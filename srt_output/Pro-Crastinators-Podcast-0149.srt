00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,560
Hello everybody and welcome to another explosive Diarrhea episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,600
We're Diarrhea coming out of my mouth right now.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:34,560
I feel like shit. I'm Tom Oliver and today I'm introducing this band of rascals with me, starting with my good boy Digibro.

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,320
Just slammed six fucking spicy octopus dumplings down the gullet and I'm fucking ready to go.

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
Oh god, that's gonna be real Diarrhea soon. Endless Jess is here.

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shines ain't always gonna be good. Everybody sing along, I'll be good.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,000
Best of luck to you my boy. Mage is here.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
How do you draw snakes? I forget.

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,040
There's like squiggly lines and then put a little like V-tongue on the end of them.

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,120
Oh no, I know a little friend. I love snakes.

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,760
Speaking of snakes, Nate is here.

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,400
Oh god, is it them snakes? Is he back with another fire track?

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Speaking of them snakes, we have the poor the poor man's substitute for them snakes.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,080
Benzane. Ray Misato, Arigato, kakakakawaii.

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,480
Wait a minute, did she say Ray and Misato as an Evangelion?

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,160
That was a substitution of my own because I don't know the actual words.

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
Well, it was good. Thanks. I thought I thought it through really carefully.

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
One minute in and I don't know what you're talking about already.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
It's like an Avril Lavigne, the Hello Kitty song. You're one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,320
This is real. I stayed away from that.

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,560
It came out about like 10 years ago or something, but yeah, she made a mainstream for me.

22
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,000
People got a little mad at her for some cultural appropriation, you know, obvious bullshit.

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:12,560
Nate and Ben, are you aware that Avril Lavigne did two songs for the ending of a one piece movie?

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,440
Yes. And one of them is a Nickelback cover.

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,480
What? Okay, I wasn't aware of that.

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,200
It's like it's like an acoustic folk Nickelback cover as the ending theme of a one piece movie

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
performed by Avril Lavigne.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,520
Everything you just said, she was she was she was married to the Nickelback guy.

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Oda did draw Avril Lavigne in one piece style because of their like buddy friendship or whatever.

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,880
That's awesome. I mean, I think she just came out with a new album.

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,000
Holy shit.

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Unless I'm mistaken. I think pretty sure I heard that on the grapevine.

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,320
My whole word.

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,520
Here it is. Oh my gosh.

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,440
Look at this shit. I gotta see this. Please.

36
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,960
Okay. Cabin, it'll be in the show notes, obviously, or whatever.

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,760
Avril's back.

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
I always knew she would be.

39
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,880
Look at Avril Lavigne drawn by Oda.

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,680
He did this because they're because he's a fan or something.

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,920
Bizarre.

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
It looks good though, right? I think so.

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,360
I mean, in as much as Oda's drawings of women can look good, it looks fine.

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,840
They, well, that's silly things to say.

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
Ooh. One, doesn't look particularly like Avril.

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,920
Two, not Oda's best face.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Maybe it wasn't literally one. It probably was.

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,720
Yeah, it's close. It's fine. Yeah, it'll do.

49
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,880
I'll take it.

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,800
Thanks Oda.

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,920
I haven't watched any of the new movies.

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,040
Oh, I'll leave it.

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,080
Oh, I'll leave it.

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,560
Destroy it.

55
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,920
So what else is going on, people?

56
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,600
Who's got things on the table?

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,920
Well, hey, you know what I had, you know what it did yesterday?

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,120
Yeah.

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
Had fucking RFCKCon2.

60
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,440
Rowdyfuckers con killers.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
Did you even know that was going on until I saw the live streams on my feed?

62
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,760
Yep.

63
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,080
Yep. The bunch of killers, bunch of Rowdy showed out in Boston.

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
We met up at Faniel Hall.

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,440
We had some IRL gang violence where they split up into teams

66
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,160
and they had to go around and shoot each other in real life.

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,800
I heard that someone won, that there was a winner.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,920
How was that decided?

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,960
Okay, okay. So I came up with this game.

70
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,000
I actually came up with it a long time ago, but this was the first time.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,240
It was called Endless War.

72
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,400
No.

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,360
Yes.

74
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,400
This was the first time we had the chance to do it.

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
Okay, so we split up into teams.

76
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
Luckily, we had four killers and four Rowdies, and so it worked out perfectly.

77
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,560
And basically, we defined a perimeter and we were like, okay,

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,720
I'm going to give the abbreviated version.

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,160
Basically, it's like, within the zone, you have your camera.

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
You have to run around and look for enemies and take pictures of them,

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,840
and then post the picture of them in a certain channel in a certain discord

82
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,600
we set up for it, and that's a shot and that kills them.

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,040
And basically, it's like a quick draw.

84
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,880
So if two people see each other, it's like, who can take a picture and post it first,

85
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
and they get the shot off first, and they win, and the other one's dead.

86
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,560
Fascinating.

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,280
And it was a shootout, and Connor, Connor the Rowdy, did win, but it was close.

88
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,760
It came down to Connor versus Shraft?

89
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,720
Or Sauce?

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,360
Not Sauce, but it was, yeah, but yes.

91
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,560
The Rowdies won by a hair, and I will kill them.

92
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
Well, that's pretty cool.

93
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,760
And it was a hoot.

94
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,720
It's a dope system.

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,000
And then we went and we live-streamed Kazi's dad's house, and that was RSCKCon,

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
and it took all day, and it was really fun.

97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,640
Are people still traveling in for these, or is this just people who are in Boston at this point?

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,240
It was about half and half.

99
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,760
It really terrifies me.

100
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,520
You are in control of a cult, and you really should be leading into it a lot more.

101
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,720
Um, there was, um, Kip was there, he's from Texas, uh, I think Texas.

102
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
Fucking Texas!

103
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Sauce Pirate was from New York.

104
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,320
How are they affording to fly in for these?

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,080
How are they affording to fly in for these?

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,720
They've been saving up their good boy points for years at this point.

107
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,200
Well, they've been mining in the mines.

108
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,720
They've built up a bunch of slime coin, you know, before they-

109
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,200
Some of them still have some left over from the great slime coin market boom.

110
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,440
Of the pre-Negapause days, you know, that went a long way.

111
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,120
Okay, so what I've been doing for the last few days

112
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,760
is I've been, like, marathoning this podcast, called Who Are These Podcasts,

113
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,280
that is a podcast that reviews other podcasts, mostly to shit on them, and-

114
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,080
Can we get on there?

115
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,640
Probably, but, uh, it's- because I've been listening to it, it's, you know,

116
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,280
put a lot of things in my head about, like, what a podcast should or shouldn't be like.

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,480
And so I'm just, like, analyzing our podcast as we're doing it, and all I can think is,

118
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,840
this is the least comprehensible fucking podcast ever.

119
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,320
Sure.

120
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,440
Like, we've gone for seven and a half minutes, and nothing we've talked about is something that

121
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,120
anyone could possibly know what the fuck we're talking about.

122
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,920
Like, like, aside from, like, Avril Lavigne-

123
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,880
The endless war fanbase would beg to differ.

124
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,320
Avril Lavigne be in a one piece-

125
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,840
Marathoning at the mouth.

126
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,800
Like, I'm thinking, if you don't know anime, you don't know what we're talking about,

127
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,360
why it's interesting that Avril is in a one piece thing, and we even, like, we say Oda,

128
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,360
we're talking about the author of one piece, but we don't say that.

129
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,480
Who wouldn't know that?

130
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,640
The most-

131
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,080
Who in this wide world?

132
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,560
And then, like-

133
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,320
Well, I mean, as you- I mean, we are- we are the premiere anime podcast on-

134
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,880
It's true.

135
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,960
The internet, so everyone should be telling you-

136
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,080
I'm not- I'm not even complaining.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,600
I'm just saying that, like, uh, it's just occurring to me.

138
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,560
We're doing everything wrong from a marketing perspective.

139
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,200
Absolutely true.

140
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,600
Tell me more, Digi.

141
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,800
I'm actually very interested, and this is a great line of inquiry,

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
and I'm interested to hear any thoughts you have on this subject,

143
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,880
because I think about this all the time.

144
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,200
Okay.

145
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,120
Um, was that it?

146
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,600
What- what-

147
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,880
Would you mean the quality of the podcast or something?

148
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,520
Yeah.

149
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,600
Yeah.

150
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,080
Oh.

151
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,040
Yeah, sure, sure.

152
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,480
Let's talk about what a- what a bizarre clusterfuck the PCP is.

153
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,360
The PCP is-

154
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,840
Sure.

155
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,120
It's- it's extremely bizarre, for sure, and definitely a huge clusterfuck, but, like,

156
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,600
at the same time, that is the only reason anyone cares, I think.

157
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,720
Like, it's- it's a podcast who- which only exists to serve the audience it already has.

158
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
It's a show about nothing.

159
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,640
Pretty much.

160
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,240
It's- it's a show about, like, just-

161
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,480
It's just us, just the people who are members,

162
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,280
smash together once a week to talk about whatever.

163
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,160
But, like, because of the fact that we- we take it for granted that the audience is,

164
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,560
you know, following- it's really funny, especially because, like, a lot of our audience

165
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,160
doesn't follow all of us, like, individually or really know anything about, like,

166
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,840
there are some people who listen to PCP and it's, like, they're just a fan of, say, Nate,

167
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,200
who listens to this and thinks of it as this podcast, Nate's On,

168
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
and then has no idea who the rest of us are.

169
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Ah, yes, the capricious Nate heads.

170
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,640
Fucking Roseboys.

171
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,840
I just have to wonder what it even- what it sounds like we're talking about to- to anyone like that,

172
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,400
you know? Like, what do- do they just listen and they're like,

173
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,640
I have no idea what's going on?

174
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,240
You know, one of our- one of our longtime fans, Oblivion Fall,

175
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,960
of great professionalism and renown, um, he, uh, he described the other day.

176
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,560
This wasn't about, like, the quality or anything.

177
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,560
He's obviously followed all of us for the- most of us, anyway, for a long time.

178
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,080
But he said that, like, the PCP was his- someone said I- like, someone submitted an entrance for the,

179
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,400
for the theme contest and they said, like, uh, you know,

180
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,000
lol, I procrastinated on this.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
Does that mean I get bonus points?

182
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,920
And then Oblivion Fall, I think, replied, said something like,

183
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,560
actually, I find the procrastinator's podcast, like,

184
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,960
the most beneficial thing for me to enhance my productivity.

185
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,720
Something about it, he finds very conducive to doing his work.

186
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,600
I don't know what that is.

187
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,880
I think on a recent episode, we addressed the- the irony of the fact that none of us are really major

188
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,920
procrastinators.

189
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,120
Like, well, you know, it's one of those things- it's one of those things that's like,

190
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
when you have a- when you have a astrological sign, like, I'm a cancer,

191
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,080
you can go searching for the ways that that actually does, you know, pin- it's the religious

192
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,560
mindset.

193
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,440
You find ways to, like, justify beliefs you already have.

194
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,040
I mean, we all do that about everything.

195
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,720
But, like, because of procrastinator, I mean, I do procrastinate on quite a bit,

196
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,400
so I'm like, yeah, that totally works.

197
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,800
I'm thinking of confirmation bias, all the ways I totally do procrastinate in a week.

198
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
But I mean, everyone procrastinates to one degree to one degree to another.

199
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,520
I think it's- it's a weird word, though, because, like, when you think about procrastination,

200
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,800
like, I put things off to the last minute, but not because I'm not doing anything.

201
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,560
It's like, I will find- if I know that there's a deadline, I would rather do it

202
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,760
right before the deadline and then cram in other shit to do before that.

203
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,880
And I don't really know why I operate that way, but, like- but I've never passed the deadline.

204
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,840
Like, I've always managed this very well.

205
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
I've never been late on these kinds of things.

206
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,080
So, it's funny, like, when I think of- when most people say that they procrastinate,

207
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,080
I think they are talking about something way worse than what I'm doing, you know?

208
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,840
Like, those alimony payments or, you know, whatever.

209
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,680
Although I have procrastinated on my taxes for a couple years, so.

210
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,200
Fair enough.

211
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,160
You know, this reminds me just of the cardinal sin that will make me hate you, listeners or fans.

212
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,240
If you do not put a space, when you're writing the name of the pro space,

213
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,520
Crastinator's podcast, I- some people actually committed this vile sin

214
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,440
in their submissions to the editor contest, and I'm just letting you know,

215
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,280
this will be a strike against you.

216
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,840
Oh, God.

217
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
My fucking peach, uh, uh, amiibo just fell and hit my router.

218
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,720
I was waiting for you to say your peach fresca.

219
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,040
I wish I had one of those.

220
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,440
But I don't.

221
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
Okay, what else is going on, people?

222
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm bored.

223
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,920
This sucks.

224
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,960
Yeah, this is terrible.

225
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,960
Well, um-

226
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,840
Wait, you're like- you keep saying that, but you have nothing.

227
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,320
What- did you not think of anything before the show?

228
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,400
I've got nothing.

229
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,800
I've got nothing.

230
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,600
You're absolutely right.

231
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,520
Hey, let me scrape the bottom of the barrel here.

232
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,960
I'm off keto for, like, a day.

233
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,080
Was this, like, a cheat day?

234
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,960
I had a milkshake at RFC K-Con.

235
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,920
Then I had a beer and a cupcake.

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
Ah, I was decadent.

237
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm surprised to hear that you're still doing keto because-

238
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,680
What's working?

239
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,040
I would assume that your kidney stone had something to do with it.

240
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
You know, everyone assumes that, and everyone says that.

241
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,320
But then I go and I look it up, and I find no data backing up that assertion.

242
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,640
I mean, where do you think you got it from, then?

243
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,200
Like-

244
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,160
From my kidney.

245
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,920
The kidney stone fairy.

246
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,960
Blessed him one day.

247
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,160
I mean, like, what generally causes kidney stones?

248
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,640
Like, have you done something that would have caused it?

249
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,600
I mean, this, okay, I've been complaining about this.

250
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,120
Everyone has their own, like, oh, obvi-

251
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,280
Of course you got a kidney stone, obviously, because you do X,

252
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,880
but, like, everyone's X is different.

253
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,840
And, like-

254
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,720
Sure.

255
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,400
So, like, what am I supposed to make of it?

256
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,080
Like, some people think it's obviously because-

257
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,960
Do everything different, man.

258
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,120
Some people think it's because it's obviously because of keto.

259
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,280
Some people think it's obviously because I drink sodas,

260
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,600
or because obviously because artificial sweeteners, or-

261
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,240
It's my bet.

262
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,320
Are those known to do that, though?

263
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,640
I don't know.

264
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,960
It's a perfect storm of all those Ben-Saint activities.

265
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,840
Well, I don't know.

266
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,760
I mean, I kind of thought so.

267
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,080
I don't know.

268
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,720
I did some cursory googling the other day, and I didn't-

269
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
I came away with the feeling that, like,

270
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
I was less sure about any of these things, like,

271
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,280
oh, this definitely caused it.

272
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,880
I mean, you can just get them.

273
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,360
Some people just get them, you know?

274
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,400
Some people just get cancer, even if they don't smoke or whatever.

275
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,360
Hey, total left turn, but I actually do have something I want to talk about.

276
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
I want to quickly just mention something about keto.

277
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,320
I've been listening to a lot of, like, stupid reddit readings about, like,

278
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,840
stupid threads or whatever, and, like, the anti-MLM thread.

279
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,640
And I've noticed a sort of a surge in MLM.

280
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,480
MLM is in multi-level marketing?

281
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,040
Yeah.

282
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
As in the PC pyramid scheme.

283
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,080
Indeed.

284
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,320
No, that's nothing like the pyramid scheme,

285
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,840
even though it's called the pyramid scheme.

286
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,360
It's called the pyramid scheme ironically.

287
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,920
Give us money now.

288
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
It'll be great for marketing purposes.

289
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,200
True fans know it's named ironically,

290
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,880
and donate all their money to it.

291
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,000
Anyway, and they are very keen on selling you keto products now,

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,240
so that's making me suspicious of keto.

293
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,280
Because they're like, oh, keto coffee.

294
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,080
You lose weight.

295
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,200
What a stupid way to reason through life.

296
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Ben, have you ever been to, have you been to a vitamin shop recently

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
or passed by one in your travels?

298
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,080
No.

299
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,040
God, no.

300
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
If you have, you would notice that every single one of them

301
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
have big signs on the front now that say,

302
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
keto headquarters, get all your keto shit here.

303
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,760
Probably due to the whole, you know, there's like, there's companies,

304
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,880
and I mean, there's one company called Bulletproof,

305
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,800
but it's not the only one.

306
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,840
There's a bunch.

307
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,280
And they just sell shit.

308
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,320
But like, they just sell you food that's keto.

309
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,360
But like, here's, you can just go to the fucking supermarket

310
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,640
and buy like, butter and like, meat and like, cheese.

311
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,760
People are dumb.

312
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,480
And like, yeah.

313
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
You don't, like, they'll sell you.

314
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,600
It's so much easier, Ben, to just go to the,

315
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
go to your vitamin shop and buy the F-bomb.

316
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,200
They'll sell you.

317
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,720
It's literally called the F-bomb.

318
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,880
It's this bomb-shaped supplement.

319
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
It's just, and it's all just fat.

320
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,840
So they call it the fatbomb.

321
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,720
I think it's, yeah, bomb.

322
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,840
They'll sell you, they'll sell you a branded version.

323
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,360
They'll sell you a powdered version

324
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,520
in a smaller container for more money.

325
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,040
They'll put, they'll put things on the label.

326
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,200
They'll talk about the branch chain amino acids,

327
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,720
that whatever the fuck it is,

328
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,560
when it's just, it's just coconut oil or whatever.

329
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,240
I think people just convinced themselves

330
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,040
that they have to do something special for it to work.

331
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
That like, it couldn't possibly be

332
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,840
that the stuff is just at the grocery store they always go to.

333
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,000
It can't be as easy as just eating bacon

334
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,880
and losing weight.

335
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,600
It's impossible.

336
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:51,920
Yeah.

337
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
And yet, it's entirely possible.

338
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,760
There's a great video by the needle drop

339
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,360
about being vegan cheap because like,

340
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,200
lots of people say like,

341
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,160
I can't go vegan because it's expensive to buy healthy food.

342
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
And it's like, no, it's not.

343
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,560
Vegetables and fruit are like the cheapest thing

344
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,240
you can get at the fucking grocery store.

345
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,440
Like, you can buy bananas and fucking apples

346
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
for basically nothing.

347
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,640
Like 25 cents a piece or something.

348
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:18,960
Right.

349
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,760
They're carrots.

350
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh man, I've been buying so many bananas recently.

351
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,080
Yeah.

352
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
All of those are extremely cheap.

353
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,200
So it's like, just because you're going vegan

354
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,400
doesn't mean you have to go buy fucking veggie burgers

355
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,120
or some shit.

356
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
The problem with that is that like,

357
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,360
yeah, fruits and vegetables are cheap,

358
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,120
but that's not a meal.

359
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
It's just a fruit and a vegetable.

360
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,440
Well, sure.

361
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
Like, it doesn't feel like I'm eating something

362
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,880
unless I've cooked a plate with a bread and a meat set.

363
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,240
That's the thing is that like,

364
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,840
people are making the argument of like,

365
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,600
I can't go vegan because it's expensive.

366
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,640
But it's like, well, the point of veganism,

367
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,240
if you're doing it, is that you're trying

368
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,560
to make some kind of moral stance.

369
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,840
So it's like, you're basically saying,

370
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,640
I'm putting my comfort above this moral stance.

371
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,840
And it's like, well, at that point,

372
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,520
you've defeated the purpose of it.

373
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,240
You know, like, just eat what you want to eat.

374
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,400
Like, if you're not going to, if you don't care,

375
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,960
if you don't feel strongly enough about it to commit to this lifestyle,

376
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,520
you know.

377
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,120
I don't know if Fantano's point was this or not,

378
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,480
but I, with some people talking about it,

379
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,120
people are just dumb and super ignorant,

380
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,040
and they just don't know these things.

381
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,200
Which I think was the point of this video,

382
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,640
to just educate people.

383
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,000
People, they just think that veganism is expensive,

384
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,600
and they don't actually know like,

385
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,760
what goes into being vegan or otherwise.

386
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,600
I don't know that much about veganism,

387
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
but I would have meant like, you know,

388
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,040
like getting your, getting the protein,

389
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,720
getting the proteins hard, and like,

390
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,200
It takes some work.

391
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,480
You probably got to get it from like,

392
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,840
Just eat nuts, like bees.

393
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,480
Something.

394
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,280
Yeah.

395
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah.

396
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,440
Isn't there something like, like,

397
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,200
like beans are like an incomplete protein?

398
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,320
Like if you're, you know, like,

399
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,920
if you're getting like vegetable protein,

400
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,280
you have to eat like the right, like,

401
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,960
different kinds combined.

402
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
The last class I ever took to get my

403
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,040
computer science degree was a biology course,

404
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,280
and I learned actually some fascinating facts in there,

405
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,920
which are, when you consume anything that like,

406
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,240
has protein in it, like beans or meat,

407
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
or anything like that,

408
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,560
they, the proteins consist of a certain select set

409
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,360
of the amino acids that human beings use

410
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,120
to assemble the like, you know,

411
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
muscle and protein stuff in our own bodies.

412
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,440
Yeah.

413
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,640
And so, like, if any beans.

414
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
But animal protein is complete protein,

415
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,440
because it's basically the same shit.

416
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,520
I would think that it's more complete, yes.

417
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Oh, I know, is I don't believe anything

418
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
Anthony Fantano says, because I don't,

419
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,400
Fair it out.

420
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,240
I don't, I can't trust a man who reviews music

421
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,040
for a living and doesn't give every Red Hot Chili Peppers

422
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,000
album a 10 out of 10.

423
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,040
Even the newest one?

424
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,680
That would be the last one.

425
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,480
Yeah, sure, why not?

426
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,120
Oh, all right.

427
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,520
That's all I felt when I listened to it.

428
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,040
I was like, yeah, okay, sure, why not?

429
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,600
It's 10 out of 10.

430
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,520
Fair enough.

431
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,720
All right, what do you think about this, people?

432
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,320
Let me drop this bomb on you.

433
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,800
I want to talk about the Mathematosis

434
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,280
notification of people's opinions.

435
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,800
And the large extent of that.

436
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,160
Yeah, that's what it is.

437
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
So, Mathematosis, so whatever.

438
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
I think Breath of the Wild came out,

439
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,080
I think in 2016, maybe 2017.

440
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
So it's been like two or three years or whatever.

441
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
Yeah, God, it's that long?

442
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
It's been a while, yeah.

443
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,480
It was on the Wii U, so, you know.

444
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,600
What the fuck?

445
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,440
The Switch hasn't been out that long, has it?

446
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,520
No, well, I don't know, probably two or three years by this point.

447
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
It came out in March, I think, over two years ago.

448
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,240
Oh my God.

449
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,680
So, Mathematosis, years later, comes out with his review.

450
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,560
And this happens with other people.

451
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,320
I'm just using him as the example here.

452
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,640
And basically, to my mind, he was shockingly positive.

453
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,400
And I was not expecting this and was not prepared for it.

454
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,280
And coincidentally, I've already been replaying Breath of the Wild

455
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
by just, I had no idea he was making this video.

456
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,800
I was already like halfway through.

457
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,760
And I was basically playing the exact way

458
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,880
I had played the first time and still having a lot of fun.

459
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,040
But all my same complaints were still there.

460
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,000
And here's my point, here's my point.

461
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,920
I'm seeing a lot of threads on like V and stuff,

462
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,240
where people saying like, you know, they'll point to like one review

463
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Mathematosis did of like God of War.

464
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,640
And they'll be like, haha, yeah, Matt's on my side.

465
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,240
God of War was shit.

466
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,640
And it wasn't great or something like that.

467
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,680
And then like the Breath of the Wild one comes out

468
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,560
and everyone like is ignoring it because it's not in line

469
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,640
with the general consensus or whatever.

470
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
And I'm sure other people have been swayed by it.

471
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,720
I don't know.

472
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,600
And in the video itself, he talks a lot about like,

473
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,120
basically what I gleaned was that he was focused on a lot of stuff

474
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
that a lot of people enjoyed about the game

475
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,720
that I did not get a lot out of.

476
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,680
Like all the crazy mechanical stuff you can do

477
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,840
with the systems that are in place.

478
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,720
And he seems to downplay a lot of things I didn't care for

479
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,120
and upplay the ones that he liked more.

480
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,240
So I don't know.

481
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,920
That's what a reviewer should do.

482
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,680
Well, I mean, I don't know.

483
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,120
Like he's just stating his opinion.

484
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,280
It may or may not completely overlap with mine.

485
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,040
You know, in this case, obviously not.

486
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,280
Okay.

487
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,360
But so what's my point is my point is

488
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Matthew Matosa seems to be a real.

489
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,680
What's the word?

490
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,920
Like a trendsetter or like a thought leader?

491
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,560
A thought leader.

492
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,600
That's the word.

493
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
And I don't know.

494
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
I guess I'm just curious because he's not even like the biggest voice,

495
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
but there's something about him that makes people

496
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,320
just really take him seriously.

497
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,960
And I guess this ties into our old discussion about like the

498
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,120
what's Joseph Gordon Anderson, whatever his name is.

499
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,480
Well, it's professionalism.

500
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,360
Matthew Matosa doesn't have any like huge embarrassments

501
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,720
or fuck ups or, you know, retardation to his name.

502
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,360
Does Anderson?

503
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,880
Nothing to piss anyone.

504
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,560
Yeah, Anderson released a video that people interpreted as like

505
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,400
firing back at his commenters.

506
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,800
And I guess he's like shitty on streams and he's bad at games.

507
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,040
So, you know, people can't have that.

508
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,760
So, so there's a there's a noticeable vocal section

509
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,000
of his comments section is now that seems to hate him.

510
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,640
Yeah.

511
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,040
Yeah.

512
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,720
But I mean, you know, it just happens.

513
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
Like there's nothing you can really do about it.

514
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,880
But Matthew Matosa has been like shockingly professional

515
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,360
his whole career.

516
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,160
He I mean disappears completely and then comes out with a video

517
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,720
and he's gone.

518
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,640
I mean, I want to back up here for a second

519
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,160
because what Nate is describing applies to every reviewer.

520
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,760
Like everyone gets a parody.

521
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,080
This isn't a Matthew Matosa specific thing.

522
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,320
Right.

523
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,800
This is just what a whole leader is.

524
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
He's a holy cow, though.

525
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,240
He's he's untouched.

526
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,720
I mean, this is something that I get like a lot of people who hate me.

527
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,680
They hate me because other people parrot my videos at them,

528
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,480
that like when I make a video, there's a subset of people who

529
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,280
will say like this confirms that the show was bad, you know,

530
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,680
and like they won't then go on and just be like, yeah, well,

531
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,840
not like now I believe I'm objectively right because Digi Bro said

532
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,200
the thing I was thinking, even though I personally will literally

533
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,280
say like, hey, this is just my opinion.

534
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,120
Everybody is no, you know, I tend to reevaluate my opinions

535
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,160
when Digi agrees with me.

536
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,960
I've really noticed that I must whenever anyone says anything,

537
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,880
I immediately think of why they're wrong.

538
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,960
Like any of you or any of my family.

539
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,520
Yeah.

540
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,640
Oh, yeah, we feel it.

541
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,680
Oh, we feel it.

542
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,400
Why do I do that?

543
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,880
I don't know.

544
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,160
I don't know.

545
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,600
Strange man.

546
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,920
I don't feel like to play devil's advocate.

547
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,880
So every time we refer to you as best guy ever,

548
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
you should reevaluate that position, guys.

549
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,960
You should think carefully before you use such words,

550
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,480
which, you know, definitive.

551
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,000
On the subject of how everybody is stupid

552
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,520
and their opinions are bullshit, you

553
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,480
can't say anything without being responded to by fucking

554
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
simpletons.

555
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
In the last podcast, we brought up the Resident Evil 2 remake

556
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,640
recently.

557
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,800
And I was positive about it because you were at it.

558
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,920
I played it yesterday, by the way.

559
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,400
It was pretty fun.

560
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,600
It's really good.

561
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Yeah, it's good.

562
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
So I said it was good in the last podcast.

563
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,480
And I see now a comment from someone who's like mad at me

564
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,440
for saying that it's good.

565
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,320
He's like, oh, it's just a shameless cash grab

566
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,320
for people who are nostalgic, like Jess.

567
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
It was like, if I wanted to be nostalgic,

568
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,360
I would play the original.

569
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,160
I wouldn't play the remake.

570
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,800
That makes no sense.

571
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,520
And then he's like, you know, outside from the visuals

572
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
and the overall quality, the game is boring.

573
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,920
So aside from waiting, he goes, yeah.

574
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,160
You're talking about the overall quality?

575
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,200
Yeah, this is a real comment.

576
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,480
Oh my god.

577
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,120
That's good.

578
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,760
That's real good.

579
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,000
He literally goes like, he literally goes,

580
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,360
the gameplay is tight.

581
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
And to the point, I appreciate that.

582
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,840
However, outside the visuals and overall quality,

583
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,280
the game is just boring.

584
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,320
He must mean something like the quality of just like the way

585
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
that I think what he's trying to say,

586
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,800
I think what he's trying to say is that the game is like

587
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,200
technically well made, but not interesting.

588
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,920
It lacks soul.

589
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,680
He's saying that it brings nothing new to the table,

590
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,320
that like it's just like the quintessential Resident Evil,

591
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,920
but like we just had Resident Evil 7,

592
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,320
which did bring a lot new to the table.

593
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
I mean, I was going to play the original Resident Evil.

594
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,840
And then I'm like, you know what?

595
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,600
Third person shooting just looks more fun.

596
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,480
I think I'll do that instead.

597
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,640
Like I'm not, I'm not trying to pick on this commentary.

598
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,560
I'm just, yeah, I happen to see him because like,

599
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,000
you know, I said something good about the game.

600
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,160
So of course I get blowback from someone who doesn't think

601
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,600
it's all that good, but I actually have a Resident Evil 2 video

602
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,400
coming out that is going to skew negative.

603
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,800
And I know when that comes out, I'm going to get the same

604
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,600
blowback from the other morons who think that like,

605
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,040
how dare you say something negative about it?

606
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,760
It's actually good.

607
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,800
That's true.

608
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,840
There's no winning.

609
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,560
On all sides of this, it's hard for me to understand

610
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,680
because like I just enjoy hearing people say their opinion

611
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,800
and justify it.

612
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,320
And it doesn't, it doesn't matter if I agree with,

613
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,040
like like Matthew Matosis' video on Breath of the Wild,

614
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,200
I fucking loved that video.

615
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,480
And I felt like he is extremely justified in feeling

616
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,680
the way he does about the game.

617
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,880
The game doesn't look like it appeals to me in any way.

618
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,400
Like, I don't know why lately my videos on games have been

619
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
skewing negative, like the Kingdom Hearts video.

620
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,960
It's like, I don't know, I think it's just like,

621
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
I feel like that's what YouTube deserves at this point

622
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,160
is just more of the negativity they all crave.

623
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,800
And well, I mean, your opinions seem reasonable.

624
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,440
So, you know, I'm not too surprised based on the content.

625
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,520
I don't ever feel like I'm being like too negative.

626
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
I always feel like I'm being fair, but people are like,

627
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,320
oh, this guy's bitter.

628
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520
I'm not bitter about anything.

629
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,200
It's just, this is the kind of content you want

630
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,640
and this is the kind of content you deserve,

631
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,560
even if you don't want to admit that you want it.

632
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,040
Everyone knows like big takedown videos have always been

633
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,440
the most popular on YouTube.

634
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
And so, but yours, yours aren't big enough takedowns.

635
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,680
There's too much.

636
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,760
My videos are like five minutes long most of the time.

637
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,440
And usually just one point,

638
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
because I don't want to make a big video with 50 points

639
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
and take the rest of my life to make it.

640
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,800
You know, it's better to just, if you just want to say

641
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,440
one thing about a game, just say that one thing.

642
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,840
You don't have to make a whole fucking review analysis

643
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,120
to put that point in.

644
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,400
We always talk about this warmly,

645
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,880
but your video on The Hundred Knight or whatever,

646
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,040
The Witch and The Hundred Knight, that was,

647
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,280
that's like my favorite video you've made in several years,

648
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,960
I think, you know, not to say that the others are bad.

649
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,400
It's just that one stands out in my mind a lot.

650
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,440
It's so weird to me to see people who reject hearing

651
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,360
the opposite opinion, because I want to know why

652
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,880
people feel the opposite from me.

653
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,560
Like, the Gaming Brit just put out a glowing bike

654
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,280
comparison to anyone else, review of Kingdom Hearts 3.

655
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,800
Like, he loved it.

656
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,880
I skipped that one, so it won't influence me

657
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,400
while I'm still making mine.

658
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,720
Gaming Brit is one of the best channels on YouTube

659
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,440
that I've ever seen.

660
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,840
Yeah?

661
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,920
Gaming Brit's great.

662
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
He's so consistent.

663
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
He's a great channel,

664
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,000
and like, when I watch that video, I'm sitting there

665
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,400
and I'm like, this guy, he doesn't even bring up

666
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,200
any of the things that everyone else talked about

667
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,720
that they hated about Kingdom Hearts 3.

668
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,520
Like, he maybe like, is kind of like,

669
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
the cutscenes are kind of stupid sometimes,

670
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,840
but like, he just seemed to be into the game.

671
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,080
And like, that's great.

672
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,560
That should exist, even if I feel the opposite,

673
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,520
because obviously a lot of people feel that way.

674
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,160
So like, don't you want everyone's feelings

675
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,200
to be represented?

676
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,280
Like, that's the ideal.

677
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,040
You shouldn't be coming to one video

678
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,480
to be the ultimate video.

679
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,600
I want there to be every single possible take

680
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,320
represented, so I know why everyone feels differently

681
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,800
from each other.

682
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,280
Every opinion is like a tribe,

683
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,880
and like, you have one opinion.

684
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
You're in the tribe of people with your opinion,

685
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
and you want your tribe to dominate.

686
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
Yeah, that's very true.

687
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,920
I don't want my tribe to dominate.

688
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,280
I want to coexist.

689
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,240
I want diversity.

690
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,800
I want to quickly check.

691
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,880
We need more diversity in video games.

692
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,440
Disagree.

693
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,520
I need Ben to shut up.

694
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Whoa.

695
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,480
Go on, go on.

696
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
Because I want to be like, hold on, hold on, hold on.

697
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,760
I've been wanting to interject.

698
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,880
We've got to talk about this.

699
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,240
No, we've got to get into what just went on here.

700
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,960
All right.

701
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,720
Yes, because I said, I want to interject,

702
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,000
and you started talking over me.

703
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,440
That's why I wanted you to shut up.

704
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,000
There's nothing more to it.

705
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,200
Indeed, agreed.

706
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,240
Talk about savage takedown.

707
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,360
Ben just got slapped down.

708
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,960
You know what, finally.

709
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,280
His reign of terror has been put to an end at last.

710
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,520
I just wanted to interject a bit earlier than I did speak up.

711
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
Like, I feel it, didn't you?

712
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,680
Because before the pony fandom, I never really felt like,

713
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,240
I never experienced people getting so upset

714
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,400
about other people expressing their opinions

715
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,520
that are different.

716
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,120
Because for me, personally, I love listening to opinions

717
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,160
about the things that I like or I hate,

718
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,360
even if they're different from mine.

719
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,040
Because for me, it's just extra content

720
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,480
talking about the thing that I like

721
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,760
or hate, I guess.

722
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,080
For instance, I really like Dragon Age,

723
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,360
and you bet you're ready.

724
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,520
I'm going to listen to every single review

725
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
about Dragon Age, be it good or bad,

726
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,960
because I want to know what they think.

727
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,600
Do they like it?

728
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,640
What do they dislike it?

729
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,360
And it gives me, like, I didn't really

730
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,040
think about it that way.

731
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,560
I guess that's kind of annoying.

732
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,920
Or like, oh, yeah, that's right.

733
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,280
Oh, I completely missed that thing.

734
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,040
Yes, I love this about the game.

735
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,760
You know?

736
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,120
It's just fun.

737
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,400
I don't understand.

738
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,560
The pony community, so the pony community

739
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,040
was really fucking partisan.

740
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,320
OK, that one, for sure, was very focused on being positive.

741
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,720
I don't know.

742
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,080
No, I'm saying partisan.

743
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
It was very, like, descent was very tribal,

744
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,160
and descent was very looked down on.

745
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,800
It was this weird, like, sort of one-of-a-kind group.

746
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,640
Like, it grew out of 4chan.

747
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,920
So there was always that, like, 4chan edgelord part of it.

748
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,880
But then it was also, like, this lovey-fluffy tumbler part

749
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,200
of it, too.

750
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,360
Because it was like, we're all outcasts.

751
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,480
We're all outcast together.

752
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,320
We all got to look after each other.

753
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,080
By not allowing descent.

754
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,600
There was, like, two pony fandoms.

755
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,080
And then there was a third that was just normal people who

756
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,680
no one fucking remembers.

757
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,240
I never met any of those.

758
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,840
I can't say I'm familiar.

759
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,040
There was only one, and it's my secret identity, me.

760
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,960
My secret identity, comma, me.

761
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,520
Hey, on the subject of, I don't know,

762
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,200
like, appreciating other people's opinions,

763
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
OK, I don't know about you guys.

764
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,360
But within my soul, I feel the growth of a villain.

765
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,480
I feel a villain emerging slowly over time.

766
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,520
This wasn't able, yeah.

767
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
Wait, when I was listening.

768
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,240
Wait, you've always been a villain.

769
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,520
What are you talking about?

770
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Well, I aspire to be a little finger.

771
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,960
But I don't think I have the courage.

772
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,720
But, like, when I'm watching the Matthew Matosis video,

773
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,200
it was interesting.

774
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,400
Because we talked about this a bit.

775
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,480
And as I'm watching it, there was, like, I felt myself,

776
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,240
he used a lot of flowery language, right?

777
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,480
He used a lot of grandiose verbiage stuff.

778
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,360
I didn't get that.

779
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
I don't, you said that in the chat.

780
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,960
And I don't know what verbiage you're talking about.

781
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,720
Are you talking about Matthew Matosis?

782
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,200
Yes.

783
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,560
OK, OK, I want to say something.

784
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Matthew Matosis' Breath of the Wild video

785
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,320
had multiple instances of him misusing words

786
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,760
that he really should know.

787
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,720
Oh, no.

788
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,520
Like what?

789
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,160
Oh, god.

790
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,080
Potato, potato, potato, potato, potato.

791
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,360
No, no, man.

792
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,080
OK, I'm sorry.

793
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,880
I can't think of any.

794
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,600
But, like, it must have been, like, six or seven times

795
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,400
for the whole video.

796
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,520
He, like, used the word, like, he used, like,

797
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,840
he would use, like, a word, like,

798
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
irregardless instead of irrespective or regard.

799
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,760
Like, that kind of thing.

800
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,960
And I was like, he doesn't, this is worse than usual.

801
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,080
You know.

802
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,280
He's getting dumber, guys.

803
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,000
He's getting dumber.

804
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
It was, it was, it was more free.

805
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,600
He doesn't usually do that.

806
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,480
But he did many times.

807
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,120
Maybe.

808
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,440
I wish I had a specific example on the tip of my tongue.

809
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,920
I noticed.

810
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,840
Matthew Matosis is so, yeah, go on.

811
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,240
I'm just saying, I never, I did neither caught that,

812
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,120
nor did I think there was any, like, weird words in there.

813
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,760
Like, I don't remember hearing anything that was out of place.

814
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,600
But, well, this is, here's the thing, though.

815
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,120
You liked the video.

816
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,160
I liked it.

817
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,440
There were things that I enjoyed watching.

818
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,040
In fact, I did enjoy watching it.

819
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,080
But, like, I had a kind of fundamental disagreement

820
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,560
of his point.

821
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,520
And here's the thing.

822
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,320
I think that because I just sort of disagreed

823
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,480
with the tact he was taking, because, like,

824
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,440
I made a video comparing two totally different games,

825
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,480
like, whatever, Hollow Knight versus Breath of the Wild.

826
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,680
And, like, they're very different.

827
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,560
But I like the style of Hollow Knight stuff more.

828
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,360
And, like, that kind of was, is what informed that entire,

829
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,800
which one I thought was better.

830
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,400
And, like, that still remains the case to this day.

831
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,000
And so, as I'm replaying the game now,

832
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,680
I still feel like, wow, this world, you know,

833
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,240
it's cool and all.

834
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,200
The film's pretty empty.

835
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,320
Whatever.

836
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,160
Matthew, he loved the freedom and stuff.

837
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,800
It's like, because we disagreed on a fundamental,

838
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,720
like, precept of his analysis, I felt myself

839
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,280
giving less charity to, like, his, like, art.

840
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,600
Like, whenever he makes, like, an artistic flair

841
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,080
in a sentence, I'm like, that's unnecessary.

842
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,480
Let's just catch the facts here.

843
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,400
I didn't notice any artistic flair in his sentences, though.

844
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,600
Any sentence that contains more than the basic number

845
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,520
of adjectives, verbs, and nouns required

846
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,720
to get the message across is a waste of my time.

847
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,600
I don't even know if I hear the individual points

848
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
or words that he's saying or making,

849
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,120
because, like, when I hear those videos all,

850
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,160
it's like a heroin trip.

851
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,640
I just feel like, yeah, talking about games.

852
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,160
I just fucking come over how he writes, like,

853
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,000
and the way that he, because the thing about Matthew Atosius

854
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
that I like about him above other critics

855
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,960
is that I feel like he really looks at everything

856
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,920
that the game could have been, like,

857
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,080
as opposed to just looking at what's there

858
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,040
and then saying, here's whether that was good or bad.

859
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,480
He looks at it and says, like, here's what could have been done

860
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,840
and whether that would have made it better or worse

861
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,040
or, like, why these choices were made, you know,

862
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,440
why these things all work together and stuff.

863
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,840
It's like he's taking a lens that goes beyond the game

864
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,520
into, like, just the whole possibility space

865
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
of what a game could even be.

866
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,040
And not enough critics are doing that.

867
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,280
I just love that he, I just love that he just never seems

868
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,440
even remotely combative about anything.

869
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,720
Like, he never seems to bring up what anyone else is saying.

870
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,680
He doesn't, like, his videos exist in a nice little warm bubble.

871
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,280
And I don't think he reads anyone else's shit.

872
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,360
Good. That's the best thing you could probably do.

873
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
That is wise, I'd say.

874
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,520
Yeah, he just, he feels like he just, he takes his fucking time.

875
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,080
He analyzes every single facet of the game.

876
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,640
And as you said, yeah, he really thinks about, like,

877
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,680
the potential of it.

878
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,800
Like, I don't know, when I played a game like Metal Gear Solid 5,

879
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,520
I kind of loved that game and come back to it

880
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,040
because I just don't care about the story

881
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,120
and I've just gotten over that, that it's total shit.

882
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,360
And, like, that game could have been, like, amazing

883
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,640
if the story was good, but it doesn't even bother me.

884
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,280
So I get why someone would literally give it a 0 out of 10

885
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,200
if they're, like, a huge Metal Gear fan.

886
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,280
But for somebody like me, it was, like, a 9 out of 10

887
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,680
just because I enjoyed playing the mission so much.

888
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,640
Well, that's the thing.

889
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,040
And that's what it looks like with Breath of the Wild,

890
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,120
where when that game came out,

891
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,040
all the people I saw praising it

892
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,680
were all people who like to push mechanics to the extreme.

893
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,160
Like, Dunkey is somebody who will find every possible thing

894
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
that you can do in that game

895
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,240
because he likes to experiment with a game.

896
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,320
I like to have a guided experience.

897
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,480
And, like, with Breath of the Wild in particular,

898
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,680
I'm afraid to play that game

899
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,520
because when I play Zelda, I like to try to find everything.

900
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,120
Like, the fun for me is in these worlds are densely crafted

901
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,920
in that, you know, every time I get a new item,

902
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,720
like, there's an immediate application for it in this place

903
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,960
to get this thing, to check something off the list

904
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,720
and be done, you know?

905
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,360
The idea of an endless possibility space

906
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,880
just doesn't appeal to me at all.

907
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,200
And so I wouldn't want to play it, you know?

908
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Speaking of guided experiences and Zelda, conspiracy theory,

909
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,880
who else thinks that Egoraptor was paid off

910
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
to plug the bayou, the blue bayou restaurant

911
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,560
in his fucking Zelda Ocarina of Time video?

912
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,000
That's such a weird joke.

913
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,760
It's such a weird moment in that video

914
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,440
when he takes a little tangent to talk about

915
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,680
how much he likes the blue bayou restaurant.

916
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,080
And it sounds like a joke, but it's not funny at all.

917
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,240
It's only funny because he says it as though it's a joke.

918
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,960
But it's not, it's just him endorsing a restaurant.

919
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,840
And I hate it.

920
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,400
That could be a joke.

921
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,600
Don't remember that at all.

922
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,200
You've probably watched that video a lot more time ago.

923
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,800
He's obsessed about this.

924
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,000
He is.

925
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,520
Every day I think about the fucking,

926
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,360
how much I hate the blue bayou restaurant.

927
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,120
He's just like, it's when he's comparing the link

928
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,120
to the past to a theme park.

929
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,640
He's like, oh, welcome to Treyarch.

930
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,520
Try our fucking Trice Force shaped ice cream pops.

931
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,600
Hey, I love Disney World.

932
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,440
I go like six times a year.

933
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
I love the blue bayou restaurant.

934
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,360
They got great food.

935
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,120
Oh, that's a little pricey.

936
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,600
But you know what?

937
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,480
It's worth it.

938
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,120
Why?

939
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,320
That's a good joke.

940
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,080
Why is that a good joke?

941
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,040
What's funny about that?

942
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,640
It's a little pricey, but you know what?

943
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,080
It's worth it the way he says it.

944
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,120
It's fucking hilarious.

945
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,840
That's what I'm saying.

946
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,800
It's not a joke.

947
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,480
It's just he says it as though it's a joke,

948
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,920
which kind of makes it funny.

949
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,240
But it's such it's a joke.

950
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,320
The joke is that he says it in a funny way.

951
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,280
That's not a joke.

952
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,440
It's just a funny voice.

953
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,360
That's a little bit pricey.

954
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,600
That's a little pricey.

955
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,480
But you know what it's worth it?

956
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,880
I'll bet it's not fucking worth it.

957
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,520
Fuck that guy.

958
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,720
It's fucking human core.

959
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,480
Eagle Raptor is so fucking human core.

960
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,120
He enjoys food at restaurants.

961
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,080
That's disgusting.

962
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,400
That's gay.

963
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,360
The theme parks, human core.

964
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,320
I denounce them.

965
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,320
That's my two cents about that.

966
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,280
What were we talking about?

967
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,400
I don't know.

968
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
A mom and pop restaurant is human core.

969
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,120
A theme park is like a weird like a hamster wheel

970
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,680
created for us to run in by like our overlords.

971
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,600
I think I agreed.

972
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,120
But I still think that's human core.

973
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,440
It's like it's like manufactured human core.

974
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,520
What's human core?

975
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,320
Mage, why don't you get in your time machine

976
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,480
and go back to fucking August last year.

977
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,880
Go back to September 11th, 2001.

978
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
And I'll show you what human core looks like.

979
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,960
Excuse me for not caring about shit.

980
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,600
Oh fuck.

981
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,200
She says 9-11 doesn't matter.

982
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,480
That's the European stance.

983
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,240
That's fucked up.

984
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,200
That's fucked up.

985
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,440
You know human core.

986
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,480
Like it's for idiots.

987
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,680
Oh no.

988
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,360
You're gonna put your foot down over there Ben.

989
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,720
Hell yeah Tom.

990
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,440
High hoof.

991
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,400
High hoof me bro.

992
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,880
High hoof me in the gross disgusting audio links.

993
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,120
No.

994
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,280
Show notes.

995
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,640
Put that in the show notes everybody.

996
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,560
It's happening.

997
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,160
It's happening in real time right now.

998
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,120
So what else is going on people?

999
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,960
Well, I'm dying.

1000
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah.

1001
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,760
Let's talk about my cool hangover

1002
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,480
that I am currently suffering right now.

1003
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,800
Okay.

1004
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,440
So yeah, I feel bad.

1005
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,480
I was just coming in.

1006
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,280
Just I was coming in the door as I saw

1007
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,760
that this podcast was starting and I'm like,

1008
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,560
I really shouldn't because I want to be dead.

1009
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,600
But I also would like money.

1010
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,880
So I came on, which is really my mindset every single week.

1011
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,080
But this time it was more so

1012
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,880
because I actually got sick.

1013
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,240
Yeah, what if you live, you need money for that.

1014
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,200
What series of events led you to this night of debauchery

1015
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,760
that I'm sure follow this morning of agony?

1016
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,440
You mean preceded.

1017
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,800
That's right.

1018
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,360
That's right.

1019
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,000
Right, okay.

1020
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,440
I want you too much Matthew Matosis.

1021
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,400
He's a lot of words.

1022
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,840
Well, I went out partying last night with Juan,

1023
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,200
who I talked about last week.

1024
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,760
Indeed.

1025
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,880
The Angels Forever thing.

1026
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,960
And by the way, thank you everybody.

1027
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,120
There was like a thousand dollar bump

1028
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,400
and it's only been a couple of days.

1029
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:40,800
That's great.

1030
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,400
So that's really cool.

1031
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,120
And holy shit.

1032
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,720
And fucking Juan was really happy

1033
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,120
and he loved me and people liked me.

1034
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,400
So it worked.

1035
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,600
People liked me now.

1036
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,640
People think that I'm good.

1037
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,440
That makes me a...

1038
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,480
I fooled them.

1039
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,040
It's nice.

1040
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,720
You know, we have this weird little clusterfuck of a podcast

1041
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,920
about nothing.

1042
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,400
It's nice that something good happened

1043
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,760
because of it for once.

1044
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,000
Yeah.

1045
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,840
Yeah.

1046
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,600
I got to finish chewing my hangover crackle.

1047
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,040
We are the reason the human humanity is dying.

1048
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,720
We're the reason people are dying.

1049
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,760
But not today.

1050
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,040
Except Ivan.

1051
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,480
Yeah, except Ivan.

1052
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,840
The one person who won't die

1053
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,880
because of this podcast.

1054
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,920
There'll be the last man left.

1055
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,640
I hope we won't be spared.

1056
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,520
The last man standing.

1057
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,480
So I went out partying with Juan

1058
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,840
and also my friend Dylan

1059
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,720
because it was his birthday.

1060
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,600
So we're all...

1061
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,840
We got to fucking bar worth of this cool bar.

1062
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,320
We're like...

1063
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,400
We didn't have chairs.

1064
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,680
I mean, there was a table.

1065
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,440
But then there was also a stand-up thing.

1066
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,560
I was at the standing up part.

1067
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,440
So I felt cool because I'm like,

1068
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,640
yeah, I'm standing up at the food eating my pizza thing.

1069
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,520
So that was cool.

1070
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,720
And like...

1071
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,520
So then, you know, there were drinks and stuff.

1072
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,600
So like, I don't drink

1073
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,440
or I don't like drinking ever.

1074
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,320
It's bad.

1075
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,880
I hate it.

1076
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,400
I don't like being drunk.

1077
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,640
I don't like after being drunk.

1078
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,240
Feel the same way more or less.

1079
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,680
Even though I drink sometimes.

1080
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,160
Yeah.

1081
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,480
But I also am really desperate for approval.

1082
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
So I can't turn down a drink ever.

1083
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,840
I can't turn down anything.

1084
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,200
If someone says we're drinking,

1085
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,560
I'm like, well, I'm drinking the most.

1086
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,080
It's me.

1087
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,360
It's good ol' energy.

1088
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,080
I'm gonna drink.

1089
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,680
I'm gonna be the coolest guy here

1090
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,280
and everyone's gonna like me.

1091
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,960
The coolest, drunkest guy.

1092
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,960
Exactly.

1093
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,320
Which really is synonymous.

1094
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:22,800
So...

1095
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,520
I feel you.

1096
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:23,920
I was...

1097
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,520
So I was drinking.

1098
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,200
I did some tequila shots

1099
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,400
with the salt on the hand.

1100
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,080
And then I went to the place

1101
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,120
and I got this thing called

1102
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,000
A Man With No Name,

1103
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,440
which is like some kind of whiskey drink.

1104
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,920
But the ice cube was like a big round ice ball.

1105
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,840
It looked like a ball of ice.

1106
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,480
It was really cool.

1107
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,600
I've always wanted one of those.

1108
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,720
And as I was drinking it,

1109
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,920
sort of like the poison in the alcohol

1110
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,480
was like melting into the ice cube,

1111
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,280
ice ball.

1112
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,560
And it created like a ridge

1113
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,240
around the circumference of the ice ball.

1114
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,440
So it looked like the Death Star.

1115
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,240
So that was really cool.

1116
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,680
So I got another one of those

1117
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,520
because I liked that it was a Death Star

1118
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,800
kind of looking thing.

1119
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,880
So then I got this dragon fruit

1120
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,760
fucking red fruity beer drink

1121
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,040
and that was fucking tasty.

1122
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,120
And even after all that,

1123
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,920
I was doing fine.

1124
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,560
I was feeling...

1125
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,760
You know, I was loosey-goosey.

1126
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,720
I was making jokes.

1127
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,760
I was being cool.

1128
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,880
You know, I'm just walking around

1129
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,240
like, hey, I'm just being cool.

1130
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,680
I'm just being cool.

1131
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,800
And you know,

1132
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,160
everyone was telling me that I'm cool

1133
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,440
because the podcast...

1134
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,560
My friends, by the way,

1135
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,960
didn't even know that I have a podcast

1136
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,640
because I'm so ashamed

1137
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,240
of this part of my life normally

1138
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,560
that I haven't told anyone in my real world

1139
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,080
anything about what I do.

1140
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,000
I never post like shit on Facebook.

1141
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
No one knows anything.

1142
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,480
And that's how I like it.

1143
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,360
So they didn't even know

1144
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,360
that I had a podcast until I said,

1145
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,040
hey, I shouted out Ivan on the thing.

1146
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,240
So that was cool.

1147
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,680
So they were proud of me for telling people

1148
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,480
about the GoFundMe

1149
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,880
and also proud of me for having a podcast

1150
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,680
which they didn't know.

1151
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,800
So definitely, that's nice.

1152
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,240
It's only been going for three years.

1153
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,120
Yeah, so I was...

1154
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,360
Yeah.

1155
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,560
Yeah.

1156
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,960
So yeah.

1157
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,760
So even after that,

1158
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,560
I was feeling good.

1159
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,320
I took some selfies in the bar.

1160
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,880
You know, my friend had these cool geckos.

1161
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,760
I took a picture of one.

1162
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,200
I was like, look at this fucking gecko boy.

1163
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Oh, I want you to do a gecko, please.

1164
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,320
Oh, it's on Instagram.

1165
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,440
I gecko-grammed.

1166
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,840
That's the single most interesting thing

1167
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,960
in the last half hour.

1168
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,600
Mage out for blood today.

1169
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,240
Mage is the reason people are dying

1170
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,280
because she's murdering them

1171
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,480
with her vicious words.

1172
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,200
So I was feeling fine

1173
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,960
till we got back to the apartment.

1174
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,840
But then this girl who like...

1175
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,600
Now that's trouble right there.

1176
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,080
Oh yeah, this girl who I call,

1177
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,640
who I refer to all night as Facy Woman

1178
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,000
because she had a face and she was a woman.

1179
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,360
And like...

1180
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,240
Typical.

1181
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,360
Fucking typical.

1182
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,960
Because like it was a face that I knew that I had...

1183
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,120
Like I knew that I've met this person

1184
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,880
probably 11 times before.

1185
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,320
I recognized her face,

1186
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,480
but I didn't know her name until someone said it

1187
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,440
and like, oh, that's your name.

1188
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,760
I've just been calling you Facy Woman this whole time.

1189
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,640
And then that caught on

1190
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,880
and then everyone started calling her Facy Woman.

1191
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,400
Oh, I bet she loved that.

1192
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:00,800
But uh...

1193
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:01,920
Oh yeah.

1194
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:02,960
But she was...

1195
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,920
She does have a face.

1196
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,960
She does have a face.

1197
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,760
It was a cool face.

1198
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,680
She's a cool face person.

1199
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,120
So she was like...

1200
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,280
Like baby bouncing this jug of like potion,

1201
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:13,920
this drink,

1202
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,080
this like fucking...

1203
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,560
This snot juice or baby slime or whatever.

1204
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,360
Dandling it?

1205
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,240
Yeah, on her knee.

1206
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,360
So she was going around

1207
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,560
and she started like pouring that

1208
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,520
into people's...

1209
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,560
Agape mouths,

1210
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,680
like chickens looking up

1211
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,520
and drowning in a rainstorm.

1212
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,560
So, you know,

1213
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,440
I allowed that to happen to me a few times

1214
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,560
and that's when everything went crazy.

1215
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,800
And you know,

1216
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,840
when I get drunk enough,

1217
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,880
I become God.

1218
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,080
So I was sitting there,

1219
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,200
I was doing the jokes,

1220
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,800
I was saying the cool things,

1221
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,640
I was making everybody laugh and you know.

1222
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,920
And you know.

1223
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,960
But of course,

1224
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,600
sometimes I'm too funny for normal people,

1225
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,480
I guess.

1226
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:50,720
Yeah.

1227
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,200
Because like...

1228
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,760
Yeah.

1229
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,080
You know,

1230
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,280
because I was telling my jokes,

1231
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:53,520
you know,

1232
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,560
I might have let fly a couple of cool n-bombs.

1233
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,880
And some wacky f-bombs, you know.

1234
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1235
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,760
You know, and some silly...

1236
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,880
You're painting a picture here.

1237
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:05,840
Yeah.

1238
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,640
And some colorful rape jokes or something,

1239
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,200
I don't know.

1240
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,560
Not a lot of rape jokes,

1241
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,000
just an appropriate amount,

1242
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,960
I would say.

1243
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,680
Yeah.

1244
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,520
Whatever you think the right amount is,

1245
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,400
it was that amount.

1246
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,600
Yeah.

1247
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,720
But I began to notice

1248
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
like a slight shift in the room

1249
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,320
and it's like...

1250
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,920
It's like, guys, come on.

1251
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,800
This isn't the internet.

1252
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,720
You don't have to pretend to be offended by things.

1253
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,640
It's okay to laugh at n-bombs and stuff.

1254
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,640
But no one believes me

1255
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,920
because the world has gone crazy.

1256
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,560
And really,

1257
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,120
it's not that everyone was offended,

1258
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,320
but there was this one guy sitting next to me on the couch,

1259
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,800
this one cuck who's f-cking...

1260
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,480
Like, I don't know.

1261
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,560
I said something that was too funny for him.

1262
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,480
I said like a rape joke or something.

1263
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:46,880
Yeah.

1264
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,680
And he like,

1265
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,280
he slapped me in the face.

1266
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,880
No, f-cking way.

1267
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,360
What?

1268
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:52,640
Yeah.

1269
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,880
And like...

1270
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,640
All right, well, that's uncalled for.

1271
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,640
It wasn't like a hard slap,

1272
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,640
but it was hard enough to be annoying.

1273
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:58,720
Yeah.

1274
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,760
That's f-cked.

1275
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,840
That's straight up escalating the violence.

1276
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,080
You don't do that.

1277
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,040
You don't do that.

1278
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,440
Yeah.

1279
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,560
And I said,

1280
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,680
whoa, what was that for?

1281
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,040
And he just did it again.

1282
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,440
And I'm like, okay.

1283
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,080
What the f-ck?

1284
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,720
What were you doing?

1285
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,200
Why you sl-

1286
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,480
I didn't say anything.

1287
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,040
What are you doing?

1288
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,520
And like,

1289
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,960
and he did it like three or four times.

1290
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,920
He kept like slapping.

1291
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,600
And again, like, it wasn't like hard...

1292
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:15,840
What?

1293
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,960
Like really painful slaps,

1294
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,720
but it was hard enough that it became

1295
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,200
really f-cking normal.

1296
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,080
Trying to get you to punch him in the f-cking face?

1297
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:20,880
Like, what the f-ck?

1298
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,320
Yeah, so that's what everybody does.

1299
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,760
Everybody wants to get punched.

1300
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,960
Everybody wants to f-ck with me.

1301
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,600
Everywhere I go.

1302
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,400
I don't know why,

1303
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,200
no matter where I am,

1304
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,080
no matter what I'm doing,

1305
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,160
there's always one f-cking person

1306
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,000
who just can't handle it.

1307
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,920
One person who doesn't understand

1308
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,600
that I'm just being cool

1309
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,440
and has to get their undies twisted.

1310
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,960
Because I guess I just intimidate people

1311
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,560
with my overwhelming charisma.

1312
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,080
So they have to find some way

1313
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,840
to try and tear me down

1314
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,920
to alleviate that sense of worthlessness

1315
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,120
they feel in my shadow.

1316
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,800
So he kept doing it a couple times

1317
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,560
until finally I had to put some dad

1318
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,520
in my voice and went,

1319
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:53,920
Stop!

1320
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,280
Some dad.

1321
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,520
This party will become not fun

1322
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,040
if you hit me one more time,

1323
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,680
I promise.

1324
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,360
So then he stopped,

1325
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,480
and so that guy was gay.

1326
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:02,720
Yeah.

1327
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,920
But nah, he was alright.

1328
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,280
We became friends, I guess.

1329
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,560
Not really, I hope he dies, but...

1330
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,440
I feel many ways about many things.

1331
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,960
If you got a f-cking problem,

1332
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,960
you say, like,

1333
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,880
hey man, you know,

1334
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,960
not to be a buzz kill or anything,

1335
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,640
but I'm personally a fan, you know.

1336
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,560
But my wife is black

1337
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,840
and is a rape victim,

1338
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,240
so the jokes are a little bit sore on me.

1339
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,920
Fucking words in these situations.

1340
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,960
I mean, even that,

1341
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,680
I believe.

1342
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,240
It would have been...

1343
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,000
Like, if I made a joke,

1344
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,720
and someone was like,

1345
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,840
oh man, that offends me

1346
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,560
because of, you know,

1347
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,440
this reason or like,

1348
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,640
hey, there's a fucking black guy

1349
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,120
right next to you

1350
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,760
and he feels bad

1351
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,840
because you said that word 50 times

1352
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,960
in one sentence,

1353
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,760
then I would be like,

1354
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,400
okay, I'm sorry.

1355
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,920
Yeah, you don't go from,

1356
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
you don't go from silent to

1357
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,760
fucking slap in a guy

1358
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,880
to silent to violent.

1359
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,160
Silent to violent.

1360
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,200
Chris been walked.

1361
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,160
I just can't...

1362
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,680
There is no words

1363
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,120
that can come out of someone's face

1364
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,640
that I think a slap

1365
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,720
is an inappropriate response to ever.

1366
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,120
Agreed.

1367
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,720
I guess something like,

1368
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,640
if you don't stop me now,

1369
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,720
I will assassinate your dad

1370
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,160
or, you know, something like that.

1371
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,320
What if they say slap me?

1372
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm not gonna slap somebody

1373
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,560
just because they told me to.

1374
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,680
Yeah, I don't wanna go there.

1375
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,560
I'll need some cajoling.

1376
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,600
I'll need some cajoling

1377
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,560
to follow through on that.

1378
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,640
What if they say I'll pay you to slap me?

1379
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,800
That's the cajoling I'm looking for.

1380
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,600
It's weird to me because, like,

1381
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,440
you can tell that nobody in the room

1382
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,800
is really offended.

1383
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,400
Like, most people are laughing.

1384
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,160
Everybody's, like, having a good time,

1385
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,240
but, like, there's this sense in people

1386
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,880
that they have to pretend to be offended

1387
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,480
and they just have to play along

1388
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,520
with the idea of, like,

1389
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,040
oh, you can't say that.

1390
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,560
And it's like, you're not offended.

1391
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,160
Stop pretending and don't touch me.

1392
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,920
Well, it's not even that there's an offense

1393
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,560
at that point.

1394
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,800
It's that they're afraid to laugh.

1395
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:47,840
Yeah.

1396
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,680
Because, like, what's everybody else gonna think?

1397
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,520
I can't, like, this can't be funny to me,

1398
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,240
even though it's fucking great.

1399
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,280
Yeah, and maybe it's also, like,

1400
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,240
a virtue signaling thing,

1401
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,960
of they wanna be like,

1402
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,560
hey, just so everyone knows,

1403
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,680
I'm not cool with this,

1404
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,680
so, you know, like, that's a part for sure.

1405
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,520
I don't even get what it was that I said

1406
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,560
that set him off,

1407
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,040
because it's not like I was just spewing

1408
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,920
this torrent of outrageous, hateful shit.

1409
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,120
I know how to read the room.

1410
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,560
Everything was fine.

1411
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,080
Yeah, yeah.

1412
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,600
But anyways, that's just a minor aside.

1413
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,960
That's not like a whole big thing.

1414
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,160
We started playing games.

1415
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,960
We started, you know,

1416
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,360
drinking more of that baby slime out of the tap.

1417
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,120
And, you know, we were playing Liar's Dice,

1418
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,040
like Orlando Bloom and Pirates of the Caribbean,

1419
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,520
part two.

1420
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,320
Nice.

1421
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,840
Anyways, then I started puking.

1422
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,200
I was puking all over the fucking place,

1423
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,480
by which I mean the toilet,

1424
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,600
because I'm pretty, like,

1425
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,360
I'm pretty swift when I feel a puke coming.

1426
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,720
I can get, like,

1427
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,000
I can weave in and out of people

1428
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and slalom my way to the bathroom.

1429
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,400
Oh, the word slalom.

1430
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,720
Would you say you're a man who can handle his puke?

1431
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,720
The last time I heard that word slalom

1432
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,960
was, like, in the phone stones cartoon.

1433
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,400
And I never knew what it meant.

1434
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,760
No idea.

1435
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,480
I just know it because of the impossible

1436
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,320
driver tutorial on PlayStation 1,

1437
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,680
where you gotta fucking do all that shit

1438
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,120
in the garage on the first level

1439
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,360
and slalom your way through the fucking pillars.

1440
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,280
That is such a weird word.

1441
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,480
It is.

1442
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,400
I don't think I've ever heard that word.

1443
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:04,960
Slalom.

1444
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,680
Like, no one should ever say that.

1445
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,200
Is it not really just skiing?

1446
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,160
Is there a slope involved?

1447
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,120
Yeah, it's a skiing thing.

1448
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:09,840
It's like an, like, you go between the flags.

1449
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,880
I knew it was some kind of Olympic winter sport thing.

1450
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,560
Yeah, it's just, like, weaving in and out of.

1451
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,360
Oh, okay, okay.

1452
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,120
You know, I know what happens to everybody.

1453
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,200
Like, everybody knows that everybody pukes

1454
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,840
when they drink.

1455
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,200
But, like, you don't,

1456
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,960
but you never want to be the guy

1457
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,880
who's the puke-y guy at the party

1458
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,760
while it's happening.

1459
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,920
You want to be able to hold it in until you're alone.

1460
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,720
No.

1461
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,840
The next day, like, now.

1462
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,320
Oh.

1463
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,440
When someone starts puking,

1464
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,400
that's when everyone's like,

1465
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,280
oh, dear.

1466
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,640
Oh, boy.

1467
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,760
It signals the third act of any good party.

1468
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,560
I mean, the best way to puke at a party

1469
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,640
is to be like a dog who knows

1470
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,920
he's not long for this world,

1471
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,000
so you crawl into the porch to just dial on

1472
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,200
so no one can see it.

1473
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,400
You got to get out of there

1474
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,680
before anyone knows you're puking.

1475
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,680
Puking in silence and hopefully come back

1476
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,400
and you're like, hey, nothing happened.

1477
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,520
Or come back and be like,

1478
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,240
hey, I puked, but I'm okay.

1479
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,960
Don't worry.

1480
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,960
Like, because I've been to a lot,

1481
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,720
like, when me and my friends used to drink a lot.

1482
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,000
That's not always possible.

1483
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,360
It's not just that somebody would start puking.

1484
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,320
It's that they would become bad.

1485
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,080
Like, the moment when somebody gets to a point

1486
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,760
where everyone else is worried about them,

1487
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,880
that's when the party's dead.

1488
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,360
Yeah.

1489
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,640
Because it sobers you up.

1490
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,600
Like, if you're not drunk enough to be that guy,

1491
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,360
then you will become sober

1492
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,080
by wanting to help that guy, you know?

1493
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,120
Yeah.

1494
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,040
Well, my whole thing is that just like,

1495
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,640
I have a deep-seated need

1496
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,680
to be the coolest guy in the room at all costs.

1497
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,000
So, like, I will drink more than anyone.

1498
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,760
I'll drink anything anyone gives me.

1499
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,360
If somebody says to me, like,

1500
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,560
I won't do something, like,

1501
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,920
ah, you won't drink this much.

1502
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,960
I'll be like, oh, you said the wrong thing to me, Buster.

1503
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,000
Whoa, with the heart on it.

1504
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,640
I don't know.

1505
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,920
It's a Leo thing.

1506
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,600
You know, I just got to be the guy.

1507
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,880
I'm like, I'm really into astrology.

1508
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,480
Also, that's my new thing.

1509
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,440
Whoa, whoa.

1510
00:51:59,440 --> 00:51:59,680
What?

1511
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,040
Not really.

1512
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,440
Where did that come from?

1513
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,720
Well, I was watching the Orville

1514
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,920
and there was an episode about, like,

1515
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,040
a planet of people who are, like,

1516
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,080
obsessed with astrology.

1517
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,920
And they, they, like, they do, like,

1518
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,960
a genocide thing of people

1519
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,200
who were born under a certain sign.

1520
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,400
So I was watching that and I'm like,

1521
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,520
yeah, that's a good society.

1522
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,400
I would, that'd be cool.

1523
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,840
I would like to get rid of all the Scorpios.

1524
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,720
That'd be awesome.

1525
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,040
No.

1526
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,880
My dad's a Scorpio.

1527
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,640
Poor bastard.

1528
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,280
Riveting.

1529
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,240
You would kill me.

1530
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,280
You would kill me.

1531
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,640
That hurts, man.

1532
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,920
Well, you'd thank him for it, Tom.

1533
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Are you a, are you a, are you a,

1534
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,600
are you a Scorpion, Tom?

1535
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,720
I am a Scorpio, yeah.

1536
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,120
Everyone, signs, me, Aries,

1537
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,720
fire sign, Beth sign.

1538
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,440
I'm a cancer.

1539
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,640
I think that's water, I think.

1540
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,760
Leo, lion, king of the jungle, best guy.

1541
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,720
Taurus, earth, glad it's not water.

1542
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,360
Digi.

1543
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,160
Do you know Digi?

1544
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:50,640
Any idea?

1545
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,720
Digi's also a Leo.

1546
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,120
It's Leo.

1547
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,280
Okay.

1548
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:53,760
Where'd he go?

1549
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,280
Uh, I guess he's dead?

1550
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:55,840
Digi.

1551
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,880
I was trying to find a,

1552
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,800
I was trying to think of a way to transition out

1553
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,920
instead of giving an answer,

1554
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,760
but I didn't come up with anything in time.

1555
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,320
Too late.

1556
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,720
Crap.

1557
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,360
Out, outplayed.

1558
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,240
Well, what else happened then, Jay?

1559
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,960
Go on, go on.

1560
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,800
So, you know, I, I would be like hanging out and be like,

1561
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,600
oh, make way, people, it's pukey time.

1562
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,120
And I got up and I would like,

1563
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,040
Russia, I would dart to the bathroom.

1564
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,600
Mm-hmm.

1565
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,200
It was definitely a dart motion,

1566
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,080
like I would whoosh.

1567
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,440
And I did that like two or three times,

1568
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,320
I think, over the course of the night.

1569
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,760
Like, and one of the times when I was in there

1570
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,280
puking, I was like, well, I'm in here,

1571
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,240
I might as well poop too.

1572
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,360
So I pooped on my puke.

1573
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,400
And that was really cool.

1574
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,440
God damn.

1575
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,160
All right.

1576
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,360
Can flush more than once.

1577
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,760
Because like, normally I would never poop

1578
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,560
in another person's house,

1579
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,000
but if they think I'm in there puking,

1580
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,960
then I have, you know,

1581
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,720
carte blanche to secretly poop

1582
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,360
while I'm at it.

1583
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:41,840
That's true.

1584
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,600
Secretly poop.

1585
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,040
No one will ever know.

1586
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,280
Yeah.

1587
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,480
So then, you know, I came out,

1588
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,600
and then the party was starting to thin

1589
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,480
and people were leaving.

1590
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,240
So then it was just me and my friend.

1591
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,480
So, you know, me and my friend

1592
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,080
started having like emotional real talk,

1593
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,640
and that's miserable for all parties involved.

1594
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,600
And no one wants to do that,

1595
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,720
but it's just a part of the party.

1596
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,840
You have to do it at some point.

1597
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,760
It's like a ritual for men, I guess.

1598
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,840
Men who otherwise fucking just push

1599
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,160
everything down all day for their whole lives.

1600
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,240
You know, you gotta have that drunk

1601
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,000
meeting of the minds at every party

1602
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,520
at least once with your genuine broken.

1603
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,440
So, I don't know.

1604
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,400
So then that was the party,

1605
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,520
and then I woke up in the morning

1606
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,360
choking on my own vomit,

1607
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,480
like fucking ACDC.

1608
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,560
So then I fucking went.

1609
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,160
We stopped at McDonald's in the way home,

1610
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,200
and I got an orange juice,

1611
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,360
and I don't know why the fuck I did that.

1612
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,440
Because then I came home and started the podcast,

1613
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,880
and then I immediately had to disappear

1614
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,640
for 15 minutes to fucking vomit up orange juice,

1615
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,560
and it was acid-y, and it hurt, and it tastes bad,

1616
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,600
and now I'm drinking tea,

1617
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,920
but now the tea tastes like vomit and orange juice

1618
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,080
because it's coating the inside of my mouth,

1619
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,560
and that's my grumbly story

1620
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,800
about how hungover and sad I am.

1621
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,840
Incredible. Not bad.

1622
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,200
But I would do it all again

1623
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,920
if somebody told me that they would like me.

1624
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,720
In fact, there's another party tonight.

1625
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,800
While Jesse was getting shit-faced at a party,

1626
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,680
I, the night before, was taking three tabs of acid,

1627
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,120
and it was pretty fucking cool.

1628
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,320
While I was doing that,

1629
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,920
you, the night before, did something.

1630
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,520
What was that experience like?

1631
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,000
It was pretty fucking sick.

1632
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,120
Me and Zen Huxtable did a bunch of acid,

1633
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,120
found your drugs, kids.

1634
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,960
Listen, do drugs, though.

1635
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,680
You can do some drugs.

1636
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,560
Not kids, but...

1637
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,520
No, don't do it.

1638
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,720
As long as you're 18.

1639
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,960
Yeah, kids don't do drugs if you're 18.

1640
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,000
Hey, kids. Do a lot of drugs.

1641
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,280
It's me. It's me.

1642
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,640
You're a dad, but like your cool dad, Ben St.

1643
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,280
letting you know that you can do some drugs if you want to.

1644
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,400
You have my permission.

1645
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,360
No, not alone.

1646
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,120
Just do them in the house, where it's safe.

1647
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,320
Or not. I don't really care.

1648
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,080
Get on out there and get those drugs, kids.

1649
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,040
He's the cool dad. He doesn't care.

1650
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,280
It's all I'm doing.

1651
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:51,760
That's right.

1652
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,000
You're the good, the bad.

1653
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,800
Don't listen to him.

1654
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,120
See, I'm like your dad, but like really,

1655
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,760
you know, we're more like friends than like dad, you know.

1656
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,160
You never visit.

1657
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,120
You never visit.

1658
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:05,040
Like, I'm like, yeah, because I'm like too cool to visit.

1659
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,040
Why don't you introduce me to some of your classmates?

1660
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,560
They look pretty cute, don't I'm saying?

1661
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,760
Hey, yeah.

1662
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,760
I can't wait to come to your kindergarten class again

1663
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,120
and see them. Hey, yeah.

1664
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,320
Am I right?

1665
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,840
High five, son.

1666
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:19,920
Anyway.

1667
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,360
Moving on from that as fast as possible.

1668
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,880
Tell me, tell me more about the experience.

1669
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,200
Yeah, I mean, mostly it was me and Zen Huxtable

1670
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,600
sitting around listening to music and talking about

1671
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,320
tautology and how everything is the same thing,

1672
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,200
but also infinite versions of the same thing,

1673
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,160
which is basically the conversation,

1674
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,160
the one that you have when you're on acid.

1675
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,200
So yeah, so that's the one that just kind of goes

1676
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,640
around in circles.

1677
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,440
Well, yeah, but every conversation does.

1678
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,280
I mean, that was the nature of the conversation

1679
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,000
was us addressing the fact that the conversation

1680
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,040
was going in circles and and and then continuing said circle

1681
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,360
for us for because the thing about acid is that

1682
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,960
you can't sleep after you take it for like a long time.

1683
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,600
Like it keeps you up, it gives you lots of energy

1684
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,040
even after the trip is over.

1685
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,960
So we're just kind of like standing around talking

1686
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,960
about tautology all night long and listening to music.

1687
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,560
But we do when we do it together.

1688
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,760
This is the second time we've done it.

1689
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,040
It's been sort of a cultural exchange where we just kind of

1690
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,560
share one another's or share our music with one another,

1691
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,880
you know, because he's mostly into like jazz and big band

1692
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,240
and stuff like that.

1693
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:44,080
And I'm more into like, you know, psychedelic rock and shit.

1694
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,760
And there's a lot of crossover there.

1695
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,160
So, you know, I got him into the Mars Volta.

1696
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,440
He showed me some cool shit.

1697
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,160
And that's basically it.

1698
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,520
I mean, there's not nothing crazy or exciting happened

1699
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,640
that wouldn't be over the detailed space.

1700
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,320
2001, a space Odyssey style.

1701
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,240
I saw I saw some cool.

1702
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,840
I mean, yeah, I did.

1703
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,360
I had I had some fun.

1704
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,280
Well, because like the thing is that basically to explain

1705
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,320
to anybody who has no idea what acid does to you at all.

1706
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,040
And like if you've if you've seen music videos that are like,

1707
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,920
this is what an acid trip is like, it's exactly like that.

1708
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,120
Like it's exactly what everybody portrays it as.

1709
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,600
But like basically how I would characterize it is that normally

1710
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,840
your brain is in taking like ridiculous amounts of sensory data

1711
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,440
on just everything going on.

1712
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,920
But it it doesn't register most of it.

1713
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,880
It puts most of it away.

1714
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,720
It just focuses on the things that matter.

1715
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,000
When you're on acid, it's not doing that.

1716
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's not focusing on things that matter.

1717
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,280
It's just taking in everything and it doesn't know what's important.

1718
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,240
So if you were to say stare at a wall,

1719
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,560
you will notice way more detail in that wall

1720
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,400
than you've ever normally noticed.

1721
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,360
But because your brain can't like,

1722
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,520
it can't necessarily like process all of that at once.

1723
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,520
Some of it starts to look weird and fucky

1724
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,720
and it's all moving around.

1725
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,160
Everything you look at is moving.

1726
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,760
Any still image, it's moving.

1727
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,040
Everything's moving all the time.

1728
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,320
Because you're just like trying to keep track

1729
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,040
of all this fucking sensory data going on.

1730
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,920
So if you were to have no music

1731
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,360
and just be like in a just in a room by yourself,

1732
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,880
it would become terrifying because you you know,

1733
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,920
you're just like seeing shit fucking happen constantly.

1734
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,360
But like if you listen to music,

1735
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,200
it keeps you concentrated on the music

1736
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,360
and it sort of forces your attention onto something.

1737
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,000
So instead of like your attention constantly shifting

1738
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,360
and constantly like you know,

1739
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,360
paying attention to different things,

1740
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,080
it's like it commands you to listen to it.

1741
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,000
And so if you listen to really dense music

1742
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,120
with lots of shit going on,

1743
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,840
you're going to parse every single detail in that music

1744
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,880
and it sounds really beautiful.

1745
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,320
So mostly we're just sitting there listening to trippy music

1746
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,880
and when I would sit there with my eyes closed,

1747
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,040
that's when you have the fucking mind visions.

1748
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,240
They're like traveling the universe fucking seeing.

1749
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,400
I kept seeing like the the like schema of my own brain

1750
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,760
is how I would put it.

1751
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,960
But like it was like I was seeing my my vascular system

1752
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,480
or like the veins in my brain,

1753
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,000
but they were all full of pastel rainbows like charging through.

1754
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Was it like that episode of Spongebob

1755
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,360
where Plankton goes into his earhole and into his brain

1756
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,160
and at some point Spongebob just turns his eyeballs

1757
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,480
around in his head and looks into his own brain

1758
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,080
and sees Plankton standing on it

1759
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,840
with a lever controlling his movements.

1760
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,280
I have...

1761
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,000
Oh, you know what?

1762
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,400
I have seen that that episode.

1763
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,600
No, it wasn't like that.

1764
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,800
Okay, well now I get it.

1765
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,640
It sure was, it sure was.

1766
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,240
I mean, if anybody wanted to like just to name a music video

1767
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,000
that I think encapsulates it perfectly,

1768
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
the video for When You Die by MGMT looks like an acid trip.

1769
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,280
But there's tons like, I mean,

1770
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,080
again, it's something that's portrayed in in lots of media

1771
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,880
and granted, I wasn't like doing a shitload of acid or anything.

1772
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,160
Like if you do a whole lot,

1773
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,600
it can get even more out of control as I understand it.

1774
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,320
But mostly it's just like everything you look at

1775
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,880
is moving all the time and it's trippy and cool.

1776
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,280
Fuck yeah, do drugs.

1777
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:19,840
Hell yeah.

1778
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,800
Well, you know, they always say,

1779
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,920
Sam Harris, the only person I respect who's ever done a drug,

1780
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,400
is, he always says that like, it's helpful for,

1781
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,680
he's the guy who I first heard a reasonable argument for

1782
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,280
that consciousness is an illusion.

1783
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,280
And basically that, I forget,

1784
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,080
I think it was DTM, MDMT or whatever.

1785
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,760
He said it was very helpful for,

1786
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,040
like it elevates you above your own,

1787
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,480
what's it like, ego or whatever,

1788
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,680
such that you are like, yeah.

1789
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,640
That is what I think.

1790
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,160
I think MDMA, which I'm pretty sure is ecstasy.

1791
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,040
Yeah, I think that's right.

1792
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,480
You're thinking of the wrong thing.

1793
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,320
It's DMT that causes ego death.

1794
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,520
DMT?

1795
01:01:59,520 --> 01:01:59,840
Yes.

1796
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,200
Okay, I forget which one it was.

1797
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:01,520
I don't find that.

1798
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,760
Yeah, yeah, you combine the acronyms.

1799
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,280
But first of all, pretty smart guy,

1800
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,440
and then he did some drugs because he's into meditation

1801
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,920
and it helped him be like, yeah, I don't exist.

1802
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,880
I'm just part of the universe.

1803
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,480
You know, there's nothing special about me.

1804
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,480
I am the particles that are part of the universe.

1805
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,280
That's pretty cool.

1806
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,240
People make a big deal about like-

1807
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,760
I don't know why I need drugs for that though,

1808
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,720
because like I get it.

1809
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,600
Yeah, you don't.

1810
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,640
Like, I mean, I feel like,

1811
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,640
I feel like you can just understand that concept and be fine.

1812
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:25,840
I knew a guy in college whose name was-

1813
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,760
I recommend doing acid because it's fun.

1814
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,960
I knew a guy in college named Acid Paul,

1815
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,320
who gave me the spiel about DMT and how,

1816
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,520
oh, it's like when you die,

1817
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,720
your brain is flooded with chemicals and whatever, you know.

1818
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,160
He gave me the DMT spiel.

1819
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,160
Why don't you just fucking kill me, Acid Jim?

1820
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,880
Just do that, and then I'll experience the best high of all.

1821
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,200
Death.

1822
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,600
Also, you know what?

1823
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,880
I don't fucking buy that whole,

1824
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,760
when you die, your brain is flooded with chemicals.

1825
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,520
How long do you have before you-

1826
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,040
What if it gets shot in the fucking brain?

1827
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,760
I've got what, like two seconds before I'm just out?

1828
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,320
Is that enough time for the chemicals to flood my brain and turn me into-

1829
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,440
I think about what the experience of having one's brain

1830
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,160
physically damaged and destroyed would be like constantly.

1831
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,680
I don't want to think about it, but-

1832
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,400
I think about it all the time and freak myself out.

1833
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,760
I think about spiders laying eggs in my brain,

1834
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,080
and they're just, you know, dealing with-

1835
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,800
You know, basically becoming Spider-Man is what I'm trying to say,

1836
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,320
and you know, swinging from New York City skyscrapers.

1837
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,280
Yeah, they laid eggs in his brain, and now he's turning them.

1838
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,880
That's what happened, yeah.

1839
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,320
Well, the chemicals flooded his brain,

1840
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,360
and he's having an extended, like, flash trip.

1841
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,040
That's actually just the moment of his death.

1842
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,240
It's only lasted, you know-

1843
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,480
It's stretched out like an eternity in front of him.

1844
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,920
Yeah, but it's stretched out over, you know,

1845
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,480
decades and decades of comic books worth of time.

1846
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,280
Indeed, indeed.

1847
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,680
The flash, the trip that is.

1848
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,680
I want to watch Into the Spider-Verse again,

1849
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,280
because it was like the coolest movie I've ever seen.

1850
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,320
Agreed?

1851
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,360
Good, I still haven't seen it.

1852
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,960
Haven't seen it, don't spoil.

1853
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,480
You should go watch it.

1854
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,040
Hey, speaking of things I've seen, a quick-

1855
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,720
Well, I guess this is a tangent now,

1856
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,360
but like, I have another subject of interest to me.

1857
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,080
But first of all, I have to ask, Tom,

1858
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,280
I don't want to spoil anything.

1859
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,920
It's about Devil May Cry 5, and it's just about-

1860
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,320
There's been like some reveals of things lately,

1861
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,800
and I don't want to like say it, if it's gonna, you know,

1862
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,000
fuck with things, things about some characters that have been shown.

1863
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,040
Any-

1864
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:15,200
Yeah.

1865
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,480
Am I- Are you aware of this?

1866
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:17,920
The last-

1867
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,520
Do your favorite, say it, so I don't have to.

1868
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:24,000
They aired the last trailer before the game comes out on March 8th,

1869
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,200
which is five days from now.

1870
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:25,280
Yes.

1871
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,080
I'm very excited.

1872
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,080
Okay, and was there a character at the very end?

1873
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:37,040
They showed Virgil from Devil May Cry 3 that he's back.

1874
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,160
There, he's coming back.

1875
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,800
So first of all, I have no idea how that even happened.

1876
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,320
Yeah, I don't really know.

1877
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,680
I mean, well, here's the thing.

1878
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,120
In Devil May Cry 3, he's like sealed away in the underworld.

1879
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,240
That's kind of what happens.

1880
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,280
He gets trapped in Demon World, and that's how the game ends.

1881
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:51,840
Spoilers.

1882
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,320
Ha-ha-ha.

1883
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:52,800
Yep.

1884
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,720
Because you care so much about the story in this game.

1885
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,320
The portal between Demon World and Human World had been sealed off.

1886
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,760
I was thinking that, yeah.

1887
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,000
Until Yusuke shows up and opens the portal, and yeah.

1888
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1889
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,840
And then in Devil May Cry 1, which comes time-on-wise after 3,

1890
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,160
you fight this dude called Neroangelo.

1891
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,920
It's revealed at the end of the game that he is what remains of Virgil,

1892
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,800
and you, you assumedly kill him at this point.

1893
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,960
And you get the other half of the necklace, you make the sword of Sparda, it's fucking sick.

1894
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,240
It was so cool, like back in the day,

1895
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,320
like beating Devil May Cry 3, and then going back to the first one,

1896
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,840
and like having this new appreciation for like, oh, that's fucking Virgil.

1897
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,440
It was so fucking ill.

1898
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,120
God, what a great game series.

1899
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,640
Everyone should fucking play it.

1900
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,400
But yeah, he's apparently somehow back in Devil May Cry 5,

1901
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,960
looking exactly like he did in Devil May Cry 3.

1902
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,800
Who questioned that, Tom?

1903
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,280
What, what, Devil May Cry 4 special edition, was he like canonically in that, or was that like-

1904
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,720
I don't think he was canonically in it.

1905
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:53,840
Okay.

1906
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,880
Because I haven't played it, but I know there is like a cutscene or something,

1907
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,400
I think they did for DMC4 with Virgil,

1908
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,200
applying that he was in Fortuna at some point.

1909
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,080
Yeah, yeah.

1910
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,720
I think there's a whole Virgil campaign in Devil May Cry.

1911
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,040
I think you can play him in the campaign, because I know they added,

1912
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,600
they, like the special edition, they added Virgil,

1913
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,880
and then they made Lady and Trish, both playable characters as well.

1914
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,320
Um, but I don't know if they have their own campaign.

1915
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
I know, I know they did something for Virgil,

1916
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,560
because everybody has a hard on for Virgil.

1917
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,280
Indeed they do.

1918
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,560
He's implied to have history in Fortuna, even, and like,

1919
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,600
it has something to do with Nero, but it's not clear.

1920
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,280
I mean, they think that he's his dad, right?

1921
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,240
Yeah, that's like the general idea, but it's not confirmed yet.

1922
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,880
So, they're assuming there's going to be obviously more information on that in this game,

1923
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,640
because like the whole thing is like, they're like,

1924
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:47,920
oh, Nero's devil bringer arm from four contained Yamato, which was indeed his sword.

1925
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,360
And so, in this game, it starts with that arm, that devil bringer arm,

1926
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,840
or getting cut off, and he gets those robot arms,

1927
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,120
and that's like the gimmick of the game.

1928
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:02,320
So, assumedly, from the very beginning, everyone assumed that Virgil would be involved in somehow,

1929
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,680
because of the circumstances of his arm being removed and shit like that.

1930
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,480
So, it wasn't like a super big surprise.

1931
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,560
I think the bigger surprise of that trailer was that they showed like a flashback with Dante's

1932
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,680
mother Eva, and like, implying that they're going to go into like the backstory of like,

1933
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:22,400
how they got separated at birth, and like, what happened to fuck over,

1934
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,200
Sparta, and how he got fucking captured and shit and imprisoned, and like Eva got killed.

1935
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,960
So, yeah, the trailer went from, like, all the trailers have been like,

1936
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,040
just like, this is going to be a fucking goofy, good time action game with your boys.

1937
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,560
And then this last trailer, they drop like this emotional bomb, where it's like, no,

1938
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,880
like, we're going to get heavy at some point, you're like, oh.

1939
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,560
Well, you know what, that's appropriate.

1940
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,600
I think so, this feels like they're going to wrap it up.

1941
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,640
I highly doubt they'll ever make it.

1942
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,280
They should.

1943
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,960
Unless, like, this game does fucking amazingly well.

1944
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,680
I don't think Capcom's really going to bother making another Devil May Cry.

1945
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,520
So, this does feel like, tonally, that they're going to wrap everything up in a nice pretty bow,

1946
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,160
and leave it be at that point.

1947
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,120
So, well, and I guess we'll just have to see, it's coming out in what,

1948
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,400
like, three weeks or something?

1949
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,640
Try five days, dude.

1950
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,680
Five fucking, it'll be out when you hear this podcast.

1951
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,480
Oh my God.

1952
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,760
You will be able to see our reactions live on IM Games.

1953
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,240
Oh my God.

1954
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,200
If the days line up, I'm not sure at this point.

1955
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,520
But either has happened or will be happening soon.

1956
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:20,880
Okay.

1957
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,280
Now, all that said, very interesting, and I will absolutely play it.

1958
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,160
I've played all the other ones.

1959
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,280
So, I'm definitely going to play it as well.

1960
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,960
Well, except two, I skipped most or two.

1961
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,600
Okay, whatever.

1962
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,800
You're not alone.

1963
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,160
Here's my, yeah, indeed.

1964
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,440
Here's my concern.

1965
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:36,400
Can we stop pretending that the characters in Devil May Cry 5 look good?

1966
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,640
Can we just look, because look at Virgil.

1967
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,920
Look at Virgil here.

1968
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,400
Yes.

1969
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,720
I put him in the show notes or whatever, the audio links.

1970
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,720
He looks great.

1971
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,800
He looks like an anime guy.

1972
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,040
Okay.

1973
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,560
We all know that's 10 out of 10.

1974
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,240
And now look how fucking Virgil looks.

1975
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,480
Everyone knows he's the hottest character in the whole series.

1976
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,120
Just look at his fucking dumbass, realistic shit double chin face.

1977
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,040
Hey, his face looks like a foot.

1978
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,160
He looks terrible.

1979
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,720
He looks like the guy from Third Rock from the Sun.

1980
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,600
What's that dude's name?

1981
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,440
Anybody know what I'm talking about?

1982
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,240
The Joseph Gordon Levitt or like the older guy?

1983
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,120
No, the old guy.

1984
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,160
I don't even know where they came from.

1985
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,960
I don't know where they came from either, and maybe they're fake.

1986
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,760
It's this thing they do now where they model the characters after the mocap actor.

1987
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,560
Well, that's what they do.

1988
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,720
They literally scan, like the models of these in these games, they don't,

1989
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:30,560
it's not like an artist sit down and made them from scratch, like a drawing or something.

1990
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,120
What they do is they get an actor and they scan the face,

1991
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,040
and they get a version of the bottle, and then they tweak it a little bit.

1992
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,600
And it never looks good because there was no artistic direction really.

1993
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,120
You came from real life, and real life is always ugly.

1994
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,240
Look at Virgil's hair.

1995
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:49,920
Compare Virgil's hair from Devil May Cry 3 to Devil May Cry 5.

1996
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,360
It looks like shit in Devil May Cry 5.

1997
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,320
It's terrible.

1998
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,000
I haven't seen any of these screenshots.

1999
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,520
I only watched the trailer, which doesn't show anything but his coat.

2000
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,720
And you're like, well, that's clearly...

2001
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,280
Yeah.

2002
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:01,760
Yeah.

2003
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,360
I didn't see this.

2004
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,040
He looks very shitty.

2005
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:05,760
And here's the thing.

2006
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,000
Dante, I think Dante looks fantastic in at least this particular shot.

2007
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,280
I think he looks dope as hell.

2008
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,360
Now, they're still gonna have the horrible, like,

2009
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,560
mouth-speaking realistic animation that always looks bad.

2010
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,160
But, you know, Dante himself as a character design looks good.

2011
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,040
God, what?

2012
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,520
Just...

2013
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,960
It's just like at the end of Resident Evil 7 where this guy shows up.

2014
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,440
Just some guy shows up and they call him Chris.

2015
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,560
Oh, it's Chris Redfield.

2016
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,520
And you're playing it, and you're like,

2017
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,440
like, who is this chinless gump that you are suddenly telling me is Chris Redfield?

2018
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:39,840
He looks...

2019
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,240
This man didn't punch a rock.

2020
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,280
That's bullshed.

2021
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,640
Like, he used to be like a cool-looking, like, attractive, beefy, like a chiseled,

2022
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,240
fucking masculine dude.

2023
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,960
And now he's like this chinless worm of a human.

2024
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,640
He looks like fucking McLovin' with some, like, pubic hair on his face.

2025
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,080
It's gross.

2026
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:58,560
He looks like...

2027
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,960
It's like a peach fuzz fuckboy.

2028
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,000
Okay, I want to know.

2029
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,880
I don't know this.

2030
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,160
Why are we doing this?

2031
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,760
Is it cheaper to do this?

2032
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,440
If so, I've got some sympathy for it.

2033
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,800
If they don't want to invest in, like, character design, I can...

2034
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,320
I think it's the opposite.

2035
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,840
I think it's more expensive.

2036
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,040
Then don't do it.

2037
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,320
Then don't fucking do it.

2038
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,240
I think they're doing it for realism's sake.

2039
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,560
And realism is the pain of video games.

2040
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,240
Throw it in the fucking garbage, my dude.

2041
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,720
Because they did the same thing with Metal Gear Solid 5.

2042
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,160
They scanned it on its face.

2043
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,200
I can't say it's anime.

2044
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,480
Why realism?

2045
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,280
No, that's no...

2046
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,240
I don't...

2047
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:30,960
I guess we're...

2048
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,360
I don't know.

2049
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,080
There's like a...

2050
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,760
There's a sense of, like...

2051
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,560
I think developers want the games to be...

2052
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,760
Maybe even using realistic actors or, like, real people the way Kojima's been doing recently.

2053
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,520
I think they just think they have to.

2054
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,680
I think they think that they're not gonna make the profit margins that they want if they don't go all out.

2055
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,400
Here's something.

2056
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,800
Devil May Cry 5 is running using the Ari engine,

2057
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,720
which they developed for Resident Evil 7.

2058
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,960
And without knowing how that...

2059
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,440
Because it's a proprietary engine, you know?

2060
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,000
So by not knowing what the limitations of that proprietary software is,

2061
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,720
like, I'm assuming they built the Resident Evil engine for Resident Evil 7,

2062
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,120
a scary, realistic-looking game.

2063
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,840
So all the technology in there is probably made to deliver photorealistic games.

2064
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,040
And if they're using that engine, it's not as easy as just, like,

2065
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,680
you know, changing the shaders and stuff to make it look more anime-y or cartoony.

2066
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,960
Like, you have a piece of technology designed to make photorealistic graphics and probably nothing else.

2067
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,160
Oh my god. Is that fucking guy you just posted, Jesse?

2068
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,120
Jesus Christ versus Original Christ.

2069
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,320
Yeah, look at this wimp!

2070
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,720
What did they do to him?

2071
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,560
Oh my god!

2072
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,680
Yeah, I know.

2073
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,000
And I know we've talked about this exact thing before, but...

2074
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,920
That wasn't even, like, a fake reaction.

2075
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,280
That's, like, disgusting.

2076
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:47,920
Yeah, they, like...

2077
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,440
They literally, like, I don't know.

2078
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,480
I guess Umbrella caught him.

2079
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,360
They put him in a lab and they sucked his T-Cown out through a straw.

2080
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,560
That's the real T-Virus right there.

2081
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,040
Oh my fucking god.

2082
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,320
And you know what?

2083
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,280
I agree with people.

2084
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,040
Lady looks pretty good, but I'm posting...

2085
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,160
I don't know why they're not fucking loading.

2086
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,600
These images of Trish.

2087
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,520
Trish has experienced the most massive attractiveness downgrade of, like,

2088
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,080
any fictional female I've ever seen in my life.

2089
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,720
Yeah, I don't know. I think she was pretty good in both.

2090
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,200
Oh, okay.

2091
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,120
She's El Goblina in the bottom one.

2092
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,640
Okay, maybe this is a bad screen tap.

2093
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,400
What the hell is El Goblina?

2094
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,280
She's just a goblin.

2095
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:21,840
She's just a goblin.

2096
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,800
You mean, wouldn't it be La Goblina?

2097
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,000
Okay, fair enough. Fair enough.

2098
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,480
That might be La Goblina.

2099
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,920
There we go. There we go.

2100
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,720
Okay.

2101
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,120
People, you don't need to look at any of these screenshots if you don't want to,

2102
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,160
but the point is, like...

2103
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,920
I hate that we're feeling shackled.

2104
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,320
Whatever.

2105
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,000
Like, high-profile, like, action,

2106
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:38,480
what do you call it?

2107
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,320
Like, quote-unquote character action.

2108
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,440
I don't know if that really applies.

2109
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,040
Fucking Gaming Brit hates that term.

2110
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,360
For, like, there's a lot of focus on, like, the character model,

2111
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,560
and you want it to look like good,

2112
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,560
and you want it to be, like, special or something,

2113
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,200
but why in God's name would you prioritize

2114
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:58,000
looking like a real person in, what, screenshots and stuff,

2115
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,560
versus just going for an appealing art style,

2116
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,520
an appealing character style?

2117
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,360
It's because it's for normies, dude.

2118
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:03,440
I think you're right.

2119
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,880
Gaming has been monetized,

2120
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,040
and ever since the 360, it's this push for, wow, this is so...

2121
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,640
It's like the normal peep.

2122
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,400
Video games have become that person on Facebook.

2123
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,960
But Devil May Cry 5 is not a normie game.

2124
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,840
It's a hardcore...

2125
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:18,800
But it doesn't matter.

2126
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,960
Like, again, the technology has to be built around certain feature sets,

2127
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,160
and, like, this is what sells.

2128
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,760
Like, I guarantee you couldn't make something like, you know,

2129
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,240
Toon Link in the RE engine.

2130
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:34,160
Probably doesn't have the foundation to build something like that.

2131
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,720
I think this comes down to that whole issue

2132
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,520
that everyone's talking about with the AAA market of

2133
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,480
needing to constantly make more money than the previous year, where every game...

2134
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,240
companies are shit and should be.

2135
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:51,680
Yeah, and, like, it's like they could definitely make a DMC5

2136
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,760
where they tone down these graphics.

2137
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,600
The game would cost less to make.

2138
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,560
And even if it did sell to fewer people,

2139
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,160
which I don't even know if that's the case.

2140
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,920
I don't know how much people really give a fuck

2141
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,000
about these photorealistic graphics.

2142
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,760
Certainly not at this level.

2143
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,480
But, like, I think that if they toned it down,

2144
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,600
even if it sold to less people,

2145
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,040
it would still make a profit because it costed less to make.

2146
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,800
But, like, I think that they need a higher just number,

2147
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,720
like, in order to please the investors.

2148
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,040
And I think that they have to make it this way

2149
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,360
to show it to those investors.

2150
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,880
Like, probably not even about, like, what they think will sell,

2151
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,040
but when they show the game to the people that are going to greenlight it,

2152
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,720
they have to assure them that it will have these next-gen graphics

2153
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,120
that supposedly are necessary.

2154
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,680
Because these people are just, like, you know, investors

2155
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,520
who just, like, oh, the kids want, like, the better graphics, right?

2156
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,440
So we need to give them the better graphics.

2157
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,040
So, yeah, I'll keep funding your operation.

2158
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,840
I think the normal people do like that, though.

2159
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,520
You know, like I was saying, I think it's like the video games

2160
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,680
have become the equivalent of that person on Facebook

2161
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,800
who will just post, like, look at this really impressive drawing

2162
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,000
this random person did.

2163
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,480
And it's just, like, a photorealistic apple or something.

2164
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,840
And it's like, this blows my mind how someone could do this.

2165
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,800
It's the exact same thing.

2166
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,120
It's like, oh, my God, graphics look so good.

2167
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,760
Um, the most annoying thing is that, like,

2168
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,600
I remember when I was playing Call of Duty 4 way back in the day

2169
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,080
and, like, thinking those graphics looked really good.

2170
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,600
And then I just had this sudden realization that, oh, uh,

2171
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,640
all the clothes don't move, even though they're, like,

2172
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,680
the game looks realistic and shit, like, none of the clothing,

2173
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,880
like, folds or moves.

2174
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,720
It's all just sculpted in place.

2175
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,560
And from that moment on, all video games have looked horribly embarrassingly

2176
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,520
uncanny valley-faced.

2177
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,080
Why is it?

2178
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,920
Because clothes don't move like they should.

2179
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,840
Game developers and 3D modelers have seeming, to my eyes,

2180
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,640
completely given up on clipping.

2181
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,480
We're just over dealing with clipping.

2182
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,120
Forget it.

2183
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,400
We're not going to fix clipping.

2184
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,360
I was about to say that.

2185
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,160
Like, why in current year does any game still clip ever?

2186
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:58,800
They clip excessively.

2187
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,480
Because it's so fucking hard.

2188
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,000
Yeah, I think it's so hard they've just said we're not going to worry about it.

2189
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,600
Like, the problem is that, like, you get clipping issues

2190
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,440
from what little I can understand.

2191
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,600
Is that they're, the models in video games don't do anything.

2192
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,680
They're literally just there to look pretty.

2193
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,400
Like, hit calculations all done with hit boxes,

2194
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,040
which don't conform to the geometry of the shape.

2195
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,720
So you're always going to have issues because, like,

2196
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,920
the model itself that you see visually has nothing to do with the collision data at all.

2197
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,120
Right, right.

2198
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,520
And you know, to the clipping issue, I am happy to just give up on clipping,

2199
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,800
as long as the game plays well and is fun and snappy and good.

2200
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,640
It's just that I'm holding them to their own standard here

2201
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,960
of, like, visual acuity and stuff.

2202
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,760
And so, you know, that issue has just gone completely by the wayside.

2203
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,720
I think the problem, user end, is that people judge things

2204
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:58,720
not on how good it looks all the time, but how good it looks occasionally.

2205
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,240
Like, I think that people see a game and if a moment looks good,

2206
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,040
they think the game looks good.

2207
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:09,760
And this, I'll tie this into that JoJo thing that I got in all that

2208
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,000
fucking heat for on Twitter, where I was shitting on JoJo for its character designs.

2209
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,960
And, like, most people are thinking of it as, like,

2210
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,960
but the character designs look great.

2211
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,400
Look, I can show you a picture of the character looking great.

2212
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:26,560
And I'm like, well, that's not what that means in animation terms.

2213
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,280
It means how well does the character animate?

2214
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,160
How good do they look moment to moment throughout the show?

2215
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,880
You know, and so if they look like

2216
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,760
shit in half the shots, then that's not great character design, you know?

2217
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,240
And, you know, and even going one step beyond that, like, this is a video game.

2218
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:48,320
And so, like, we're just comparing Kingdom Hearts 2 versus 3.

2219
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,280
Sure, first of all, I think Kingdom Hearts 2 just has a better art style,

2220
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,920
but nonetheless, Kingdom Hearts 2 character designs look way better.

2221
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:58,720
And I didn't appreciate that until a Gaming Brits video where he showed footage of both.

2222
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,760
Kyrie is so fucking hot in Kingdom Hearts 2.

2223
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,040
Holy shit.

2224
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,160
Yeah, I agree.

2225
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:04,880
I agree.

2226
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,360
And she's not that hot in 3 by comparison.

2227
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,400
Everyone looks worse.

2228
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,080
She too has become El Goblina.

2229
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,280
I mean, La Goblina.

2230
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:20,160
But yeah, there's a good meme of, fuck, it's Shion from Kingdom Hearts 3 versus Kyrie.

2231
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,080
It's what it's like, Waifu versus La Goblina.

2232
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:22,720
It's in my video.

2233
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:23,760
You'll see it, everybody.

2234
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:29,280
But anyway, like, Kingdom Hearts 3, just jumping.

2235
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,320
Just jump, if you want to jump into a glide in Kingdom Hearts 3,

2236
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:37,120
you have to do, like, a jump, wait till you hit the peak, jump again, wait till you hit the peak.

2237
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,240
It feels slow.

2238
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:43,280
And then you can, at the peak of your thing, it automatically gets you into a glide.

2239
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,200
In Kingdom Hearts 2, it's like, circle, circle, square.

2240
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,480
Bam, you're gliding instantly.

2241
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,600
It's fast as fuck.

2242
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,240
It's punchy.

2243
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:48,720
It's great.

2244
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,360
And it's just this fucking realism shit.

2245
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,960
Or it's not even realism.

2246
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,640
You can't double jump in real life.

2247
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,960
Why can't I just do it as fast as Kingdom Hearts 2?

2248
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,440
This sounds like the problem me and Digi were talking about in one of our first

2249
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:07,200
I Am Games videos about realistic versus stylized movement mechanics in games.

2250
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:12,080
And how, like, so many video games chasing realism add, like, anticipation and follow-through

2251
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:16,160
to player interaction, which always slows everything down because you have to wait

2252
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,680
for the realistic animation to play out.

2253
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:26,000
Whereas most games play better with, like, sacrificing the integrity of the animation

2254
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,440
so that it matches your input.

2255
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,760
And a lot of these modern games don't do that.

2256
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,120
Like, Digi was talking about, like, when you're trying to turn a character around,

2257
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,360
they have to, like, step and rotate on their foot.

2258
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,320
Fucking, I'm trying to play through Twilight Princess right now.

2259
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:43,840
And I've literally had several deaths from, like, Link not turning correctly,

2260
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,840
because he gets, like, stuck in his animation and will just walk off a fucking cliff.

2261
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,480
It's like a transition between states and it's silly.

2262
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:54,240
I was just thinking of, when I was watching you play The Witcher 3 the other day,

2263
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,040
there was a moment where, like, you're walking around through all these corpses

2264
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,040
and there was this dog that was in the area.

2265
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,840
And I saw it just, like, glitch and spaz out and, like, change positions really quick.

2266
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:12,240
And I was thinking of, like, The Last of Us, where I can't believe that in people discussing

2267
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:17,520
that game, no one, well, some people have talked about it, but the fact that Ellie will just run

2268
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:23,120
through areas, like, like, randomly and she'll be, like, clipping through objects and running

2269
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,240
around and, like, disappearing and reappearing next to you.

2270
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:29,440
And I'm like, how does this not take anybody out of the experience?

2271
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,680
Like, this looks fucking terrible.

2272
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:38,320
Because, Digi, it's fucking baby girl, my baby girl, my daughter.

2273
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,440
That's all the people need.

2274
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,880
It's like, to me, that means the game looks bad a lot of the time.

2275
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,960
There's one video that was talking about that specific issue in The Last of Us,

2276
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,000
and I specifically remembered them saying, like, they could have just had Ellie or your other

2277
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,600
character wait at the beginning of the encounter, because, like, they're always in a room.

2278
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,600
They're like, but that would just be lazy.

2279
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,000
I'm like, but it would be so much fucking better.

2280
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,840
And you wouldn't have known, like, they can say that, oh, it would be lazy, but that's

2281
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:10,160
only because they've seen this alternative and they don't want to imagine having less.

2282
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,680
Isn't it really lazier, though?

2283
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,000
It seems, because it seems like you can't do anything at all.

2284
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,440
Right, it's not lazier.

2285
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,360
But AI is just going to do what it does and we're not going to bother trying to address this.

2286
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:24,960
This person is thinking of that as reducing the amount of things in game.

2287
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,400
Like, oh, instead of character moves, character doesn't move.

2288
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,960
Ergo, that is less and therefore is lazy.

2289
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,480
But they're not thinking about the fact that if it had been done that way,

2290
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,400
they would not have questioned it.

2291
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,480
It would not have seemed weird at all.

2292
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,520
It would have seemed completely rational in the context of the story.

2293
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:46,160
You could have even had a thing where, like, the character will wait or move based on your input.

2294
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,120
You could call Ellie to follow you and then you'd have to make sure she doesn't get

2295
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,040
fucking one-hitted by these guys as well.

2296
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,480
That would be like a whole other level of gameplay.

2297
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,640
But let's just have a run around.

2298
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,440
I finally remembered.

2299
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,400
There was this game.

2300
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,360
I had a similar problem when we were talking about a game I actually played.

2301
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:08,000
It was one of the, not story of seasons, what it used to be called, Harvest Moon.

2302
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,640
Harvest Moon, I think, a story of two towns or something like that.

2303
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,920
And what really annoyed me was this stupid horse mechanic.

2304
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,080
I think it was in this game, I might be mistaken.

2305
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,200
But I think it was in this game.

2306
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:24,000
You got on the horse and it took a while for the horse to gain momentum.

2307
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,840
And I would just never ride the horse because that's such a very cutesy,

2308
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,200
simple sort of game.

2309
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,280
And why do you add momentum to the horse?

2310
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,880
Just hop on the horse and go.

2311
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,960
The adding the momentum, it makes it hard.

2312
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,680
Because it's such a sort of twitch, I need to only move one block and then stop,

2313
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,800
two blocks and then stop.

2314
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,240
You know, it's not like a vast exploration sort of game.

2315
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:47,360
It's a very contained sort of map.

2316
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,440
So by the time the horse moves, I already need to stop.

2317
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,480
And it was so obnoxious and I just never used the horse.

2318
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,080
It's just about what your priority is when you're making a game.

2319
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,800
If your priority is realism.

2320
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,760
Then stop making your game and throw it at the garbage.

2321
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,080
I don't know why you would do that.

2322
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:06,480
I don't know.

2323
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,560
If there's a fucking, there's a very specific thing you want.

2324
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:18,800
The blue glow I posted of Kingdom Hearts 3 and just like the sheer unbridled horror

2325
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:25,120
when Mickey Mouse came on the screen and I saw what he looks like in this new graphical engine

2326
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,160
that they've concocted out of the nightmares of children.

2327
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:29,840
Yeah, yeah.

2328
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,800
Like he looks like he looks like something killed Mickey Mouse and is now wearing his

2329
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,040
flesh over its animatronic skull.

2330
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:41,360
Like there's like his eyes are like not a part of his body.

2331
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,200
Like it's like a weird mask.

2332
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:48,960
Like the the graphics in Kingdom Hearts 3 have the graphics have become better than

2333
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,680
the art style ever should have allowed for.

2334
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,160
Yes.

2335
01:24:52,160 --> 01:25:00,080
Because now everything looks like smooth and like good and it's perfect and porcelain and creepy.

2336
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:06,240
And mostly Mickey like everyone else like Goofy and Donald look okay and Sora looks fine.

2337
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,720
I mean and you know it really it looks great.

2338
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,680
But Mickey looks like a nightmare from hell.

2339
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,240
I don't like how anybody looks and I don't like him.

2340
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,600
Specifically from hell.

2341
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,560
Specifically from hell.

2342
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,800
Everyone the whole game look okay obviously I got used to the Kingdom Hearts 2 art style.

2343
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:26,640
I've been dealing with it for like 12 years now but you know everyone's so shiny.

2344
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:30,000
They're so fucking shiny and you know what I got over it after a while so I'm not even that

2345
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,600
upset about it but I do think man it's dumb is my point.

2346
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,040
This is the Kingdom Hearts podcast every week.

2347
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,400
No we gotta stop.

2348
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,680
Let's go to voicemails.

2349
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:40,400
We can stop.

2350
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,320
Yeah why don't we get to the fucking voicemails.

2351
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,560
We've been going on and on and on but it's I think I'm ready to transition.

2352
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,720
Anyway else no anything to say.

2353
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,280
Sure.

2354
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:56,400
Yeah oh there is one little thing we have to do before we get to the voicemails.

2355
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,200
You know it you love it and let's hear about it.

2356
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,200
Okay here's a little remix for you guys.

2357
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,040
Not the remix no.

2358
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:08,560
I hate you.

2359
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,080
You have to go back to the original.

2360
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,920
This isn't how I wanted this to play out.

2361
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,560
As you know calling each other gay is the meme way to say it.

2362
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,000
Oh wait that's a long one shit.

2363
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,120
Fuck the pizza party podcast.

2364
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,280
Okay thank you thanks buddy.

2365
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:43,520
So I'm so I just I'm just so you know I'm just so hashtag where's the podcast and I got so

2366
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:51,120
frustrated with it yeah that I that I tweeted you know I tweeted some guy some some random guy

2367
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:56,000
some guy named Nolan I don't know who he is I don't know how I found him you know I was you know

2368
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,400
I was just like I just just shot him a tweet like where's the podcast and it was his birthday so

2369
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:05,600
I threw in a happy birthday message but he was too busy celebrating the day of his birth

2370
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,880
to tell me where's the podcast and I still haven't found it sounds like I think so I think

2371
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:16,640
I think it might be a conspiracy I'm starting to get scared I think that maybe this is more than

2372
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:22,640
just a subpar podcast I think that this might be an existential threat to us and all that we hold

2373
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:32,160
dear and I'm mad and I'm sad and I'm and I'm depressed and I'm and I'm and I'm and I want to

2374
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:36,800
pass that on to you the viewer hashtag where's the podcast well that's good Ben and luckily we've

2375
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,600
got someone I think with a similar story here to back up what you're saying here so let's let's go

2376
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:48,960
over here to a call from pizza party podcast is run by the Clinton Foundation let's see what that

2377
01:27:48,960 --> 01:28:00,800
might be about here we go we can only imagine pizza party podcast are they kidding us um excuse me

2378
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:08,560
have you heard of Hillary Clinton yeah I've heard of pizza gate comment pizza cheese pizza

2379
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:15,600
child pizza milk party spirit rituals they're rubbing it in our faces people they can't keep

2380
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,840
getting away with this

2381
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:31,360
pizza okay that's enough we can get that right there I think uh we get the idea all right well

2382
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:36,640
what do we do well what do we do with this with this I guess we call up Alex Jones until we've

2384
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:45,280
got a fucking bomb we're sitting on a landmine we've got a new attack vector that we can use

2385
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:51,280
in alliance with the mainstream media to do something I don't know yeah I'm sure we can do

2386
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:57,520
something I'm sure we've got a hashtag do something yeah hashtag do something somebody please hashtag

2387

that quote on quote Ben ben saint and quote unquote best guy ever are actually related

2403
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:04,640
in any capacity I've seen no blood tests um that's true they seem to be completely opposed

2404
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:10,720
politically we don't have our citizenship papers I really just don't document it and all the back

2405
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,440
stories I've heard about the childhood you know they don't really sync up for me they don't they

2406
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:23,120
don't really add up in my head I'm like hmm oh really huh you know they all sound kind of made up

2407
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:32,400
sort of uh sort of fictionalized like um you know pre-planned yeah I don't know maybe it's just

2408
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:38,880
me what I think that the whole the whole t-bap thing yeah get to the thing it was it was just a play

2409
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:44,000
it was just a ploy like how the white stripes pretended to be siblings when they were actually

2410
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,520
married is that true basically what I'm suggesting is that perhaps ben saint and best guy are are

2411
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:58,800
actually um married married that could be it okay I don't know what's up yeah yeah that makes sense

2412
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:07,200
well uh boy well now I mean I don't know can I even prove it can I even prove it to myself no

2413
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:13,760
I don't think so okay well there you go that's it uh I don't know anything anymore untruth debunked

2414
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:20,080
okay I have to say speaking as speaking as the person who was the best man at your wedding I think

2415
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:28,640
he stole a shit I don't think there's any grounds to see it uh indeed let's move on here we got uh

2416
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:37,120
giga dong mcfrank oh wait sorry mega giga dong mcfrank okay thank you I want to be culturally

2417
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:44,800
respective go hey guys sorry if I sound a little weird I've been sick lately and also can't find my

2418
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:50,720
blue yeti anywhere I need help because I recently met this girl and she's totally hot and she's into

2419
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:56,160
me but we don't have the same interests and hobbies like she kind of likes anime I guess but what should

2420
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:01,760
I do if I want to play video games with her and it turns out she sucks at them I'm 21 years old and

2421
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:09,200
I am not a goddamn zoomer I hate cell phones I hate gen 4 pokemon and I fucking hate fortnite

2422
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:16,000
thank you for your educated response um you don't have to have the same interests in her to have sex

2423
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:22,080
with her or hang out and see if like I mean just date her and if she turns out to be boring then

2424
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:28,000
break up yeah right that's fair so wait his his quest he's worried that she's gonna be too much of a

2425
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,560
zoomer is that one I think that's definitely a valid concern I think he was saying she might

2426
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:38,400
be too much of a normie for him like he likes he's into anime and video games and she's not

2427
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:44,160
but like whether or not that becomes a problem will become apparent so just go for it that doesn't

2428
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:50,880
work man uh anime and video games will be there forever but you know if if you if if she's the

2429
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:57,600
one that got away then she won't be so uh put your childish bullshit to the side and

2430
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:06,880
get some puss agreed I just no just fucking stay home forget about it if you don't get some puss

2431
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:15,520
you're gonna be a puss every man has a push okay don't worry about it just be a puss ben saint

2432
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:23,920
I'll I'll stand by that uh okay next up science man is calling in no doubt to educate us all

2433
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:30,080
commence question how to get on the pcp voicemail

2434
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:40,000
hypothesis say some weird relatable question then play the piano execution

2435
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:47,120
have you ever tried to uh fuck your hamster but then your penis is too small

2436
01:34:54,640 --> 01:35:03,840
is that toho music no it's no game no life opening game well done well done

2437
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:09,040
well yeah I mean well he proved it I don't think he's actually playing piano I think he's just

2438
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:14,400
playing the song no that's probably true he had you hear that like couple of seconds he stumbled

2439
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:21,120
and fumbled to get his way over to the button all right disconnect good job playing or not I don't

2440
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:27,200
know definitely not it's hard to trust people I know that song very well it's definitely just the

2441
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:33,040
song okay fair enough uh I will say though that though the whole uh question into piano thing

2442
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:37,600
while cool is not enough to necessarily get you over the bar because there have been some that

2443
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,680
have been skipped when there were too many of them or they just weren't interesting enough

2444
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:46,800
few questions couldn't be improved with a little bit of piano I have to agree with that I have to

2445
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:51,360
background music goes a long way on any of these questions yeah production values

2467
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:35,760
the way there really I have a dead x minecraft youtube channel which I'm going to start back

2468
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,080
up again rebrand it I'm not going to say what I'm doing I'm not going to fucking give it away

2469
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:44,240
because I don't want anyone to fucking steal my idea but I am stealing your format and your sense

2470
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:51,520
of humor just a heads up also a little bit of max mofos uh fucking door kicking in shit

2471
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:56,480
from max mofo pokemon I'm gonna rip that off too okay uh just letting you know there's nothing

2472
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:01,280
you could do about it because you cannot copyright a sense of humor so uh fuck you

2473
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:07,040
you and uh yeah I'm gonna surpass you you know I respect this guy he's got he's got a plan yeah

2474
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:11,280
me too he's got like he's got an actionable plan later I couldn't tell if he said that Nate was

2475
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:17,760
retired or retired I think he said he retired pretty sure he said retired but he went on to

2476
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:24,000
say that yeah I'm I'm I'm washed up I'm all done I've got nothing left to give and you know maybe

2477
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:31,440
that's true you're forced into early retirement by this way uh you know I would just say I think

2478
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:35,520
there are better formats than we agua I would recommend doing one of those instead because

2479
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,920
you probably just do better but hey if it works for you I say go for it although if you call it

2480
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:45,360
we add trap I will you you've been doing we are with all this time so that your enemies will think

2481
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:52,080
it's a good idea and trap themselves into doing it that's true oh god I'm finally gonna pay off

2502
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:12,160
and and that's all there is to say about it I guess look at these texts I found I found uh

01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:18,720
yeah I found the texts from last night when I was drunk that I uh sent to my significant other uh-huh

2504
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:24,560
oh boy and it's just like and and there's no response until the very end so it's just like a

2505
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:36,880
wall of outgoing texts and it starts with 7 15 p.m. hell yeah I'll do a good start yeah

2506
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:48,320
7 20 p.m. hell yeah 7 25 p.m. hell yeah 7 35 p.m. hell yeah

2512
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:50,960
I just love looking at this wall of texts and how perfectly timed it is 7 15 7 20 7 25 7 35

2513
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,120
7 40 I think I was doing it on purpose like I think in my brain I was doing a bit

2514
01:43:55,680 --> 01:44:01,440
but nobody was on to it except me this one person got to witness the bit and I guess you as well

2515
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:07,360
as your own most important critic and now everyone knows about it so thank god the world is aware

2516
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,520
by the way look what mage drew in the show notes during the course of this podcast pretty spooky

2517
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:19,040
pretty scary hold on where am I looking you're watching you're drawing a lot of spooky scary

2518
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:27,120
shit these days yeah yeah traditional art is it's really good for a spooky art for me I guess

2519
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:31,760
well that's interesting it's really fun you have such a dichotomy of style cool

2520
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:39,280
it's like a slightly more anime version of like a uh scary stories to tell in the dark

2521
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:43,520
kind of creature yeah you know you know what I mean I was thinking more like Todd McFarland

2522
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:50,400
hmm I was thinking more like Seth McFarland and Lois I don't even work at Burger King

2523
