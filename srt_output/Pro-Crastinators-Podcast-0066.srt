00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Can you believe all the money we're making from these ridiculous pony videos?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,700
Stocks, bonds, drugs, blood diamonds, nothing's made dividends like this before.

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,500
I am the best guy ever and also here's Hippocrit.

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Cash money and such.

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
And that's it. We're the only guys here, that's it.

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
So let's move ahead here.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, that's the party fucker to the party cash.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
IT'S ME!

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, what do you know?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
PURSING IN THROUGH THE SEALING!

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I was parachuting and I just figured I should get out now before the instructor got too mad at me.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And here I am.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well alright, just in time.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why was he getting mad at you?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I figured if I waited too long he'd be like, why aren't you jumping out so I better go early so he wouldn't get mad.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What was that voice that I heard from under the door that we locked to keep him out?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, it's Ben St.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hey, let me just roll on in here and say that I'll probably be leaving a little early because Nate's technical issues have forced a scheduling conflict.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Because around 7 today I'm going to be over fucking streaming video games streaming you, me, Nicky on twitch.tv.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So if you're in the future, go back to watch me.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, I'll join stream.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, you should all join the stream by the way.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh hey guys.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Sorry I'm late, my dad was taking me in the city to see a marching band.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He said son, when you grow up would you be the leader of the broken.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's beaten in the damn, he said will you defeat them, your demons and all the non-believers, the plans that they have made because one day I'll leave you a phantom to lead you in the summer to join the black raid.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And that's why he appeared, he tellturnism is bad.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Busted, Nate, busted.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I just, I just, I don't associate that song with anything except Gern Lagen.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Is that, I mean-

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I associate that with the freshman year of high school.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Munchy, have you not seen this girl, I gotta link it to you, it's like the greatest thing ever made.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's just, it so perfectly fits with the, with like the Simone common relationship.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, let's move on.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The Simone.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Can we, can we-

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
From Moana.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Can we have a peek behind the curtain real quick and say this is not the first PCP episode we've recorded today?

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Very true, everybody.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I had technical issues, my computer died.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We recorded a grand episode about Nate's weird utilitarian principles.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So grand.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, it was actually really great and when we're all real fucking bummed that it's lost forever and no one will ever hear it.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I, I, I object to even mentioning it because then we might not make it in the future, but we'll try again.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm gonna upload my audio and I'm gonna let the audience try to piece together.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Really?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Piece together what was going on.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why would you all upload our audio separately?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I made some really great points.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, everyone upload their separately on their channels.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a good idea.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll try to recover mine too and upload mine separately.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Nate, don't even try to recover it because I-

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It'll be like an ARG.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Whoa, that's a good idea.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But we spoiled it for everybody.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, well too bad.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Maybe within the week until this goes live, people will be wondering what the fuck these audio's are.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Excellent.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, everybody, but we're not talking about that today.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Instead we're gonna talk about money.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Insert cash register sound effect.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is that, is that ruffling?

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What's that?

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is that the ruffling of the cash?

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, what's that ruffling of the cash?

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yep, that's, that was my money.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's Ben rubbing all the IOU's together that he has.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,120
Ben who Ben who hates

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,000
Dollars and loves coins would never

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,720
Yeah, yeah, I wish I just had a big sack of like weird like ring coins and just things all the time to carry

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,080
I never want to see you fail as long as I live

76
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,040
That is it does make more impressive sounds that you do things with it like that. Yeah, there we go

77
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,120
Oh, yeah, it's like a pirate sound you put a sack of gold on the table

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,280
Parts knew what was up. They were smart. So okay, here we go. So here's the the Urban Dictionary definition of money everybody

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:21,120
Okay, money that which allows lazy people to do stupid things without painful consequences thus keeping them forever stupid

80
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,640
Here's the example. It's not the love of money. That is the root of all evil, but rather the lack of it

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,080
It's not wrong to have money. It's wrong for money to have you

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,280
Hey money is the root of all evil is a misquote and I can't remember what the actual quote is

83
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,760
But I know it's love of all money is the root of all it makes sense said Jesus to me right now

84
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
Yeah, money is I like it

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,120
So as you can guess we did not have much time to think about this ahead of time. So let's just jump into it

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,840
Let's talk about my accounts. I have a big bank account. Go go fund my bank account

87
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,520
Here's my account info paid for the PCP last month. Let's see. Yeah

88
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Share our detailed financials. That's what this episode. Yeah, I got one hundred seventy five dollars

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,720
Link in the description to our bank account, which you can feel free to just have at withdraw from what's your favorite?

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
password the ease for your bank

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Top ten my bank password

92
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,800
My top ten account passwords and that's a good one. That's a good video. I should do that before I die

93
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,720
That's actually a great idea. Okay, so let's talk. So is money the root of all evil? No, it's great

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,600
I hate money money

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,680
Causes me more stress than anything else in my whole life. I don't know whatever I hear anybody be like guys

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,080
Wouldn't it be great if we eliminated money? I just think you're an idiot. You don't know share life

97
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:56,040
The fact that I that I need money is what causes me the stress not the fact that it exists. Okay, okay?

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,880
Yeah, I feel that way

99
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,720
I would like I would like a nice comfortable sort of amount of money where I'm like well

100
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm not gonna die tomorrow. So that's good

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,680
I'm you know me and me and DeVoo talked about this a bunch when I was living at Digi house when both of us were living at Digi house

102
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,760
DeVoo would sometimes get on this tub subject of a what's like universal minimum income

103
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,200
We're like just basic income. Yeah universal basic income where everyone it's just like, you know like like

104
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,440
Social programs are are less social programs are cut

105
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,640
But just everyone gets like you know a small but livable income maybe like

106
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
$20,000 something a year and

107
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,480
Like you if you make up for it else and like God, I wish that was the world we lived in no

108
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
I don't know

109
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,560
Set he'd be perfect. That'd be a big race

110
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,920
I wouldn't have to worry about anything I could just do my art and be happy a lot of the time

111
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,120
I think of like like people who are on hard times

112
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,640
But they never seem to be like suddenly homeless like actually completely homeless with no money and no way to make any

113
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
I know I like about Ben though

114
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,120
It's just I like that Ben is a Ben is realistic and is willing to downscale his life

115
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,800
With you know like having made less money

116
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,600
What I what I hate is what or what I think is is wrong or silly of people to do is to like expect

117
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,840
Everything and then also like not realize that like oh well

118
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,600
I'm not generating enough value to deserve these things like Ben is willing to eat trash and live

119
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,240
You know on the streets. Yeah, it's like I only make zero dollars. This is what I prefer it

120
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,720
Yeah, exactly, you know that's like he's he's correctly scaling his expectations to reality, which is good

121
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
I think so I like to think so

122
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,960
It seems that way anyway, I think poor people, you know, I I think poor people should be eliminated

123
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,760
Because here's what poor people do they will walk into a

124
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
I didn't

125
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,360
Even able to make half my point now. I can't remember what it was. I'm just really mad

126
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
You just

127
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Something about like homeless I don't know if you suddenly if you suddenly if there are people on the on the on the on the streets

128
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,480
And I've been like there for years suddenly giving them a paycheck. I don't know what they would do with it

129
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,880
Oh, so you're saying that like even if we gave, you know, even if even if suddenly there was a there was a not

130
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
There was like a livable wage for everybody

131
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,120
I don't know whether that much would change like people would no not a bit more not that much

132
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah, but it would just but I just wanted to be good for people like me

133
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,800
So that's why I want like I don't care about anything else. Obviously. I mean, I know Tavu has some weird like

134
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,960
Things that are like that. I mean, I only say weird because I don't understand them

135
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,680
I don't know if they're actually like incorrect or not

136
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,560
But like he's got some justification for universal basic income based on like it would free up people to work on the things

137
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
They really want to do

138
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,680
Because that's what it would do to me. Yeah, I mean, you know, it makes sense

139
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,240
But the only thing is

140
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,800
Like so universal basic income definitely makes sense in a situation just where there's like mass unemployment due to like

141
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,480
Technological evolution or whatever. It's just you know, like we don't need like a thousand billion McDonald's employees anymore

142
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,560
We've got robots. They they've got it under control. So like that's you know

143
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
And that puts like a million people out of work or whatever

144
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,280
But but like up until that point where like things are covered by robots

145
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,000
If you give people universal basic income like there's not going to be value generated

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,320
So it's like the society will suffer and could get weighed down by that shit. It's like there needs to be

147
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,560
Is they were already spending like a million fucking dollars on like, you know, I don't know a stuff

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,160
Stuff that the government does that like that like this would be like this would be paid for by cutting those other programs

149
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
You know what I like about this though

150
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,200
This puts the responsibility on people to manage their shit properly and then I don't have to feel bad for them anymore

151
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,360
Yeah, you know, I feel like it should at least be something you have to sign up for like just fill in some paperwork

152
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,840
If you can't read if you can't write

153
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,400
No school. No, no, wait wait

154
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,400
Here's what it is. Here's what it is

155
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,240
If you can't read or write you get free school until you can and then from there

156
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,200
Okay, you get you get like a little bit of money and then you can just you're supposed to like you'd be incentivized to do stuff

157
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,640
You go to because like okay, if you get money some people some people will definitely just live and do nothing forever

158
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,640
What if you're just retarded though like literally you're actually mentally challenged about those people?

159
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,040
Well, you get some of that money and you spend it on

160
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,840
Yeah, but they won't know how to do any of that shit. They'll need they'll need care

161
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,800
Guys, let me clear this up with what I think is a far more intelligent solution instead of just giving people

162
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,680
$20,000 a year retarded because the thing about money is you can buy whatever the fuck you want with that

163
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,240
If we're gonna give people handouts, it should be a universal housing and universal like food and water

164
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,760
Don't give them just straight up money so they can go buy fucking anime books and I'll say I disagree with that

165
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
I disagree then you're fucking retarded

166
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,440
No, I want I'd be fine with just being housing and food allowances

167
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,440
I I want those people to die who can't who can't make that shit happen

168
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,680
I want them to die and be and remove themselves from the gene pool

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,880
Why yeah, why is that crazy why?

170
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
What category of people are you right?

171
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,440
These people who squander their universe. Yeah, sorry

172
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,760
I was trying to explain what you were going, but you've seen it says fine

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,800
Yeah, I was just saying people who cannot manage their life

174
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:47,160
They're like 30 grand basic minimum income with the ability to go out and earn more if they want to those people if they can't handle that

175
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,600
They should die. I mean I agree that everybody who gets a gender studies degree should die

176
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,560
But I don't I think that's a little too extreme though. No, see here's the thing

177
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,960
I don't like about universal basic income. What like we've kind of structured society in a way that everybody just gets to live

178
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,720
Like we will take care of everybody. I don't like that. Some people should die

179
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,200
Some people should be weeded out fucking crazy. No, but they're weeded out by their own decision-making

180
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,400
No, they're not like we're killing them. No, they fucking aren't there

181
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,600
Well, they're weeded out because they because they don't have a family support network or because they just happen to get sick

182
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,280
Or because they're mentally ill things like that. Well, free will isn't real either. So, you know, none of this

183
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
We have control

184
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Totally

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,840
This is why we needed that podcast because it's just gonna keep coming up

186
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,460
Of course. Do you want to actually go back now? I think the mood is set again. We have to go back

187
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Here's my thing about money

188
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,200
I

189
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
like coins

190
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
And I'm with you so far

191
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Did any of you as kids have like a big thing of pennies? Did you just have a load of pennies?

192
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Sure

193
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,480
Yeah, they have pennies. Yeah, oh, it's called the same thing. It is called the same thing

194
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,960
You have sense we have pennies and everything is also called pennies. It's just like five pennies five pennies

195
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Is Abraham Lincoln your pennies too?

196
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,280
No, it's the Queen the Queen's all about money. Is a pens the same thing as a penny?

197
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
One pence one penny. Yeah

198
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,040
But you call it sense you just change the P to a C

199
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,200
Yeah, you know what they say in for a penny in for a pence. That's the expression

200
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
All right, I wasn't gonna talk about not know this

201
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,640
All right now I like I like I forgot what I was gonna say, but I like coins

202
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
I'll just go back to that that classic

203
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,720
That's that classic tried-and-true tested debate topic. I love coins. Uh, they're good

204
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,640
I like oh, yeah, the pennies thing

205
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,600
Did any of you have like like I had like a treasure chest full of pennies and I and I

206
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,480
Cashed it into the bank one day and it wasn't even that much and I really I really I really am upset

207
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,320
Treasure chest it was a little little wooden treasure chest with a lock and I had a padlock and it was just full of pennies

208
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,000
And it just felt so dude. You know I felt so wealthy. I did yeah

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,040
I felt so wealthy having that chest, but my parents told me you know

210
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,960
That's worth money and you can have it and I'm like whoa

211
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,080
So I did and it was like I don't know a couple a couple quid a couple pounds like not even five pounds

212
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,200
Maybe and now I'm sad that I don't have a pirate chest

213
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,120
I do have a related question for everybody if we want to go around the horn based off what hippo just said

214
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,600
And hopefully this is relevant for most of you if you got like for your birthday you get money

215
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,880
Like at the edge of like 10 to 12. What did you spend that money on?

216
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,160
Saved in one time. I went to I went to a hallmark and I spent literally

217
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
$100 on webcams

218
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,160
Just webcams. What are those a webkin you mother fuck is that a stone?

219
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Webkins are

220
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
All right

221
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Here I'm gonna red pillion webkins

222
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
All right, please

223
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,280
You would be a little lad a little boy or a girl or maybe even both and you would walk into it

224
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,000
You would walk into a store and there you would see them the webkin and he would

225
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,760
And they would smile upon you gleefully and with it with the with the tint in their eyes where you know

226
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,200
They mean fucking business basically there's these they're there these little like stuffed animals

227
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:52,920
And they look fucked up and like fucking like battered like like crazy housewives fucking Los Angeles and and they like

228
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,480
They're all like tie-dyed and shit

229
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,600
They're like mystical and magical and frivolous and you would buy these you would buy them and and and there'd be like like

230
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,440
Like fucking like 15 or $20 like like a lot for like a teddy bear or something or like a cat

231
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,640
And then you would buy them and then they would have a special code and you would go online to webkins

232
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
www.webkins.gov and

233
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,320
And you would enter in the this is a government program. Yeah, you would enter in webkins would be cut to pay for a universal

234
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
No, we have to abandon that

235
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,080
Yeah, that motherfucker that guy and he would get him and he would put the code in and then he would be like hello

236
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,320
I'm alive inside the computer. I will I will transmit my code into your soul now

237
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,400
And and impressive it's like a soul augmentation program, right? Okay, is it is it like beanie babies for the modern age?

238
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,440
Is that yes? Yeah, and you like put them in rooms and you could like make their rooms look cool

239
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,160
And you could like it was like Animal Crossing

240
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,000
But you had to like get like a fucking like thing in real life. So they're kind of like amiibo

241
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,280
So yeah, yeah trainer amiibo, and yeah

242
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,160
They live inside of a virtual world and you can like see them growing you can play games with them

243
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,320
I would always play this one game where it was like I would go into the fucking like King Solomon's minds

244
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,120
And I would like work my little baby hands until I would fucking cried myself

245
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,560
All over your web was doing slave labor. Yeah, yeah, exactly and I liked it. I liked it like that. I liked being a slave

246
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,120
I was a slave to my own desires, and you know what it worked down the end like what's that?

247
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,080
There was like like that that minigame

248
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,600
It was like an old like asshole like southern like fucking like a big it like fucking confederate sold your dog there

249
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,160
It was like working my minds and maybe you'll fucking not be a slave one day

250
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,400
Wow, and and I did it ever feels like

251
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Yeah, that's what it means to be a slave

252
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,200
And then I always work and I was trying to get like fucking like like heart scales basically I can never get any

253
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,920
I only got like fucking like shoes and like fucking like three dollars, and it was well wait you made money

254
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,240
There's a return on investment here. No, well first of all money like super much like webkins money, okay?

255
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
So like Bitcoin

256
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,680
I got I got payment and dogecoin

257
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,160
That's worth 20 times Bitcoin as I understand like when you win the sled game on Club Penguin. Yeah, exactly

258
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,640
Yeah, yeah, and a base. Yeah, it's like web. It's like Club Penguin, but like better because it's webkins

259
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,240
And like it's I know a certain hippo who would probably argue against you on that one sucker

260
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
I don't know whether hippo's played

261
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,000
Fiona the hippo world's famous hippo yesterday at the Cincinnati Zoo. Oh, yeah

262
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,120
It was cool. She was a little rambunctious dude. She was hanging out with her mom and papa

263
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,720
That's nothing to do with what we're talking about. Yeah, but then again now that is webkins, so

264
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Let's

265
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
What did you waste your money on?

266
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,880
Right without question. It was always video games every single time I would buy mostly like I could afford

267
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,320
I would spend my money on like GBA games because they were generally cheap

268
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,400
Yeah, like every every birthday or like Christmas. I could usually cash in for exactly one video game no matter what it cost

269
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,600
I mean, they were generally like 60 bucks, but nonetheless, I would use my money

270
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,840
Really that much back then. They're like 40 bucks shit 40 bucks

271
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:17,160
Yeah, you know, but I would scrape together my money and I would buy fucking Mario and Luigi Superstar saga the greatest game ever made or

272
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,800
Fuck what else? I don't know Castlevania. I would always buy the new Castlevania's on GBA. It was the greatest games of all time

273
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,600
Shit like that. So it was always video games. So that's my answer. That's a complete long and short of it

274
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
I

275
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Shout out to Castlevania circle of the moon

276
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,680
I would um always save any money I got from birthdays because I

277
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,320
Ever since ever since my parents said oh, we can't afford that at anything

278
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,680
I was like wait, you can't you can't get this thing that I would like you to get for me

279
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,200
And then it was disturbing and then I learned that things can cost a hundred pounds

280
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,160
And I was like no no one is ever gonna spend any of this money. I'm getting I have to keep all of it

281
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,000
So I just kept putting it in my bank account and I have thousands upon thousands

282
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,400
Well, not that many but like what was your what was your goal with this just to have it to save it

283
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,920
I mean as a kid. I just thought well my parents buy things for me

284
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,520
Anyway, so if I get money from my other relatives, I don't need to spend it

285
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,720
I just need to you know, just sort of sort of wait wait around and then parents

286
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,520
So your answer to what did I buy as a kid is I didn't buy I didn't buy anything. I just got shit

287
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,360
I'm I'm a I'm a I was a clever Jew as I wish I was as smart as hippo because regretfully

288
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,120
I spent all of my childhood money buying yugioh tins

289
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Which were never worth it

290
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,200
And now every single card I own is worthless and I I couldn't sell it if I found the biggest fan of the world

291
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,480
It it was the worst investment a young boy could ever make

292
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,960
Oh my god about magic dude should have invested in magic the gathering that would have paid I bought I bought magic the gathering

293
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,560
I just remembered like the most wasteful thing that I spent my money on I did I did spend some money on it

294
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,880
But mostly it was something that I would use my like, you know Christmas and birthday gifts

295
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,560
Like like credits as or such as they are for

296
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,240
Um fucking fucking dungeons and dragons

297
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,680
Uh like splat books and rule books. I always wanted more of them. I ate that shit up

298
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,480
Um god, it's embarrassing. Cool. Huh. Do you still have them?

299
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,080
Yeah, there's a huge fucking pile of them in my parents house

300
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,040
Some of those were e fucking sensual the manual of the planes is a is a wonderful book just to read

301
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,400
Some of them are just fun to read like some like they have rules in them

302
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,360
And it's like that's fine

303
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,640
But some of them are just like lore and it like goes into like each one of the each one of the planes and like talks about

304
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,040
What monsters and what gods live there? There's a lot of creativity there and I really think those are fun as fuck

305
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Some of them

306
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,640
I want to get into but I don't know how and I don't know how to

307
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,160
To get into dungeons and dragons. Well, here's the free get all those rule books like the free on the

308
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,360
Disclaimer disclaimer. Don't get into dungeons and dragons. It's actually a shit game that sucks

309
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,480
Um, yeah, and like any any any any any suggestion to the contrary is the product of memes and stock homes

310
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,600
It's what I mean by that is that I I would like to be able to say

311
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,040
You know, I kind of get what the whole lore of dungeons and dragons is if there is like a consistent law

312
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,440
I know there are like different books. Well, there's a saying this is this is this is like the book of this

313
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,160
And then another book will reference that book a bit so they're sort of connected, but not really

314
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,760
There are a few there are a few like worlds that like certain books are specifically made for and or in

315
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,680
but like

316
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,520
I mean

317
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,040
They all conflict with each other

318
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,680
I feel like if I want to be get it be good at world building. I might have to read a few of those

319
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Forgive me if I wrong. Yes

320
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,600
A dungeon and dragons to like make your own story. It's like you make your own thing

321
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,920
Oh people need not always need a bit of guidance

322
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,960
I guess is the point and some people just want to buy these like pre-made stories and just play along with them

323
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,880
Like remember that one about that that drow elf guy drizz it or whatever who was so popular

324
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,800
Yeah, I know people would just buy lore books to read. I always wanted I always wanted

325
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:16,600
Like to be in a game like like a professionally made campaign like a professionally made adventure with like

326
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,280
Because like the professionally made ones are better like they're just better

327
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,760
But nobody wants to buy them because someone wants to DM and people want to tell their own shitty stories around your fucking

328
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
a basement dining room table

329
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,160
and

330
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,520
like

331
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
I feel like I missed out because

332
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,040
Like one time I played a pre-made adventure that like came in a box and I was like this thing is so robust

333
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,840
There's like there's just so much more to do like it's so much more engaging than just the shitty nothing

334
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,120
Whatever that my that my jerk-off friend here has has prepared for my enjoyment. Fuck that guy. Say my name. Say my name

335
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,200
Munchy munchy. It's me. I DM you already said webkins

336
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,440
Uh, no, no, no, I'm telling Ben to name that guy by name so we can make one of them

337
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,840
All of them. Oh, yes, just like everyone. It's just everyone. Just nobody makes good d&d campaign

338
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,320
I nobody makes them. I didn't even know there was

339
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,680
Like lore to dragons dragons. I thought I was just like a rule dragons and dragons. Yeah

340
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,680
Well, that's what we're talking about, right?

341
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,920
Some dungeons and dragons you clawed you colossal weight some of the books describe like a specific setting

342
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,680
But not but like you don't have to play it in that setting if you don't want to

343
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,880
Yeah, I thought I didn't I thought it was just like a rule set for like anything

344
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
I thought I thought the mother

345
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,760
There's a whole pantheon of gods and shit and like

346
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
The way spoonie

347
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,160
Explained it in his uh series about dungeons and dragons makes it seem like it's really cool. Well, he's wrong

348
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
I promise you he's wrong

349
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,200
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm sure it's it's not cool, but it's like cool to have a story to say and then this happened

350
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,000
Although I kind of want to go watch those that video now

351
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,520
Uh, all right, let's move on to the next one. No, no, no, no, just really just really just really just really quick

352
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,040
Wait, all right, what is it? I I wanted I want to be in a spur

353
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,760
Dungeons and dragons thing. Oh god only only I got to never

354
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,160
My dammit, Nate

355
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,640
I yeah, I was thinking about spurred the other day and I was thinking I am such a genius

356
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,760
That was good. Remember how like early on some of the like role playing sessions

357
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:31,240
We did over text to simulate uh pester logs. Yep. Yeah, I am the greatest. Yeah, those are great

358
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,320
If we ever

359
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,000
And the pcp of course is the thing we have to do that. I will force you to do it

360
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,760
Then I will not you will not have to say in it. You know what? Yeah, I'm not gonna say that I would never do

361
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Like a spur with the pcp

362
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,840
I would if I could find an excuse to do it

363
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,280
So yeah, I mean that one's was actually fun because we didn't give a fuck about although. No, wait. D&D actually has

364
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,920
Yeah, well, I mean there's already horse stuck

365
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:03,880
Well, yeah, but I don't get to play as my guy. Yeah, horse stuck is just Gibbs thing basically, you know

366
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,560
Well, no, no

367
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,840
I could like have a bit where you I I could have like a like a you skip ahead and then there's like a big area

368
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,880
Where you could have a gorgeous. Let's talk about this another time

369
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,640
I don't care about money. This is way more fun. Well, this is not the time to discuss the details. I have possible future work

370
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,000
Yes, it is

371
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I can't think of a better time a tangentially related topic of money that we were talking about

372
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:34,680
We're talking about, you know, things we spent birthday money on what about the biggest waste of money of all time that we have spent

373
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Sure

374
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,240
I've got a great answer for this and I think about it all the time and how much I regret it

375
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,560
I spent 100 american dollars as a little baby boy

376
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,600
At king Richard's fair at this giant floppy black leather match

377
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:57,080
Because I want it to look like vampire hunter d more than anything. I remember that hat. I remember I still have this hat

378
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:06,120
It's dusty as fuck. It's huge. It's even better. Hilarious listeners. Let me just personally assure you is even better than than you are imagining

379
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,240
It's amazing. It's I'll do a vampire to d cosplay someday and use it just to justify the purchase

380
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,640
Uh at king Richard's fair, which by the way king Richard's fair is like a renaissance fair thing that they have near us

381
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
It's pretty it's pretty cool

382
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,720
they uh

383
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,960
I spent 90 dollars on a on a like on like a

384
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,720
Smith uh metal flanged mace, which I named which I named leopold

385
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,840
Uh and and leopold is I guess probably sitting in my in the closet of our parents house right now

386
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,600
Haven't seen him in a while, but he's my faithful companion and if I in a time someday in a time of need

387
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,080
I'll have him around that I do not regret at all

388
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,000
Well then why'd you bring it out? We're talking about because I just wanted to talk about leopold

389
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
I guess it is regressed because this is a waste of money

390
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,280
Uh the the thing that I've wasted the most money is and the things that I regret the most are all the things that I've lost

391
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Because I don't have them anymore

392
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,080
I've lost so many fucking things. I'm a clumsy adult and I don't know where any shit is

393
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,960
I just found my original ds the other day after like fucking like eight years of not having it

394
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,720
And it's like all like broken and shit and I love it, but I hadn't I and I don't have my fucking original 3ds

395
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,000
I think that one broke though. There's just so much shit. I don't have that. I just lost somehow

396
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:30,280
I don't know how I hate so much the the the like the fear of of an electronic device

397
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,800
Like like oh if I like a like a ds or a gameboy advance like if I bring it into the bathroom

398
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,040
What if I drop it in the toilet? It'll be ruined

399
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
I can I can I have to put it on my bed

400
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:47,480
And I and I have to walk, you know, and then I play my switch while I poop now every time and it is the greatest experience

401
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,960
It's too dangerous. It's so wonderful. I I'm never going back. My switch is my favorite thing in the world

402
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,960
It was worth every single cent every other console is garbage consoles are shit handhelds are the future

403
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,160
I mean, yes. Yes. Handhelds are far better than consoles. I hate consoles. I hate computers

404
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,880
I only like handheld gaming devices that that is

405
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Do you remember okay? Do you remember what happened to your copy of like zelda for swords or something?

406
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,880
Yeah, what what you did with it, right? Well the tragedy that ensued. Yeah. Yeah. I know it was an accident

407
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,360
It was on some trip. It was on some trip like either to or from college

408
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,200
I was I was catching my train in in pen station in new york

409
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,440
And I the train was there it was like leaving and I was I had all my bags

410
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,720
And I was like running to jump on this train before the doors closed

411
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:39,240
And just as luck would fucking have it my fucking ds just bounced

412
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,320
Out of my bag and just like hit the ground and skidded and just fell off the edge of the platform

413
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,280
And just landed under the train and I was standing there looking down over the ledge through the gap

414
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,360
And I could see it there. Maybe like 10 feet away from me eight feet away from me

415
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
I was just sitting there and I just looked around like

416
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,000
well

417
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
I better get on the train

418
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,520
And then I got on the train and sat down. I was like my fucking ds with nate's game in it is like is like

419
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,760
Eight feet below me like down through the floor of this train. It is sitting there right now and I can't get it

420
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,760
Yeah, you know what though ben?

421
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,280
I I feel content knowing that the little mole people who man the trains who do the repairs at night

422
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:26,600
They creep out from the woodworks one of their little children probably obtained that ds and and enjoyed it to his heart's content

423
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,160
But no charger. It probably died in three hours

424
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,600
Well, it was the best three hours of that little mole's life

425
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,120
But but uh, but moles are blind so they wouldn't have been able to see it. Yeah

426
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,720
Oh, he could he could play through through psycho kinesis

427
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,240
Nate your story has more holes than hillary clinton's email story

428
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,160
Well, what about donald trump jr. He's done nothing wrong. He's he's oh, yeah, he's done nothing wrong

429
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,440
He's a good name one thing that trumps have done wrong. Hey, they have money. Can we talk about trumps money?

430
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,320
Uh, sure. What's there to say about tv show and the theme song was money money money money?

431
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:07,080
No, no, no, no, no, no that is that is trump wait that wasn't no, that's uh, uh, uh, that's that is vince mcman's son

432
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,400
That is his wwe song when he comes out. That's the song of the apprentice as well

433
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,000
Really? Oh, I guess they're repurposed it. Well, that's cool. Repurposed it

434
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,360
It's not like the song wasn't invented for wrestling. That's incorrect. It was invented for the song's been around forever

435
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,920
Is that true? Yes. Okay. All right. Jesse once told me like that's his theme song

436
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,960
And I know songs do get written for specific wrestlers

437
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,040
Well, probably I've been correct here. Maybe I've made a mistake. I don't think so. Okay, whatever

438
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,200
In any case, fine. Cool. Good. Was that the apprentice theme song? Was that the idea? Yeah? Yeah

439
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,640
Okay, I regret losing the most is my courage my pride and all of my wisdom

440
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
When he joined the piece, yeah

441
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
All of my wisdom

442
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,960
It's when you joined you you joined having all your wisdom

443
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:00,680
It is through the process of joining that you lost it all. Is that is that accurate? Okay. It's it's goodbye. Goodbye

444
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,440
Um, I may have told the story before but there was this one time when I was playing donkey kong country 2 on my

445
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,440
On my little brother's uh black gameboy advance sp

446
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,520
And I was I was getting frustrated because that game's really it's real hard

447
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,280
A real difficult game and I got mad and I threw it across the room because I didn't realize that things break

448
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,000
And it and it broke and that screen was fucked and I didn't know what to do

449
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,960
I just nobody heard it. Nobody was around

450
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,880
It was and it was like during like a like a the middle of the day. So

451
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,200
Uh, did you print out a screenshot from donkey kong and pasted over the screen?

452
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,280
Well, eventually that's what came of it. Like, uh, not not I didn't do that

453
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,600
But he he turned it into a memorial. He he he cut out a little a little uh image of like mario cart

454
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,640
Gba or whatever mario cut advance and he pasted that on and he just kept that as like a little little thing that you could flip it open

455
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,360
How did you make up for this great scene of yours?

456
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,920
This the thing was I I was so upset that well, I didn't I was I was scared really

457
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,080
Um, sure and my little brother was really upset and my dad came home

458
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,280
And he heard about it and he just left and then he came back with another one

459
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,240
But but he was my god

460
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,760
He came back with another one, but he looked at me so glaring like

461
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
I don't want to have to do this again

462
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Hey, you know, I felt terrible

463
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Pretty much he was a good dad

464
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,600
But I felt like a complete idiot, but it I didn't learn my lesson because a few years later

465
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Oh

466
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,320
I broke that same brother's uh ds original by punching it

467
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,000
Because because because of dragon quest something or other

468
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,160
I was trying to do the casinos in a dragon quest game on ds and I punched the thing

469
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,480
I realized that if I punch it it might break, but I was so angry. I was willing to test it

470
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,840
And I

471
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,640
Test you really, you know, you really do have like a video game ball of rage inside. It does come out. Yep. I I'm I'm frucky

472
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,720
I'm evil. I'm terrible

473
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:08,600
When I was I was like eight and I would literally with my my gameboy advance when I lose against the pokemon league

474
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,720
I would just throw the thing as hard as I could across the room and the batteries would go flying out like fucking grenades

475
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Right. No, but it never

476
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
That gba still works to this day

477
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,760
Damn, they don't build them like they used to no that uh, that thing's a fucking tank

478
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:28,440
What the hell is it with white people and throwing controllers? I don't get it with white people with white

479
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,440
White people specific to other races not do that. I would assume they do. I don't know. I've never seen a black man

480
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,440
What about the spicy latin community? They gotta do that. I did I did I did punch uh

481
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,040
I did punch my laptop in the screen one time and just fucking

482
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:57,240
Here's the thing here's the thing I was in college and and my school gave everyone there a basically a free laptop

483
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,980
That like well, I mean we had to pay for it, but they were like, okay

484
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,280
Well, they issued me a laptop and like they would repair it if it ever got broke

485
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,200
So like one time when I was home vacation

486
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,920
I just like punched it in the screen and just like cracked it all just ruined it while it was on

487
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,080
It felt really badass, but then like for the rest of vacation. I had no I had no laptop

488
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,960
Which was a bummer but then I went back and I was like, oh, yeah, I just dropped something on it and they were like

489
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,240
All right fine

490
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,800
Why didn't you wait until the end of the vacation to do that?

491
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,480
Well, it was it was I was mad about yeah, it was the heat of the moment. It wasn't like I'm not gonna be mad later

492
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,640
It wasn't like a free. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I really want to punch my laptop screen

493
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,560
But I don't I don't know if I'll be mad enough later. So I better I better conserve it

494
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,600
Um, uh, yeah, Ben Ben's Ben's a an angry lash out of things man. Yeah

495
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Yeah, I kicked a hole in the wall that one time

496
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,960
You know the basement one time I I kicked a hole in the wall

497
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,520
But I'm gonna defend myself on that because like me and the parents were like really on the outs at the time

498
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,400
And they'd been and they'd been fucking giving they'd been

499
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,280
Okay, they took me to a shrink and they made they got the shrink to prescribe me riddolin

500
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,480
so for like two weeks I was taking riddolin and

501
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,120
Here's the thing I don't know whether the riddolin like made me fucking hyperactive and that's where this happened or

502
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,120
If taking the riddolin gave me an excuse to be hyperactive because now I could blame it on the riddolin

503
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,640
I don't know which is these is true

504
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,840
But yeah during that time I did like punch a hole in our basement wall

505
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,720
And then my dad our dad got so fucking mad and he made me repair it myself

506
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,000
Like I had to go to the the store and like buy putt like like plaster putty wall putty mix it

507
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,280
Like scrape it on like repaper the wall. It was like he

508
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,800
It took I mean it probably could have been done in a day by a competent craftsman or a couple days

509
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,160
But it took me like a fucking week to do it was miserable and

510
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,720
I was very sad

511
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,400
I think that's a fitting punishment. I think so too. Yeah, I think I think that's fair

512
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,680
But still it made me it really it really was a drag

513
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,720
Fair but I was gonna say it sounds like me and munchie. I've like never done shit like that ever

514
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,000
You know, I'm not a violent guy. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's just a thin boy thing

515
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,680
Maybe

516
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,680
Are you calling me fat you piece of shit?

517
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,720
No, I will you don't want to be fit. No, no, right

518
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,400
No, I don't know what it what it's caused by it, but I'm just an angry rage machine because I remember another story

519
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,300
Oh, my god, he's dead. We killed him

520
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
The original playstation one

521
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,400
Say or something and I and I I lost real bad and I have never heard

522
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,120
I never even like I'm so seething all my electronics. I have never like I don't I don't play video games with my sound

523
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:46,760
I went there and they'll they'll like hurt my ears. I oh fuck's sake. Why is it? Okay? Yeah, we hear you now. I can hear you

524
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm so I'm so full of rage thinking about give rage. Yeah

525
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
That trademark Gibbon Ray

526
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
so so guys uh

527
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,360
I'm playing rayman one on ps1 the original playstation disc

528
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,360
I don't have it anymore because I got so mad that I took it out

529
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,000
Slowly and I just had it in my hands and my hands were shaking and you know when you're angry

530
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,280
And you need you feel the need to like really really clench your fists or pull on something real bad

531
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
And I had this disc on both hands and I was like

532
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,440
I wonder if I could just twist it just a little bit just a little bit twist it in my hands

533
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
And then I snapped it instantly. I was like

534
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
And you know my my hands were shaking. I was like

535
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
No, you know

536
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
I killed rayman's essence

537
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,560
It was the first time I destroyed a video game. I felt like my first time but far from the last

538
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,880
He felt that surge of power and knew he would do this every day

539
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,880
I was real sad, but I was very scared that people would find out so I shoved I slid it underneath the tv

540
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,120
And and I don't know who found it. I've probably somebody found it at some point

541
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,720
But uh, my brother's one says one day was saying where's rayman?

542
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:08,120
Where is it? Hey, that panic started to rise. Hey hippo. Hey hippo. Where's rayman? Where's rayman hippo? It's like

543
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,680
I didn't do nothing. He went out a good man

544
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,200
He took a trip far away to visit distant relatives. He's not coming back. Uh, don't look for him

545
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,480
There's the sequel rayman 2 the distraction

546
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Oh, that's that's cute. That's hey, but remember that time we had a babysitter and we played frisbee with the final fantasy eight discs

547
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:35,000
Uh, what a fucking idiot. Yeah, I do. I can't possibly imagine wait. What what?

548
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,160
I was just like

549
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,880
We were just playing final fantasy eight having a great time and he was like, hey, here's a great idea

550
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Let's play frisbee with the goddamn disc and we were like little kids. We're like, yeah

551
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,520
The babysitter suggested it

552
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
Yeah, he was the one doing it. Oh

553
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,680
Am I the kind of guy who's gonna play frisbee with his final fantasy eight disc? Absolutely not. He instigated

554
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,440
He instigated this madness. I remember and uh, I do remember that a guy a guy in our boy scout troop

555
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,040
He sold me legend of dragoon, but like the third disc was just broken

556
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,840
I remember that it was like a big fucking deal

557
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:14,440
And I think I had to get my parents our parents to talk to his parents and be like your son sold my son a broken thing

558
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,640
And like he've like reluctantly paid me back at some point

559
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,480
That sounds familiar that sounds and I remember once that was like my favorite game

560
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,680
But the third disc was broken and I couldn't get past that. Yeah

561
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,440
Yeah, one and then you for my birthday years later got me a new copy of legend dragoon

562
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,560
And it was the most wonderful. I was finally able to be I did what a cool guy. I am you used money

563
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Yeah, I was just gonna say

564
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,680
And you know how I did that with money. So there you go

565
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,400
I have a new god. I have a new question if we want to talk more about money

566
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,040
Yes, we do. Please. It feels like a video game cast so far with all this webcam shit

567
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:58,040
It's fine. When we mentioned spoonie this question popped into my mind. Are there any people who make more money than you think they deserve?

568
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Oh my god, I mean

569
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
All of us I think fall into that category

570
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,880
Ben in the last episode you said that the market gets to chew

571
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,120
So if anything that's making money at all like it deserves to because people are willing to pay for it

572
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,800
Well, yeah, all right. I have to engage in a little bit of double think here

573
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,800
Like yeah, I know that like people people can give will give money to what they value and I think that's fun

574
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,440
But like for me personally, I think like even though I like for example, gym sterling

575
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,480
Like I like him

576
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:37,000
But I think it is out fucking rages that he makes like $10,000 a month for what he does like that's like that's disgusting

577
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,720
But if people are willing to pay for it, what's the problem? But what are they paying for?

578
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,920
What are they paying for like the people just value his opinion that you know, you know what it is

579
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,440
You know what it is? It's not it's not people don't actually

580
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,400
Think that they're doing him any good because they're not like he doesn't need more money to do what he does

581
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,880
Like like he's passed the point where he he could whatever

582
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,240
They're just people just pay for for things like that people pay for for creators

583
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,520
Just because they want to feel something like they have something to do

584
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,840
They just want to hitch their wagon to theirs and like feel like they're a part of something which is like that's fine

585
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,800
I get that and I won't say that anyone's wrong to do that

586
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,440
But like it's annoying because like

587
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,120
Some people like oh you mean like me for example

588
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,000
Like I need money so that I can actually do the things I want to do and then someone like jim sterling

589
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,480
You're just giving him money to give him money at that point, you know

590
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,360
Yeah, I that that's definitely frustrating a frustrating feeling

591
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,560
Uh, but like on the uh, just this isn't really a counter example

592
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:39,080
But then you got people who just like that what they do is they game the stock market and produce nothing

593
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,600
And like they just make tons of money and even even look more like

594
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,600
Yeah, I guess you're right. There's worse injustices in this world. Yeah, I don't really know what my point is

595
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,520
I guess I just like I'm just escalating the scale of like this shit gets fucked up

596
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,120
I was just hoping we have high levels point out people on patreon and make fun of them

597
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,840
I don't want to talk about stock market. Hey, you know that you know that you know that porn lady who makes like the high-def

598
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,000
Still images of porn and makes like 30 grand a month. You know her. Yeah. No, I'm very interested

599
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,080
S-s-s-s-s-such

600
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:19,560
No, she's Saki Chen Saki. Yeah. Yeah. She draws like really like beautiful shiny like fucking fan art bullsh**

601
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
I like like

602
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,960
Like like ben I don't begrudge these people for earning their money

603
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,960
But considering like I'm trying to personally get to a level just to survive

604
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:36,840
On doing this stuff, of course, it's just naturally frustrating that I see these people making so much more than they actually need

605
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,560
Like it is you know, that's all but I don't begrudge them, but I just

606
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,080
I hit some of that I only begrudge people when they're in the same sort of line of work

607
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,040
Anyone a patron I consider especially like a creator like cuz like if it like is say that there's like a load of there's a big

608
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,000
I mean everyone knows there's a huge market for porn people

609
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,480
Yeah, like if you do porn you're going to get money and you're going to get like a lot more than you would doing something else

610
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,640
I can get upset at that. I mean generally generally like it generally the opportunity is certainly there

611
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:19,240
Yeah, well the point is if a video game reviewer of you know is

612
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,880
Making loads more money than me, and I think I'm better than them

613
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,600
Like it's not a game reviewer. It's it's it's it's it's more I feel

614
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
It's just a more relevant

615
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,120
Direction to put rage rather than just at people making money in general

616
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:43,320
Yeah, I mean, it's more frustrating when someone yeah, yeah when like when it feels like someone else is getting more for the same thing than you are

617
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:50,160
Yeah, okay, that's fair. That's fair like I don't know like peanut butter gamer for the fact that he survives at all

618
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,440
Well, Spoonie dude his money is gone. He is I don't know

619
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,040
He's making more than most of us. Yeah, not I've checked now making more than him now

620
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:03,520
And I mean obviously I deserve it. How much he makes nothing. How much is he making like $800, right?

621
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,280
Yeah, I think something yeah, that's about right, but like he's made nothing for months and you know

622
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,560
Like he's got his depression or whatever

623
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,480
But the point is he is not giving his patrons anything of value so why on earth would he get any money for it?

624
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,120
He shouldn't he shouldn't get any money. No, you know, but like that

625
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,160
You know these on to these people into thinking if they gave him a certain amount

626
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:29,880
He would make a movie that he has no intention of actually making I think he's a fucking scam con artist who deserves to give all his money

627
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:37,080
He's just said some stupid like like he's not he doesn't deserve to have like

628
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,040
He doesn't deserve to be able to say I'm going to do something because it's just not reliable

629
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,640
Well, he doesn't say anything anymore. I think he streams occasionally, but I don't even know whether he does that anymore

630
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,600
But I guess I don't follow that. Should patreon goals

631
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,360
We consider like a legal contract that these people gave you this much money for this thing that you didn't do

632
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,320
It's like a line

633
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,520
It is a line. I really hate that I would just get away with like

634
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,800
I like this moment to reiterate that I have not forgotten about the reward art that I owe people

635
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:14,480
If any of you out there are like really jonesing for that and like want it in a timely fashion like feel free to tell me

636
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
But for the but anyway

637
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
My guilt

638
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,200
How's the name different from a Kickstarter campaign that reaches the goal and then they just run off with the money

639
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
You mean like you mean like leaving the weave

640
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,080
It's in the works

641
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,360
Yeah, it's coming. It's coming. Don't let Jess listen to this episode. No, but it is that it is actually coming though. I promise

642
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,640
Stuff like that is that like the free market or whatever if people are

643
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,080
You there's nothing free market about lying and stealing

644
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,480
Yeah, but if you're known as a liar and stealer people aren't gonna pay money for you anymore

645
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,560
Well, they didn't know until you already stole their money. Yeah, I know but that's why I said you can get away with it

646
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,640
Once but after that you're fucked forever. So I don't know why you should be allowed to get away with it

647
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,440
I mean, you know the loud to it's just the way it is

648
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,840
Didn't she actually finish or is like is finishing me like three episodes once you promised to do like a million, right?

649
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,720
And when she did it was like three years late

650
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:19,240
Then once she said she would do and now she's like hosting panels and getting atheists kicked out of panels

651
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:24,240
And she's fucking retarded and people don't trust and love this woman who who conned them gay

652
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,560
Anita is the avatar of feminism and to oppose Anita just like to people to oppose her like

653
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,320
She is just she's just obtained this crown. Well, Hillary did nothing wrong and is perfect

654
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:43,360
But yeah, you know, it's just like for some reason she has this status now where you cannot oppose her without just being

655
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,880
Considered, you know, like a anti-woman or whatever. Yeah, which is you know, whatever

656
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,520
I

657
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:54,640
Know everyone's already said this but I want to reiterate the people who I think deserve no money are as follows

658
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,560
porn artists porn actors. Yeah

659
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,040
What's the weather? Oh, I completely agree with you much. You want a condom companies condom companies contrast

660
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,040
Yeah, any sort of

661
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,280
What is it a planned parenthood?

662
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:16,420
Yeah, I really agree. I really agree about I want to defund parenthood

663
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,360
I really agree about the porn actors and actresses because they're they're they're having sex, right?

664
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,720
No, they don't

665
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,680
Anybody ever see that gift of the dude snapping his dick

666
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Yeah

667
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,360
What do you think it means

668
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,960
Yeah, that's right, that's what happens. It's fucking brutal

669
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,560
But it's like

670
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,860
Didn't break it just probably hurt. I mean, I don't maybe get like there's no like

671
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,560
What material is your dick made of like it's made of dick

672
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,180
It's made of a sponge. It's made of a spongy mucus membrane

673
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,020
Coiled up into a kind of foam

674
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:24,020
Muscle in there, too, so I think maybe it's counselor my dick's nothing but muscle, dude

675
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:33,140
I do my kegels every day do my cock push-ups. Oh wait, what's that thing? I do my jelking every fucking

676
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,460
Yeah

677
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:42,980
You joke but after jelking for a full year my dick is now one centimeter longer. Okay, so that's laughing now. It's not fucking true

678
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:52,980
All right, all right, you know, I'd love I'd love to I'd love to share my jelking story

679
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,940
But it'll have to it'll have to wait for another day because I gotta go I gotta go stream twitch.tv

680
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,660
Stream jelking

681
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,620
Yeah, viewers you'll you'll miss this one today, but we'll do more so go sub me

682
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:16,500
We might yeah, we might actually uh put them put them there, and they'll be up on twitch

683
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:24,100
I want to come on after this after this i'm gonna come on save me. Okay. I'll see you soon. I love you. I love you all

684
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,220
I love you, Ben

685
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:33,620
Is he gone? Is he gone yet? No, no, what penalty shall we give ben for leaving girl? He's still hearing and it's away from delay

686
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,180
Oh, i'm still hearing. What is this? What is it? What is this shit?

687
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,740
I just want before I go. Okay before I go

688
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,780
I just want to say that Nate if you want to fucking penalize me

689
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:46,580
Let me this is entirely your fault. It was your it was not. It was your fault

690
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:52,740
I said I have to leave before seven and then you had had technical issues that caused it to run late

691
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:58,020
All right, so me leaving is due to your technical issues. Okay, I would argue that I don't bear more responsibility

692
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:03,860
But I do bear the you know the the physical. Okay. It was okay fine. I can I can we can agree on that. All right, okay

693
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:10,260
Bye-bye. Yeah, okay. All right, seriously though. He's getting docked pay. He's not paying this boy for this

694
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,660
Can we just have a serious discussion about what we're gonna do about kicking ben out of the pcp?

695
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:20,420
I think now's the right time. That's the right time. Listen guys. I've been sick of Ben shit for a long time. Yeah

696
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,860
I've been sick of Ben for a while guys. He doesn't offer into the podcast. He's got nothing interesting to say

697
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,220
He's got no comedic timing. He's a big. He's a big gay, you know

698
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,460
When he edits the episodes, I have to write the description for him because he never does

699
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,620
Oh, do you do that too? Do you do that too? I sure do all the unfunny ones are from me

700
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:43,380
I I think that the pcp can be shaved down to like maybe one person if I really stretch it

701
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,860
Yeah, let's just make it. Let's just make it the the tom Oliver show. Which person would it be? That's a good idea

702
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,660
That's a good idea. Um, you're gonna have to find it. It has to be Jeff

703
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:59,940
Only Jeff has the vision to carry some of the 21st century. Tom has all the attributes of a true pcp member

704
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,580
Depression suicidal thoughts my little pony addiction. What else could you want?

705
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,860
It's pretty good. Yeah addiction

706
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,740
um, okay

707
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,780
Anyway, do you have any other points about money or should we just go to the question?

708
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,860
I have money right now. I'm gonna buy a pizza hut after this

709
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:25,620
I'm gonna buy a whole pizza hut restaurant Nate speaking of money. Go pledge your parents' hard-earned money to the pcp patreon

710
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,140
Oh, of course everybody. Yeah, how can we not lead off with that everybody? Go?

And also if you pledge at least one dollar you get access to the special

716
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:56,100
PCP discord chat and we're all in there and we talk to you fuckers like all the time and it's annoying

717
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:00,500
Yeah, actually because we love you. It's not just a fucking con. We actually go in there sometimes

718
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,540
And monkey just had a bunch of questions for our failed pcp episode

719
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:10,180
We just tried to record but they were going to be involved. So if you want to be on the show, it's another way to do it, you know

720
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,740
Yeah, all right. Well, that's it. I think are we good. Yeah, I think that's it

721
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,700
Oh and on that discord like your level of pledge you get like a different color if you want to be a cool guy

722
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:25,700
So if anybody wants to everybody wants to step up to the plate to be that true handboy 100 dollars per episode tier

723
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,300
You will look like a god amongst the sheep. So i'm just letting you know

724
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,700
This is a tangible benefit here. Do we have like like shirts yet?

725
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,700
The shirts are coming in fact

726
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,740
I was actually thinking that I might sort of film a little uh

727
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:44,260
Intro to this episode because the last one's already edited and just add it there because like I'm I'm getting I'm getting moving

728
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,380
I'm getting those up. So you might be ready right now, but soon

729
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:53,540
I gave you the clean the clean shit. You did you did so I've got everything I need to get like the basic shit rolling

730
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,260
All right, fucking there you go folks

731
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,300
Question time. Here we go

732
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,820
That's I think that's a conclusion. We all have we like money money is good

733
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,380
Money is good. I think yeah, I think we've

734
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,540
I think we also decided uh video games are good. Uh, and that's pretty much it

735
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,220
Go go go go go go to twitch.com

736
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:19,460
dot tv slash give and take and and uh and uh

737

743
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,180
Oh, and to give some closure to last week's episode. I did get my youtube channel back. So you guys didn't have

744
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:57,060
Of course, I forgot I've already I got it back before the episode even aired. So I'm gonna I was I was wondering

745
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:01,620
It's weird one week. I'm bragging about my subs and when it comes out my channel's gone

746
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:05,940
Next week. I'm complaining that it was deleted, but it's already back by the time it airs

747
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,020
We need to stop recording these eight days early. It makes us seem like we're crazy

748
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,580
That's the only way ben has enough time to edit them

749
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,900
Uh, okay, let's let's go to the questions. Here we go. Uh, I'm just gonna acknowledge as a block

750
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:24,420
Everyone's asking these questions about what is or isn't gay. Uh, well, let's just let's do an episode about that shit

751
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,580
You know, let's just do a bonus episode about that. I think we're gonna do a bonus episode about what's guys

752
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:35,780
By far the most popular questions we get every single week are about like is it gay to suck your own dick our traps gay

753
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,060
I think is the number one question

754
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,140
I've deliberately avoided them because I don't give a shit

755
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:44,820
But you're finally gonna get your answer if you become a patron the bonus episode is about this stuff

756
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,980
So, uh, and also if you listen to the insufferable social media argument podcast

757
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:52,980
We already answered all those questions me and digi so nobody cares about nobody cares about that podcast

758
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,980
That's that's the shitty podcast

759
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,100
Yeah, that's that's like the arm retrieval of your channel

760
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:06,420
Oh, no, yeah, it's true. Uh, okay. Here we go. So so so everybody a patron that'll be out

761
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:11,460
Uh, that that comes out like the end of the month. So that'll be in probably like a week from this when you hear it. Okay. Here we go

762
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,940
Uh, that's a terrible question

763
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:21,460
Nope, that's shit. Uh, oh here we go. Uh hashtag ask bcp. Oh by uh at hylio. Hey, it's my buddy hylio my music guy

766
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,940
What the fuck are you thinking? Did everyone hear here?

767
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:41,300
Gibbs hilarious joke riyuko my toy because she looks like a shadow. That's funny. I'm laughing

768
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,580
What about sonic himself? He's pretty hot

769
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,140
Sonic's pretty hot

770
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,060
He doesn't have enough

771
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,660
He eats. Oh no, wait, sonichu, of course. So I roast you. Oh, yeah

772
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:59,940
Roast you probably the whole pantheon is available to us a rose bubbles chew angel chew or whatever name is angelica

773
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,700
That's an angelica rose a chew. I don't know the hottest is because I hate sex

774
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,140
But whoever has the eye who has the most justice and valor

775
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,660
pulsing through his veins is vex the alligator

776
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:17,700
What about that little bumblebee? I like that little bumblebee that guy's a fucking faggot. He's a beat. I hate you

777
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,460
They're worthless

778
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,580
He's a punk ass bitch. You know what drop his fucking lights out

779
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:28,740
I like I like the the robot specifically from sonic heroes that that was that is that male sonichu

780
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:35,860
It's no no. It's the robot that was with shadow and rouge or something. Oh that guy from from adventure battle 2 or whatever

781
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:41,380
Yeah, that guy was cool. All right. Forget this shit. This is a gay question. Uh, how about uh, here we go

782
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:48,660
At a die nile 2 2 7 asks if you could restart life from birth while retaining all the memories and yes

783
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:53,380
You have now. Yes, would you no changing made no no changing major events?

784
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,940
What a shitty question what that ruins the whole question

785
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:00,580
Why why would you do it if you can't I want to be the baby who predicted 9 11 and called

786
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,660
George bush on the phone the morning of and said

787
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,900
Mr. President sir, mr. President sir, they're about to attack the twin towers and then he just replies

788
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,220
I know

789
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:14,340
Oh my god. Okay, but you know what I've had a fiction. I've had a thought about this for years

790
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:18,580
Okay, does everybody remember that remember the movie jumanji the old one not the new one with the rocking shit

791
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:24,740
Yeah, yeah, so so at the end of jumanji after they finally win after like it's like 40 years later something after they

792
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,460
You know robin williams grew up and that other lady grew up

793
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:34,260
So after that thing happened so so robin william spent that whole time since he was a kid in the deepest darkest jungle in jumanji

794
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,100
And he survived and you know he did this whole thing

795
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:39,540
So like he didn't really learn anything about real life, but he did become a real boy

796
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,860
Like he's he's you know a big fighty action jungle man

797
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,580
So that's cool

798
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:48,740
But that other lady like the lady that was his like childhood friend who grew up and they they finished the game together like

799
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,460
That lady lived to be like

800
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:54,660
35 or 45 or whatever like a middle-aged woman

801
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:59,300
Having gone through society seeing everything that happened in the real world

802
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:05,460
She knows everything and we saw at the end of jumanji when like that year those times just passes normally

803
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,540
When they meet those kids again like they remember everything that happened

804
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,820
So this woman knows every major thing that happened

805
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:16,900
Uh during the time between like the 70s and like 2000 or whatever jumanji came out

806
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:22,740
So like why is this woman not the richest person on the planet controlling everything major that happens because she understands

807
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:29,380
And can predict every single event that happened. Why didn't that happen because that's back to the future

808
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,380
Is a different movie. Yeah, I'm just uh, she she should have been the god

809
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,260
Busted that's the future of shit like that

810
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,180
Speaking of shit like that, you remember you ever know the the

811
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:46,420
Lion witch in the wardrobe where the kids they you know, they the i'm talking about the original movie

812
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,420
I don't know whether the the other movie has this but

813
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:57,620
The they they'd live in that world for fucking years and they grow old and they're like, you know late 30s or something kings and lords ladies

814
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,260
And then they go back and they find the wardrobe again

815
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,820
They come back through and their kids again in world war two. Yeah, and i'm thinking

816
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:10,100
They know what sex is and now they're little children. What's gonna go? What's gonna happen?

817
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,820
There's gonna be child pornographers, of course. Oh, yeah

818
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
The only good porn actor

819
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:25,060
In inception leo de caprio and his wife lived in the limbo area of the dream world for like 80 fully years

820
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,220
So technically he's been alive for like a fuck 130 years. It's crazy

821
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:35,300
Sort of but yeah, it's sure. That's that's pretty goofy shit. But what what uh, what was the question?

822
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:40,900
Uh, I can't remember why is jumanji the greatest movie. Okay. Now. Let's move on to the next question

823
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:44,020
Well, because i'm a level seven christ consciousness member

824
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,860
I've actually been alive for 6 000 years and I've watched humans evolve over time

825
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:51,060
And I just have to say that it's uh pretty good and I knew

826
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,620
It's gonna happen by just wanting it to happen. I didn't want to

827
01:00:54,580 --> 01:01:00,500
Okay, good question. You wanted the holocaust to happen. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. It's pretty funny. Don't you?

828
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:06,180
I find that I find that interesting don't you think millions of people die even lose those sea belts

829
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:11,620
That's pretty interesting. All right. Go ahead. How I got a question. What are all right? Would you rather?

830
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,820
um live for a hundred years or

831
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,900
live

832
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:21,220
100 million thousand years, but it's the same year over and over again

833
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:26,260
Oh, definitely that definitely that one for sure that one for sure because I can speed run that shit

834
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:31,460
Yeah, plus there are billions of people like you'll never get bored because you can always find like a new person to

835
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:36,260
Fuck or you know mess with or you know, there's tons of stuff you can do even living the same

836
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,900
I might freak out and lose my sanity at some point, but I'm willing to gamble that I'm willing to take a chance

837
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:45,940
Don't you think after like 30 years you'd run out of art to consume? There's no new art being created

838
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:51,060
What's the well you can just work on creating it yourself like you can evolve yourself and I'm not entertained by watching

839
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,420
my own art

840
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,420
No, but you can watch people react to your increasingly good art as you learn new shit

841
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,740
You just want to read youtube comments for a hundred million years

842
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:03,700
It doesn't have to be youtube you could become a fucking sculptor you can change the world you become an economic genius and uh, you know

843
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,700
You gotta do it in within one year

844
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,620
So that's not even that long

845
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:13,060
But you can spend like those millions and billions of years over and over learning new things that will allow you to speed run that

846
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:17,940
Shit, yeah, but I think I would just get bored like showing things up like I want to watch the next avengers movie

847
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:22,980
And I couldn't do that the thing is though. Yeah, you might get bored just with people's reaction because like, you know

848
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,700
You know what they're gonna do, but I don't know I'd give it a shot

849
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,060
I'd give it a shot

850
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:32,260
What happens if you die in this theoretical hypothetical thing do you just come do you start the year over?

851
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,060
you

852
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:38,260
No, because then that would be a way to cheat if you just want to get through them

853
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:42,740
Yeah, I can practice every suicide method and see which one's the best I could perfect it sounds fine

854
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:47,380
So how about how about oh, how about if you kill yourself for the rest of the year?

855
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:53,780
You're uh, you're conscious you can feel like yourself decomposing and then when you get to the end of the year you just reset

856
01:02:54,980 --> 01:03:01,300
So you're still like conscious for the whole year. That's fine. All I want to do was just assassinate the president over and over again

857
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,300
So I would find the best way to assassinate the president

858
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:10,500
Dude, don't talk about hillary that way. It's it's a sin to talk about hillary that way. You can't do his name with was seth rich god damn it

859
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,740
And

860
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:19,140
Hey guys, welcome to twitch as my new speedrun killing donald j trump

I hope you enjoy

862
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:29,540
Let's move on here's a question that shouldn't be asked so i'm just gonna ask it to to clarify it uh at read or daryl asks

863
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,740
What is the current status of jeff as a member of the pcp?

864
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:37,540
Is he really was he really kicked out and banished to the phantom zone of the pcp guys?

865
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:41,780
We had a we had a just a a simple parting of ways because jeff was doing his own thing

866
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:46,580
And he he left it really was like we joke about it because it's funny

867
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:49,780
Yeah, but um, there wasn't really like a any big deal

868
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:55,140
It was just sort of he doesn't talk he didn't talk in the chat and he were like, uh, you're not really a member of us

869
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,540
Of our stupid gay group

870
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:02,260
I saw jeff anime expo and he was delighted to see me and I was delighted to see him, you know

871
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,900
He is a good guy. Okay, so that's done. Let's move on

895
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,060
uh

896
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:47,860
No, no, no, I think lord anglis. He's grown up lord anglis. He's a real fucking aridon

897
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:54,500
Oh, he is aridon the literally the worst guy of all that's definitely that's definitely him

898
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,740
Okay, I'll make that. No aridon is a psycho who kills his friends and is just a generally bad person

899
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:04,420
No, no, no, you don't tell he's like he's literally a migtau. He's literally a fucking migtau elli roger person

900
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:09,380
That's really is you don't have to read this just for this hero character. You should check him out. He's pretty great

901
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:14,820
I think you'll like what you see. He literally shoots up his fucking friends because if some person won't go out with them

902
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,500
He literally

903
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:23,060
He shoots up his entire race. He destroys his entire fucking race because some girl won't go out with them

904
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,940
I always thought I was more of an itachi uchiha

905
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:31,700
Yeah, my favorite homestuck character. Okay, just take questions garbage. Let's do mine

906
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:36,660
Bugs good bad or important by jade morrow. We bugs are great

907
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:41,860
Didn't we answer that last time jane? I would expect better from you. I'm deeply disappointed with his shitty quest

908
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,300
Maybe he's looking at a question from last week that might not have been released yet

909
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:49,060
Uh, so in that case, I apologize jade. That's true. Are you fucking bully?

910
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:56,020
Still die. No, no, she she can live. I love jade. She's great. Uh, let's uh, what else we got here. Uh, no, that's terrible

911
01:06:56,660 --> 01:07:01,300
These are all bad. These are one more good one and go to bed because I've been here for three hours

912
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:06,500
Yeah, that's true. Um, okay, here we go. Uh, oh, it's another one from at porous saline god

913
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:11,460
So here's a chance to redeem yourself. What's the worst porn you ever accidentally saw?

914
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,700
Oh

915
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:18,660
That that would be the first one I ever saw which okay, I was I was google imaging search

916
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:23,380
I'm not fucking joking when I say this funny simpsons images

917
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,260
I googled that

918
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:30,500
And and I was just scrolling through like like I got to page like fucking 60

919
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,620
I just could not get enough of the funny simpson images

920
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:39,140
And eventually I came across this was the first porn I ever saw and I felt so bad when I saw it

921
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:45,540
A cuck it was a cuck image of bart fucking lisa and millhouse crying in the background

922
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,540
Wow

923
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:51,300
That's great. I'm the one who drew that. I can't believe you found it

924
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,180
I know

925
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:58,500
It was it was sublime. Oh god all of that that's simpson's stuff

926
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:02,500
It it's like one guy who does it like I don't know

927
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,580
I don't know whose mom key jones

928
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:10,180
I've seen that as well. I think that's probably the same like it's just so bad

929
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,860
It's all right. So and after I saw for the first time I literally cried because I was like I saw sex

930
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:19,780
I know what sex is now. I'm not a kid. I'm not a child last week

931
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:23,460
He had no this was actually in the future. It hasn't happened

932
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:32,420
The worst porn I've ever found was also the best porn I've ever found and that was the the legendary pain olympics of of yesterday

933
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,100
I was gonna bring that up god damn it. All right, you there you go. So nominal stuff

934
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:39,700
It was the back in the old days on spank wire dot com

935
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,740
There is a video known just as you know the spank wire video

936
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,500
It was named after the website

937
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:50,180
But it's really just a compilation of the best of the pain olympics and it had some good shit in it

938
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:55,620
A lot of which was inspiration for things that I detail in the triflers

939
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,420
A word yep. Yep

940
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,740
Uh, this isn't actually bad at all

941
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:04,180
But the only thing I can think of it was kind of bad just by sheer volume

942
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:08,420
There was this website that was shortly for a very very short lived amount of time was free

943
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:13,860
I think it still exists. It was called pink tube called pink tube and basically what it was was it was amazing

944
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:20,660
It was a wall of porn and it would scroll past you and like there would be previews of every single one playing at the same time

945
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:24,260
And all you would have to do is either highlight one with your mouse or click on it

946
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,940
And it would blow it up and make it big and like you could watch that and then as soon as you were bored

947
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:32,100
You could close that and it would keep on going and there'd just be infinite numbers of them. It was amazing

948
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:36,500
Uh, but they were all great. It wasn't bad at all. So that's not relevant. I got nothing

949
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,860
Um, I love funny census images

950
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:44,260
Give do you have anything to to to top this off?

951
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,180
I don't know about accidental porn

952
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:56,420
I bet you see some freaking brisks. There's no that's always deliberate. What are you talking about? Yeah fair fair point

953
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:00,980
But um, I guess there's a couple times where I was just on google

954
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,620
And I clicked on an image. It was like

955
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:09,220
Before like google could could block stuff like this and it redirected to a page of

956
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:13,220
Of like, uh, old people having sex and blowing each other

957
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:16,020
Uh, like old gay guys. I'm like, oh

958
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:23,140
And it was like enjoy your porn asshole and I wasn't even clicking on porn. It was just like an image of like not even anything

959
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:28,180
And it just redirected me to gay old man sex and talking lemon party

960
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,180
Lemon party, of course

961
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:36,900
It wasn't quite that because I also saw that and I'm like good god damn it. Why are the people keep putting this on the internet?

962
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:41,540
Lemon party's cute. I think those old men are adorable. Yeah, they're just having fun

963
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:44,580
Uh, I didn't like it because I'm not old

964
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:51,940
Yeah, yeah, but everybody should check out the offended page on encyclopedia. Dramatica that has some good stuff, too

965
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:58,820
Sick, uh, can I just shout out just this is this isn't even a room we need to go into but at nyankwan

966
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,940
Ask the question, uh glass is hot or not?

967
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,980
And I just like that it's a it's a picture of a girl with glass

968
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:08,420
So like I think we know she's got a bit of a dog in this fight. I think

969
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,820
No, you're probably hideous, bitch

970
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:16,980
Everyone knows I'm a I'm a well-known glasses fetishist. So there you go. You know where I'm at. Yeah

971
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:20,740
Uh, okay, that's it. No need to go into that any further. Uh, all right. We're all done everybody

972
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:29,220
Wait, wait, no, no the best question of all time at jero rado red. Who'd be the cutest pcp couple?

973
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:34,020
Nate did use a classic the bin munchie is a new contender

974
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:40,100
No, holy shit. That's actually that's actually a real question dude. What the fuck yeah, worst question

975
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:46,980
Fuck is wrong. Everybody. That's a good question. Jer Jarad. This is the worst question I've ever seen

976
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,780
In my life, that's we've already done

977
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:55,460
What are you talking about pairing all of us off until like the one two pairings? It has to be jeff

978
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:03,220
Jeff jeff jeff x jeff is just jeff and i know like the two non pcp members. Oh

979
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,700
And that's a match between them and they're both racist

980
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:16,100
Of course, what about syde syde and his fedora? That's the ultimate pcp couple syde monkey is my favorite
