00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey, it's a new day. It's a brand new dawn. It's a new episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,040
here on theprocrastinatorspodcast.com, not on YouTube. Because YouTube just keeps lying.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:27,440
They just keep lying to us. They hate us. We're being oppressed. We are being cancelled. We've

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,160
been cancelled. This is cancel culture. We've been cancelled culture right now by YouTube.

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,720
They don't want us on their platform. We've been de-platformed. And for what? For being

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,880
based all the time. We are constantly punished on all sides for doing our job too well. We

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:53,240
are called The Pro Crastinators. We are professional Crastinators. And yet, we're constantly getting

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,440
shit from our audience for procrastinating. We're constantly getting shit from YouTube

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:09,080
for, I don't know, being on YouTube, which is again, our job. Just trying to do our fucking

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:16,320
job. We're just getting shit on all the time. Everyone says, oh, Ben, where's slime and punishment?

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,840
Ben, where's the finale? Where's the new Endless War update? When's the new season starting?

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,520
Where's Vapors 2? Where's the- Where's my parts for the rap? Where's the Kuzo Mega

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,520
Kickstarter? Where's the Radcon Light Novel? Where's the- Yeah, Radcon Road to Radcon for

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,360
part five. Where's the OVA? Where's the dojin? Where's the- Where's the- Where's the- Where'd

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,560
my $34,000 go? They cry and weep and gnash their teeth. You know, the problem with the

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,520
theory of the $34,000 is that it doesn't feel real yet, because none of us have gotten

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,480
any of the money. No. Presumably, Nate is just like holding it in like an offshore Swiss

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:06,240
bank account. It is like earmarked to be spent on stuff, to be spent on like- There were

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,640
too many- And none of us are getting any of it until we've done all the- There's too

20
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,360
much post-production cost and some of us haven't even- Some of us are so lazy, we haven't

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,880
even submitted our receipts from Radcon yet. Or maybe only one of us is that lazy.

22
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,160
That was the first thing I did. Mine was mostly for food and stuff.

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm really bad about that kind of shit. I mean, but I'm good at like- The way I've been

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,480
filing taxes- I don't remember if I've been reimbursed. I'm not sure if I've been reimbursed

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,840
for like food. I hope so. Have you even had to file taxes in the last few years?

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,880
Yeah. Yeah, of course, everybody does. No, I've done my taxes every year. And in fact,

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,920
I was doing my taxes like two days ago, and I realized that you can just apply for an

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,160
extension and get it extended to like October. And I did. And they gave me the extension

29
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,320
in like immediately. And so now I don't have to do them until October. It's pretty sweet.

30
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:16,680
Do you end up owing the government money? Oh, yes. Yes. Because as a self-employed

31
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,800
person, if you work for an employer, a lot of times they withhold your taxes anyway.

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,240
And then sometimes you get a rebate. But for me, nothing gets withheld. So yeah, I always

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,120
don't- But do you get anything back from being low income?

34
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:44,920
There is a- There are certain- Self-employment is rough for taxes. There are- Yeah, there

35
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,760
are like low- There are limits. Like there is a certain allowance of a few thousand dollars.

36
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,720
I think it's up to like maybe like two or three or four thousand dollars where basically

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,120
that much of your income is like- I think it's two thousand something is not counted.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
So like the first amount, it's like you don't get tax on that. But after that, there is

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,960
like a certain amount and I am above that. So I do get taxed normally on everything

40
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,080
beyond that amount. And actually, if we're talking about taxes and I don't mind, I mean,

41
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,680
I don't know what the audience thinks about tax talk. Personally, I don't find it boring.

42
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,840
But I was doing it- I'm always interested because I have tax problems.

43
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,960
Last year, you know, I did the Vapors 2 Kickstarter and I got the money from it. But I didn't-

44
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,160
I didn't have the book ready. Incidentally, I have the book ready now and I'm going to

45
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,280
be getting it printed like this week. Like the time has come. It's a miracle. But so

46
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,560
I didn't- I didn't spend it last year. So theoretically, I would have had to pay taxes

47
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,920
on the entire amount even though, you know, a lot of it has to go towards production.

48
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,400
And I was sweating that. I'm going to get overtaxed on this shit. But it turns out there

49
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,960
is something called the accrual method of accounting, which long story short, is basically

50
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,880
just you checking a box that says, I want to count my later expenses for earlier, please.

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,180
And if you just say you're using the accrual method, you are allowed to consider future

52
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,780
expenses incurred by a previous thing, a transaction, as though they occurred at the

53
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,500
moment they were incurred- though they occurred when they were incurred rather than when you

54
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,880
actually paid them. So I can do that. And I- so I'm glad I was able to delay paying

55
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,220
my taxes because now I don't have to do it until October. So by then I will have, you

56
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,460
know, printed the books, gotten all the rewards and stuff paid for the shipping and all, which

57
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,940
is probably going to be another thousand dollars or so. So I'll be able to mark all

58
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,980
that as expenses off of that Kickstarter money.

59
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:57,140
The money behind all this stuff is the way it moves is so much more complex than people

60
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,500
think about because it's like, you see, like, okay, well, they just got this money and then

61
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,320
they used it for this thing. And it's like, yeah, but you spend it incrementally over

62
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,980
the course of the entire creation of the thing. So it's like, you have this money, yes, but

63
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,300
this money is for this thing. And it continues to be for this thing.

64
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,460
And it's not, it's not your money. I mean, it's not, yeah, this is true for Vapors,

65
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,940
it's true for the PCP, Radcon, it's probably true for everything. It's not your money,

66
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,300
or it shouldn't be your money until you have fully done everything you were going to do

67
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,380
with it. And then you can be like, okay, okay, I can keep whatever's left over.

68
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,580
That's the problem.

69
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:13,380
You know, fixing your leg, but you also cannot complete the project until the leg is fixed,

70
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,900
that it's like, in that sense, the money, it would be going towards the project if it

71
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,180
was used to fix your leg, you know?

72
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,540
Yeah, sure. Well, that's kind of like, that's sort of like borrowing against yourself. Do

73
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:33,900
you know what I mean? Sure, you might find yourself in an emergency situation needing

74
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,100
that money for something other than what, you know, a new expense, right? That wasn't

75
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,100
accounted for. And then it's like, well, I need to spend the money on that. I will then

76
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,700
have less money for the things that I expected to pay for. But what else can I do? Sure.

77
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,380
I mean, it kind of, it puts you in a no-win situation where either you can say, okay,

78
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,220
well, this money is exclusively for this project. I will not use any of, I will not

79
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,380
dip into this funding to fix my leg. However, in order, if that is the case, then in order

80
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:13,380
to fix my leg, I will have to either incur a separate debt or I will have to like, you

81
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,420
know, have somehow work hard enough to have the money to just pay for it, you know, without

82
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:25,060
having to incur debt. Either way, you're saddling yourself with more work than the thing that

83
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,300
you're supposed to do, which in itself will postpone the thing that you're supposed to do.

84
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,220
So either you're postponing it because you're not using the money to fix yourself or you use

85
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:41,060
the money to fix yourself, the project, assumably can get, you know, further along. However, it

86
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:47,540
also now requires more funding as some of the funding was diverted to emergency relief, you

87
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:56,020
know. When you're like indie crowdfunded, going over budget just means that you're paying for

88
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,780
it. So if something happens and you end up over budget, that's just out of your pocket.

89
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:08,020
Right. And the onus always falls on you as a business person to have made a good decision

90
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,020
about knowing how much money you needed. And the fact of the matter is that indeed,

91
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:20,180
people have no fucking concept of how much money will be needed in most situations. Like,

92
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,660
and there's like, you'll go over budget every time. Well, there's an amount. There's an amount

93
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:32,340
that you know to account for. And then there's things that you just will not know to account for

94
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:40,100
until the time comes, either in terms of time, invest like for us on like Radcon four, it wasn't

95
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,140
we didn't fuck up on the money end of things. We fucked up on the time end of things, like

96
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,020
just overloading an amount of things that we thought we could do, get done in a shorter

97
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,940
amount of time than we could, you know, a little bit, a little bit. And even so, like, I mean,

98
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,700
some of the things are things that, you know, I don't think anybody expected to be done quickly,

99
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,500
like the OVA, like, obviously, the reason that's in the works is that there's a fucking animation

100
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,820
being made for it. Like, it's not because of us. It's because it's a big project that's in other

101
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,780
people's hands, you know. Well, it's, yeah, on the one hand, it's a big project that's in other

102
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,220
people's hands. On the other hand, we have never done a thing like that before. So we kind of had

103
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,100
to like discuss like, how are we going to go about doing this? And then like try and figure out

104
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,220
what's the best way people know we have not made it hit a patient before, you know, but like,

105
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:38,820
in terms of other things where it's like, okay, like the diss track, like the exact nature of how

106
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,140
we were going to do it, like, we didn't have a proper microphone set up to get like the song

107
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:51,940
done right at Radcon. We got a demo version done that we could record the music video against.

108
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,860
But like, there was not enough time to, you know, come back and record a proper studio version on

109
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,940
top of everything else that was going on. And so in the aftermath of that, it's like, okay, well,

110
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:10,020
now everybody has to go and find time on their own to, you know, record for this thing. And the

111
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,900
work wasn't over at that point. Exactly. The work was not all done within the time that was allotted

112
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,180
for the work to be done. And then like you and Tom also had to do, you know, like shipping and

113
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,620
product fulfillment, right? Making shirts and posters. Well, Tom did. I mean, all I had to do

114
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,260
was mail him the posters, which I did a week ago. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. But yeah,

115
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,740
so I mean, for Tom especially. But I mean, you know, we had a portion of the budget earmark to

116
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,540
like cover the estimate, the estimate, like I got paid for drawing the poster and, you know,

117
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,780
he's getting paid for like the the the chipping and the and the printing the stuff. Yeah. Yes.

118
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,940
It's very involved. And it has been like, like Radcon for the event lasted, you know, was it 10

119
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:01,780
days? Yeah. But like, in a very real sense, it's still it's still going on, like it's still in

120
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,380
the process of happening and unfolding. Well, that's how it was for all of them. I mean, like

121
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:10,420
with Radcon 2, it took so long. Yeah, Radcon 3 took a year. All of them. Radcon 3 took a year for

122
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,900
all the content to come out. I was still working on 10 paces and draw a year later. I think

123
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,540
Pleven the Weave took like a whole year for the whole season to come out. What the hell are you

124
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:29,060
stirring around? I'm glad you asked, did you? Oh, God. This is this is this is coffee. And this

125
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:35,700
is a half a pint, half a pint of mint chocolate chip keto ice cream mixed into it. Yes. I'm

126
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,580
glad you noticed that I was loudly stirring this cup so that you would ask me what was in it.

127
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,940
No, I'm I'm stirring it because I want to drink its contents because they're delicious. But I'm

128
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:54,100
very excited by this by this new recipe that I've started describe it. That's it. It's just

129
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,980
it's a it's a mason jar full of coffee that I dumped half a pint of low carb mint chocolate

130
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:07,620
chip ice cream into and mixed it up and I'm drinking it. Good. Oh, I put some stevia in there

131
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,020
too. I guess I was thinking what's the word there's a word for when you put ice cream in coffee. It

132
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:18,500
might be macchiato, but I'm not sure. So I think this is a keto, a keto macchiato.

133
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:32,100
A keto macchiato auto. Yes. Patent pending. How does it feel to me the most like you're like

134
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,100
you're like a budget version of an insufferable hipster.

135
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Thanks, man. It's like I appreciate that. That's like what makes it it's it's like,

136
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,940
like you would just be like a douchebag. But the fact that you're doing it all on your own

137
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,100
gumption, like you made it entirely by yourself is so respectable that it's like, wow, he's really

138
00:13:52,100 --> 00:14:02,740
putting effort into this fucking like. Yeah, I, I mean, sure, like, I started, I started ordering

139
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,740
out food like like two weeks ago, I went on a kick where I would order food all the time. Yeah.

140
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,820
And like, but then I realized like, oh my god, like with delivery fucking food,

141
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,660
like with delivery fees and like you got to tip your fucking delivery guy now, your door dash or

142
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,780
whatever. And it's like, it's like, it's like 25 fucking dollars to get a burger. I actually just

143
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,780
pay for the grub hub plus and door dash premium because of the fact that I have been ordering

144
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,260
so much that it is legitimately benefits me, especially because with grub hub plus,

145
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,700
every time you spend like 100 bucks or so, they give you like a $10 rebate or whatever. So

146
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,980
it's like, it's definitely a system that entraps you. It's like, if you could, if you can afford

147
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:54,100
to be in the system, then it is more affordable than trying to like just order from it regularly,

148
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,340
you know, but like, yeah, but you'd have to order enough for it to pay off. And then at that point,

149
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:05,460
you're spending a lot on eating out and you shouldn't be, but that's right. Yeah, that's what I did.

150
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,100
That's what I did with Instacart, which is like the grocery delivery service. They would normally

151
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,980
charge a fee per delivery. But if you do their, their like premium program, you know, deliveries

152
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,260
free for like a one time yearly fee, and I calculated it out. And it was like way cheaper

153
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,740
to just pay the yearly fee or it would have been, except that then I stopped using it because the

154
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,180
pandemic hit. Although I might go back to using it at some point. It's funny that you stopped with

155
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:36,020
the pandemic hit because I feel like a lot of them started with it. Well, they stopped delivering

156
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,460
for a while. So with, and that was bad, but then they pay for that. They should fucking rebate

157
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:47,940
you that period of time. Like, it was, it was actually a pretty brief. It was actually a pretty

158
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,980
brief period of time. I'm not that upset about it. But even on top of that, they don't, they don't

159
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,620
take a, they don't take EBT, which seems like a big oversight. Even Amazon, Amazon started taking

160
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:07,700
EBT recently, which is like a real game changer. So like since, since Instacart stop doesn't take

161
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,820
EBT. And since, you know, I don't want to fucking take public transit to like, Wegmans or something

162
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,020
which is cheaper. I've just been shopping for food at Whole Foods. And like, yes, I know that it is

163
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,900
more expensive to buy food from Whole Foods, but they take, it's close to me. So I don't have to

164
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,780
put myself in contact with people and they take EBT so I can spend my fucking government monopoly

165
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:41,380
money on it. Suckers. It's great. It's, it's, it is amazing. It's amazing. But ordering out, ordering

166
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,940
out. Groceries, you know, gotta do it. You know, it's a necessary expense. One must, one must.

167
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,500
Ordering out, I, I was like, I have to stop this. I don't care how good boneless,

168
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,020
buffalo wings from wings over are. I cannot, I cannot maintain this lifestyle. It's, it's,

169
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,140
it's especially if I were to like, I could technically afford it. But if I keep doing this,

170
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,700
I'm going to find myself at the end of next year, getting hit with that fucking tax and I'll be like,

171
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,900
oh shit, I forgot. Oh shit, I forgot. I'm a self-employed peon and I owe like fucking half

172
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,700
my fucking money that I made to the government and now I don't have it because I spend it on five

173
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,900
guys. Then how much variety is there in the stuff that you order? Because that's a big part of why

174
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,980
I order so much is that like, I just like to eat tons of different kinds of food. So it's like, you

175
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:36,180
know, um, in the stuff that I order, uh, well, I don't do it very often. I ordered, I ordered Indian

176
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,420
food. No, no, it was Greek food like a month ago and I didn't like it that much and I didn't think

177
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,060
it was worth the money. So I didn't order for a while and then someone in my house ordered

178
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,420
buffalo wings and I was like, yeah, I'll get in on that. And they were so good that I had like,

179
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,820
had to get some more. So I ordered a bunch more over the next week. So I guess there's not that

180
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,940
much, I guess there's not that much variety. I'll order food if like I get like a particular thing

181
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,060
that I'm like, I want some of this. I must have this.

182
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:10,740
Hearing you describe the way that you ate Greek food made me realize something because

183
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:18,580
I think that most, most Americans, they like, they just eat American food

184
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:27,060
like almost exclusively and then like once a month or so are like, oh, I'll mix it up. I'll like,

185
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,220
have some Mexican or like some Chinese or like some Thai food if I'm fucking really feeling

186
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:40,260
freaky. And like, this is very strange to me because like, I mean, when I was growing up,

187
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,740
I ate like nothing but TV dinners and bullshit and like, my mom became a vegetarian in like 2001

188
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,100
and her cooking just degraded over time because she doesn't eat what she's cooking. So she doesn't

189
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,660
give a fuck, you know, so like, and nobody else in the house could cook.

190
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,220
Imagine being a vegetarian mom and cooking for your non vegetarian family.

191
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,980
I don't blame her at all because, you know, I mean, it's just a hassle and, you know,

192
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,860
nobody really appreciates it or helps out. I respect it. I respect it that you would be like

193
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,020
principled enough to be like, I want to make the world a better place. I think being a vegetarian

194
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,820
is a good way to do that. But I don't believe in imposing my values on others. So I'm still

195
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,420
going to cook. I'm so I'm still going to cook me that I don't believe in. Right. Yeah. Yeah. You

196
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:32,180
know, if you're not eating the food, it's really hard to make it good, you know, and like, yeah.

197
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,940
So my mom has become a better chef, apparently now that she and my dad are both vegan, and she

198
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:44,020
could just make vegan dishes because obviously it's to their palate. I don't like almost any vegan

199
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:51,940
food. So I have a roommate who is a loose vegetarian. And I don't know. I don't think I don't think

200
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,020
I don't like the things he makes. And I but I don't think it's because it's vegetarian.

201
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,220
I think he just under salts everything. I think that's his problem. Yeah. If he just

202
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,380
fixed that, he'd be fine. I mean, it's always just a matter. I mean, I used to not even eat like

203
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,740
any kind of dish that did not have meat in it. It's like I did not even see the value of a dish

204
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,860
without meat until like May started cooking dishes that are like actually good, you know,

205
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,500
like not to say that she often makes up with no meat in it necessarily or that that's my favorite

206
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,660
shit, but it can be good, obviously. And like, sure, you don't we don't need to eat anywhere

207
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,900
close to as much meat as we do. You know, I think meat is good for you for the human experience,

208
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,100
but you don't have to eat it even every day, you know, no, to get to get the benefits necessary

209
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,980
from it. But like, but nonetheless, I'm a big time meat person. I like to eat a lot of fucking

210
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:54,580
meat if I can. But like same. And I tend to favor like just getting a sandwich, which is like no

211
00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:02,340
fucking lettuce on it or anything like that. But like, I in terms of flavor palette, I'm interested

212
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,420
in a huge variety of styles of preparing meat, or you know, of putting it with other things. And

213
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:16,900
like, so much of American food is just meat plus lettuce, tomato, onion. And like, sure, not that

214
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,620
I'm not fine with those things, but I do not find that to be a very interesting flavor combination.

215
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,060
I don't like lettuce very much. I'm not a big fan of tomato. I put, I put love onion curry. I put

216
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:32,820
curry powder on my colleague on my steamed more sauteed. It's gonna half steamed half sauteed

217
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:40,420
cauliflower. I put curry powder on it the other day. I sprinkled some mozzarella on top. I don't

218
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,220
use curry powder very often, but this was like, Oh, it's perfect. Oh, it's beautiful. I tend to crave

219
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:52,340
like, I want to eat fucking onions and mushrooms and fucking peppers. And like, you know,

220
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:58,820
shit that would be in a curry, or shit that would be in a soup or something like that.

221
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,420
But also stuff that would be on a sandwich sometimes it's just like, I want to mix it up. I

222
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,140
want to be eating different stuff every day so that I know I'm getting like all the different

223
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,420
types of fucking nutrients, all the different types of immunities, you know, I want to be

224
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:18,580
fucking ready for any situation with through my body's fucking makeup. I want my body to have

225
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:24,260
evolved to deal with all kinds of different things, you know what I mean? And so, so I try to mix it

226
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:32,980
up. But like, you know, it's just funny because most of what you actually can get in America is

227
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:39,300
not like authentic cuisine from places. Like, like if you get Chinese food, almost all of them are

228
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:47,220
the same unionized Chinese American food, American idea of Chinese food. It's like Tex-Mex. Yeah,

229
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,060
like it's like Chinese. It's like, it's funny because it's funny because it's like Tex-Mex,

230
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:58,260
except that the Mexican restaurants are also like that in America. We're like, they're also like,

231
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,580
what we think of as like real Mexican food, i.e. not Taco Bell, like Mexican family restaurants are

232
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:11,220
also like generally the same unionized like template idea, like American idea of the Mexican

233
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,780
place where they're serving quesadillas, which are not even a Mexican invention, you know, like,

234
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:22,420
yeah. So I definitely add like a, I've definitely been to like one or two like pretty authentic

235
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:28,100
little like hole in the wall, like like Mexican place, like in California, I went to one or two.

236
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,900
There was a place near our house in Boston that was like, it was like an expensive sort of like

237
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:41,460
higher end place, but it was like much more like it was clearly Mexican food, like like someone

238
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,820
from Mexico making Mexican food, but like at a higher, you know, kind of class Mexican food.

239
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:53,060
So not necessarily like street Mexican food, but like it was not the same menu as what would be

240
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:58,500
at like a standard family restaurant, you know, and like there's a Chinese restaurant in my town

241
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,100
called Jade Villa that I highly recommend anybody who happens to be in Virginia Beach.

242
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,380
It's like right by town center and they actually have two menus. They have one that's like the

243
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,300
standard American Chinese menu and then they have the Chinese menu where it's like frog legs,

244
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:20,340
jellyfish, fucking, uh, you know, all kinds of crazy shit that is awesome and is stinky tofu.

245
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,820
They do not have stinky tofu, but we did go to that place that had it. Well,

246
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,220
actually they might, maybe I just didn't, I've never looked for it. Were you there, were you there

247
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,020
when econ got the stinky tofu at the place in China town? The story was told to me many times.

248
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:42,100
It's so bad, so disgusting. I can't believe it. You can't insist it's good though, so whatever.

249
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,220
I'm not like, no guys are free. Well, yeah, I'm at the end. I mean, I'm at the end.

250
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:54,740
He's a chocolate chips as well, you know, a cup, a cup. Yeah. Well, like literally. Well, did you,

251
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,540
okay, uh, he was on. Oh no, do we want to get into that? I mean, go ahead. I don't care. This is public.

252
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,260
He was on, okay. He came on Glinkstream. Do you know who Glink is?

253
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,380
Ah, fuck that guy. Yeah, I know. Yeah, you don't like that guy? Well, he was.

254
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:15,700
Not even a little bit. He was doing a live stream and econ went on there. Econ is pals with him.

255
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:28,180
And he, he was asked by somebody about his love of NTR porn. You know what NTR is, right?

256
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,260
Netsur, Netsurari. Yes. Yeah. Is that's like, that's getting cucked, right? Well, it's,

257
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:41,140
there's three perspectives on it. And as econ put it, he said that he is 30, he is spends

258
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,980
30% of the time in all three of the perspectives. So he gets off on being any of the three people

259
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,900
in the scenario, which is to say. Oh, sure. Yeah. The cuck, the cuck, the wife or the bull.

260
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,020
All three of them, he's into being all three. So. Oh no. Oh no, I can't, I can't hear anything.

261
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:07,300
Eleazar, Eleazar, cut this part. Okay. I'm back. You can, you can, you can roll another blunt if you

262
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:17,300
want. I don't care. Okay. Okay. But I'm back. So, so you mean, right, 30% bull, 30% cuck, 30% wife,

263
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,740
right? That's exactly. Sure. I totally get it. I totally get it. Yeah. So, you know,

264
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:30,980
as far as I'm concerned, if you're 30% cuck, you're a cuck. 30% cuck. Sure. Yeah, sure. Any

265
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:37,220
percent cuck is a cuck. It's like, it's like, it's like being white, you know, if any part, if

266
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,900
you're at all not white, if you have even a drop of non white, you're not white anymore, right?

267
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,620
If you have even a drop of cuck, you're no longer a bull. It's funny you say that because I think

268
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,580
that goes both ways with race. I think that if you're mixed at all, you're just mixed and like

269
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,980
nobody will have you, you know? Oh boy. I mean, it's like, there's a sect of people who do not

270
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,900
want to say, there's a sect of people who do not want to say that Obama was the first black

271
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,620
president because he is right because he's half white, half white. So, well, yeah, I mean, that,

272
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,300
I mean, it's a big, big topic. We won't get into all, we can't possibly cover it all. But like,

273
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,820
neither of us is really in a position to have a strong opinion about it. I guess that's what

274
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,900
we're trying to say. I mean, most people say that Obama was a black president, even though he is

275
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:29,460
demonstrably half white. But yeah, it's kind of a fringe position to say he's not black because

276
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,220
like, he's black because he looks black. And like, at the end of the day, when you get right down to

277
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:42,100
it, that's what race is. It's like, you can make like, you can claim some kind of genetic lineage

278
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,100
and like, yeah, maybe, but at the end of the day, what you really mean by white is just that you

279
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:53,140
look white and that's basically it. Then are you familiar with the rapper Logic? No. Okay, Logic

280
00:27:53,140 --> 00:28:00,660
presents one of the most interesting scenarios in my mind because so Logic is is is is half black,

281
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:08,340
half white, I think. Yeah. And he raps a lot about being but being half and like not really

282
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:15,700
fitting in with either crowd, right? And there's a lot of people who talk about how they they

283
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,060
they're sick of hearing him talk about or they're sick of him sort of like talking about that

284
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:27,860
experience because of the fact that he doesn't really look black at all. And so it's like hard

285
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,660
to believe that he would have faced the same prejudice that they do. And when I think about

286
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,500
that, I'm like, well, aren't you exhibiting right now the prejudice that he is speaking about

287
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:46,260
in the songs by saying so. But at the same time, so before I ever saw what Logic looked like,

288
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,700
he does look, I mean, I can, I can kind of see it, right? Okay, I can kind of see it. He looked

289
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,220
like though, but he looks, he looks, he looks pretty white. Look up what he looks like in

290
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,780
Rick and Morty, though. This is really funny to me because I saw his appearance at Rick and Morty

291
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:05,220
before I knew what he looked like and assumed that he looked like this. And that made me think

292
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:12,020
like, oh, yeah, he looks like he's like mixed. He looks like he would be like considered a black guy.

293
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,420
But it's just funny because they present him as looking like especially mixed, but he doesn't.

294
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:22,820
He kind of looks way whiter than that in real life. They got his chin wrong. It's funny to me,

295
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,860
like the thing that looks the most black about him is like his hair. He's his like kind of like

296
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,980
curly hair. I mean, to me, they gave him like these big lips and like, he just kind of has like,

297
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,540
it kind of has like normal. I mean, I'm being, I'm being Eurocentric when I say normal white guy

298
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:45,780
lips, you know what I mean? I absolutely believe that like Logic has experienced what he talks about

299
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:51,940
because like, from my perspective as a white guy, I look at him and I think, well, he doesn't really

300
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,220
look white enough to fit in with white guys. Like I know that, you know, I don't know if black guys

301
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,420
know that, but I know that. But him the way he looks in real life. I think that a lot of black

302
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:08,340
people think that he wouldn't be singled out because he looks too white because, okay, black

303
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:15,220
people are very fixated on skin tone. Like in my experience in going to black school,

304
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,380
black kids talk about each other as like, oh, that light skinned guy, that dark skinned guy,

305
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,820
that mid-tone person, you know, they pay a lot of attention because they think that

306
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:31,460
there's like a sliding scale of privilege based on literally how dark you are. And the funny thing

307
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,700
is that in those communities, that is even more true because of the fact that people

308
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:42,340
perpetuate the stereotypes. Particularly African kids get bullied a lot in African American

309
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,180
communities. For being the darkest. Right. For being the darkest and for being just culturally

310
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,020
different, you know, because they're from Africa. Like I'm talking about literal like, you know,

311
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:57,220
kids who are from Africa who come over and trying to adapt. But like, you know, and I saw all of

312
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:03,140
this as myself an outsider at the school, but, you know, I was literally like a white kid from

313
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:08,020
the suburbs who just somehow ended up here, you know, so like, I didn't feel like I was,

314
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,740
I didn't feel like I was being singled out so much as just like, what the fuck is this person

315
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,580
doing here? They have nothing to do with the infrastructure of what's going on here, you know.

316
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,820
Infrastructure.

317
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:25,780
Yeah. But like, I look at logic and I think like, if this kid went to an all black school,

318
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,020
then they're going to treat him like a white kid. And if he went to an all white school,

319
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,100
they're going to treat him like a mixed kid. I know that would be the case because I went to

320
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,300
both and I've known kids who were mixed and I know how they're treated. It's kind of hard to

321
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,780
tell in some of these pictures, he looks completely white. And then in others, it's like, okay, I

322
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,700
can kind of see it. So I don't know. Maybe. Yeah.

323
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:55,780
It's just the white people. I guess what I think that like, people who have like, I think when

324
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:04,100
you have a racial, like when you are, when you are a minority race, you feel particularly like

325
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:10,660
there's nothing I could do about this. And I'm just being shamed for for who I am. But it's like,

326
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,580
when you don't have that, they still find a way, like whatever is, whatever there is about you

327
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:22,820
that is different or or weird, you will be bullied for, you know, and it's like the severity of the

328
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,700
bullying or like where it happens, where you can get away with what is different depending on who

329
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,580
you are. But that's always the case. It's like, you can always get away with being certain people

330
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:40,340
in certain places and not in other places. And, you know, maybe being white, there's the

331
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,620
like gives you far more places that you can feel secure. But that is also under the circumstance

332
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:52,260
that you are white and like normal, you know, you're like, yeah. And you'll definitely be

333
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,020
bullied. You're definitely liable to be bullied for any any difference that you have from what's

334
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,060
perceived as the normal status quo. That's definitely true. I will say that for me, like

335
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:11,300
I as a, you know, as somebody who as a child, you know, I was a signed male at birth, told people

336
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,020
said I looked like a girl. I didn't like the people said that about me. But I did not attempt to

337
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:21,220
change myself. I could have though. And in my mind, that was always like a choice I was making.

338
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,700
It's like, I could choose to fit into society. I just would be really depressed and I wouldn't

339
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:32,260
want to. So if I can get away with living being like, you know, weird looking, then I'll just

340
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,580
I'll just do it. And like, I'll put up with whatever the consequences are, even if that means

341
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:42,820
getting bullied or looked down on. And like, you know, I understand that that's not viable for

342
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,900
everybody. And I never I never put myself in dangerous situations or had to be put in dangerous

343
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:54,500
situations because of my parents taking good care of me, both being around, having a house,

344
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:00,340
I didn't have to leave, you know, not having to involve myself in anything dangerous in order

345
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,620
to survive, which is something that both of my parents had to do. Like, they both had to commit

346
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:13,300
crimes to survive when they were teenagers, you know, so like, I understand, like, I understand

347
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:20,500
both why people would do that. And also, like, like, I would never because I've been I've been in

348
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,540
a situation where I didn't have to. And I understand that life is just better when you don't have to

349
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:33,540
commit crimes, you know, that's true. Definitely. So like, you know, when when the when the only

350
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,100
when you just commit crimes for fun, it's like way better than when you when you got to do it.

351
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,220
Yeah, it's better when it's when it's an unforced error. So yeah, when you can choose the crimes

352
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,220
that you want to commit because you feel secure and committing them were morally righteous and

353
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,020
in doing so, not because like, if I don't commit this crime, I won't be able to eat tonight. And

354
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:58,900
I'm not sure how many nights I can live if I don't eat, you know, right? Yeah, which is what poor

355
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:05,460
people experience, especially teenagers, you know, yeah. And like, in in their minds, they will

356
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,860
convince themselves that it's like normal, because it's just like, that's all they know. It's like,

357
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:16,420
yeah, crimes. Yeah, well, well, that level of life, that level of like, because that's what

358
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:23,140
society is expecting them to just continue on. Like society's expectation is, okay, well, your

359
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:29,540
life may be shit. But if you work really hard and get good grades, because you are smart, then

360
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:35,860
you'll make it through. And it's like, okay, well, like, like, make it through to do what, you know,

361
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,940
like, what am I, what am I aiming for exactly here, you know, and that these people just kind of

362
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,340
fall by the wayside and society doesn't make it through to make it through to, you know,

363
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,140
take out a bunch of loans and go to college and do it again, and then take out a bunch more loans

364
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,940
and go to, you know, grad school and do it again or whatever, and take out a bunch more loans and

365
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,740
like, you know, get a mortgage on a house or whatever. So they're just constantly trying to

366
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:08,340
meme you. It's the whole, this world is run by ad agents and intelligence agents. And most of them,

367
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:15,300
most of the ones with the power are just doing it. They're just in it for the boy pussy.

368
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,220
Like, okay, that's not where I was expecting you to go with that. But okay, I've, okay,

369
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:27,300
through the realization that almost every billionaire has been implicated as a pedophile,

370
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,300
I've come to start to wonder when you say when you say implicated as a pedophile, what do you

371
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:36,900
mean by that? Like associated with Jeffrey Epstein having gone to his island,

372
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:46,340
implicated in child sex trafficking, or child pornography having, or just being, you know,

373
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:53,220
being basically FBI case files or people who are protected by the CIA. I have no doubt that

374
00:36:53,380 --> 00:37:00,100
like lots of them are, you know, billionaire pedophiles. I mean, I don't know, like, like,

375
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,620
having been being associated with Epstein isn't, isn't like a strong enough link for me because

376
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,340
like Epstein was a well connected billionaire himself. He probably knew all kinds of guys.

377
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:17,220
And part of, part of what him and, and, and just laying Maxwell, we're trying to do is to make

378
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,340
themselves constantly photobombing everybody so that everybody's implicated with them, you know.

379
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,060
And I definitely think there's different levels. That's why, like, and I know this.

380
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:33,460
Did you see the thing about Gislein's Reddit account? Oh my god, that shit is fucking incredible.

381
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,260
That is the revolution of the century. Karma account on Reddit. And she was like,

382
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,380
The first account to ever reach a million karma. She was like,

383
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,620
she was like a moderator of view of world news, I think, like a big subreddit.

384
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,860
People are speculating that she may have actually owned Reddit for a brief period

385
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,500
that like she had actually bought it and like, and that she's like literally one of the most

386
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:02,980
influential Reddit users of all time. And I completely believe it. But okay, you have to

387
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,980
think about it this way, because this is, this is all plays into why I was thinking about this,

388
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:15,860
because like, why would you feel the need to become a billionaire? Like, for me personally,

389
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:21,940
that's a great question. I love this question. Like, let's see where it leads us.

390
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:27,620
I mean, Ben, you, you are probably the person I know who is the most satisfied with the lowest

391
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,340
quality of life. And I mean that as a compliment, because I honestly do admire that about you,

392
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:38,500
because I'm so I, I'm somebody who like, when I picture like, what is the ideal way to live?

393
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:45,140
I think of like being just like a mountain man in a cabin, like growing my own shit off the land,

394
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:50,740
letting the insects have my crops and shit, you know, like not using no pesticides, nothing

395
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,540
in natural Henry David Thoreau thing with the rats eating your potato or the moles eating

396
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,940
your potatoes. I don't know that reference, but it's probably the same thing as the Arjuna episode

397
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,140
that I am referencing. So like, you know, who just joined this call? Gibbo just jumped in.

398
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:13,300
Hey, are you recording? Yes. Okay, we're fucking going to town. So I was just explaining to Ben

399
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,260
that like, what I consider to be the like, that my picture of like an ideal way of life,

400
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:24,900
like morally is like being, you know, like a mountain morally like, like, like morally and

401
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:30,340
also like, I think this would be, I think this would be like the most peaceful way to live your

402
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:36,500
life to like live in tune with nature out in the mountains, like growing enough crops to just take

403
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:43,540
care of however many people there are around, you know, fostering a healthy relationship with the

404
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:49,460
planet as you just live your life casually without really concerning yourself too much with like

405
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:58,100
advancing, you know, things like culturally or whatever. That's really hard though. It is,

406
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,940
it is difficult and you have to basically decide that that's going to be your whole life, you know,

407
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:10,660
is like, is homesteading. And I think that the purpose of society is that we don't need everybody

408
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:17,060
to do that. A few people can do it enough to provide for everybody. But I think that we have,

409
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:22,660
I think that we are, we build our societies too big that like ideally there would be more people

410
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:28,980
doing the agriculture for the benefit of, you know, making each community like more

411
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:34,580
agriculturally stable, less reliant on factory farming and all the other bullshit and factory,

412
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:42,100
everything factory education, more locally sourced. Yeah, like I decentralized, decentralized.

413
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,500
Yes, more decentralized because like when we think about like the ideals of like communism and like

414
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,740
what it should implement in the population is that like more people want to work for the government

415
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,740
because of the fact that there is no higher station really. Like the greatest purpose you can

416
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:07,540
have is towards the betterment of the community. But like communism only really, in my mind,

417
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,700
like makes sense on a community scale, like within one isolated community that has its own rules.

418
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,820
And like the, I think that there's a good reason to have like, I have a counterpoint to that.

419
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:25,460
Counterpoint. Part of the reason that and econ will, you know, make fun of me because

420
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:31,060
I'm so predictable for saying this demonstrably true thing. The part of the reason why communism

421
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,500
has never succeeded, has never really been implemented is because you can't really have it

422
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:42,100
in on a local level or even on a national level. You can't really have real communism,

423
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:48,420
a classless moneyless, stateless society in a world where you have to engage in trade

424
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,940
with other nations who do have class and money. So basically, I mean,

425
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,580
communism can only really work in like a completely isolated society or on an entirely

426
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,580
global scale. Okay, so by that definition, is there any meaningful difference between

427
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:11,380
communism and anarchy? Um, well, because it sounds like you're describing my ideal anarchy

428
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:18,180
by that. I mean, I guess, I guess the ideal anarchist society is also a classless moneyless,

429
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:24,180
stateless society. So I guess they are similar. I guess I don't know exactly what the distinction

430
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:29,620
would be. I mean, I think to me, the main reason that I run away from the idea of communism and

431
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:35,220
prefer the idea of anarchy is just that like, with communism, it's always going to come down to

432
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:41,540
someone's making the rules and about like, what is ideal? And like,

433
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:49,220
I don't know who, I don't know how people would become a part of the decision making process

434
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,180
of what are those ideals without like, democratic process of some kind, you know?

435
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:00,100
Yeah, well, yes. I mean, part of like, part of the idea, and I don't know exactly,

436
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,740
I'm not sure if this is like a Marx thing, or if this is like a later thing. But like,

437
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:11,780
part of the idea is that you, you move towards a society in which you abolish, well,

438
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,700
basically, you democratize everything. And the idea is that like, the more you democratize

439
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,820
everything, not just government, but like, you know, the workplace and stuff like that and like

440
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:28,820
community life. And the more you democratize everything, like the details kind of take

441
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,780
care of themselves. I was reading, I think it was in capital, but I was reading somewhere,

442
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,700
where no, it might have been a video, I don't remember. But the idea is like, if the more

443
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,900
things become democratized, like we don't have to speculate on, well, what does civilization

444
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,700
look like under communism? How do we handle this or that or the other thing? The answer is, we don't

445
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,220
know. We will find out when we get to a point where things are fully democratized and people can

446
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:59,940
decide things for themselves communally. And then they decide, and it might vary from place to place,

447
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,860
right? Like one community might run things one way and another another way, right? I don't know.

448
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,860
I guess lately I've been on this vein of thinking that like, the point is not, okay,

449
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:14,420
how do we structure society? How do we just, how exactly do we redistribute everything?

450
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:19,860
The point is the democratization wherein we just make those decisions as we need to.

451
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:26,260
Ideally, society should be in a flow state where we can make decisions as quickly as possible.

452
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:31,700
And like, I think the biggest problem with the government is too much bureaucracy and like,

453
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:38,500
which is ultimately like the, you know, what makes me fall, I guess, libertarian,

454
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,500
because I want the government to be smaller. But it's not about, it's not even for me about the

455
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:48,500
power of the government's being smaller. It's about the government's power to be reactive,

456
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:55,860
to like change its mind, to, you know, like, think about like how hard it is for somebody to be

457
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:01,300
let out of prison who, who did not commit the crime, where like, we've reassessed the case,

458
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:07,300
we know that like, there's not proper evidence, but like, it takes 15 years for this person to

459
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,700
get released, you know, that's a product of like, over bloated bureaucracy. And there's,

460
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:19,780
there's a lot of things that get caught up in that. And it's like, we need both, we, it's like

461
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:24,180
both going in and out, I guess it's like, the government needs to be able to react quicker,

462
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:30,580
and then also to take it back quicker, you know, the, the, yeah, the idea of the bureaucracy,

463
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,500
there cuts both ways, because on the one hand, the situation you describe is bad. But on the

464
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,900
other hand, that situation also means that there are all these procedures that we have to go through

465
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,060
before someone gets the death penalty, right? Like that's the reason why giving someone the

466
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,540
death penalty is more expensive than just giving them life in prison. Because there's all this red

467
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,460
tape to go through. And it's because we don't want to do this by accident. We want to have these

468
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,980
procedures to make absolutely sure that we're not just doing this willy-nilly.

469
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,780
I personally think it's weird that we even have the death penalty. Like, I don't, I don't really

470
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,980
get the point of it, you know. Yeah, the, there is a great video, I think it's his newest video

471
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:10,180
by Sean, where he talks about the death penalty. And yeah, like the point of the death penalty

472
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:17,060
is basically just to make people, like, feel better? Like, not the victim. It's to make, like,

473
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:22,020
it's because people in society are mad. Like, the argument is that it's a deterrent. The evidence

474
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,660
isn't really there to suggest that it actually is a deterrent. The purpose is because, like, people

475
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:33,460
who are mad about crimes want punishment. And that's the point. So, like, yeah, I mean, at some

476
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:40,500
point I will finish Foucault's crime and punishment and form a full... Foucault. Wait, that's Dostoyevsky.

477
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,420
No, what's the name of the book I'm thinking of then? Not crime and punishment.

478
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:51,140
It's a similar title, though. The Foucault book. Slime and Punishment. About, about, um,

479
00:46:52,100 --> 00:47:03,060
Uh, that's F-O-U-C-A-U-L-T-Y-O-U-R-F-C-R-F-C-K, uh, Foucault. Foucault.

480
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,780
It's the one about fucking the death penalty and why it's a good, and I haven't read it yet.

481
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:13,140
It's scary. I don't, I don't know. Well, actually, it's more about why... I haven't read any Foucault.

482
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,900
It's not even, actually, it's not about why the death penalty is good. It's about why public

483
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:23,060
execution is good and why the death penalty is bad, actually, because it's not as good as public

484
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,620
execution. Because it's not public enough? Discipline and punish, that is the name. It's not televised.

485
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:37,300
Hmm, I see. World's deadliest executions. Uh, that's a Simpsons, Simpsons reference.

486
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:45,300
Hey, you know what's real fucked up just thinking about this? Is that everything I own and have ever

487
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:52,500
owned was made by somebody I will never meet and have never met, like, everything, except for the

488
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,260
like, the small, like, little bits of, you know, things that people physically may and give to me.

489
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,980
Brownish shit that you have. That's a little thing, that's a little thing we like to call

490
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:08,980
alienation from the means of production, my friends. That's, you better, you're talking

491
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,100
straight marks right now. You're gonna get, you're gonna fucking radical.

492
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:21,220
No, I feel that too. Like, my ideal, my present ideal is like, I want to have basically just like

493
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:29,060
a town of people I think are cool, where everybody makes their own shit, and it's just a self-sustaining

494
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:33,940
economy of people making cool shit and supporting one another on the basis of making cool shit.

495
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:40,180
I was, I was watching this. I like that idea, but it reminds me of something. Like,

496
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:46,740
yesterday I found this channel called Tasting History, where a guy cooks recipes from like,

497
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:52,260
cookbooks from like, Victorian times or like medieval times or even like ancient Greek stuff.

498
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:58,660
Like, he made this fish sauce called Garum out of like, fermented fish paste. It's like, it's like,

499
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,100
he does like, historically accurate reenactments of food that people in the ancient world used

500
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:08,100
to eat. It's pretty interesting, but he, he, there's one video, I think he's making some like,

501
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:14,020
some old bread. I forget what the name of the bread is, but he is talking, he talks about

502
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,860
Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, which I read in high school, but I don't remember it all.

503
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:23,700
And I guess in Chaucer, Chaucer I guess really hates millers. Like, he basically thinks that all

504
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:29,140
millers are like, greedy businessmen and like thieves and like, rapscallions and rogues and

505
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:34,980
like, thinks they should be put to death because like, repeat offenders, right? For like, people

506
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,700
that are like, like cutting their, cutting their flour with stuff that's not flour. He's good.

507
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,420
I guess, I guess like, in medieval times, in a time when you would have lived in a little village

508
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,860
where like, one person makes the bread and another person like, you know, forges your plow or whatever,

509
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:55,780
the millers, there was an idea that these people, you know, owned the means of production in the

510
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,860
sense that like, everyone's got to eat and they're the ones that are feeding everyone,

511
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,500
but they're greedy and like, they'll overcharge you for the bread. Like, they'll fill it full

512
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,260
of air. So you have to pay more. They'll put their thumb on the scale. So like, so they,

513
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:13,060
you think you're buying more than you really are. A golden thumb. The phrase was, he has a golden

514
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,380
thumb, which both implies wealth, but also it was like, the thumb is, the thumb is heavy. The thumb

515
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,780
is heavy on the scale. So it's, he's charging you for more than you're actually getting. Millers,

516
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,260
dude, fuck millers. I hate them. Maybe this is arrogant. Everything wrong with society.

517
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:32,420
Maybe this is arrogant of me to think, but I feel like throughout history, like the problem has

518
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:38,820
always just been that like, people can't really like, communicate well. Like, I think that like,

519
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:46,260
communication has never been very good. And that like, in the past, I think we really like,

520
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,220
underestimate how fucking confused everybody was about one another's intentions and like,

521
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:56,020
how difficult it probably was for people who were not, who didn't know each other and like,

522
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,220
literally everything that was going on with one another all the fucking time, because that's

523
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,140
how people like were. It's like, people in your community, you literally know everything about

524
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:09,300
them. You see them constantly. There is no lapse in your understanding. But like, people were so,

525
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,860
because of that, people are super tribal and like, people from other communities, like, even if it's

526
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:19,140
just the next neighborhood over, it's just like, I have no idea who this person is. And then like,

527
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:23,540
this guy's from Shelbyville. I don't trust him. Yeah. I don't know. And I think that's the street

528
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:28,660
who are they are. Well, that's the thing. I think that the creation of the nuclear family

529
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,380
created it so that every household became its own community, because we started just like,

530
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,820
the idea of the, the, the fifties idea of the family is like, you personally have to write

531
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:46,100
everything. You don't rely on anybody. You own everything in your house. You have your own copy

532
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:51,140
of everything that you could possibly need. And therefore, you're self-reliant. But like,

533
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,260
people think that they need to be self-reliant to be successful. And it's like, you don't,

534
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,820
you could literally share these things with other people and live. The nuclear family is like,

535
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:07,220
a more recent idea. Like, like, obviously, people have like, lived like, just them and their partner

536
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:12,900
and their kids. Like that obviously always happened. But that wasn't always seen as like, the ideal

537
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:18,020
or the modern standards. You know, people lived in like, big, like, like extended family dwellings

538
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:22,340
or whatever. Like that was, that's normal for a lot of human history. I think it's a result of

539
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:29,540
having a culture of excess and proposing that excess as necessity because of the fact by way

540
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:35,540
of sociopathy. Because it's like, in America, we're told to fear our neighbor. Do not associate with

541
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:41,940
other people. Other people are scary. You should stay away from them and have all your own things,

542
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:48,100
you know? And so you convince yourself that you need to own, like say, a microwave, right? Like,

543
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:54,100
how often in the day does one person use a microwave? And imagine if there was like, a

544
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,740
microwave somehow in like the middle of the street in your, in like a cul-de-sac, right? And

545
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:03,060
everybody shared the same microwave. Probably wouldn't really be that much competition over the

546
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:10,020
microwave. Like, you know, point being, you know, and think about how much money is spent on all

547
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,700
eight people in that cul-de-sac owning their own microwave. It's like, this is what the government

548
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:20,500
wants to be because that level of consumption causes you to spend all this money that literally,

549
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,020
you could just go to your neighbor, if you knew your neighbor, you could just go to their house

550
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:27,860
and use their microwave, you know? And this is something that kids understand because kids are

551
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:33,700
in a position where they, you know, they have no power and so parents will let them sort of,

552
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:38,500
you know, rely on them a little bit more or adults in general might do that, especially in

553
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:45,940
suburban places. But like, you know, that doesn't mean that those like that, like nothing changes

554
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,260
about that when they grow up other than that they become more afraid of other people and more, you

555
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:56,180
know, uh, insistent on self-reliance. I'm just realizing that that was like the cause of so much

556
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:05,620
social distance, like not to use that term. Like the idea that I could like live in a rented flat

557
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:10,500
with a bunch of other people and share like a bathroom is like, oh, gross. I don't want to

558
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,500
have to like talk to people. I don't want to say anything to people down the hall. I just

559
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,260
want to have my own house. I want to buy my own house so I don't even have to talk to people.

560
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:23,700
That's what I'm doing. That's what my big dream is to live alone completely. And it's much more

561
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:30,980
expensive. I don't know. It's just like, why? Because, uh, what's the, you're not saying this is

562
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:36,100
a good thing. I'm saying this is like how society is meant to be. You're saying that it's not a

563
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:41,140
good thing, but then like, okay, so like, so you don't want it, right? Because it sounds like it

564
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:46,900
sucks. I think it's, I think it's a difference of faith and it's a strange one. It's interesting.

565
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:54,100
I think that, uh, for me, at least it's like, I have very little faith that I'm going to share a

566
00:54:54,100 --> 00:55:01,300
house with somebody and it won't suck. But there are certain people who like sharing a house with

567
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:06,660
you was not a problem for me because you are pretty much completely on your own anyways.

568
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:12,260
Like you don't have a lot of space. Yeah. Uh, and, and you pretty much keep to yourself anyways.

569
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:18,900
You, you're not very like demanding of attention or anything. You, you, you don't cost much money.

570
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:23,620
You don't like, you don't use a lot of, you don't use very much electricity. You don't use very

571
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:29,620
much water. You don't use very much food, you know? Uh, so, and you eat my leftovers. So like,

572
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:34,500
if anything, you're helpful. Uh, that's like, that's, that's such a win with a real symbiotic

573
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,060
relationship. Everybody fucking gets what they need. Beautiful. You are very, let's me eat their

574
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,060
leftovers now when throws their leftovers away. I hate it. And Tom is very similar to you. You

575
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:47,460
know, having him as a house guest, never really a problem. The only concern could be like privacy,

576
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:52,660
just not being able to like walk around my house naked comfortably, you know? Right. Right. Which

577
00:55:52,660 --> 00:56:01,460
never stopped you anyways. Well, but it doesn't to this day. Yeah. But like, I, I, so, you know,

578
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,820
to me, it's like, there's, there are certain people who I'm willing to share a house with.

579
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:11,540
Uh, I don't imagine there being that many people who I could, but I think it's the fact that I even

580
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:16,260
have faith that I could have a super comfortable home environment where it's like just me and the

581
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:22,500
closest people and we could be as open as we want is like a romantic idea to me. And I think that

582
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:27,060
you, Ben, are just somebody who like on some level just doesn't really believe that that's

583
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:32,340
necessarily true or even need it. Or maybe you just feel so comfortable that you just don't even

584
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:38,740
care. And like, sorry, it's easy for you that I don't believe what's true that you could have

585
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:45,460
a situation where you would be 100% comfortable at all times with another person.

586
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:57,540
Um, no, no, no, no, like the lack of beer. You're correct. It's kind of like in a strange way.

587
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:04,500
The, the, the idea that your thought in your head of like, okay, well, I will never have a 100%

588
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:13,940
uh, like comfort zone. So I might as well just have whatever comfort zone, like I don't,

589
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:21,260
I'm I'm actually really confused what you're saying. Okay, what the point you're making about me or about society or

590
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,760
What I'm trying to say is that

591
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,680
for me, it's like

592
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,520
If I were to live in a house, let's say like okay, I lived with you in DeVoo, right?

593
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:38,060
And living with you in DeVoo was fine and and shade and shade shade and amber

594
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:42,660
Yeah, they were forget they were around because we saw so little they were never there. Yeah

595
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:47,860
That situation was fine because like you're all people who I am comfortable around

596
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,460
I'm comfortable sharing a house with you, right?

597
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:56,980
But like obviously I wouldn't do everything that I would do in my own room in the middle of the house, right?

598
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,540
Like how many times yeah, how many times that I come to your room and you're like wait a minute

599
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:09,500
I'm naked. I have to put on clothes, you know usually right so like there's a certain level of you have a comfort zone of your room

600
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,540
But like you step out of that to go into the house and like for me

601
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:19,980
It's like I like having a house where the whole house is all my comfort zone and

602
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:25,420
The only way that can be possible is if the only people sharing the house with me are people

603
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,740
I'm completely comfortable with you know, but if if I didn't feel that there was anybody

604
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:35,100
I could be completely comfortable with then I would probably just be like, okay

605
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,260
Well, I'm fine with just having people I'm somewhat comfortable with and having my own room as a comfort zone

606
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,060
It's not like a terrible way to live and I think it's how most people live

607
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:49,380
I don't think there's many people who can find somebody who's like it's just gonna do like literally be down for absolutely every

608
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,900
Tendency they ever I don't you know, like I've had I've had like obnoxious living situations before

609
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:01,180
Right, I didn't like the people that I lived with and I wanted to avoid them and I felt anxious about seeing them

610
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:06,860
I don't feel that way here like sometimes there will be times when like I don't really feel like socializing

611
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:11,100
But like I'll have to go and like to the kitchen to get something and I'll have to walk through the living room

612
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:16,580
People are in there and oh god. Oh, they're gonna say hi to me and like whatever. That's fine. That's like not a problem

613
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,660
It doesn't it doesn't bug me. So I don't have any problems. That bugs me

614
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:26,340
That I definitely had that big time in the past. There was like particularly family members. There was a moment

615
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:32,540
Multiple I never feel like anything is demanded. Let's give it finish first. Okay multiple moments

616
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:39,860
When I was at uni when I was like in a shared house with six other people in their own rooms and stuff

617
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:45,900
We're like I needed I was hungry. I was at the computer in my room safe safe

618
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:53,060
No one can get me in here safe. Oh, no, I can hear people in the kitchen. I am hungry. I need to eat but

619
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,780
You know what? I think I'll just starve

620
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,700
I'd rather just like be hungry wait until they're gone to bed and then I'll eat and I happened a couple times

621
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:05,460
And I was like I know I mean I know but I did it. I know the feeling. No, I know the feeling

622
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,420
I used to I used to I'm a little less like that now

623
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,540
I did sometimes I still feel like there's people around like I don't just I'll just wait

624
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:19,660
I mean back. I guess that's true. I'm back in my hikikomori phase in particular. I'm I'm really stealthy

625
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:23,980
I'm very good at not being detected and like it was especially

626
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,460
Under the like waist-high walls

627
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:31,100
Yeah, I mean like particularly in in big houses

628
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:36,120
It's it's fun because there's a lot of different ways around and you could just quietly sneak up on people and like

629
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:44,500
You know, I'm big on both like surprising people by just like when they turn around. I'm suddenly there and also like

630
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:49,380
You know, just just but also just concealing my presence when it's like, okay

631
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,380
Like you said if like I want to get something

632
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,380
Downstairs, but like I hear somebody's down there

633
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:59,060
I will not go down until like I hear the sound has cleared and like, you know

634
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:02,900
I might still suspect that they might be awake and if they hear me they might say oh

635
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,380
You're still awake and I'll go

636
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,580
Don't think about the fact that I'm awake

637
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,100
run away

638
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:17,740
So the fucking people around feel very much pressure here with the people I live with now

639
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:21,380
I don't I'm not worried that they're gonna say anything. I don't I don't care what they think

640
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:26,500
I'm just like yeah, whatever and if I don't want to hang out. I'll just be like okay. Bye. I

641
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:32,220
Fucking hate the moments when when somebody is like, oh, you scared me. I didn't hear you

642
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,860
I didn't I didn't sense your presence. It was like I don't make I don't make a lot of noise

643
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,140
I guess I don't breathe heavily or stomp heavily and then they turn around

644
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,420
I'm trying to be stealthy and I feel like

645
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,660
Like a fucking serial killer. It makes me feel everybody says that I'm I'm very stomp

646
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,740
I'm like stomp apparently I'm very heavy footfalls

647
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:57,380
But like also I'm very easily snuck up on and like sometimes it happens all the time that I'll be cooking many times

648
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,860
Yeah, it's happened with a bunch of people here

649
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:04,060
Like I'll be cooking or something and I'll just turn around and someone will be in the kitchen

650
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:08,420
They came in when I went and I'm like, oh god. You are so easily frightened that I

651
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,340
I got to a point where I started expecting it

652
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:19,940
Like I tried to I would try like my approach you in a way that would like minimize the level of stress that it was going to

653
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,860
Yeah, like like people now like like my friend

654
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:30,900
Doob will like he'll he'll like kind of like step stomp a little loudly out the kitchen just to make sure he'll like knock on

655
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,540
The wall or something before he rounds the corners, so I'm not like

656
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:39,740
Yeah, I mean I might call out ahead of time just like hey Ben before I even into the room just so you know

657
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:45,020
These coming it's just I was just I would I was thinking of stuff like that

658
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:49,820
Like sometimes I try to make sure that my steps are pronounced, but not to pronounce

659
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:54,060
I don't want them to think I'm trying to get their attention because then they'll be saying huh, and then I'll be like

660
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:59,780
Why are you stomping bro? I hate I hate it when people are like why are you still walking?

661
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:05,060
Why are you doing anything and I and I'm literally just like hey, I'm a I'm walking here and like that's it

662
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,660
That's the answer

663
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:13,540
Can't fucking don't fucking question people hate hate hate being questioned. I hate when my methods are questioned

664
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:20,900
That's it. Yeah, well, this is this is this is fucking generalized anxiety disorder the podcast

665
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:26,720
Yes, wait you guys talk I have to pee I'll be back in two seconds

666
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,660
30 seconds 30 seconds

667
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:34,700
This is a story about a guy named Al who lives in a sewer with this hamster

668
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,740
Pal and I don't know any of the other words of the song because I never memorized it. It's really hard

669
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,260
Now you should have said long as I rhymed

670
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:46,420
Yeah, I thought about it, but I was like that doesn't make any sense so that I swerved

671
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:51,820
Crash maybe maybe maybe making sense was overrated in that context

672
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:57,580
Maybe rhyming would have been more aesthetically pleasing. You know, I was thinking about anxiety. I feel

673
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,220
like I used to

674
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:05,340
Like dismiss the idea that I had anxiety even though I was like socially awkward and a bit shy

675
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:12,820
The idea of like people who had anxiety they always talked about panic attacks and and like serious like

676
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:18,420
Immobilization things that they just could not do stuff and I was like, well, I guess if I push myself

677
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,420
I can do most things so I don't have that

678
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:26,780
Then I sort of internalize that as like every time I do feel a bit scared. There's no there's no excuse

679
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:31,480
I have I don't have anxiety. I have to do it. There's no way you know that I could be like

680
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:36,860
Some like mental blockage that here. I'm just like stupid or bad or something

681
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:43,780
I I think this is what we what you what you're describing is what you and I and and I think a lot of our audience

682
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,620
Have in common with with our anxiety is that like

683
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:53,260
It's it's like well, I'm I am sane and like I am smart enough to keep a handle on this

684
01:04:53,260 --> 01:05:01,980
Like I don't have I don't have panic attacks all the fucking time because I understand that I am like what's wrong with me

685
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,700
so like

686
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:09,260
You know to some degree. It's like I understand that I'm panicking like I know that's what's happening and like I mean

687
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,260
I have had panic attacks

688
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:19,100
I am prone to them, but I I don't know they're not too scary for me because it's kind of like I understand

689
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,460
What's going on? I know why I'm panicking, you know

690
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:27,180
If anything the fact that I'm having a panic attack is kind of a relief and that it's like, okay

691
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:35,220
I get it. I get I get what's happening. This is just anxiety buildup, you know, and I think that that's I think that's something that a lot of us

692
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:43,500
Struggle with is literally like being like well, I feel the exact same way as a crazy person

693
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:48,140
However, I'm not crazy. So what do I do with that? You know like

694
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,700
Like I'm not demonstrably crazy

695
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:56,860
It's sort of a case of like, you know, the what's what's the phrase that basically mean like, you know

696
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:04,300
The the bigger wound gets the band-aid like what am I is there a idiom that means that agree the gray the squeaky wheel

697
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,380
Yes, thank you. Holy shit

698
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,660
Create a new idiom to try to remember that

699
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,860
The bigger

700
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:26,860
Squeaky wheel gets the grease so it's like, you know, yes, the people who are having uncontrollable panic attacks are the ones who are going to

701
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:30,260
You know, I mean who are gonna feel like they need to seek

702
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,460
help from somebody and

703
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,860
And get that dealt with and then the people of us who are like, okay

704
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,380
Well, I don't quite have uncontrollable panic attacks

705
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,940
But I feel everything just short of that and I still could use help

706
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:47,660
But I don't like need help so badly that I am a squeaky wheel, you know

707
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:53,020
So it's like I'm just a fucking half flat like I'm a halfway deflated wheel

708
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:57,740
I am I have poor traction on the road and I am a hazard, but I am not

709
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:05,580
Obvious enough for you to fucking get my air pumped up, you know, which is which is what I drive on basically is four of those

710
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,220
I mean a lot of

711
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,660
Like

712
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:16,460
Therapy or whatever is about or I don't know. I'm a fucking idiot and I don't know I'm talking about sorry if this is stupid

713
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:21,100
I'll go say it anyway. I think a lot like a lot of therapy and and psycho shit

714
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,300
Is about

715
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:29,940
Like just it's just about managing symptoms. Yes, like it's just and it like if your symptoms are managed

716
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:35,940
And if you feel that you are living more or less successfully without like great interruption from your issue

717
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:40,660
Whether you reckon whether you have issues or not if they're not fucking you up then that's okay

718
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,980
That is something that okay

719
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:46,460
I think this is a problem in basically advertising for psychology is that like

720
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:52,460
They they want to give everything a diagnosis so that everything is like clearly like we know what we're working towards

721
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:59,340
We have names for things and we can help these people out, but like by viewing everything that way

722
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:05,620
It's like like psychology is almost like an advertisement of like hey is your life really fucked

723
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,180
then you should come seek help here and it's like

724
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:15,540
Psychology and and therapy shouldn't be just for people whose life is uncontrollably fucked

725
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:21,660
It should be for anybody who's dissatisfied at all like you can iron out the dissatisfaction

726
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:25,620
You know like therapy and therapy doesn't have to be literally paying a

727
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:32,060
Psychologist to do it for you can just be talking to people because that's all it is you talk to a person who has more perspective than you

728
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:36,460
Do about how the mind works you you have plenty of friends who can probably give you

729
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:42,700
Something akin to a therapy session, you know if you have friends and if not make friends

730
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:47,980
It's it's it's good therapy, you know to talk to people who who could understand you but like

731
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,460
That's essentially all therapy is and if you understand

732
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:59,780
Psychology yourself you don't really need to talk to a therapist. You could just talk to other people who understand psychology

733
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,780
You know I have been

734
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:08,300
Because yeah, I've been thinking about that like for years like I don't really need to pay for things when I could have like people to talk

735
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,740
to but

736
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,500
It is a bad idea

737
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:17,100
Generally, I found to go to the public and to say on Twitter or in a YouTube video

738
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,820
Yeah, it's helpful somewhat because it's like a it's a different medium

739
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:27,860
But like I've got counseling like recently for the first time ever I've paid for a fucking bunch of stuff and

740
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,100
yeah, and I've had a few sessions now and

741
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:37,180
The the appeal is not that they know more than the people

742
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:43,580
Who could reply on Twitter or anything? I mean they do know more, but it's not that's not like the thing

743
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,580
I'm paying all this money for it's

744
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,860
the the the knowledge and

745
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:54,460
The the security that I can say all of this stuff and they are not ever

746
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:00,860
Going to cause they're not ever gonna cause Twitter drama. They're not ever gonna cancel me with this information

747
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,540
This information stays here

748
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:08,540
They are not like I am not at risk of making like ruining their day because it's their job to listen to me

749
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,540
I don't have to worry about like

750
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:18,540
Bringing the moods down or like doing anything to like a friend that would you know like make their day bad or you know

751
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:26,140
Whatever the the anxiety is like it's all just just speak and it's it's better than speaking to a brick wall or to a microphone

752
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:29,100
And then deleting the recording because it's a person and they can respond

753
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:37,260
Yeah, so it's like that is the value. I think the trust element is definitely is definitely when I when I see someone

754
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:42,860
Go on Twitter with like a problem, right and be like guys

755
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:48,980
I'm having a problem. This is really bothering me. Let me bear my soul. I'm

756
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,540
My reaction is not good. My reaction is is like, oh

757
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,820
if you're

758
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:59,340
This is not the place for that you're doing that you're doing it wrong

759
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:03,500
You're doing it wrong. I get I get why no no I get why they would do it

760
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:07,420
But I don't think they should and I think they should know better and I'm like

761
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:11,580
Don't please don't do this. I think it's it's sort of

762
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:15,580
It's sort of a matter of like these people don't know who

763
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:23,020
They can talk to and sure I would I would highly I totally sympathize for why I totally sympathize why they're doing

764
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:27,180
I just don't think it's going to do what they want it to do. I guess I guess I would say because like

765
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,820
those people

766
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:34,300
I completely agree with you like don't post in that kind of shit like on twitter is usually not

767
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:39,660
Very helpful, but it can attract people to your dms who might be able to help you

768
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:44,060
But maybe more effective than that is just going to people's dms like because people come

769
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:50,940
I opened up my dms after coming out. I have become a literal fucking guidance counselor for the entire

770
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:58,380
Trans anime community. So like you know, I I talk to people all the time about their issues and stuff

771
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,060
but

772
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,260
like

773
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,380
You know

774
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:05,260
It's easier if you're like coming to me

775
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:06,620
like

776
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:12,540
Hey, do you have a comment on this situation? And it's like, okay, like I know

777
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,580
I I know why you are coming to me

778
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,140
You know and like if I have a response, I'll give it to you if I don't I won't um

779
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,060
That's just it's as simple as that I give responses when I have thoughts

780
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:29,260
I read when I have time, you know, uh, if I'm interested if I'm bored

781
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:34,780
So it's not like I respond to absolutely everybody or anything like that. Um, just you know the level of engagement

782
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:40,620
I feel appropriate, but like, uh, you know, I do think that for a lot of those people

783
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:43,020
It's like they can't afford therapy

784
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:49,260
They don't they don't a lot of them just haven't yet accepted that they have a problem or like don't really they

785
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:54,540
Again, they think oh, I'm not that extreme like oh, I don't have panic attacks or oh

786
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,420
I don't have like extreme body dysmorphia and it's like, okay

787
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:04,140
Well, do you find that you live most of your life in a in a sort of dissociated haze or you're not really paying attention

788
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,420
Anything going on around you and it's like, oh, yeah, that's how I live every moment of my life

789
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,100
And it's like, okay seek therapy, you know, like that's not it's not supposed to be that way

790
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,620
It's like, yeah, uh, you know, you definitely

791
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,620
But it's all I've ever known

792
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:19,420
Say I'm so comfortable here

793
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,940
um

794
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,940
It's nice and gray

795
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:27,260
Imagine imagine living in an associative haze cringe

796
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,180
Associative haze boys

797
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,780
This hashtag

798
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:42,940
Um, Ben, you you're you're a lincoln park fan. Yeah

799
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:44,940
Yes

800
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:52,060
Yes, yes, that's right. So I've been thinking a lot about lincoln park and about chester bennington lately because of him killing himself and

801
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,420
Right, I don't know if you know much about his past

802
01:13:55,980 --> 01:14:03,980
But like no, it's nothing nothing at all. Uh, well, uh, it's horrible. So I'll say it in a funny way, uh, but he uh was

803
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,500
Sexually abused for like, uh years by

804
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:13,260
By like an older friend and he was afraid to say anything about it

805
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:17,500
You hate to see it. Yeah, he was afraid to say anything because he thought that they would think he was gay

806
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,420
and uh

807
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:25,100
Like it's it's it's really interesting because like that would really suck to imagine being gay

808
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,980
She's exactly

809
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,900
Uh, so he uh

810
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,260
he uh

811
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:39,580
You know, when you when you listen to lincoln park's music knowing this and knowing like

812
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,780
He was also he basically became an alcoholic

813
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,460
Uh

814
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,380
And like in early lincoln park

815
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:52,380
He was an alcoholic and a lot of the song like crawling is about alcoholism that like he said so as much as like

816
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,940
It's about my an inability to escape my alcoholism

817
01:14:55,340 --> 01:15:01,820
And when you look into the lyrics knowing why he was an alcoholic and he's talking about these wounds that will not heal

818
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:07,740
Uh and how fear is how I fall. It's like, okay. Well, this is what the song's about, you know, I see it to be fair

819
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:12,140
You can read almost anything you want into the lyrics of lincoln park song

820
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:17,260
Uh, but that's that's it's it was fascinating to me to because I've always felt that way

821
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,860
It's like oh anybody can project onto this

822
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:25,500
But once I actually knew what he is like what it's actually like what he actually went through personally

823
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,140
And I mean particularly with some of the later songs because

824
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,820
He you know, aside from the fact that he went through alcoholism

825
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:35,980
He later on uh, he because he became a recovered alcoholic

826
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:39,420
And there's a bunch of songs that are about like alcoholic recovery about

827
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:45,420
Recovering from your past traumas. They have one song on one of the songs. It's called like victimized. That's just like, you know

828
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,500
You've been victimized or whatever and uh, so like, you know

829
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:54,140
I think that he was he was dealing with these demons trying to move through them

830
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,580
And like holding himself to a really high standard

831
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:04,060
And it seems as though basically what happened is that when chris cornell the singer of uh, um

832
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:09,180
Soundgarden killed himself who was like one of chesters like best friends and personal idols

833
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,780
He like couldn't take it and not too long later

834
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,100
He lapsed

835
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:20,060
Drank some alcohol couldn't take the idea that he would become an alcoholic again and killed himself. So

836
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:26,620
Wait, who was it that died that made him relapse the the soundgarden lead singer, you know black hole sun

837
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,580
chris cornell, I don't know is okay

838
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:36,380
Cool. Um, so he had committed suicide not too long beforehand and then chester seemingly like fell as well

839
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:41,100
But anyways, it's it's fascinating to me because of the fact that

840
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:46,460
Um before he was in linkin park. I had not known this. He was a part of a band called gray days

841
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,300
just

842
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,540
Gray and then days da ze

843
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:55,900
Um, and I they they they like reproduced their first album

844
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:59,100
Before chester died. So like this was going to come out

845
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:04,860
Then he killed himself and it now is out like they finally released it the songs have been on the radio

846
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,100
And it was really funny because I saw that the when I first heard the song

847
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:12,780
I saw it said gray days and I thought oh, there's a band

848
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:17,340
That's called gray days. That's funny because mine. I've called myself gray

849
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:22,060
In reference to the fact that I spend my time in a gray days. This is perfect, right?

850
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:26,380
And I'm listening to it and I'm listening to the music and I'm like this sounds just like linkin park

851
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:30,060
Which is really funny because I grew up listening to linkin park and thinking, you know

852
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:35,820
Like connecting to those emotions not even realizing it was chester and his old band until I looked it up

853
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,820
And then I'm like, okay, this all makes sense

854
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:40,300
Um, but like the songs

855
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:45,260
The album is like I won't say it's great. You might enjoy it. Um

856
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:52,220
It's pretty all right like radio rock type music pretty much very like washed out and daisy

857
01:17:52,460 --> 01:18:00,060
But like the lyrics from the perspective of knowing that he killed himself the lyrics are too fucking depressing like

858
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,740
The the second track the second track is like

859
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,460
Maybe maybe things will get better

860
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,260
Maybe things will get brighter

861
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,660
Maybe maybe

862
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,780
And it's like oh no

863
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:22,540
And they did it they clearly did it. No, I guess I guess not. Well, maybe next time

864
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,500
But it's just funny because like that music

865
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:30,460
Again, like linkin park like you said the emotions are painted with such a broad brush

866
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:35,100
They don't seem to be about anything in particular and like listening to gray days, which is

867
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:41,260
They're even earlier, you know writings in linkin park like this is must be how he felt when he was a teenager

868
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:45,580
Maybe resurfacing these emotions gray days was from before linkin park. Yeah, that was the band

869
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,580
He was in for like six years before

870
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:53,260
Linkin park and they were like they broke up because they just like it wasn't going anywhere and then he joined

871
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,420
Linkin park and became huge so like

872
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,860
You know, I think he was basically trying to like readdress

873
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,500
these past emotions

874
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,660
And so he was thinking about them a lot

875
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:07,580
And then, you know, chris cornell killed himself and he's like well if chris couldn't make it

876
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,260
I can't fucking make it, you know

877
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:15,980
Because he tweeted something like after chris cornell died like I can't imagine like living in this world without you or something like that

878
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:17,820
um

879
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,420
Yeah

880
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:22,540
I mean if you ask me he might have been gay for chris cornell

881
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:27,820
And that was what was you know, what was no he was gay after all

882
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,780
I mean

883
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,260
That's just my personal theory, but like

884
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,580
uh, okay

885
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:40,620
You know, but like it's just like man the fucking the lyrics their lyrics that like again

886
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:46,300
If you heard this on the radio, you would just be like, oh, this is like cheesy fucking radio music

887
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:50,940
It's just so general it could be anything but it's like this motherfucker actually killed himself

888
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,500
And we know what he went through. We know he was an out of recovered alcoholic

889
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,340
We know he killed himself because he relapsed

890
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,540
We know that he was an alcoholic because he was trying to deal with these childhood demons

891
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,380
And he wouldn't talk about it

892
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:07,900
Like his wife became like a big advocate all the stuff surrounding him after his death that like all the money

893
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:12,940
Surrounding him is going towards uh, like basically boosting mental health

894
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:20,700
Normalization of like talking about it because like obviously he was somebody who the reason that the lyrics of lincoln park are so reserved

895
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,300
Is he didn't want to talk about it?

896
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:26,140
You know like he didn't want to be specific because it was too fucking hard to deal with so

897
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:30,860
Uh, you know which ironically makes it connect to the most possible people

898
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,740
But it means that he was the most guarded person

899
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:39,900
You know like the person least capable of actually confronting the reality of what had happened to him

900
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:44,380
Uh, so like and you know in his attempt

901
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,680
Ultimately fell. It's just depressing

902
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,780
Sorry to bring down the room

903
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,220
But I thought you'd appreciate that as a lincoln park fame

904
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:59,980
I do that's neat. No, I didn't know I knew chester killed himself. I didn't know shit about him other than that

905
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:02,620
Yeah, I hadn't been told recently either, but

906
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,500
Um

907
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,500
Well, hey we're at

908
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:14,220
We're at an hour and 20 and we've got like a million voicemails to get through but let's like try and rapid fire them

909
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:17,100
Yeah, but you still are you still here? I'm still here

910
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:22,060
You we're on we're on speak pipe if you want to oh the first one we're gonna do is

911
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:26,540
Yes, yes, I know. Yeah, there's like 30 fucking voicemails in here

912
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:31,820
I'm gonna try and just like we're gonna go fucking bup bup bup bup bup through all this shit because I'm

913
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,300
You know

914
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:39,420
Nate was like, uh, hey, I'll fucking curate these for a fee

915
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:42,540
Um, and I'm like no man anarchy

916
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,500
curation it's for the birds

917
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:51,340
Everybody everybody gets a platform here on the pro krastinators podcast

918
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,820
All right, call it and say some nazi shit. I don't give a fuck

919
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,260
Uh, okay, I'm there

920
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:01,740
Okay, here we go with ben playing d&d

921
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:04,860
three two one

922
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:07,740
go

923
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:14,140
Yeah, cool. All right. Good. Good stuff. They

924
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,260
True, it's like

925
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:21,900
You know that meme that's like what's your sign? I'm a leo. Fuck you. I don't believe in that made-up horseshit

926
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:27,820
And then he's like so true to the periodic table. I was excited by how short that one was but

927
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:32,540
Unfortunately, it's a rare breed amongst these in that regard

928
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:39,340
We don't have to listen to all of them if they're boring. Let's see how cognate cognate cognate potus potus potus is

929
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:48,860
Christ, okay. Here we go. Three two, but no, but I'm saying that's me. That's me going so true looking at this song

930
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:54,860
Ribbit ribbit ribbit. I'm a goddamn frog. Haven't played d&d in like two weeks now. Kind of kind of disappointed, but okay, whatever

931
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:58,860
Uh cognate potus three two one go

932
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:01,660
yo

933
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:03,820
cognate

934
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:07,100
I think this is gonna be boring running for president

935
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:16,540
Everyone is saying that it's like a trick by trump to get people uh to vote cognate. So then that like the everyone that is

936
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,620
All right, let's go to the next one

937
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,540
My my thoughts on this ever everyone says like oh no if people vote cognate

938
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:28,060
Then it'll split the vote and trump will win like I think a lot of people who would have voted for trump would vote for cognate

939
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:33,660
I don't see I don't see this as like a thing that's gonna exclusively like cut into the democrats at all

940
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:41,580
Uh, I I mean, I just straight up wouldn't have voted if not for cognate. I mean, I'm only going to vote if I can vote for cognate

941
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:47,740
Yeah, oh god, jesus. Oh, whatever fine. Yeah vote cognate. Yeah vote cognate. Fuck it

942
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:56,700
Fuck it. I'll do it live right you ready for super smash brothers pedo and g-note. I absolutely. I'm ready. Okay three two one go

943
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:02,140
It seems as if the super smash brothers plays are all pedophiles

944
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:07,340
They're all groping at children and kissing miners and then the dog is crazy

945
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:15,500
That's a narrow and zero and the catara are these super smash brothers. I don't know if we need 57 seconds of this

946
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,060
It's it's a terrible

947
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,740
Yeah, that's it. Okay, cool. Yeah for a second

948
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:30,460
Uh, yeah, it's it's another one. There's another super smash post ultimate pedo ultimate g-note

949
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:34,780
It's the same. It's almost the same length. Should we just listen to it? Let's do it. I guess so

950
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
Three two one go

951
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:43,100
Well, it's happened all of the fupus smash brothers play as a pedophiles

952
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,500
They have been confirmed as such

953
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,220
Fucking zero

954
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:55,100
This is a different voice. I guess he thought the first voice is still annoying. I don't I don't know if this is no better

955
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:59,180
If it's like a redo, I don't know if that's a remake or a sequel

956
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:00,460
Um

957
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:03,260
It seemed like he started off saying pretty much the same shit though

958
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:09,420
Oh, it was almost the second one. It's like well now it's all of them. So the oh the situation has progressed

959
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:12,220
Maybe not. Um, I was seeing people

960
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:15,820
I was seeing people on twitter saying like oh no

961
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:21,580
I saw someone say like god if my family finds out about this shit. It's all over

962
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:27,260
I won't be able to go to smash tournaments anymore. And at the time I didn't know the context but in hindsight i'm like

963
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:29,420
kind of hope

964
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:31,820
They don't have any smash tournaments for a while after this

965
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:37,340
Kind of hope they don't do it. They probably shouldn't be having smash tournaments in the middle of the uh, you know

966
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
COVID and all that yeah

967
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,060
I think it was vosh tweeted something about how like

968
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:47,820
Sky williams house is like the the epstein island of the smash community. Do you know about this?

969
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:54,620
Yeah, I I know nothing about any of this. I guess a lot of these smash tournaments were held at the home of this guy named

970
01:25:54,700 --> 01:26:00,060
Sky williams and it's not it doesn't there's no explicit accusations that sky william who I think is a guy

971
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:03,420
I don't even know that sky is a is a pedophile himself

972
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:07,740
But like I guess it was like at this house that like a lot of this fucking

973
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,460
I don't know fucking diddling it happened

974
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,940
So it's like I don't know big deal

975
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:20,300
The dillyard. Yeah, the dillyard's room. Uh, let's let's watch the best reality tv show of all time. Absolutely

976
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:23,180
in three two one go

977
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:30,220
I've recently discovered this uh, absolutely crazy fucking reality show and you might be thinking

978
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:33,500
Oh, well the reality shows they're all they're all staged man reality

979
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,460
It's fake

980
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:40,460
No, this is like the kind of reality show that gets canceled after the first season and it gets sued like a shit ton

981
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:45,980
times afterwards and years to come and then uh, the studio tried to hide its existence

982
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:52,380
But it still exists. It's on youtube and there's like a bunch of people talking about it

983
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,140
Get to the point. Yeah, what is it?

984
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:59,180
Mainly just john trun. He made some videos about it. I don't care about fucking john trun hilarious, man

985
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:04,780
And I uh, all of you should watch it. It's all what's it called youtube. It's called kid nation

986
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:09,100
It's fucking brilliant, man. They they take uh 40 kids

987
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:15,100
And they go to a literal ghost town and they just have them like to live there for 40 days

988
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,420
They just like lord of the flies like a class system

989
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:24,460
And uh, okay, okay, I'm interested. This is all just the first episode man, and they split them into like factions

990
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:28,060
I've only watched one episode so far, but it's fucking amazing

991
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,780
And so I've never heard of this

992
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:37,580
You gotta watch it man. You gotta I want to hear kid nation on the procrastinators podcast

993

01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,100
I don't know I

995
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,100
It sounds like it could be

996
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:48,380
insane

997
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:52,220
But but because this is like on tv. This is on cbs

998
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:55,180
So like how crazy can it really get you know?

999
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:56,300

You know who hasn't learned racism yet

1003
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:12,380
I have to say I don't know if I could possibly care about anything in the universe less than a minute and a half

1004
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:17,180
Of my true persona 5 opinion forget. I sent the other voicemails

1007
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:35,020

1008
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:39,900
And then another one was like, oh, I did it. Okay, but fuck that. Um, that I shouldn't have sent those

1009
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:43,420
I uh pretend I didn't this is the real opinion

Of persona 5 that everyone should wait wait. They don't they just unabashedly praise the fucking game

1011
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:54,460
Um, what's the opinion they think it's the best game of all time. It's not give me a number out of 10

Security no wait, sir. This might be our final chance. What donatello's appearance in pcp episodes

1030
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:23,180
Actually correlates perfectly with our ratings. We might be able to save the pcp if we send them back in time

1031
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:29,260
Fire up the time machine then listen area slimy green demented shell trash. We have to go back

So wow so long way of saying that we should get donatello on the pcp

1041
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:12,380
That was fantastic. I like I think that can be arranged. It had a music. It had a musical number. It had stakes

1042
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,540
It had rising action. Yeah

1043
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:18,460
I would call this this a masterpiece great acting great acting. Yeah

1044
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,260
Um

1045
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:26,780
You know, you really you really believe that this is a guy who's trying to yell into the microphone

1046
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:31,020
But has to keep his voice down so he so he doesn't bother his parents. You really buy it

1057
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:38,060
Because digi is a degenerate and ben is antifa. I did not but that is I I posted it on twitter

1058
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:42,860
I guess I'll I don't know if I want to link it in the description or anything. I kind of think

1059
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:50,780
I like the guy's been flooded with like youtube comments and I kind of don't know if we need to do any more of

01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:57,420
Of that. No, but um, I will I will post it for you here in the fucking chat so you can see but yeah

1062
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,780
degeneracy

1063
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:04,380
Antifa

1064
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:06,860

Um, uh, it's good stuff. It's it's great. You know, it's classic anyway

1068
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:21,740
Let's see if we can find something even better at this guy who's just got a youtube link as their name of their voice

1069
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:28,460
Okay, I'm gonna play it link is to please stop supporting digi bro the procrastinators by a dank wizard. Okay

1070
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:32,380
Oh, lol, okay, which is like a four almost 420

1071
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,940
length, so I don't know if it's a meme

1072
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,500
But uh, I don't I don't think so

1073
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,500
It is almost exactly for pretty

1074
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:44,380
I'm gonna play this this voicemail though just to see what it is three two one go

1075
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:52,700
Hey guys, have you seen this video? I'm linking as the title of this voicemail by a dank wizard

1076
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:58,060
It's fucking funny. We've seen it and it is pretty funny. All right. Good school

1077
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:04,060
So, okay, so that that previous voicemail was somebody making fun of a dank wizard for being a uh

1078
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:07,820
A dank pussy basically about a pussy a pussy wassy

1079
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,700
You think that was the real dank wizard

1080
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:18,300
No, I thought they were making fun of a dank wizard. I thought that was no

1081
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:22,700
No, I think that's I think that's what his real voice sounds like

1082
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:26,620
That's just how I think it's a controllable smooching

1083
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,660
It feels like what he would be

1084
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:32,780
I don't you know, it's funny. I'm not I'm not mad

1085
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:35,500
I just think it's funny that someone made a video like that

1086
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:40,700
And I have to share it on twitter because I just want to spread the love and good times around

1087
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:43,180
I want everyone to enjoy it as much as I do

1088
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:45,980
Uh, all right next one

1089
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:52,460
Thirteen seconds. Thank you merciful shower speed run chads three two one go

1090
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:58,380
Any fellow shower speed run shads still hanging around? I just got a

1091
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:03,340
149 that's pretty damn fast. I'm not sure I can get it any lower

1092
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:07,180
We'll see though. We we should have leaderboards

1093
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:12,700
149 doesn't seem that fast for a shower. I mean, what are the requirements? Like what all do you have to do?

1094
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:19,260
That yeah, like do I like if you have to use conditioner that it necessarily takes more than two minutes

1095
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:24,780
If it doesn't require a conditioner if it's just shampoo and body soap if you just use like an all-in-one

1096
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:27,180
It would take like what 30 seconds like

1097
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:33,100
I feel like I could do a really bad job washing myself off in like 30 seconds. Yeah

1098
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:38,780
Like just like jump in grab the soap rub it around rinse off jump out. You know like that's all it takes

1099
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,020
It's technically a shower

1100
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:45,260
Well, we need categories. We need categories, right? We need speed run categories

1101
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:51,180
It's like, you know the category for like you with conditioner without conditioner shampoo. No shampoo, you know

1102
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:55,020
Yeah, how rich is your lather? All right hippo. What were you trying to say?

1103
01:35:55,980 --> 01:36:01,500
I'm sorry. By the way, sorry. I still call you hippo because I realized everybody's calling you gib again

1104
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:06,700
Since you don't really have an active hippocrite channel. I just got so used to saying you hippo

1105
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:09,420
It has a good cadence to it. Uh

1106
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,620
I don't mind. I feel like there's still no consensus

1107
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:20,140
My my my preferred my preferred pronoun is gib. Is it okay? I was told that so I was like, okay

1108
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:25,100
But like it it you know, it doesn't matter. It's like it's it's just like I prefer the word give

1109
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:27,580
I've never actually been sure

1110
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:32,300
Well, uh now, you know, I'm just saying

1111
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:35,900
I've been getting into the long play shower game

1112
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:44,620
Where I I I use the shower as my my chance to meditate and I I sit like crouch at the at the bottom of the shower

1113
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:48,780
And I close my eyes and I go into a deep trance and I wake up

1114
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:55,100
Um, and uh, it takes a very long time. So I made a new category long play

1115
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:59,980
Uh, you we need it's it's it's good. Okay. We we can have a leaderboard

1116
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:03,180
But the thing is we're gonna need like it needs to be verified

1117
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:06,700
So you're gonna have to film yourself showering and send it to us

1118
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:13,660
Uh, and we're gonna have to manually review each submission in order to verify that no, uh, you know that there were no cuts in the footage

1119
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:19,100
Yes, and that you were playing all the pictures that you and that you were playing on approved hardware

1120
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:23,980
Approved hardware only in that you must have tits

1121
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:27,020
end of vagina

1122
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:29,260
That's the hardware i'm talking about

1123
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:31,820
Okay, okay

1124
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,620
One piece more like one piss

1125
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:37,340
I am ready as a matter of fact

1126
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:39,820
three two one go

1127
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:44,700
PCP more like ppc

1128
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,300
In other words, yeah

1129
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:56,300
It's like it's like the regular ocean this guy's like on crystal math

1130
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,980
It's the ppc

1131
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:03,180
Like this guy

1132
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:05,900
Crastinators

1133
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,980
Hey

1134

1135
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:15,580
I think this guy's actually on i think he's actually on drugs guys. I would very much believe that

1136
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:19,020
Voice grail voice grail

1137
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:25,100
No voice we got up. I'm sorry. We have we're hard. We're hard on crime hard on drugs

1138
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:29,420
The drug war rages. We got to put him in jail and get his put him in voice. No voice grail

1139
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,900
We didn't abolish it the funniest voicemail i've ever heard

1140
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:34,620
Hmm

1141
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:43,500
The line is like the year in ocean the line between greatness and and idiocy is so is so paper thin in a case like this

1142
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:51,420
Genius or insanity. I am ready for an emotional journey because the next two are called margarh and margarh's apology

1143
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:57,180
Margarh has been margarh has been sending voicemails like the last several weeks

1144
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:05,420
So they've clearly got a lot to say so let's well, they're they're saying something and then apologizing. So that's what i'm the most curious about

1145
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:11,420
Let's let's let's jump in there with them three two one go

1146

Hello pcp

1147
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:18,540
Yeah, I do always send the voicemails late on saturdays

1148
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:22,700
And I guess that means that I usually end up being the final voicemail

1149
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:26,140
Uh having been the final voicemail two weeks in a row

1150
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:32,220
I'd like to issue a challenge to the community to uh beat me and be the final voicemail

1151
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:34,860
Um, I haven't even been trying so

1152
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:42,220
He succeeded massively on I mean a lot of people want this challenge because there's like 10 more of these

1153
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:46,780
Things after this you're yeah, he's he's already won because like yeah

1154
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:51,500
He normally sends he was the last one because he would always send it on like the day of or the day before

1155
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,500
but this time we got like

1156
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:58,620
We got like 10 voicemails in the last like 12 hour or in the last like 24 hours

1157
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:00,940
So I don't know what's up with that

1158
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:05,100
So next margar's apology. Let's find out what he's so sad about

1159
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:07,660
three two one go

1160
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:14,140
Hey margar here. I'd like to issue a formal apology to mr. Tom oliver

1161
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:20,460
Uh recently one of my voicemails. I asked why there were so few members coming onto the podcast

1162
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:26,060
And tom clarified that it's literally because of the fucking unemployment shit

1163
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:30,380
That uh, it's just better for him to not show up as much. So

1164
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:33,500
Uh pretty cringe, uh bad

1165
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:37,740
Bad take on taxes from the government. Uh

1166
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:44,460
No hate towards tom though. You got to do what you got to do. Uh, so sorry. I complained about that

1167
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:49,580
But the complaint stands for all the others unless you justify it. So fuck you

1168
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:54,380
I don't know what an apology was necessary for

1169
01:40:56,300 --> 01:41:01,740
I'm I'm fucking on unemployment too and I all and I just show up anyway. So, uh, you know, whatever

1170
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:07,100
No, no, fuck tom. No fuck tom and fuck you too margar voice jail voice jail. Huh, huh?

1171
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:09,420
I thought we abolished the voice no

1172
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:13,020
We did not the the stream only raised enough to free

1173
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:17,980
I think it was three out of the eight people in voice jail. So we did not fully abolish it

1174
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:23,900
We did defund it though, which is something. Um, but we're still we have voice voice chair

1175
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:26,220
Hmm

1176
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:32,380
Voice chair, you know for the ones we really don't like oh like with a single bare light bulb hanging above them. Yeah

1177
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,420
Yeah, see

1178
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:39,820
This'll be easier if they tell us their voicemail secrets

1179
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,380
Uh, next one

1180
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:45,020
11 seconds message to ben part two

1181
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:48,940
Mysterious three two one go

1182
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:51,660
What did I tell you ben?

1183
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:54,060
Get off twitter

1184
01:41:54,380 --> 01:42:00,540
Bad ben bad ben shoo shoo shoo go to your room. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Fuck

1185
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:07,820
I hate the yes. I know twitter bad twitter bad, but we all do it. We're all guilty. I love trying so

1186
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:11,100
I have no bad relationships with twitter

1187
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:14,060
I you know, I just I was thinking about it

1188
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:18,140
All like all you see all you see are the worst takes on twitter

1189
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:20,700
But I don't know i'm with two minds about this because on the one hand

1190
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:27,980
Yes, what I get on twitter is a concentrated stream of the worst things that happen and the worst things that people think and it makes me upset

1191
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:33,100
So is that reality because on the one hand I genuinely believe that these are real things that people think

1192
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:36,300
On the other hand, they're probably not as common as they seem

1193
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:41,980
When you when you're getting them. Well, it's both that they're not as common and also that these people are not as likely like

1194
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:49,020
Acting on these beliefs like like I think I think most people have like it's easier to talk shit on twitter

1195
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:50,540
Yeah, well not just talk shit

1196
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:57,020
But I think that people live in ways that are contrary to their beliefs without realizing it because it's easy to like

1197
01:42:57,340 --> 01:42:59,340
To to intellectually

1198
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:03,420
Internalize a set of beliefs but to actually like perform in a way that would best

1199
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,780
Cause like your like to best further your cause

1200
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:12,940
Is really difficult for people on on any side like most of your life is dedicated to just trying to live your life

1201
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:20,300
Not trying to further anything and like in many cases living your life is actively furthering causes that are against you

1202
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,860
And you really can't help it. I mean like you've you've said many times

1203
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:26,140
There's no ethical consumption under capitalism, you know like sure

1204
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:29,260
So it's just and I am and I did invent that phrase as well

1205
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:32,140
To make you to make people understand

1206
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:34,140
Yes

1207
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,900
Sorry twitter is

1208
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,900
Yeah, go ahead

1209
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:41,020
I was just gonna say twitter is like reductionist goggles

1210
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:46,700
Like you put them on and you see the most reduced form of a person due to the character limit

1211
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:51,740
And then through that you form opinions that are not necessarily correct in any way

1212
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:55,980
All in the people that are speaking and then you get a sense that things are terrible

1213
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:00,380
And I don't know whether it's it's actually that as as bad as it is

1214
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:04,540
Uh, I mean there are genuinely there are genuinely terrible people

1215
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:11,260
Let's let's acknowledge twitter amplifies it. Yeah. No, it's true. I mean I definitely I

1216
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:18,780
Ben I think in many ways that you you are right in your approach to twitter because like people take it too seriously

1217
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:21,740
Well, it's not like okay like

1218
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:26,060
The way that you go about it is I was I was I was catching some flags

1219
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:30,060
I was catching some flak the other day about my approach on twitter

1220
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:35,340
Yeah, I would say the way you go about it is alienating and like there are definitely people who it's gonna make mad

1221
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:38,060
But do I think it's necessarily ineffective?

1222
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:43,340
Like I do think that you if you if you really have a problem with the things that people are saying

1223
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:47,900
Aggressively letting them know that will cause them to reflect

1224
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:53,820
They might just double down on hating you, but they will have to think about their beliefs that much is true

1225
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:56,780
And I do like I I do not endorse bullying

1226
01:44:56,860 --> 01:45:01,100
But do I think bullying doesn't work or that it can't be a viable tactic? No

1227
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:08,140
And so like ultimately I don't I don't see anything that I do is bullying. I am am I caustic sometimes?

1228
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:12,140
Yes, do I say mean things? Yeah, but like would you say it's but it's bully

1229
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:15,260
It's bullying if there's like an unfair an unfair power dynamic

1230
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:19,340
I mean if I say bullying I feel like it's a cuter way of saying being abusive

1231
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,700
Or or abrasive like what do you want me to say?

1232
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:26,460
Those are not the same thing. Those are not those are two different things. They could be close

1233
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:29,340
Am I abrasive? Yes. Am I abusive?

1234
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:34,700
I don't think so unless like insulting someone is automatically abusive. I wouldn't say so

1235
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:37,180
I think you're I don't think that you are uh

1236
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:42,860
I I I wouldn't call you abusive. I do insult people like I definitely do that

1237
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:49,020
Yeah, I saw some of the flak you were getting and some of the the responses would just sort of like

1238
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:57,580
Uh, you're not gonna further any causes by the way you act right and you were getting really mad like do you think it's

1239
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:05,020
Do you think it's like annoying that people expect you to be fighting for a cause with everything you say a little a little

1240
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:09,020
Yeah, a little because I I always feel a little like like

1241
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:11,740
if if I like

1242
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:13,980
There's like a watch on your back like

1243
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:17,980
If you're gonna be progressive you better be progressive in exactly the right way

1244
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:23,980
Otherwise, we're gonna shit on you as well. It was it was I was getting a little annoyed because yeah the feeling I was getting was like

1245
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:25,820
Ben

1246
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:32,620
We we you you know we share these like we share these ideas. We share goals politically culturally whatever

1247
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:39,900
And what I want is to see you pursuing those things optimally and the way you are comporting yourself

1248
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:47,180
Is not optimized and I'm like you might be right. Well, I mean it's kind of also like no I'm not going to like

1249
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:51,900
Who I'm not going to behave off literally who you know that can be optimal

1250
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:56,220
Who can behave optimally all the time is in in any given situation

1251
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:59,660
Would I maybe get better results from being like hey?

1252
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:05,900
I see that you said this weird thing you said something about the jews that I don't agree with and I have some historical like

1253
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:10,940
References that you might want to read that might disprove some of your hypotheses like let me go through them one by one and point

1254
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:14,140
Maybe that would be more effective than saying like like like fuck off

1255
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:18,140
Nazi right maybe that's more effective, but I'm not going to do that

1256
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:19,580
I can't do that

1257
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:23,420
What do I get the most bang for my buck from and you know this is in terms of both

1258
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:27,500
Impact on the water broader world at large and also like how does it affect me?

1259
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:32,620
How taxing and painful is it for me to go through exactly that's that's the part it's like being

1260
01:47:33,260 --> 01:47:41,260
Being polite is like it takes effort. It takes like if you are not I think there are people out there who just naturally are

1261
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:43,980
Frankly, I have a low capacity for it. I really do

1262
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:49,660
I mean there are people out there who have who really are good at being polite and understanding and

1263
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:52,300
Like it's just the way they were raised

1264
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:55,500
You know it's just they they came up with that and like for me

1265
01:47:56,140 --> 01:48:01,740
It's it's not that I don't want to be polite and understanding. It's just really hard, you know, and it's like

1266
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:04,620
I I think

1267
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:06,300
As long as I mean in my mind

1268
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:08,700
It's like as long as I'm trying my best to not be like

1269
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,860
Deliberately an asshole

1270
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:14,380
Then I feel like I like I'm not going to overextend myself

1271
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:21,340
To the to the like furthest extent I can to be the nicest I possibly can especially to people who are being mean to me

1272
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,500
It's like if you are being mean to me

1273
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:29,020
I am going to feel you know, like hey, you you really need to know

1274
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:33,180
Like I guess it's it's kind of like if somebody was

1275
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:39,180
Bumping into you constantly and you kept saying stop or like could you move away and they weren't doing anything

1276
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:43,500
At some point you just have to fucking jam your elbow into them and just be like get the fuck away from me

1277
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:45,580
You know, so it's like

1278
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:50,620
If you if you want to live in this world you have to be somebody who can eventually just say like hey

1279
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:54,700
Your existence threatens me and I'm going to do something about it, you know

1280
01:48:55,260 --> 01:49:01,020
My yeah my last argument on the way about the way I can port myself on twitter is there are now

1281
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,980
I might be I will admit that maybe I am

1282
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:06,140
inclined to

1283
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:12,140
Take this approach maybe slightly more often than it is strictly necessary, right? I'll grant that but there are some

1284
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:17,020
Things there are some ideas. There are some opinions. There are some things that people can say

1285
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:19,740
That I believe are so

1286
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:25,660
Are so despicable and so wrong that to that to try and like

1287
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:27,020
Like

1288
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:32,380
Respond to them thoughtfully and to to try and like answer them and rebut them

1289
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:34,860
Is like doing them too much credit

1290
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:38,700
I mean it's it's sort of like and and and a more way let me fit and a more appropriate response

1291
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:43,340
And in some of those cases, I think a more appropriate response is not to even do so at all

1292
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:47,340
But just to say like I have nothing but contempt for that. I will not answer this

1293
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:52,380
I I will simply express my disgust and that's all that is required at the root because it's like

1294
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:56,060
You could attack what they're saying, but like what they're saying

1295
01:49:56,860 --> 01:50:02,620
Like in order to express how wrong it is you would have to peel back so many layers of the wrongness

1296
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:07,260
It's like this is this is not even from a perspective capable of expressing

1297
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:12,540
Something correct because it is so wrong and so like at that level. It's like

1298
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:19,180
My inclination would be more likely to just ignore it like even if I thought even if I did have like a visceral

1299
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:23,900
Reaction of hatred towards something I read my reaction is like I don't want to get involved

1300
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:27,340
I don't want drama. I don't want to I don't want to get to I don't want to get into an argument

1301
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:31,980
But I do understand why like if you have that reaction and you say something like again

1302
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:36,780
Even if in the short term it doesn't seem to have quote-unquote an effect

1303
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:39,660
Like when you let people know that you have a problem with them

1304
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:45,580
Then they are going to have to think about the fact that they're going to think about that fact and granted

1305
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:47,980
I think that when you are super aggressive

1306
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:55,340
It is more likely that the conclusion they'll come to is well. Fuck you even harder than sure like I don't think that

1307
01:50:55,820 --> 01:51:00,140
I don't think it's a bad thing to put it in people's head that people have a problem with them

1308
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:07,100
You know like yeah, that's that is step one towards changing your behavior. You know to to us too

1309
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:11,180
I think I think that just like putting up any

1310
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:18,780
Yeah, I feel like the word resistance kind of aggrandizes just being a should be like being shitty being me and insulting someone online

1311
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:24,380
But like putting up any kind of resistance at all to something that you think is bad and needs to change is like well

1312
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:29,260
It's not it's not is it optimal who knows but I do think it's right to do that

1313
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:34,060
And I don't ever feel but I almost never feel bad about it unless I decide like oh

1314
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:36,300
I read this wrong or like I misinterpreted

1315
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:42,460
Well, I mean worst-case scenario you change it back like I think I think one of the biggest problems facing our like generation

1316
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:49,420
And the the one of the things caused by the anxiety we all feel is like we're so afraid of doing it wrong

1317
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:53,100
Of like hurting somebody's feelings and then not knowing how to deal with it afterwards

1318
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:58,460
And it's like the best way to deal with it is like if you were wrong admit it as fast as possible

1319
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:04,940
And make things right, you know, just be like oh, I'm sorry. I was wrong like I've changed my mind

1320
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:08,620
I understand that I that you that you were not saying what I thought you were saying

1321
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:11,100
We're cool now, you know, like

1322
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:16,060
It's just like adaptability is the way to navigate conversation, you know

1323
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:18,380
Yeah

1324
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:25,900
Although I'm usually not that interested in a conversation. I'm usually just interested in expressing an idea or a feeling and then like leaving

1325
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:31,100
I mean, I think that you're I guess what I'm saying is that from the perspective of other people

1326
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:34,700
Analyzing your actions. It's kind of like they look at it as oh, well

1327
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:38,940
I wouldn't do this because I wouldn't want to face the social ramifications of this

1328
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:40,700
um, so

1329
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:43,500
like so ben you need to stop because like

1330
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:50,460
They assume you wouldn't either. Yeah, I don't want to I don't want to face the social ramifications of this

1331
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:53,100
So I should become the social ram right exactly

1332
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:59,820
That is literally exactly a little dude people people fucking like that though and and we do it to ourselves too

1333
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:03,900
We're like I don't want to be too mean to these guys because I know that like in a way

1334
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:09,820
They have their hearts in the right place, but I whatever I do think it was dumb the whole the whole discussion was stupid

1335
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:14,460
It's like I think that uh, that you know, we can get into a

1336
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:20,300
Shit, I forgot what I was going to say. I heard a weird noise and it distracted me. Let's play the next fucking speak pipe

1337
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:23,660
Yeah, yeah, we're ready. Uh, next one is pancakes

1338
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:26,220
Confederate lost cause movement

1339
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:28,380
Three two one go

1340
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:35,580
Hi pancakes here. Listen, you don't have to play this voicemail. I'm just here to tell you something that you might be interested in

1341
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:40,860
You know with all the tearing down statutes and stuff. I feel like you might

1342
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:45,020
Look at the lost cause of the Confederacy

1343
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:50,380
It's uh, it's holy fuck. This is weird. I don't care. Interesting

1344
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:56,380
and fucking no, it's not it's not interesting like what are some of the long lasting impacts

1345
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:58,540
They're the ones that uh

1346
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:00,620
Just did the issue that

1347
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:04,220
Civil war is not based on slavery but based on states rights

1348
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:06,940
Check it out. Oh, he's

1349
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:11,660
Is that it? Do you ever hear a video game? What the fuck? What the fuck was the point of this like?

1350
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:13,660
Yes, I know

1351
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:15,420
I know that they's

1352
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:18,780
Okay, did you ever heard of reddit.com? Did you I know you were talking over a little bit?

1353
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:22,700
So maybe I missed something, but I don't think I did was the point of this just to say that the south

1354
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:25,180
Claimed that it was about states rights

1355
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:26,460
Yes, I know and yes

1356
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:32,540
I know that the conf that the confederate flag was known for for a while as a symbol of lost causes because that's what it is

1357
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,860
And it was you know now it's racist or whatever

1358
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:36,060
Um

1359
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:41,020
Did you know that it's and I also happened to know that what is considered today to be the confederate flag was

1360
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:46,540
Is not the flag of the confederacy. It was a battle flag of a regiment in virginia. I mean it just seemed like he was saying

1361
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:49,260
Just look into this thing. It's interesting

1362
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:55,980
Which is fuck you pancakes. Uh, well, he's got the fuck out of here. It's food for oh god

1363
01:54:56,220 --> 01:55:00,940
All right, this better be good if you want to redeem yourself. Okay, three two one go

1364
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:10,060
Hi pancakes here. Listen, you know how most people are vegetarians because of the moral implication of killing a certain being for its flesh

1365
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:13,420
Bombs if we reach into the future

1366
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:21,260
Where we no longer grow animals, but like use their dna to just grow the meat itself without

1367
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,980
Ascention being being involved

1368
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:30,620
Then for people like tom or something would you be more inclined to tom's not a vegetarian anymore?

1369
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:34,940
Is he no, he's not but I mean obviously his answer that question would be yes, like

1370
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:42,300
Absolutely, obviously anyone who does it for ethical reasons would be like, oh, there's no ethical problem with this food

1371
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:46,700
I guess I'll eat it unless there and problem wasn't like environmental concerns and then it's like oh

1372
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:53,260
Well, what's the impact of this genetic farmer? Are they creating more fossil fuel? Okay easy easy question easy answer pancakes never fucking dark

1373
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:55,340
in my doorstep again

1374
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:58,220
That food for thought had like zero calories

1375
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:03,660
Burn owned

Ben saint must endorse

joseph robin hat biden jr

01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:04,060
I'll terminate all your channels

1396

Damn, that's mean though john youtube. Uh, we just make a twitch. Fuck you. Don't do it. Don't do it

1397
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,500
Don't do it youtube

01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:38,060
Remember that the gif button the gif button discussion that I filmed

Where tom tom was champion. Yeah, yeah, that's lost. Yeah the cringe trial cringe trial, right? Yeah

1404
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:48,140
Ah, that was good times, man

1405
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:53,740
If only we could revisit them on some sort of platform for for hosting video media

1406
01:57:54,620 --> 01:58:00,780
Uh, but unfortunately no such platform exists because the only things I know about are fucking demons

1407
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:05,820
Who just fucking kill channels and destroy content and ruin lives for no reason? Yeah, it's a real bummer

1408
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:09,340
And I don't know why it has to be like this, but uh, it is

1409
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:14,300
Let's let's let's just not never give it give it any more thought

1410
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:17,740
Uh, next one is give me the buster cast

1411
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:20,220

Thank you

1416
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:41,580
I wait what happened to the buster cast it was destroyed. I wasn't it. What was it?

1417
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:45,660
Was it? I'm not sure. Was it not caught in a blast radius?

1418
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:48,460
um

1419
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:50,460
I I don't know

1420
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,540
um

1421
01:58:55,500 --> 01:59:01,420
Was the wait that was post no that was post radcon, right? So yeah, it would have been destroyed

1422
01:59:02,860 --> 01:59:03,820
um

1423
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:05,820
Yeah, so

1424
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:07,580
It'll be back

1425
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:09,180
When youtube

1426
01:59:09,180 --> 01:59:13,980
Do have I complained about how youtube just keeps telling us they're gonna fix it and not doing it?

1427
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:16,060
Have I said that yet this episode?

1428
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:20,060
Because it really bears repeating explicitly it's just now, but I'm glad they just keep

1429
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:26,540
Like nate nate keeps it like for the last like week or two nate keeps emailing them and they keep saying like hi

1430
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:30,460
Hi, nate. This is greg filling in for my colleague, george

1431
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:36,940
Thank you for your patience on this matter due to the situation around surrounding covet 19 our staff is limited

1432
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:43,100
And so our backlog is blah blah blah. We appreciate your patience and we will be letting you know when there are developments on your case

1433
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:47,740
Thank you for reaching out appreciate your patience. Love you. I like how I like how the

1434
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:56,620
Disease that causes everybody to have to be in their houses is somehow causing this internet-based company to do less work

1435
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,100
Like what the fuck?

1436
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:03,020
I can't work from there. Literally. I guess there's literally no work involved

1437
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:07,500
One person just needs to fucking hit some buttons. Yeah to say undelete the content

1438
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:13,900
Like just fucking undelete maybe the employees have gone from one to zero and it's all robots now

1439
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:18,460
Like it's really frustrating

1440
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:25,100
I feel I feel like they wouldn't lie like it's not that I think they're honest, but I don't see what they gain

1441
02:00:25,740 --> 02:00:27,260
by telling us

1442
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:31,580
Be patient. They're just disorganized as fuck if they're not gonna do it

1443
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:35,740
So I feel like at some level they do intend to do it

1444
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:42,380
But will they ever that's the question is a totally different question three months at least I'm thinking

1445
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:47,900
And then they're gonna bring back like half of the videos and we have to do it again

1446
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:54,540
Three months of winter coveted and awesome quarantine. Let's cheer ourselves up with this. Thank you message
