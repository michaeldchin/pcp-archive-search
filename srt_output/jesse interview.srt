00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Hello everybody and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Digibro and I am doing yet another interview this time with the Endless One himself, Mr. Endless Jess.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,720
The people demanded it. They were barreling down the doors for an interview with yours truly.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:29,920
Let's talk about right off the bat how butthurt, Ben and Nate are. How butthurt they are right now as we speak, still being butthurt, talking amongst themselves, screaming and whining like petulant babies in the chat as we're talking.

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,080
Oh my god. I'm Ben. I'm the best guy ever and everyone just wants to hear from Endless Jess.

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:46,080
What's so great about him? Well you know I'm sorry guys. Maybe you should put in the work to become the most entertaining motherfucker on the face of the earth in the entire history of humanity every day of your life.

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:54,400
It's that simple. Just get good. The people will want to hear more from you if you just get good, faggots. That's why they want me.

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:06,320
That's why they call out for a savior, for Endless Jess to come down from my throne in Valhalla and bring a little brightness into their lives with that special gift of gab that only I have.

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,040
Not you, me. Only I. That's why they want me. That's why they love me. That's why they don't love you. That's why they beg for me when you're on screen.

9
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,000
I knew that rant was coming at the start of this.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,080
So Jesse, you and I have been friends for a good, what, god, three years now?

11
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Yeah, it's about three years. It's gotta be.

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:39,200
Holy shit. That's a long fucking time. Other than Tom, if you were a woman, I'd have thrown you to the curb by now. I would have gotten sick of you after two weeks.

13
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:48,160
I think other than Tom, you're probably the longest still active friendship I have on the internet.

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:56,160
My oldest friend. The good old old school fool with that old school cool. The Endless one.

15
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,160
So to start with, I want to ask you some stuff about your backstory.

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:13,120
Particularly where your persona and comedy, not so much persona, but you have this very self-aggrandizing attitude.

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,120
You're definitely a big fan of your own work and you think you're better than everybody else.

18
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,120
And I want to know how that came to be.

19
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Because some people say that. Some people say that he's arrogant or egotistical or too much of a fan of himself.

20
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,080
But then at the exact same time, other people go, oh, he's too self-deprecating. He's just too down in himself and mopey and whiny.

21
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Well, which is it, you stupid motherfuckers?

22
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Gee, maybe I'm not egotistical or depressed. Maybe I'm just a normal, actual fucking human who's confident in the work that I have put in the effort to know for a fact is good.

23
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Maybe I'm not egotistical. Maybe I just know what I'm good at.

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Yeah, I think the impression I've always gotten is sort of that you're self-aware enough to see your own flaws.

25
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,040
But I think that you still seem to think that the net positive is higher than anyone else's net positive.

26
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
You know what I mean?

27
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Yeah.

28
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Like, we're all flawed. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, but you have more strengths than anybody else.

29
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
That seems to be how you present yourself.

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,040
That, and I don't think that anybody on the internet has a right to assume that they know what my flaws are.

31
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Right.

32
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Like, I'm the only fucking person who can criticize me, maybe me and some people who know me in real life, like some girlfriends that I've been dicks to or friends.

33
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:54,040
You know, anyone who actually knows me, fine, go ahead and say that Jesse, that he smells bad 60% of the time or that he says nigger too much.

34
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,040
If you know me in real life, those are totally valid complaints.

35
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Wait, are you sure you're talking about yourself and not me?

36
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Those are two complaints a lot of people have about me.

37
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,040
I think we are kindred spirits in many ways.

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,040
That's probably why we've been hanging out for so long.

39
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:27,040
I don't know, I just think that, yeah, that's kind of how I feel about criticism on the whole is just that I think that nobody really has the right to criticize art except for the person who made it, because they're the only one who really knows.

40
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:35,040
I mean, yeah, if you pay to go see a movie, you have a right to say that was a shitty movie, but as far as like, I don't know.

41
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Telling them what they did.

42
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Yeah.

43
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:52,040
We talked about this in the commenter rules how it's like, or in the authorial intent podcast, so you weren't there for that, I think, but that the only person who really knows what they were trying to do is the author.

44
00:04:52,040 --> 00:05:03,040
And it's like, you can criticize how well it appealed to you, but you can't really criticize what the author was trying to do unless you completely understand what they were trying to do.

45
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:12,040
So a complaint like, or a complaint like he is an egomaniac or he has too much of an ego.

46
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Well, how the fuck do you know that? You don't know anything except what you see on a fucking YouTube video that is designed first and foremost to be hilarious and to make me laugh.

47
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Right.

48
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
I hate everybody.

49
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,040
I'm already sweating. I'm already at that level.

50
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:35,040
What I want to know, though, is where your like sort of personality comes from in your past.

51
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Oh, yeah, that was the question we got. I already got way off on something.

52
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:55,040
If there is any specific point, I guess to lead into it because for me, you know, I've been I've been watching you for a long time and what's unique about our relationship is that we're not just friends, but I'm also a really big fan of your work.

53
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:07,040
And one of my general favorite content for everyone that I talk to, I don't I have a real problem taking people seriously as human beings if I'm not a big fan of their work.

54
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Right.

55
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:19,040
I feel pretty similar. It's hard. It's a lot harder for me to like keep up communications with someone if they're not making things because so much of my life is making things.

56
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
That's what I want to talk about.

57
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,040
It's the world that I inhabit and I can't it's hard to relate to someone who doesn't inhabit that same world.

58
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Right. And I think that's, you know, I'm probably I'm willing to say more than anyone I am the most invested in your work other than yourself because I watch all of it and I talk to you about it while it's being made.

59
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:48,040
And so that's good that you are because you're one of the only people that I trust besides myself to articulate my work to anyone.

60
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Because I feel like everybody else in the world explains my videos wrong and it just adds to the growing frustration of nobody getting it.

61
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Like whenever whenever some commenter tries to defend me in the comments, like some guy will be like this guy, he's not funny.

62
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
And then like immediately some commenter will rush to my defense.

63
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
But instead of just saying, no, fuck you, he's funny.

64
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:17,040
You're like a comedy subjective or like some normal sounding defense of me, they'll launch right into you don't understand the artistic intent of Jesse's master plan.

65
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:24,040
This web that he weaves goes beyond what any of us mere mortals can possibly comprehend just from watching a single YouTube video.

66
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
It's like, okay, that's just making me sound worse.

67
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
That's not helping.

68
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Yeah.

69
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,040
It's true, but it's not helping.

70
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Yeah.

71
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Well, along the line, there was a point towards, I guess, the back end of 2014, where you started up the drowning in kayfave channel.

72
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:49,040
And you started talking about wrestling and describing like these hours long vlogs describing wrestling history.

73
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,040
And it all kind of culminated in the horseshoe finale.

74
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,040
And it was interesting because I'd known you for a long time by then and I didn't know anything about wrestling.

75
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:05,040
And then once you explained all of it to me, that's when like your persona finally clicked and I understood what you were trying to do.

76
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Like, I think you're someone who the more you understand where like your influences and where you're coming from, the easier it is to parse what your channel is.

77
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Yeah.

78
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Yeah.

79
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
And I.

80
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
What?

81
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Yeah.

82
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Oh, sorry.

83
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:30,040
I think some of the difficulty in that for a lot of people who find the channel is that like, you know, a lot like my little pony fans, for instance, like, where are they coming from?

84
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:42,040
They're like these high schoolers watching a, you know, a little girls show, maybe didn't grow up with wrestling and don't understand like that this is a type of thing that has existed before.

85
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Because I think if you just stumble upon endless jests with no idea like those kinds of influences, then it's like, why is this man screaming at me?

86
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
You know, what did I do wrong?

87
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
He seems so angry.

88
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
He seems so violent.

89
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:06,040
But then if you're familiar with something like wrestling where that's the whole entertainment of it is a bunch of violent, crazy people screaming at each other.

90
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Then it's like, okay, I get that this is a form of entertainment that has existed long before you did it, you know, even if you're, you know, obviously putting your own unique spin on it.

91
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Yeah, fuck them.

92
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
And you.

93
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
That's what you were getting at, right?

94
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Yes, fuck them.

95
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
They're all stupid.

96
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Yeah, of course.

97
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
They should all burn in a garbage can.

98
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Yeah.

99
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Yeah, I want to know.

100
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,040
So you, you have a lot of influences from like outside YouTube.

101
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Yeah, like, yeah, mostly.

102
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Yeah, I think very few of my influences are within the YouTube sphere.

103
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,040
I mean, I consider James Ralph an influence, but that's about it.

104
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,040
As far as YouTube goes, I come from like, how did you end up on YouTube is what I want to know.

105
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:07,040
It's just, it was, I don't know, I just kind of fell into, it's just the most convenient platform to get my stuff out, because I don't really, like, I'm a big fan of stand-up comedy and I'm a big fan of doing stand-up comedy.

106
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,040
I've only done it a few times, but every time I did it, I felt really good.

107
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,040
I was like, hyped and amped for like a week afterwards.

108
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:22,040
It was like, yeah, that felt really like stand-up comedy, like being on a stage in front of real people in like a, in like a little club or some, any place with a microphone.

109
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,040
It just feels to me more legitimate than YouTube.

110
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:33,040
And I know that we disagree about that because you always say that YouTubers should take YouTube more seriously as its own thing.

111
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
And I agree with that to a point.

112
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,040
But for me, something about YouTube, it just feels like a website for talentless assholes.

113
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
And I deeply resent everything about it.

114
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
I resent YouTube culture.

115
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
I hate reviewers and critics.

116
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
They're all fucking smarmy, sarcastic twats.

117
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:56,040
I hate every fucking agenda pushing blow hard, trying to scream his opinion on politics or the societal ills affecting our generation.

118
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Like, who gives a fuck?

119
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
You're all asshats.

120
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
You all belong in the trash.

121
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
I just, I can't stand it.

122
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,040
To me, it just feels like a big fucking circle jerk.

123
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
It's a treehouse for babies is what YouTube is.

124
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,040
It's a sewer full of poop floating around poop.

125
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,040
I definitely think it's lowered the overall standard of what you have to be to be good.

126
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Because old media or stand-up comedy, only the absolute most popular people make it anywhere.

127
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:35,040
The overwhelming majority of stand-up comedians are still in dive bars in their 30s and not making any progress.

128
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Whereas on YouTube, you can just, like, not even be that talented, but because you're talking about video games, people find you, you know?

129
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Or because you're talking about, like, a certain thing, you can be found.

130
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Not to say that everyone does get found.

131
00:11:50,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Just, like, there's plenty of talented people, like yourself, who, in spite of covering a lot of popular stuff, have never really taken off in that big, viral way.

132
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,040
But you are making a career off of it, even in spite of that.

133
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Which has always impressed me that you have, like, you make an amount of money that no, I don't think anyone would expect from someone with your audience.

134
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,040
I mentioned that in Horseshoe Finale. It was one of my many acrimoniously spewed points.

135
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,040
It's not spewed. Spewed implies a lack of articulation.

136
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,040
But I mean, it was one of the many things that I launched at people.

137
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:39,040
It's true. Because you don't, to me, Patreon is a better measure of success than, like, YouTube subscribers.

138
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Because the patrons will fucking leave if they don't like what you're doing anymore.

139
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:53,040
And to anyone can attract viewers, but to attract people who think, I care about this person as an artist.

140
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:01,040
I care about them being able to continue their work. So I'm going to give them some of my money every month.

141
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,040
That, to me, is a far better measure that I'm connecting or accomplishing something good.

142
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:16,040
I definitely think that, like, it's a direct response to quality and to, you know, like, with the fucking Asterisk War videos.

143
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Like, when the last episode of that came out, my Patreon jumped unbelievably.

144
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Like, it had never done before. And it wasn't that I was getting any more views than normal.

145
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:34,040
It was just people were so excited about that particular video series that it, like, struck such a chord with them that they threw all their money at me.

146
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,040
And every once in a while, like, the last video I did, like, ten best things happening in anime this decade,

147
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,040
like, a video like that that just makes people feel something will definitely cause them to patron.

148
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:53,040
And so, even though you've got, like, well, I mean, I make a crazy amount of money now, but for a very long time,

149
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,040
I had ten times your subscribers and was making, like, the same amount, you know?

150
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,040
Just because you had people who cared so deeply about the stuff you were making.

151
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Yeah. And a lot of it was, you know, being drowning in horseshoes was such a consistent gimmick.

152
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Like, people knew that they were getting my little pony reviews.

153
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,040
And I knew that after I did Horseshoe Finale and I stopped doing Horseshoe reviews, I knew that it would go down substantially for a long while.

154
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:29,040
But I was prepared to make that sacrifice because I knew that eventually I would be able to get it back up with my other content.

155
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,040
And I have. It slowly trickled back up to almost where it was.

156
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:42,040
But that's a source of pride for me, that I was fully aware that it would go down, and it did, and I did it anyways.

157
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Yeah. So, to explain sort of why the two of us know each other, because we've told the story before,

158
00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:00,040
but a lot of our old podcasts are gone now, because we did these old horse casts together, which you took down eventually.

159
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Which is probably for the best, because a lot of the information would be out of date.

160
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:13,040
I don't like anything that I see, like, more than one year ago is like, I don't consider it me anymore.

161
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Right. I have very similar feelings.

162
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:22,040
I feel like I'm always a different person than I was a year ago, and I feel like people should be always changing.

163
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:29,040
I like having all that stuff up from my past so that people can look at it and see that I'm so different,

164
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:38,040
because I think it's encouraging for new artists who don't know that you have to practice and that you have to evolve.

165
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,040
And you can point to, like, if a 17-year-old tells me, like, how do I get better at writing?

166
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,040
I can link them a post I wrote when I was 17, and they'll be like, wow, this is fucking garbage.

167
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,040
And I'll be like, I know, now you have to practice for 10 years, catch up to me, you know.

168
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,040
But yeah, we had those podcasts before that have since been removed.

169
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:08,040
But basically, we met because you were one of my first subscribers when I started as Digi Baroni,

170
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,040
and you were the, for a long time, you were the biggest channel that was subscribed to me,

171
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:22,040
even though you only had, like, 2,500 subs, which to me was a lot, so I was like, oh, this guy's bigger, you know.

172
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:30,040
And you, like, messaged me, you messaged me once, and I thought that your channel was literally about footwear,

173
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,040
because it was called Drowning in Footwear, I thought it was a shoe review channel,

174
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,040
because I've known some people who are, like, obsessed with shoes, so I just thought, okay, he must be a shoe guy.

175
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:49,040
And then you messaged me again later when my channel started taking off, and I went and watched your Sin City video

176
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
and the Hello Kitty video, and I was like, this guy's a fucking genius.

177
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,040
And I've been evangelizing you ever since.

178
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Yeah, and that's good, because somebody should be.

179
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I often think of you as my ambassador to the world.

180
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,040
I might as well be.

181
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Because I don't like explaining things about myself.

182
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:19,040
It feels like, like a part of me feels like, first of all, nobody fucking deserves me to explain my work.

183
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Like, yeah.

184
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Like, I just, a couple days ago on June 6th, which was the one-year anniversary of Horseshoe Finale,

185
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:34,040
I finally sat down and I recorded the one-year anniversary video of it, and I talked about what went into the making of it,

186
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
and I talked about a lot of what the video means.

187
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:44,040
And even though I explained it, a part of me feels like, you people don't fucking deserve this.

188
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,040
It feels like a betrayal, almost, to explain my work.

189
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
And also, it's just hard for me.

190
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,040
It's hard to articulate in the moment what I really mean with my art.

191
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,040
It's like you have said before on Digi Bros. about Hideo Kiano.

192
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,040
You know, the medium is the message, and he's clearly so uncomfortable whenever someone tells him to describe Ava

193
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,040
and what it means, like, and I know what Ava is about.

194
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
You know what it's about.

195
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,040
If you're, if you're reasonably intelligent, it's not that fucking hard to understand,

196
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
but nobody is reasonably intelligent.

197
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
That's the one constant about this universe.

198
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,040
So everybody watches it and, you know, slack-jawed with drool rolling down their chin and going,

199
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
What happened?

200
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Doesn't make any sense.

201
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
And so they ask him about it.

202
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
He's like, I don't fucking know what to explain.

203
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
It's right there. Just fucking watch it.

204
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Like, the best way that I can explain Horseshoe Finale to me is to point at it and go fucking pay attention, you slime.

205
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,040
And it feels really obnoxious and aggravating that I even have to explain these things.

206
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:51,040
And it's not like I expect everybody to watch Horseshoe Finale and understand every little tiny word or phrase or reference

207
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
or thing in the background 100%.

208
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,040
That would probably be completely impossible unless you were actually me.

209
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,040
But I do expect people to at least get the themes.

210
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Like, nothing makes me madder than the fact that to this day people will watch that video and go,

211
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Oh, this is, he hates bronies. He's mad at bronies. He's leaving the fandom.

212
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
That's what this video is about.

213
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
That makes me sick. It makes me sick to my fucking stomach.

214
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,040
I want to, I'm, I'm kind of repeating everything that I'm about to be saying in the video that I'm releasing

215
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,040
because this is basically the same rant that I went on.

216
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,040
All right, well, I'll just cut you off then.

217
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Wait, shit. Now I lost track of what I wanted to say.

218
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Oh, yeah. You know, I, I've been planning.

219
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
But what I was saying, wait, let me go back.

220
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Anyways, what I was saying is that it's aggravating and frustrating for me to in the moment be put on the spot

221
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,040
and have to explain my things because I can do it if I sit down and I write it out.

222
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:51,040
But it's hard to figure out because, you know, I put so much of it into the medium is the message.

223
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:57,040
And you're a lot better than me, I think at, at vloggy type off the cuff explanation

224
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,040
because we both do vlogs and I think we're both good at it.

225
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:07,040
But like we're, we approach it differently in that I'm a, I'm a performer.

226
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,040
I'm, you're informative and I'm performance driven.

227
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Like when I turn on a vlog, my instinct is to be energetic and funny and say funny things.

228
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,040
And that's what I'm good at. You're better at actually giving out information.

229
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,040
And I hate doing vlogs in general because every time that I do a vlog, I watch it back

230
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,040
and I feel like I could have just written it out and I could have said it a million times better.

231
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
This is just going to confuse people more.

232
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,040
But the problem is that when I write it out, it becomes a project and a project takes a lot longer to make

233
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
and then it piles on.

234
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
That's exactly why I've gotten into vlogging.

235
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Yeah, it's so much easier to just like rant.

236
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,040
It's easier to, it's so much easier and quicker to do a vlog,

237
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,040
but I am always left with the feeling that I've articulated myself like an animal would after I do a vlog.

238
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:58,040
I feel the same way where I, all of my vlogs definitely have more comments from people who don't understand

239
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,040
than a typical video would, but some of those ideas aren't worth a whole project.

240
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,040
You know, like talking about the two anime I just did where I was laying on the couch.

241
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Like I don't want to write a video about those.

242
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
It's okay if some people don't get it.

243
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
I just wanted my thoughts out there.

244
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,040
And that's why I almost think of you as my ambassador a lot of the time or like the ambassador to my art

245
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:26,040
because I feel like when you're in a position where you have to explain what the hell I'm doing,

246
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,040
you're usually better at explaining it than I am.

247
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Yeah.

248
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Well, I thank you first of all and I like doing that for a lot of people.

249
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Like I do that for anyone I encounter who can't explain themselves.

250
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,040
I like to be able to try and explain what they're trying to say,

251
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,040
which is why I've always said that I think I'm good at creative intent,

252
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,040
like getting it because I really search for it more than I think most people do.

253
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Yeah.

254
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Definitely.

255
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
And I think more people should.

256
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
That's like a big hang up of mine, really, that more people should.

257
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Yeah.

258
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I mean, I don't think it's the only way, like I think you can make interesting points about something

259
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,040
without caring about, you know, while doing the whole death of the author thing.

260
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:16,040
But I think that for me, most often the author's thoughts are the most interesting, you know,

261
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,040
like nothing's cooler than what the guy was trying to say.

262
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
That usually is what gives you the most meaning.

263
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,040
I think that, um, I think that like nobody uses 10 scores right.

264
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,040
I think you did a video on this very topic, but our opinions are,

265
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
I think are like directly opposite.

266
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
I don't remember exactly what you said.

267
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Yeah.

268
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,040
You're very like everything's a 10 or a, or not a 10.

269
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Well, like to me, I just think that like intent is kind of what I look for most

270
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
when I dole out my number scores.

271
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Like I think that not enough people pay attention to intent.

272
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,040
And if you're a, if you consider yourself a critic or a reviewer,

273
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I think you have a responsibility to try to understand what they were going for

274
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
and not just look at it through like this narrow,

275
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,040
like when people complain about the cut scenes in Uncharted,

276
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,040
have you played a fucking Uncharted game before?

277
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Did you not know it?

278
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
You put in the fucking PlayStation 4?

279
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Did you not know what you were getting into?

280
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,040
They didn't like Uncharted 4 does not have a lot of cut scenes by accident.

281
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,040
They, they wanted to make a game with a bunch of cut scenes.

282
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
So you have to judge it as that.

283
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
If you don't like cut scenes, that's fine,

284
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,040
but you can't fucking sit there like a petulant baby and go,

285
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
there's too many cut scenes in this game.

286
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
It's the game is supposed to have cut scenes.

287
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
You idiot.

288
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Yeah.

289
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,040
I would agree with that, uh, that sentiment.

290
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Ooh.

291
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,040
So I have been for a very long time trying to like,

292
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,040
literally be an ambassador for you and, and write a video.

293
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,040
There was a time back in the horseshoe days where I completely wrote out a script

294
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,040
and I'd sent it to you that was like explaining why Jesse is cool.

295
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Um, and I just never got around to making it.

296
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,040
And then now I've been inspired that I want to literally rip off

297
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Nerdwriters understanding art formula and do an understanding art on Endless Jest.

298
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:14,040
And the reason is that like, because I keep saying that I think YouTube is so important as like a medium and everything

299
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,040
and I want to see it advancing is that like, you're my favorite YouTuber.

300
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,040
And I think I probably take YouTube more seriously than anybody else.

301
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,040
I watch way more of it than anybody I know.

302
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Um, like, I, I, I care a lot about like where it's going.

303
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,040
And, um, in the process.

304
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,040
It's funny because when I think about like what I tried to do,

305
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,040
and in my mind I accomplished completely 110% what I tried to do because I'm a genius.

306
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,040
But when I think about, um, the horseshoe saga and leading in the horseshoe finale,

307
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,040
um, I really think that I did my part to elevate YouTube as an artistic medium.

308
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,040
And I don't think people are ever going to really recognize that.

309
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,040
I don't, or if they do, it's going to be a long time before anyone looks at it and thinks that.

310
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
But I think I did.

311
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,040
And it's funny to me that I would think that of myself because I'm the guy who probably hates YouTube the most

312
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,040
and respects it the least as a medium in the first place.

313
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,040
But I tried, dammit, I tried to save you all.

314
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Well, the way I want to start this video, because you, the very first video on your channel, on Endless Jest,

315
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,040
if anybody goes there now, it wasn't the first YouTube video you ever did.

316
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
There's been removed ones.

317
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:40,040
But the first one that's up, it starts in such a perfect way for revealing what the point of Endless Jest is.

318
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Because the first scene is you going, yeah, it's you going,

319
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
fuck, this game's too hard.

320
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,040
And then you put the controller down and you go, you idiots don't even realize.

321
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
I'm not even in the game right now.

322
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
I'm not playing a game.

323
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
I'm not even in the TV room.

324
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
And that was the first official drowning of footwear video.

325
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:04,040
So even like the first five seconds of my YouTube career was already subverting what was popular at the time.

326
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Subverting video game reviews.

327
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
It's all about just sort of pulling back.

328
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
And that's all that I do.

329
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
And I hate that people don't understand satire.

330
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I hate that people don't get subversion.

331
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Like, I still get it because really I still do it.

332
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Like all my videos in some way are meant to be a subversion or a parody or a satire or something.

333
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Like, for example, that series of videos that I did, the best review.

334
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Fuck, in Batman v Superman, the best review.

335
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
And best is in all caps, like it's clickbait and stuff.

336
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Like, the whole point of those videos, like the joke is that it says the best review.

337
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,040
And then you click on it and it's a two hour irreverent vlog that makes no sense and is completely retarded.

338
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,040
And people in the comments go, this is stupid.

339
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,040
It's just a two hour irreverent vlog that makes no sense and is retarded.

340
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
That's the joke, dummies.

341
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Congratulations.

342
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Get out of my fucking YouTube.

343
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,040
You're stinking up the joint.

344
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Uh, that's, yeah, that's also kind of what the joke is with, um, with Victor's movie news where it's like.

345
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Which I love, by the way.

346
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,040
I said that, I said that that was the best video you've ever made.

347
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,040
And then you said, well, actually, Victor pretty much was in charge of all of it.

348
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Yeah.

349
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,040
No, Victor wrote, directed, staged, did everything.

350
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
It was his, his debut on YouTube.

351
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,040
And it is supposed to be a weekly series.

352
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
So expect more of that.

353
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
That was though.

354
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,040
That like your performance in it though was like the perfect, like the essence of DigiBro.

355
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Like that's what I want the world to see DigiBro as.

356
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Me too.

357
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Um, but yeah, like the idea of it was that it looks like this click bait.

358
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Like, you know, here's the hit new movies and then it's just like this weird dry Eric Andre show ripoff.

359
00:27:47,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Um, but yeah, like I feel like all of your videos are sort of about taking what, uh, what YouTube is and playing with the meta of it.

360
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,040
You know, in a lot of ways you're like the house of leaves of YouTube.

361
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:17,040
And I know you haven't read that book, but the way it's structured and written is that it's essentially like Ben and my Amazon cart for two years because you keep talking about it.

362
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:24,040
I mean, if we ever, uh, when we do this whole rad con that we're planning, uh, you could just, uh, read it.

363
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,040
I'll loan it to you or something as I have it.

364
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Um, but I don't know.

365
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,040
I could see you getting pissed off with it because the way you have to read it is so confusing.

366
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Um, but it's a lot like your videos.

367
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,040
How dare anybody challenge me but me?

368
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,040
How dare any other creator think that they're clever?

369
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Well, this is coming from a guy who, uh, tried to read Homestuck without reading the chat logs.

370
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Yeah, we don't need to get into that.

371
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
I don't get Homestuck, man.

372
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Yeah, we're not going to talk about Homestuck.

373
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:05,040
We should just do the, we should just do the Homestuck fucking, the people versus endless Jess for Homestuck podcast.

374
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Because it's not going to go well.

375
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
I know it's not going to go well.

376
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:17,040
That's what, that's what annoys me is because every time we talk about Homestuck, it turns into a huge, screaming, intense argument and nobody ever hears it because it's never being recorded.

377
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,040
It's literally just us legitimately fighting amongst ourselves and it's going to waste every time.

378
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Yeah.

379
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I'm glad that's the kind of content you want from us.

380
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,040
It's just us all fighting and getting legitimately pissed off.

381
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Mostly Ben.

382
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Ben gets legit mad.

383
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:40,040
It's like he can't, like, you know, I got real mad the first time we argued about it.

384
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,040
But ever since then, I'm just like, well, whatever, Jesse hasn't read it.

385
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
He doesn't get it.

386
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:50,040
I don't care, you know, but like somehow Ben can't not get mad when you talk about Homestuck.

387
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Like, it's not even that I hate it.

388
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Like, I don't think I hate it.

389
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,040
I just, I hate it.

390
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
I haven't read it.

391
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
I just hate it.

392
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Yeah.

393
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Instinctively.

394
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Yeah, I don't know.

395
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:11,040
I mean, it's pretty similar to your work, though, in that regard of being like something complex and meta.

396
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,040
It's because three years ago, I got into a Facebook flame war with a fucking Vriska cosplayer.

397
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:22,040
And from that point forward, I deemed that Homestuck was the gayest thing ever because this guy was the most annoying person.

398
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,040
But you somehow can still enjoy my little pony in spite of having met all the bronies.

399
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Yeah, well, I'm the best bronie, so I guess it balances out.

400
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,040
I'm as good as the rest of the bronies are terrible.

401
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,040
That's what makes me still able to enjoy the show.

402
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Yeah, I guess we should, I was talking to Ben during my interview with him about how, like, did you listen to that, by the way?

403
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,040
I think I'm like 40 minutes into it and I pause to go fuck around or whatever.

404
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Okay, you might have heard this part, I'm not sure.

405
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:06,040
I was saying that, like, what makes me sad with Ben is that, like, the T-Bap is, like, the most content that him and Nate did.

406
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:15,040
And it has so many creative ideas and, like, if I was trying to explain to someone, here's why I think Ben and Nate are, like, great artists.

407
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Then I can't show them T-Bap because it's a fucking weekly My Little Pony review show and it will make no sense.

408
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:28,040
T-Bap needs to come back and it needs to expand beyond My Little Pony because nobody has chemistry like Ben and Nate have.

409
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
No, it's amazing.

410
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
They're great together.

411
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:43,040
And you, though, I have the same problem with, which is that horse shoe finale is your masterpiece and there's just no way I can introduce new people to it.

412
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:57,040
Because it's such, it's not just the matter of that it's an MLP thing because, like, I honestly think that the horse shoe reviews are mostly, like, the early ones would be the hardest part where it's, like, more legitimately an analysis of the show.

413
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:07,040
But, like, I feel like the horse shoe reviews get so out there that you could appreciate them without having seen the show, but not having seen the show will make it so confusing.

414
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:13,040
And the fact that the channel's not even called the horse shoe journey to horseshoes anymore, you know?

415
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
I fucked that up so bad.

416
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:24,040
I did it so backwards because fucking cold corona went off and started horseshoe heaven because I turned drowning in horseshoes into Man Child Incorporated.

417
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
I got it totally backwards.

418
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:31,040
I should have turned drowning in horseshoes into horseshoe heaven and Man Child Incorporated should have been an entirely new channel.

419
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:38,040
But for some reason I was like, well, I don't want to sacrifice these 10,000 subs, so I should just change, but I did it, I fucked it up so bad.

420
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
And now I can never go back.

421
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
That's true.

422
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:46,040
The idea was that that channel had the most subs, so that was the one that had to go corporate and just become a shill channel.

423
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Which I loved the idea of that, but it did make it so you can't go back.

424
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:57,040
It's a great joke in the moment, but now that I can't go back and I can't rectify it, it was a terrible mistake.

425
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,040
I think that's the biggest issue with all the pony content.

426
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,040
It's not just that it's my little pony, but that we all wrote in such an in-the-moment way.

427
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:11,040
It's impossible to look back on any of it, even my own work.

428
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:17,040
The problem with Man Child Incorporated is that the whole joke is that it's soulless and it's like a sell-out channel.

429
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,040
And that's funny, but because it's a sell-out channel, I feel the least investment towards it.

430
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,040
So I never do Man Child Incorporated videos.

431
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:35,040
It had its point for about a month, and then it completely was like, well, alright, I guess that joke's over.

432
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,040
It was meant to be like the Man Child Incorporated saga.

433
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,040
It has another name, but I can't reveal the other name yet, because if I reveal the other name, I'll spoil it.

434
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:57,040
It was supposed to be like the semi-sequel slash criticism of the Horseshoe Saga, and it was supposed to culminate right around about Nowish.

435
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:08,040
But I'm just so I can't fucking, I don't know, it's annoying to fucking make videos on Man Child Incorporated, so it's taking a lot longer than it should.

436
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Well, for what it's worth, I think Horseshoe Finale came out like a year after it was supposed to come out.

437
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:27,040
Horseshoe Finale, well, the Horseshoe Saga grew so much in the telling, because the original plan, when I made that first Horseshoe review for Princess Twilight Sparkle or whatever,

438
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:37,040
the idea was this is going to be a dramatization of how I grew as a person during the two years of drowning in footwear.

439
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:47,040
So, and it's going to, I'm going to make these reviews, and they're going to be really sincere and easy to make at first, and sort of, you know, to get people watching.

440
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:58,040
And then their reviews are going to slowly become more and more insane and resentful and bitter, and it's going to culminate in CM Punk's pipe bomb.

441
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:06,040
And I'm going to sit cross-legged, and I'm going to, you know, essentially cut the exact same six minute promo that he cut in 2011 on wrestling.

442
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,040
But change the words so that it would be about bronies, and then drop the mic and end it with that.

443
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
And that is still an elemental Horseshoe Finale.

444
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:20,040
There's six minutes in there where I'm just doing CM Punk's pipe bomb, but all the rest of it.

445
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
It's sprinkled about 90 minutes of other stuff.

446
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Yeah, it just grew so much in the, like, and it became so much more than just what I set out to make it.

447
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,040
It became like my artistic footprint of everything that I am and everything that I've ever thought or felt.

448
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,040
And, like, and I'm very protective of it for that reason because, like, that video is me.

449
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,040
I put every fucking part of my soul into that video.

450
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,040
And so, yeah, it became something special unexpectedly, and that's always how it happens.

451
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Everything good sort of happens on its own unexpectedly in the telling.

452
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,040
And I want to note that, like, I knew all this from the beginning.

453
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
You told me.

454
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Like, I think I was probably the only one who was around for, like, the plans because this all started in 2013.

455
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Me and you sort of became friends that summer.

456
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Yeah.

457
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:19,040
And, you know, this was before the Horseshoe Crew was a thing because it really sprung out of all this, where the way you had described it to me was that you saw that there was this,

458
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
because I had started working for Equestria Daily.

459
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,040
All these new people were coming out with all these analysis videos and shit.

460
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,040
And you were like, man, I know I can do this better than anyone else.

461
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,040
And it'll be a way to make really easy videos and make a shitload of money and subscribers.

462
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,040
Because, like, at the time you were, you only had the one channel, right?

463
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Drowning in footwear.

464
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Yeah.

465
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Yeah, just drowning in footwear.

466
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:48,040
And you didn't want to flood it with pony content, but it looked like that was a very quick way to success.

467
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
And then you could transform it from there.

468
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
And it totally worked.

469
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,040
Like, maybe you didn't get super famous, but it did blow up as a much bigger channel.

470
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Yeah, it blew up at first until my videos started getting more Jess.

471
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,040
Right.

472
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,040
My videos took a very quick nosedive into the boogie realm very quickly.

473
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:19,040
Because for those first four months, when they were more like, you know, actual typical pony reviews, that's where, like, all the subs came from immediately.

474
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:27,040
And then once the video started getting more intricate, and I guess weird, for lack of a better term, that's when people stopped subbing.

475
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,040
And I became like this weird underground thing.

476
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Yeah.

477
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,040
I don't know if it's that they stopped or that you were constantly losing and gaining them at the same rate, you know?

478
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Yeah, yeah, that's also possible.

479
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:49,040
But then it's worth noting that of everyone in the procrastinators, you have the video with by far the most views.

480
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,040
Yeah.

481
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Which is-

482
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
And I always will.

483
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
Of course two of you bats.

484
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,040
It's got a picture of Fluttershy's ass as the thumbnail and like four million views, I think.

485
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,040
Yeah, four million fucking- I don't know why, I don't know how.

486
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Oh, and by the way, everybody who's listening to this, four million views on that video has never been mine.

487
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Has never been monetized, ever.

488
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
Yeah.

489
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Because it very quickly got copyright ID'd as soon as I posted it.

490
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,040
So that's, I mean, what is four million views?

491
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
That's gotta be like four thousand dollars, right?

492
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Yes.

493
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,040
That belongs to me that I never received and never will.

494
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Thanks, YouTube.

495
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Yeah.

496
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,040
And unfortunately back then we didn't know as much about fighting content ID's because I'm willing to bet that-

497
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,040
I don't know if you could have at the time, but I think now you could definitely beat that.

498
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Yeah, if it had happened now I probably could have fought it, but...

499
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
We didn't know about that shit back then, man.

500
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,040
We would delete videos sometimes just because they got matched, like not even taken down.

501
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,040
We'd just be like, I don't want this to get worse.

502
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Yeah, now what I do is I upload everything on private first and if it gets ID'd, I either change it or I say fuck it.

503
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
No one deserves this video when I throw it in trash.

504
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Yeah, I fight everything now.

505
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Now that I realize how easy it is to win, I'm like, oh, hell no, you're not taking my videos.

506
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Yeah.

507
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:16,040
I'm recutting my PsychoPass video into a full two and a half hour thing and I know it's gonna get a strike

508
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,040
and I don't care because I'm gonna fight it and win and I want this fucking video to exist.

509
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,040
But yeah, man, you have the video with the most views incredibly.

510
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,040
And I mean, everyone's review of bats had more views than normal.

511
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,040
I don't know what it was about that episode because, like, that was my biggest video too,

512
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,040
but mine was like not even 100,000 views and yours was like crazy.

513
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,040
But that's because of the horseshoe, because the procrastinators was originally the horseshoe crew

514
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:55,040
and it was all because of you because me and you were watching all these new guys,

515
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,040
all these newcomers into the fold and we found Gibb and Take

516
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:07,040
and we both thought he was hilarious and he did like these videos where he would supercut

517
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,040
like everyone who did analysis videos and he put both me and you in there, I think.

518
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,040
And so we knew that he was like a fan of you on some level.

519
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,040
And then the TBAP had started making these funny videos and they did a Q&A where they like specifically,

520
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,040
they didn't just name drop you, but they name dropped Butchugger.

521
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,040
And you were like, oh my God, they know Butchugger because no one had listened to that.

522
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,040
The true forgotten masterpiece of endless Jess's catalog.

523
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,040
And I gotta say, you know, back then, because, you know, we were friends and I was a fan,

524
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,040
but I didn't, back then I didn't get into all your weirder shit.

525
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Like I just thought it was all too much.

526
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,040
So like I hadn't even heard Butchugger and then like I want to say over a year later,

527
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,040
I finally listened to it and I was like, oh my God, this is fucking masterpiece.

528
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
This is amazing.

529
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Highly recommended to all of our listeners, if you haven't heard Butchugger,

530
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:08,040
it's a six minute ballad that you wrote this epic, would you consider it a hip hop song?

531
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
I'm not sure.

532
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Yeah, yeah, I guess it's sort of a rap opera word.

533
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
It's a rap opera.

534
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

535
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
It's about Cody LaRue the Butchugger.

536
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:26,040
My actual real life friend Cody LaRue who's a comedian and also has a channel called Flint Rant Films

537
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,040
where he is currently working on his ongoing series, Regular Dudes,

538
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,040
which I may one day have a part in.

539
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,040
I haven't yet because I'm very lazy and I'm misanthropic and I don't hang out with people when I say I will.

540
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
But it's always a possibility.

541
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,040
Cody LaRue has a hilarious Twitter as well.

542
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,040
Yeah, Cody LaRue is an expert at Twitter.

543
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
Yeah, he makes...

544
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,040
I was really shocked that I actually, because I don't follow a lot of people on Twitter,

545
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040
so when I read how funny his shit was, I was like,

546
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,040
wow, I'm going to follow this totally unknown friend of Jesse's just because he's funny as shit.

547
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
He's the Butchugger.

548
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,040
I mean, I'm not sure where this came from, but it must have been like four or five years ago.

549
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,040
He mentioned that he was the Butchugger.

550
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,040
And now if you mention it to him, he staunchly denies it.

551
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,040
He denies that it was ever a thing, that he ever said it.

552
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,040
It's true. He's the Butchugger. Never let him forget.

553
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,040
He can't outrun his past. I won't let him.

554
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
The song is there for all time.

555
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
Yeah.

556
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,040
Cody LaRue's the Butchugger. He's going to make you his Butchug brother.

557
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,040
His Butchug brother.

558
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,040
Man, I get so hyped for that song and I can't get my friends into it.

559
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
It makes me really sad.

560
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,040
This is why I need to abandon all my friends and just adopt you guys.

561
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,040
You all need to come here so I can hang out with you and sing about Butchugging.

562
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
Yeah, we all have...

563
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,040
I'm not sure it's worth having friends who don't know the Butchugger.

564
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:52,040
It seems like we all have our crosses to bear and mine is my family and yours is your friends, your IRL friends.

565
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Yeah. Well, I don't think my friends are nearly as big a problem as your family is.

566
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,040
I don't know if you want to talk about that on here at all.

567
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:07,040
I don't know. I'm really protective about it, I guess, that aspect of my life because I don't want to seem like I'm whining.

568
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:15,040
It's that thing where I can say whatever the hell I want about my family, but as soon as somebody else tries to say something bad about them,

569
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,040
I get really protective and I want to beat people up because they don't fucking know.

570
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
It's the same way I approach my family.

571
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,040
You would say you don't hate your family, they just cause you most of the problems in your life.

572
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,040
Unnecessary grief.

573
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:35,040
My youngest sister is literally Zephyr Breeze for anyone who saw the newest My Little Pony episode.

574
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,040
I related so hard to that episode. It was so cool. I was so into it.

575
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,040
Eh, fuck them all.

576
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,040
But that's sort of, so you do live in a basement, right?

577
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Yeah.

578
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:56,040
It is the basement of your mom's house, so much more literally than Jeff.

579
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,040
I think it's more accurate to say that she lives in my attic because I really fucking hate that.

580
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
I get that all the time.

581
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,040
He's in his mom's basement. This guy's the fucking basement. He lives at home.

582
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:13,040
Like, this fucking living at home stigma, I want to do a video about this so bad because it's a rant that needs to be spoken.

583
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,040
It's the most insane, illogical fucking stigma that we have in society. It makes me fucking sick of my stomach.

584
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
As Americans, specifically. It's weird.

585
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
Yeah.

586
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,040
Because the rest of the world usually lives with their parents.

587
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,040
Like, if you live in like an Asian country or something, typically you take over your parents' house and you just start paying for it.

588
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:35,040
Even people our age who don't live with their parents, they have fucking roommates. They have significant others.

589
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,040
They're all splitting the bills and the rent. Nobody is actually living on their own.

590
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,040
So it's such a fucking, like, pot con the kettle black to anyone who fucking looks down at you for living at home.

591
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,040
And by the way, I just want to throw this out there since we're on this topic.

592
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,040
The reason that I live at home, and I don't say this publicly because I like to keep my shit private,

593
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,040
but I'll go ahead and say it. I live at home because I support my entire fucking family.

594
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,040
So suck my ass.

595
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:04,040
You know, there's this, people say, living at home and it comes attached to this idea that you're a fucking,

596
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,040
that you're just laying around, that you're a freeloader, that they're supporting you.

597
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,040
Most, a lot of us support our families, okay?

598
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:17,040
I make the most money if anyone in my family because I'm fucking ambitious and the hardest worker I've ever known in my life

599
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,040
and I built the fucking empire on my own as an entertainer and an artist.

600
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,040
And I'm talented enough and charismatic enough to make a living off my art so that I can support my fucking family

601
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,040
and it really, really gets under my skin when I get that living at home stigma shit thrown at me.

602
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,040
It's one of my biggest pet peeves. In fact, as George Carlin would say, I don't have pet peeves.

603
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,040
I have psychotic fucking hatreds and that's one of them.

604
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,040
When people fucking say that to me, I want to lose my mind.

605
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
Fuck them.

606
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,040
I completely get where you're coming from, man.

607
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,040
Fake niggaz all looking at me like I don't know what I'm doing.

608
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,040
When I've been pulling salary for creativity since 2013 and I mean, when you see me, what do you think?

609
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,040
That guy's just crazy. He doesn't count. He's an outlier. Anomaly. Surely got lucky somehow.

610
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,040
Now, I'll be the first to admit, I've had some privileges, but I'm seeing all these kids like I ain't done shit.

611
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,040
You're just plugging your own EP right now.

612
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,040
You're gonna be on this song.

613
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:20,040
Look forward to me and Jess on the album Bedroom Bedrock coming sometime.

614
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,040
By the way, I made an entire album the other night when I got really fucking hammered.

615
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,040
Oh God. It's not like the hymn album, is it?

616
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,040
No, it's better than that. It's like an artistic statement almost.

617
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,040
Okay.

618
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,040
Because the other night I drank an entire bottle of Malibu rum.

619
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,040
I got excessively drunk. I was up all night.

620
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,040
And I did a freestyle rap. Then I did another one. Then I did another one.

621
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,040
I just got some beats offline off of some YouTube channels that make beats.

622
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,040
I did like four complete freestyle raps and these were legitimate freestyles.

623
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,040
Not one fucking second of it was written or rehearsed.

624
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,040
Just read all off the cuff and they're all incredible and hilarious.

625
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,040
I did them one after the other while I was completely fucking totally drunk.

626
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:13,040
And then to cap it off, I jotted down, still drunk mind you, still completely drunk off my ass.

627
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,040
I jotted down a guitar song and that closes out the album.

628
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,040
And it became weirdly emotional but also like movingly artistic.

629
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,040
I almost said autistic, but I said artistic. That's a very important distinction.

630
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,040
They mean the same thing.

631
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,040
It's not autism. It's artism that I suffer from.

632
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,040
We're all on the spectrum, man.

633
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,040
Yeah, the autism spectrum.

634
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,040
Yeah, I made a whole album the other night while I was drunk.

635
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,040
And then I did a drunk Let's Play.

636
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,040
And then I woke up the next morning and I had the worst hangover of my entire life.

637
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,040
And I vowed to never drink again for the rest of my life. It was horrible.

638
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
It was like...

639
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,040
Oh man.

640
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,040
You just reminded me of...

641
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:02,040
I don't know. Sometimes I feel like you have so many ideas that half of them I remember and you don't even.

642
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,040
So tell me if you remember this one, which was...

643
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,040
You wanted to make a talk show called What's Your Tism?

644
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,040
Yeah, I remember that. Now that you mentioned it, I remember it.

645
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,040
I thought that was the best fucking idea ever.

646
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,040
Yeah, where the point of the talk show was just that all the guests would come in

647
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,040
and everyone would talk about the thing that they are completely neurotic and autistic about.

648
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,040
Because everybody has that one thing.

649
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,040
Yeah.

650
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,040
I definitely think we're all somewhere.

651
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,040
That's a good idea. That's definitely something that we should still do someday.

652
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,040
Yeah, that would be cool.

653
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:37,040
One of the many ideas in The Endless just vaults that maybe someday we'll get made, but who knows.

654
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,040
If I'm not too busy making chair videos...

655
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,040
A lot of collab ideas that we're just like...

656
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,040
Well, we live too far away because the biggest one is The Plebe and The Weeb.

657
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,040
Which is a show that we wanted to do that's half in the bag but for anime.

658
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,040
But more aggressive and over the top, probably.

659
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,040
Yeah, and I want to go all out with it.

660
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:03,040
I want to build a set that is like a line down the middle of the room with different sets on each side.

661
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,040
Yeah.

662
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:09,040
That would be easy enough to do if we lived anywhere near each other.

663
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,040
Then the other idea was that after I started listening to Biggest Problem I had this idea,

664
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,040
the fans should vote at the end of every episode who was The Plebe and who was The Weeb.

665
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,040
Yeah, that's a great idea!

666
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
Oh!

667
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,040
I don't know if it would be a good idea to do this,

668
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,040
but on YouTube you can have it like hit like for this guy and dislike for the other guy.

669
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,040
I mean it would give us crazy dislike bars.

670
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:40,040
Yeah, I'd keep it in the comments I think because I get like a sick feeling seeing the red on that like bar.

671
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,040
Well, the gray.

672
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,040
Oh, is it gray now? God damn it.

673
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,040
They keep changing it.

674
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,040
It's been gray for quite a while now actually.

675
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:53,040
Well, I don't know because I never get any downvotes because all my videos are masterpieces.

676
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,040
Oh, man.

677
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:02,040
Well, to go back to the point we were making before I distracted us with that rap verse about living at home,

678
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:09,040
like yeah, I think there's like this weird idea that existed like 30 years ago of like, you know,

679
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:15,040
back when everyone left home at 18 and like maybe if you were still at home at 30 it was because like you...

680
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,040
And by the way, the reason they left, the reason everybody left home at 18 was because they got drafted into Vietnam

681
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,040
and then came back and didn't have a fucking home.

682
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:29,040
It had to fucking go hitchhiking down the freeway like Rambo with all their friends dying from age and orange cancer.

683
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:39,040
Like, you know, each of my parents kept like a, you know, they're like really surprised that me, Victor and Shay like didn't want to move out.

684
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:46,040
But like, because they both left home really early, but they were both from like dirt, poor, shitty...

685
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,040
Like my dad had to steal the eat and stuff when he was 18.

686
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:57,040
He joined the military literally for food and my mom was from a family of like six brothers and sisters with a single mom

687
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,040
and no moral compass whatsoever.

688
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,040
So she just like moved out when she was 16 and, you know, started living with other people.

689
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:13,040
And it's like, of course, if you raise like a loving family at a good home and you have a well-paying job, why the fuck would your kids want to leave?

690
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,040
Like you guys didn't leave because you were 18, you left because your lives were terrible, you know?

691
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:24,040
And it's like everybody I know who's my age lives at home and they're not unsuccessful, they're not unmotivated.

692
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:30,040
I have a friend who's a fucking published writer who's currently in grad school lives at home.

693
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:39,040
I have a friend who's a professional guitar teacher who fucking went to college for music shit and has a degree in shit lives at home.

694
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:44,040
You know, these are not fucking, these are not freeloaders. These are fucking adults.

695
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,040
These are motivated adults carving their own path in the world.

696
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,040
They just so happen to live at home because that's the smart thing to fucking do.

697
00:51:52,040 --> 00:52:03,040
Yeah. I mean, I personally, I'm paying $500 a month for rent, mostly just as a sign, like, you know, of the fact that I'm doing work and contributing something to the house.

698
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:10,040
But the funny thing is, I mean, there's a lot of legitimate reasons to leave home.

699
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,040
If you don't like your parents and you fight all the time, get out of there, you know?

700
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,040
But like if you're supporting them and putting them up, it's a good reason to be there.

701
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:26,040
And the funny thing is my parents are now planning to leave the house to me and they're moving out.

702
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:33,040
So, so it's like, I would doubt like I'm who lives at home now, motherfucker.

703
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,040
Right. I want you freeloading parents out of my home.

704
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,040
Oh, they won't be freeloading. They'll probably still be helping me with the running it.

705
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,040
But they they're like, yeah, we know you guys have no reason to leave.

706
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,040
But, you know, we just want to go somewhere quiet and be alone kind of thing.

707
00:52:52,040 --> 00:53:04,040
And like, but yeah, um, yeah, I don't I don't blame you at all, especially because I know that you, you know, you're helping to to pay for your family.

708
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,040
So it's like, it's like they're more reliant on you than you are on them.

709
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,040
So that's why you're there. And I know a lot of people like that. So I don't think it's weird.

710
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,040
But you do technically live in a basement. But it's a cool basement.

711
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,040
Yeah, that's the other thing. My basement fucking rules. Why would anyone not want to live in my basement?

712
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:31,040
Have you seen this fucking place? I got posters. I got a fucking TV. I got a fucking, I got pirate flags.

713
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,040
I got a couple Oscar statues. This place is a fucking paradise.

714
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,040
Yeah. And it just happens to be a weirdly amazing set for vlogs.

715
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:52,040
Because there's so every different angle of the room looks different because there's so many like chest high shelves and like weird bookcases and stuff and different poster arrangements.

716
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,040
And it's like every time you film it from a different angle, it feels like a totally different place.

717
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,040
And then you also change up the posters and that just makes it like dizzying sometimes.

718
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,040
It's like me and DeVue were always saying how we couldn't.

719
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:13,040
It really, the moment I finally got a good sense of the layout of your room was that vlog of you just squeegeeing water while the girl was recording you.

720
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,040
And that was the first time I like completely understood it. And I was like, oh, it's okay.

721
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:25,040
There's a separate room where the bookcase is. That's like a weird closet room or something.

722
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:39,040
And to go off on a weird tangent, because I just now reminded this, of all the sets in my room because I sort of have decorated my room for like, it's sort of segmented into sets for my different channels.

723
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:44,040
And there's like an anime corner. There's a wonderful waifu wall. There's a fucking man child incorporated corner.

724
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,040
And there's the bookcase in the other room with the fucking.

725
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:59,040
My favorite of the sets, which I haven't used in like years, is the set, the part of the corner where I filmed the like the Sim City and the Hello Kitty vlogs with that like sort of chest high shelf.

726
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:07,040
And the reason that I haven't filmed there is because I started filming in front of the bookcase for like some horse shoe review at some point, I think.

727
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:14,040
I think I started in the Grand Theft Auto review, but I started changing the posters around in there and I could never fuck.

728
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:21,040
It's that poster Tetris. I want to, I want to make a video about this topic too, because my entire life is poster Tetris, figuring out what goes where.

729
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:26,040
And for two fucking years, I haven't been able to get that corner the way that I wanted to.

730
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:33,040
And I just recently finally got exactly the right size poster, exactly what I want to fit in that little spot.

731
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:39,040
And right now the corner looks great. I'm just waiting for the right video to fucking go back to my corner and reveal it.

732
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:46,040
Because I hate the fucking bookshelf. Every video of me that I'm in front of that bookshelf, it just inherently feels pretentious and stupid to me.

733
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:55,040
It's my worst set, but it's like, it's just where I naturally tend to stand because it's where the shelf is like level for the camera to sit it on when I'm in a hurry.

734
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,040
So I end up making videos there. I hate that fucking bookshelf set.

735
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:07,040
I both agree and understand like the bookshelf is definitely my least favorite just because it's so like collapsing in on itself and just looks uneven and weird.

736
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:16,040
And that corner is my favorite one too because it's got two different shelves that are at different heights and it just makes it look really complicated.

737
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:24,040
And the worst part is they're right across from each other. So when I'm filming vlogs in the bookshelf, I'm looking at the cool corner and I'm fucking feeling I'm missing it.

738
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:30,040
And I'm feeling this longing for it, which just makes me so fucking angry and just adds fuel to the fire.

739
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,040
And that's why my vlogs are always so acrimonious. That's why everybody thinks I'm such an angry person.

740
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,040
I just feel a sense of loss for my corner.

741
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:50,040
See, I tried to do something similar when when I redesigned my room because like because DeVu told me at some point that he finds my room almost as confusing as yours just because I'll film from so many different angles.

742
00:56:50,040 --> 00:57:00,040
So I was planning to do this thing where I was going to make like all these different micro sets and then film in front of all of them and like really make people wonder how big my room was.

743
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,040
Of course, I burst that bubble because I started doing all these vlogs and just showing the whole room.

744
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:14,040
But like what I the problem is they're too small. Like I put together a shelf of anime DVDs, but then when I sit in front of it, I block the whole shelf.

745
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:22,040
So like I have no one spot where there's a good wide angle to see like a bunch of shit. It just looks chaotic and random.

746
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:29,040
But like I just end up going with whatever is the easiest place to like, you know, oh, this shelf is convenient.

747
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,040
I'll throw a chair in front of it and put up a tripod and I'm done, you know.

748
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,040
So yeah, I get the bookcase thing.

749
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:41,040
How many like how much do you spend on the posters?

750
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:50,040
A lot. I think most of what I spend is because I I don't know like hmm.

751
00:57:50,040 --> 00:58:01,040
I don't know trying to do the math. Can we just generally talk about your your buying habits which seem to be go out and just drop hundreds of dollars on whatever you see.

752
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:17,040
Here's the thing like because my family is such a drain on my finances, mostly from my sister, she has an illness that requires a lot of money all the time.

753
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:26,040
That's how I'll put it. So I just get a lot of my money drained. I like I constantly have to pay the rent.

754
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:32,040
I constantly have to pay the bills and shit, mainly because so much money goes to her.

755
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:41,040
So I've gotten into the habit over time of if I spend all of my money, nobody can take it from me.

756
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:50,040
Right. So it's just like my instinct, like it's like a paranoid because if I save my money, someone's going to get their paws on it eventually.

757
00:58:50,040 --> 00:59:00,040
But if I go out and I see a bunch of like if I go if I like walk into a comic book store, you know, I go, well, I shouldn't spend all this money on comics.

758
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:05,040
But if I don't, I'm going to lose it anyways. Someone's going to take it from me.

759
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:12,040
So yeah, so it's my I might as well just, you know, I might as well blow all my money on comics.

760
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:19,040
And then when my family needs to borrow money, they can fucking borrow it from somebody else because I don't have the fucking money anymore.

761
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:25,040
I just have comics. Do you want to pay the rent with my comics? You can't do it. Can you motherfucker? I win. Checkmate.

762
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:31,040
Yeah, it's basically like an investment, except that you'll never get a return on it.

763
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:39,040
Yeah. But I don't know, I think it's like I understand the plan and I think it's a good idea, even though it sounds insane.

764
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,040
Like I get why you're doing that and I think it works.

765
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:48,040
Well, the upside to it is that because of what our job is, everything is a write off.

766
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,040
Yeah, that's the best part.

767
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,040
So I just I just go through life.

768
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:56,040
My my philosophy is I don't have to pay taxes.

769
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,040
I don't know if that's true, but I don't.

770
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:02,040
It's definitely not true.

771
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,040
Well, I believe that it's true.

772
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:13,040
Because I I mean, I don't know if I spend as much as you did on stuff I could write off last year, but I still had to pay a thousand dollars,

773
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,040
even after writing as much off as I could.

774
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,040
But yeah, no, I do the same thing.

775
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,040
We're like, I justify every purchase by like, well, this will be in the background of my video.

776
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,040
So this is part of my set.

777
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,040
So, you know, it's it's all justified like like that light novels video I did.

778
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:36,040
I went to Barnes and Noble and spent like $110 and then I came home and made a vlog about all the stuff I just bought just so I could write it off.

779
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:46,040
I have a I have a robot in my corner that I bought six months ago because I came up with a robot character for my videos.

780
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,040
And I haven't used it yet, but I'm going to someday.

781
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,040
And that's why she's a write off.

782
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,040
My robot.

783
01:00:54,040 --> 01:01:03,040
I, uh, yeah, I've always loved that, though, that you spend so much and like on your like a lot of it on improving the videos or like,

784
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:11,040
because you'll buy a ton of new posters, not just because you want them, but because the video will be better by having those posters like,

785
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:20,040
like, um, and of course, horseshoe finale is like 18 different sets all built around like different characters and themes and stuff like that.

786
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:26,040
A normal person would spend $30 one time on a green screen and put whatever they want on it.

787
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,040
But I am no normal person.

788
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,040
Yeah, I like practical effects, practical sets.

789
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,040
Yeah, same here.

790
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:40,040
I mean, I've emulated that like the reason my walls are all covered in posters was like directly based on you,

791
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:47,040
because I loved so much that you had all these different like, you know, specific topic poster corners.

792
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:53,040
Unfortunately, all my posters are anime, so there's no way to make it feel particularly like that.

793
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:59,040
But I did like, for instance, near my bed is like all like girls in swimsuits.

794
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:10,040
And then like on the wall behind my couch is all like really dignified looking posters, like, you know, cool action show type stuff like that looks all serious.

795
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:18,040
And then there's like one corner that's like just Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh and like childish stuff, which is supposed to be like, I haven't really used that one,

796
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,040
but it's supposed to be like the infantilism corner essentially.

797
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,040
That's the baby bro corner.

798
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:27,040
Yeah, well, because it was going to be where I was going to have a shelf of My Little Pony and a shelf of Pokemon,

799
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:34,040
but I can never bring myself to actually put the My Little Pony shelf together as I talked about in the Insomnia Analysis 2 video,

800
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:44,040
just because like I feel I have such like mixed and mostly negative feelings about like the pony experience that I just don't even want to think about it anymore.

801
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:55,040
But like, yeah, I totally copied your idea of spend all my money on posters, put them everywhere, and it'll make my sets look cooler.

802
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,040
Because personally, I think green screen sets are lame and they're also hard to use. You have to really like those things.

803
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,040
Yeah, if you do green screen badly, everybody can tell.

804
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,040
Right, and me and you both live in rooms that are like too big to light.

805
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:14,040
They're just black holes. They're fucking, all our videos look dark. There's no way around it.

806
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:22,040
Yeah, so, all right, I got to think of more questions for you.

807
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:33,040
So, all right, the channel that you've been saying that you want to put focus on the most is My Japanese Animes.

808
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,040
Yeah.

809
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,040
How did that channel happen? Like, where did it come from?

810
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:46,040
Oh, fuck. Okay, I believe the first My Japanese Animes was in January of 2015 and it was the Bleacher View.

811
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,040
I think the dandy videos were out before that though.

812
01:03:51,040 --> 01:04:02,040
Yeah, but it was during that time of November 2014 to June 2015 when I was working on Horseshoe Finale.

813
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:11,040
And in the meantime, between Magical Mystery Cure and Horseshoe Finale, I couldn't very well make more pony videos because that would have fucking ruined it.

814
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:22,040
But I had to make money somehow, so I had to find ways to keep making videos while also making Horseshoe Finale and one of the ways was to make My Japanese Animes and just have an anime channel.

815
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:33,040
And it came out amazingly because the Bleach video was like fucking awesome. It was one of my favorite videos you ever did.

816
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:42,040
I love all of them and you seem to have a different mentality about that channel that every video has to be tight and complete.

817
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:56,040
My Japanese Animes is my YouTube channel. It's my best channel if you're looking for a YouTube channel because I don't really consider Endless Jess a YouTube channel at all.

818
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:05,040
Endless Jess is just my fucking clubhouse and you're there by special invitation and so you better obey the rules or I'll kick you out.

819
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:15,040
And Man Child Incorporated is another thing. I sort of have a different philosophy behind all of my channels and how I approach the content when I make them on there.

820
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:22,040
And that's why they're separate and what keeps them interesting because I take those gimmicks seriously.

821
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:32,040
It was kind of a reversal on the original intent because for a long time Drowning in Footwear was the main channel and it was supposed to be mostly big videos.

822
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:44,040
And then you would routinely hide the vlogs because you would do like a month with a bunch of vlogs and then you'd feel upset that they were on your main channel and then sort of hide them all.

823
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:50,040
But then at some point it was like a switch flip and you went fuck it Endless Jess is now the everything channel.

824
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:59,040
And the reason that I do that I get into these periods of just doing like weird vlogs on Endless Jess there is a philosophy behind it and there's a plan behind it.

825
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:03,040
I always know what I'm doing people. I'm always 10 steps ahead of you. I'm always 10 steps ahead of myself.

826
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:10,040
The reason is that Endless Jess has a problem and that problem is videos going viral.

827
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:19,040
I can't fucking stop it from happening. It happens when I least expect it to usually the worst possible videos that could possibly go viral are the ones that do like fuck updates

828
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:28,040
or Batman v Superman the best review. Those videos get the norm that video get it has a lot of views. It's got over 10,000 views.

829
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:39,040
And those videos get the normie views and normies see those videos and they flock to my channel and they subscribe expecting like YouTube content.

830
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:47,040
And then inevitably they don't understand what they're subscribed to and they leave asinine stupid comments that piss me off and they downvote my videos.

831
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:55,040
Because they're they just expect some kind of fucking YouTube channel of a guy screaming in front of a bookcase about movies every week and that's not what it's going to be.

832
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:03,040
So because I get so many normie subscribers that I don't fucking want who aren't going to get it who are just going to be a burden and a drain on my channel.

833
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:13,040
I routinely I'll go okay I'm going to make really really stupid videos for like three weeks straight and I'm going to shake off some of these subscribers.

834
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:19,040
And anyone who doesn't get it is going to unsubscribe and the people who stay subscribed are going to be the ones that I know get it.

835
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:28,040
And that's sort of how I cull the herd and keep things that you know I keep the normies out as best I can because otherwise they just infest it.

836
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:37,040
I mean if you look at fucking any big YouTuber who doesn't moderate their comment section which is another reason I moderate is because they all become a fucking sea of poison.

837
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,040
If you look at Anthony Fantano's comment section for example.

838
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:49,040
Holy shit and it's just memes people saying stupid shit and what that is it's the normie views those fucking normie subscribers.

839
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,040
If you don't keep them in check they will turn your entire channel into poison.

840
01:07:53,040 --> 01:08:03,040
I think it's amazing that Fantano like ever reads or responds or has any opinions about his comments when they're as bad as they are.

841
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:11,040
Like I mean I get upset over bad comments but my comment sections are still by and large pretty good because everyone knows I read them.

842
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:17,040
And it's usually the people who are like you said it's the new people who don't get it and who leave like the shitty comments.

843
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:28,040
It blows my mind that you wouldn't moderate it because I view my videos sort of my videos on my art and the comments are on the video which means that the comments are a part of the art.

844
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:34,040
So if your comment is not worthy of being on my art then it's just going to be weighing it down for people.

845
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:42,040
You know when I fucking watch a YouTube video and I scroll down and I see shitty comments I like the video less it's annoying.

846
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:57,040
I don't usually read comments on other people's videos unless I'm really curious how people reacted to it but then like you said if it's like a Fantano video then it's incomprehensible fucking nonsense anyways.

847
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,040
It's always just like people asking for the next review of the other thing.

848
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:10,040
Like if I paint a painting and they hang my painting up in a museum and somebody stands in front of my painting and starts jacking off.

849
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:15,040
It's ruining the experience for everybody else who's trying to see the painting.

850
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,040
That's why he has to be tased by security and escorted off the premises.

851
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,040
Yeah I think we both pretty much agree on that.

852
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:29,040
We covered most of it in the commenter rules so I don't want to get too far down the comment hole but we both...

853
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,040
That's what it's called. It's not a comment section. It's a comment hole.

854
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:45,040
I think you and I both had this experience where we... I don't know if you thought this going in but I thought that doing commenter rules would help to put some of it behind me.

855
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,040
And instead it made me way angrier about comments.

856
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:55,040
It only made the fire stronger. It kindled that fire big time.

857
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:02,040
Yeah you were saying in the chat recently that you think us doing this podcast has made you an angrier and worse person.

858
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:11,040
And I feel like it's done the same thing to me because every time we bitch about people then I start thinking about that more and more.

859
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:18,040
Like the things that annoy us about people like I'll go out into the world and see it happening and be like ahhh.

860
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,040
You know didn't we just talk about this?

861
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:27,040
Well people would complain about the PCP podcast being clusterfuck and us all talking over each other and yelling over each other.

862
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,040
And my defense of that was well come on haven't you ever been at like a family Thanksgiving?

863
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:40,040
That's how we talk in my family and that was my defense of it but then I remembered oh wait I hate that about my family.

864
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,040
I've always hated that. Shit.

865
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:46,040
And now it's like I'm in Thanksgiving with my family every week with you fucking guys.

866
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:53,040
Every week I have to sit down and I have to steal myself for the onslaught the avalanche that's coming towards me.

867
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,040
Of everyone trying to get a word in edge wise and nobody succeeding at it.

868
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:03,040
And everything I say you know it creates this pressure and this stress on every idea that comes into your head.

869
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:09,040
Because everything you want to say you know that you have to say it forcefully and quickly or else you're not going to be able to finish it.

870
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,040
And that makes it ten times harder to articulate what you're trying to say.

871
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:17,040
So nobody is being able to say what they actually want to say and nobody is listening to what anyone else is saying.

872
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:24,040
So it just becomes a fucking a cesspool. It's like it's 4chan in audio form.

873
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,040
You know honestly I think it's all Nate's fault and I think we have to have an intervention about it.

874
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:35,040
Because like lately because I kept getting so much shit from people telling me that I was interrupting other people all the time.

875
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:43,040
That like eventually I started to reflect on it and like really be like okay maybe I interrupt people more than I realize.

876
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:48,040
Maybe it's a problem. So I've been trying to like really curb it back and not interrupt people.

877
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:54,040
But when you I realized this on like the sleep podcast because I really thought I wasn't going to have anything to say about that.

878
01:11:54,040 --> 01:12:02,040
But the few times I did I realized that if Nate will always talk it doesn't matter if he has an idea.

879
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,040
It doesn't matter if he has something to say. He will talk.

880
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,040
Damn Digi I could almost kiss ya.

881
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:15,040
So if you don't get your ideas in there if you don't force them in Nate will talk.

882
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,040
And so you have to be forceful. You have to wedge it in and poor DeVue.

883
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:28,040
Like DeVue tries because in the early days he wouldn't get a word in because he wasn't cutting people off viciously enough.

884
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:34,040
But now he cuts people he cuts in so hard and it makes him hard.

885
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:40,040
Like it sounds like he's being way too serious and it just makes you like gloss over his point.

886
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:44,040
I think the whole thing is I think the whole it's an anger factory for all of us.

887
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:51,040
We're all just everybody always sounds completely pissed off by the end.

888
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:57,040
Like I'm never I am never as pissed off as I am immediately upon entering that podcast.

889
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:04,040
It's like it's like an aura to it. There's like an atmosphere that just gets into my skin.

890
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:10,040
Well the worst part is like because we tried after like with the Dark Souls one.

891
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:15,040
The idea was we were trying to scale back and do what more that were like three people.

892
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:22,040
And then the last two we did like Nate kept going like hey who else wants to be in and I'm like no.

893
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:31,040
Because it was not not the sleep one but the one before that where we had like six people in there and he like at messages you.

894
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,040
Hey Jesse want to be in the podcast. I'm like no he doesn't want to be in the podcast.

895
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:41,040
There's six fucking people in here. He's going to get pissed off and that's within minutes.

896
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:48,040
Jeff made you leave out of sheer rage.

897
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:53,040
That was that was by the way that was real. That was not like a skit that I had planned or anything.

898
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,040
No I literally like two minutes into the podcast.

899
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:03,040
Jeff made me so angry that I fucking got up and had to like storm around my kitchen for a while.

900
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,040
And then I just left the house and I just like I have to go to a walk.

901
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,040
I left the fucking recording on the podcast was still going on.

902
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:14,040
I just went outside and went for a walk and I went around the block and as I was coming back.

903
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:21,040
I see my secretary miss Jezameen Jezebel sitting there in her car and I'm like what are you doing here.

904
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:32,040
And she's like well I came to hang out and I'm like OK let's go back in the house so I can tell these guys I hate them and leave the podcast forever.

905
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:42,040
It was great because you sent me your audio recording and it's like two minutes of dialogue and then just this long like 30 minute silence.

906
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:47,040
And that was the whole recording of the first part and then like there was a separate recording for the Jezebel part.

907
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:55,040
But like you can I can hear you like when I listen back to it I can hear you leaving like all the audio of you leaving the house was in there.

908
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,040
It was fucking great.

909
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:09,040
Yeah I don't know it's it's weird for me because I have been talking to you for so long and I so approve of you and your art.

910
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:13,040
That you don't phase me with that kind of stuff anymore.

911
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:19,040
And I think there's a lot of people who legitimately can't handle that.

912
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:29,040
You know like do you remember when I had you on the pub crawl one time and you got into like this big fight with some of the other co-hosts.

913
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,040
One of one of them was being a huge gay lord.

914
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,040
I don't know which one Mr. Jeffrey Berger or whoever his name is.

915
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:42,040
Yeah you got into this fight with them and it got really legitimately awkward.

916
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:54,040
And like all I could think was like man I'm used to like Jesse's argument style which is that everyone else is wrong and that's all that matters.

917
01:15:54,040 --> 01:16:00,040
You know like I think for you it always seems like proving yourself right comes later.

918
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,040
It's that I don't like being in arguments.

919
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:10,040
I hate arguing which means that when I get into an argument the fact that I'm in the argument makes me angry which makes the argument worse.

920
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:15,040
So it's a self-perpetuating cycle of rage that once I'm trapped in there's no getting out.

921
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,040
It's all or nothing.

922
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,040
We're going down in flames and I'm taking everyone with me.

923
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:35,040
See like I've put it to people like Jesse the Jesse Wood argument style is that you do know somewhere in your mind you know why you're mad and how to articulate it but that doesn't come out first.

924
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,040
What comes out first is no fuck you you're wrong.

925
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,040
I'm right.

926
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:47,040
And it takes about five minutes of that before you will then articulate it in a way that the other person like gets it.

927
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:56,040
And then they'll be like well why didn't you say that from the beginning and you're like I did say that just a simplified version of that because you didn't have the articulate version.

928
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:01,040
I hate about the Internet because I hate verbally sparring with people like right in real life.

929
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:13,040
I'm like kind of an incredibly violent person like I immediately like I have a line and everyone who crosses it I immediately want to fucking punch everybody.

930
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:22,040
Like if I'm standing in a store like if I like four teenagers so much as walk by me I instinctively my hands are in fist and I'm just waiting for them to fucking say something.

931
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,040
I know they're gonna fuck with me.

932
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,040
I'm gonna kill them all.

933
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,040
And then they keep walking and they don't do anything to me.

934
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,040
I'm like you sons of bitches you deliberately trying to make a fool out of me.

935
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,040
I see how it is.

936
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:37,040
I can't remember if you shared the whole straight out of Compton story on the podcast.

937
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,040
Did we tell it on the podcast before?

938
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,040
I don't know.

939
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,040
I don't know.

940
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,040
It seems like I've told that story a bunch but I don't know where I've told it.

941
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:47,040
Well you can't get enough of it if you want to tell it again.

942
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,040
It's fucking great.

943
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:57,040
We were seeing straight out of Compton me and my friends and there were these fucking teenagers sitting right behind us.

944
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,040
It's always teenagers.

945
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,040
Teenagers are human cancer.

946
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,040
They should not exist.

947
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,040
They should be put in prison until they're 25 all of them.

948
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:14,040
I was, you know, we're watching the movie and these fucking teenagers were talking during the entire fucking movie.

949
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,040
Making stupid jokes.

950
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,040
Not even making jokes.

951
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,040
Just talking.

952
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,040
Just fucking being teenagers.

953
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,040
And my friend asked them to shut up.

954
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,040
Or she asked them politely to stop talking.

955
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:29,040
Like two or three times throughout the movie and they wouldn't.

956
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:34,040
And then like eventually it gets to the part where like EZE is dying of AIDS.

957
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:38,040
And it's this emotional part of the movie and everybody's crying.

958
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,040
You know, it's like, it's the emotional crux of the movie.

959
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:48,040
And these fucking kids are back there and they're giggling and chuckling and laughing.

960
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:54,040
And I finally just, I turned around and I said shut the fuck up.

961
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,040
And like the whole theater kind of applauded and snickered.

962
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,040
And they shut up for a while.

963
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:06,040
And you know, everyone was, you know, all my friends were like, yeah, that was cool, yeah.

964
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,040
So we watched the rest of the movie in peace.

965
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,040
And I knew that it wasn't over.

966
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:17,040
Like I had a feeling in my gut because I've gotten myself into these situations many times in my life.

967
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,040
And I know when it's not over.

968
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:24,040
So the credits are rolling and everyone's filing out of the movie theater.

969
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,040
And I know these kids are gonna fucking kick my seat.

970
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,040
Or they're gonna try to start something.

971
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:35,040
And when they do, it's gonna be the last mistake they ever fucking make.

972
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,040
And so I'm sitting there and I'm waiting for them to do something.

973
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:43,040
And I'm sure that they didn't realize that I was waiting for them to do something.

974
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:48,040
They thought they could get the drop on me, but they don't know who I am.

975
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:52,040
So I'm sitting there, fists balled up.

976
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:58,040
I'm fucking, I'm as intense as a fucking cocaine-addled macho man promo.

977
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:02,040
I'm ready to fucking ignite at any minute.

978
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,040
And it fucking happens.

979
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:08,040
This kid dumps his entire popcorn bucket on my head

980
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,040
and thinks that he can get up fast enough and get out fast enough.

981
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:16,040
And I shot up like fucking lightning.

982
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:21,040
As soon as I felt that shit going over my head, I fucking shot up

983
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,040
and I fucking leaped over the seats and I grabbed him

984
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:29,040
and I fucking punched him right in his fucking temple.

985
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,040
I hope I did permanent damage. I hope he's dead.

986
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,040
I have no fucking remorse for this whatsoever.

987
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:39,040
I fucking punched him right in the skull like two or three times.

988
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:45,040
And he fucking, he kept trying to go and I was fucking chasing him out to like where the stairs were.

989
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:51,040
And I fucking, the last punch that I landed on him, I punched him in the head so hard

990
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:56,040
that my fist sent his head flying into the wall of the staircase.

991
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,040
So like I punched him and it bounced off the wall.

992
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,040
It was like, it was like two hits for one.

993
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,040
It was like a fucking, like a pinball machine.

994
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:08,040
And he's fucking, he's fucking running around.

995
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,040
Oh my, everyone's screaming.

996
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,040
The whole fucking theater is watching this.

997
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,040
And by the way, the whole time that this is happening, it's the credits.

998
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,040
So straight out of Compton, the song is playing.

999
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,040
Fucking NWA is blasting.

1000
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,040
It's the soundtrack to me beating the shit out of this teenager.

1001
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,040
And he's fucking running.

1002
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:32,040
And then his fucking fat, lard ass girlfriend is like, what the fuck are you doing?

1003
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,040
He's only 13 years old.

1004
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:40,040
And I fucking got right in your face and I'm like, I'll fucking hit you too, you fat bitch.

1005
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:43,040
Get out of my face. Get out of my theater.

1006
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,040
And they fucking go.

1007
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:50,040
And then, so they run out of the theater and I calmly, I fucking like straighten my shirt

1008
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:55,040
and I walk back to my friends and I just say, we should probably go right now.

1009
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,040
We should probably go out the, out the side exit.

1010
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,040
We should, we should get in our cars now.

1011
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,040
We just fucking left.

1012
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:06,040
And it was, it was a proud moment.

1013
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,040
It was a great moment.

1014
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,040
I have no regrets and no remorse.

1015
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:14,040
I hope he, I hope that fucking kid, I hope he hasn't had a decent night's sleep since.

1016
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:18,040
I hope it, I hope my face haunts his every nightmare.

1017
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:24,040
I hope he went to school with a bunch of, with like eight black eyes all over his face.

1018
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:28,040
And I hope all the other kids, I hope word got around his school of what happened

1019
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,040
and he's getting made fun of to this day for it.

1020
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,040
Fuck him.

1021
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,040
I hope he killed himself.

1022
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:38,040
You know, I love that story, but there's only, there's one detail I just realized is weird.

1023
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,040
Why did he still have so much popcorn left?

1024
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:45,040
Like who finishes a movie and hasn't finished their popcorn?

1025
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,040
Some, some faggot, some teenager.

1026
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:52,040
No fucking skinny ass tiny stomach, can't fucking fit his popcorn.

1027
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:59,040
You'd think his, you'd think his lard ass girlfriend would have, would have finished it off for him.

1028
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:05,040
But I guess she was too busy fucking, sucking strange dick in the bathroom.

1029
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,040
I don't know.

1030
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,040
She was too full of cum.

1031
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,040
Yeah.

1032
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:21,040
I, I think I want to address to the audience that like, I think more than any of the other members of the, the PCP at least,

1033
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:26,040
you have probably the biggest like, how do I put this?

1034
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:31,040
Like on and off camera, like is pretty different.

1035
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:39,040
Like even though you, you definitely like a, you know, not to say that anything you're doing on camera is like not real or not really what you're like,

1036
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:52,040
but like, you're much more in your own head and quiet and like, um, like when I hang out with you, you're not constantly ranting like, like you're on camera.

1037
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:58,040
It's more like concentrated bursts of when you have an idea to rant about.

1038
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:02,040
Whereas hanging out with me in real life is legitimately, I never shut the fuck up.

1039
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,040
It's exactly like it is on camera.

1040
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:09,040
Do you feel that there's like a big difference to you between like on and off when you're a,

1041
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:17,040
I'm definitely, I'm definitely quieter off camera or more, um, pensive, I guess, or aloof.

1042
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,040
I don't know.

1043
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:28,040
I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm so on when I'm on camera that I've become even more, you know, decompressing when I'm off camera.

1044
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:35,040
Because I value, I value being off camera because it's to me, it's important.

1045
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,040
I don't know if that makes sense.

1046
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:41,040
Well, I know you, you like to have like a private life.

1047
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:49,040
That's not the, like, like for me, there's very little that I don't talk about on like Digi Bros. or in my vlogs.

1048
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,040
You know, like, it's almost like every emotion I have.

1049
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:59,040
Although I don't talk as much about like my stresses or negative emotions because I just think it would be kind of annoying.

1050
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:07,040
But like, I think you have a lot more value in doing something that nobody hears about and is just something you got to do.

1051
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,040
Um, would you say so?

1052
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,040
Yeah, I, uh, and lately, like, I make an effort.

1053
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:23,040
I have to kind of force myself to do things without recording it at this point because it's become such a habit of if I play a video game,

1054
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,040
I should be recording it in case I say something funny.

1055
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:32,040
If I have a thought that I should film a vlog or I should be, I should be creating something right now.

1056
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,040
I should be making a rap song or something.

1057
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:44,040
So I kind of have to force myself to just shut out the world and make myself not be turned on or not be in fucking entertainment mode

1058
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,040
and just enjoy myself by myself or like hang out with friends.

1059
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:52,040
I never hang out with friends not because I don't want to, just because I'm always focused on creating stuff

1060
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:56,040
and I don't think to call anybody or hang out with anybody.

1061
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,040
Yeah, I have the same problem.

1062
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:04,040
That's why I was saying, like, uh, that I need a hobby on Twitter the other day because I'm like, I,

1063
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:10,040
everything I do is either, like, in service of making a video or it is a video, you know,

1064
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,040
with the exception of, like, going out to eat and stuff like that.

1065
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:19,040
And it's like, I need something to do that's not immediately relevant to that.

1066
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,040
But I don't have it.

1067
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:28,040
It's weird because, um, in my, uh, in my videos, there's like a difference in anger in my videos

1068
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:35,040
because in my videos, it seems like I mostly get mad at stuff, at things, like computers or whatever.

1069
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:42,040
In real life, I mostly get mad at people and, you know, just random, you know, bad luck doesn't really bother me.

1070
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:49,040
If I'm, like, I'll be in situations where, like, there's a flat tire or everyone's stranded somewhere.

1071
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:54,040
Like, some horrible disaster happens and we're stuck in the rain and everyone else is always freaking out.

1072
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:59,040
And that stuff never phases me. Like, I'm totally aloof. I'm always making jokes because, to me, that's just a story.

1073
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,040
Everything that happens to me is some funny anecdote that I can talk about later.

1074
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,040
And so, I'm not bothered by stuff that happens.

1075
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:11,040
But when it comes to people, um, I'm always kind of on edge.

1076
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:16,040
I'm always paranoid because I just, I guess it's the way that I grew up.

1077
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:24,040
I'm always, um, I'm just used to getting fucked with and used to having to fight and used to fucking, so...

1078
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:29,040
I know you've had a lot of, like, for whatever reason, the police don't like you.

1079
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:37,040
Oh, yeah. Well, I grew up in a fucking, a very hodunk, white trash, very small town.

1080
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,040
And the thing about small towns is the cops are fucking bored.

1081
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:44,040
And when the cops are bored, they fuck with everyone.

1082
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:49,040
And they especially fuck on poor kids who don't look the way that they think kids should look.

1083
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,040
Yeah.

1084
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,040
And, uh, so, I was always getting fucked with.

1085
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,040
You were always, like, long-haired, uh...

1086
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,040
Yeah.

1087
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,040
Like, surfer slash pirate guy.

1088
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,040
Yeah, I always had long hair. I always had a leather jacket on.

1089
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,040
So the cops just, like, pull you over and, like, hassle you for no fucking reason?

1090
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:09,040
Yeah. They always thought that I was fucking stealing something.

1091
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:12,040
They always thought that I was, you know, up to no good.

1092
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,040
They always thought that I had drugs on me.

1093
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,040
They always thought that I was a fucking stoner.

1094
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,040
Even though I didn't look like a stoner, that's the thing that bothers me.

1095
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,040
Nobody knows what a stoner looks like or sounds like.

1096
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:25,040
Because they would look at me, oh, long hair, leather jacket, that kid's on drugs.

1097
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,040
I never touched a fucking drug in my life.

1098
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:33,040
The kids who were smoking weed were the fucking skinny kids in the tank tops and the beanie hats

1099
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,040
walking around doing this.

1100
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,040
Yeah.

1101
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,040
That's their fucking mating call.

1102
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,040
That's what they all sound like.

1103
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:45,040
Yeah, to clarify for the audience, um,

1104
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:49,040
you have not, until very recently,

1105
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,040
have never been high in a video because you hate weed.

1106
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,040
I hate weed probably.

1107
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:02,040
I say this about everything, but it's definitely up there among the things I hate most in the fucking world.

1108
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,040
I can't stand it. I can't stand the smell of it.

1109
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,040
I can't stand other people smoking it around me.

1110
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:12,040
It just brings my fucking piss to a boil.

1111
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,040
Generally not a drug guy at all.

1112
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:22,040
Yeah, something about it. I have like this vast psychological aversion, this hatred of marijuana.

1113
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,040
Yeah.

1114
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:27,040
But you do drink, but not as much as people think probably.

1115
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,040
Yeah.

1116
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,040
Oh, yeah, finish that story.

1117
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:36,040
Yeah, recently I got very, very high for the first time in my life, not from smoking anything,

1118
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:42,040
but because my secretary, Jezameen Jezebel,

1119
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,040
she was like, hey, look what I got.

1120
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,040
This is pot candy.

1121
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,040
This is a nerd rope, but there's marijuana in it.

1122
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,040
It doesn't make you really high.

1123
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,040
And I'm like, no, it won't.

1124
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,040
Shut up.

1125
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,040
And I ate it.

1126
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,040
And she's like, I'm warning you.

1127
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,040
I'm warning you.

1128
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,040
Only eat half of it.

1129
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,040
And I ate the whole thing.

1130
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,040
I'm like, shut up.

1131
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,040
I'll eat the whole thing.

1132
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,040
I don't care.

1133
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:08,040
I'm strong.

1134
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:13,040
And yeah, so I ate the whole thing.

1135
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,040
And then I started time traveling.

1136
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,040
Yeah.

1137
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:24,040
Then I became the fucking master of the universe.

1138
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,040
I don't know.

1139
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,040
I was just sitting there.

1140
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:31,040
I listened to a few albums whilst time traveling.

1141
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,040
I fucking surfed through the galaxies.

1142
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:37,040
The channel art for Endless Jez became my actual life in that moment.

1143
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:41,040
It was me surfing the cosmos on an electric guitar.

1144
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:48,040
And then I got on fucking online and started just completely seducing women.

1145
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:52,040
Like my fucking powers were out of control that night.

1146
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,040
My powers of seduction.

1147
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,040
It was cool.

1148
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,040
It was cool.

1149
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,040
By which I mean it was terrifying and never ever again.

1150
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,040
Yeah.

1151
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:06,040
That's exactly because I got high for the first time on Christmas and it was a waking

1152
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,040
nightmare.

1153
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,040
I jacked off six times.

1154
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,040
Yeah.

1155
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,040
Me too.

1156
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,040
What the fuck?

1157
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:16,040
I actually had to go to bed just because my dick hurt from jacking off.

1158
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,040
Yeah.

1159
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,040
My winner was sore for like three days.

1160
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:23,040
I was like, what is this doing to me?

1161
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:28,040
I just assumed because it hurt the next day and I was like, Jesus, I guess because I had

1162
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:31,040
no self-control because I was too high to know how to use my body.

1163
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:36,040
I guess because of the time travel that was going on, my hand was connected to the speed

1164
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,040
force.

1165
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:43,040
Bury down with electricity shooting out of it, burning like fucking, burning through dimensions.

1166
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:47,040
I had my own flash point.

1167
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:54,040
I fucking, I erased people from existence and changed the very fabric of reality.

1168
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:57,040
By coming on them.

1169
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,040
Yeah.

1170
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:01,040
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1171
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,040
It's all right.

1172
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,040
My cock became a Gurren Lagondrill.

1173
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:10,040
I don't remember if I was going to go anywhere else with that.

1174
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,040
So all right.

1175
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:16,040
I want you to, you turned 26 this year, right?

1176
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,040
Yeah.

1177
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,040
Yeah.

1178
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:22,040
Last year, last July, it's coming up.

1179
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,040
Okay.

1180
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,040
So your birthday is about to happen.

1181
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,040
I'm going to be 27 in about a month.

1182
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,040
You sound very upset about it.

1183
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:33,040
I am very fucking upset about it.

1184
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,040
It's the most upsetting thing in the world.

1185
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,040
We're going to die, Digi.

1186
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,040
We're all going to die.

1187
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,040
There's nothing after you realize that.

1188
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,040
Can you imagine non-existence?

1189
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,040
No, you can't imagine it and we're getting closer to it every second.

1190
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:51,040
Well, Jesse, thankfully I have religion and my religion is the singularity where I get

1191
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,040
my brain inside a computer.

1192
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,040
That's my religion.

1193
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:57,040
It's what keeps me going.

1194
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:01,040
My only goal in life is to live longer than the people younger than me.

1195
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:05,040
Yeah, that's a good goal.

1196
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:08,040
So you're the second oldest member of the PCP.

1197
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,040
I think Tom's the second oldest.

1198
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,040
I think Tom's the oldest.

1199
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:16,040
He might be already 27.

1200
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:21,040
But anyway, I want to get a picture because obviously you haven't been doing YouTube ever

1201
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,040
since whatever you were doing before it.

1202
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,040
You graduated high school.

1203
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,040
Yeah.

1204
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,040
And you went to college for a while.

1205
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,040
What were you doing in college?

1206
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:34,040
I don't know what I was doing in college and I didn't know what I was doing there when

1207
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,040
I was there.

1208
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,040
That's why I eventually stopped going.

1209
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,040
How long did you go for?

1210
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:43,040
I think I went for four or five years?

1211
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,040
Long time.

1212
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,040
Oh my God.

1213
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,040
Yeah.

1214
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,040
Was it like community college?

1215
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,040
It was a community college.

1216
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,040
I majored in everything.

1217
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,040
I got a degree in nothing.

1218
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:57,040
That's how mine went.

1219
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,040
I understand.

1220
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:05,040
I think around 2012, I dropped out of that school and I started going to Spex Howard,

1221
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,040
which is like a video editing school.

1222
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,040
I went there for one semester and I really liked it there.

1223
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:15,040
I would have completed that course except that it was like an hour and a half drive away

1224
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,040
from my house twice a week.

1225
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:22,040
Eventually I had enough of that shit so I stopped going to that too.

1226
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:30,040
Luckily around that time, I was starting, I guess the next year I started drawing horseshoes

1227
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,040
and started making Patreon money so I didn't have to fucking.

1228
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,040
In the meantime, I worked like crappy jobs.

1229
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:42,040
I worked at a cyber cafe at nights and stuff and I did farm work all the way through high

1230
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,040
school.

1231
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,040
Ben mentioned that in the last podcast because I was trying to figure, I was trying to remember

1232
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:48,040
what everybody else did for jobs.

1233
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:50,040
You said through high school you did farm work?

1234
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:57,040
Through high school and right up until like I was about 23, I guess, I was doing, I worked

1235
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:04,040
on a farm that was run by my friend's mom, a fucking sheep farm and a fucking, yeah,

1236
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,040
it was terrible.

1237
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,040
It sucked.

1238
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,040
What did you do on a farm in all that time?

1239
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,040
Oh god, everything.

1240
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:14,040
Like a lot of like bailing hay, stacking it in big piles and moving it around, barns and

1241
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:18,040
shit, which is fucking grueling and horrible and no one should ever do it.

1242
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:21,040
Why did they let you do that in high school?

1243
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,040
Oh yeah.

1244
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:26,040
It's gotta be some, was this like under the table work I'm taking it?

1245
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,040
Yeah, we were all paid in cash.

1246
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,040
I mean, it wasn't like a, we sort of fell into it because like it was my friend's house.

1247
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,040
Let's go hang out with my friend.

1248
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:38,040
Oh, by the way, while you kids are here, these sheep need to be herded and shorn and this

1249
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:44,040
hay needs to be stacked and eventually somehow that turned into an actual job and like,

1250
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:51,040
okay, you're all my workers now and fucking, yeah, so that became like a job and we all

1251
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,040
fucking lived there.

1252
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,040
It was like a sort of a second home.

1253
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:57,040
Like for a while, like I had two homes.

1254
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:01,040
Like there's like my house house and my friend's house and I would just travel between them

1255
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,040
down the road and it was cool.

1256
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:07,040
It was kind of like living on like a hippie commune with my friends and like I look back

1257
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:12,040
on those days with a lot of fondness just because like it's in the past and you were

1258
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,040
just me and you were a child and everything was good.

1259
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:17,040
I definitely would not say that I was happy.

1260
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,040
Okay.

1261
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:24,040
I was, there were some times that I was pretty miserable, but like just the fact that I was

1262
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:28,040
miserable with my friends and that we were always together and they were always around

1263
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:33,040
me is something that I don't have anymore because now I live a very solitary existence

1264
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,040
and by choice, I hate people.

1265
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,040
I'm completely misanthropic.

1266
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:40,040
I never want to be around anyone, but I also can look fondly on being around everyone.

1267
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:43,040
If you were around them enough, you would get completely sick of them.

1268
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,040
Yeah.

1269
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:48,040
I know for a fact.

1270
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:55,040
So that's where a lot of my oldest inside jokes came from is that time that I still use

1271
01:36:55,040 --> 01:37:00,040
on my channels like the Donatello thing.

1272
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:01,040
Right.

1273
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:06,040
Donatello was, I wanted to ask about that because you have all these characters who like recur

1274
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:07,040
all the time.

1275
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,040
Oh, they're not just characters.

1276
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,040
There's a lore.

1277
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:12,040
We have an entire backstory.

1278
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:19,040
There's an entire universe of this shit that we have been creating since like the first

1279
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:24,040
years of high school because we started doing fucking Vegeta impressions and then we started

1280
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:29,040
doing Goofy and then we started doing Donatello and then we started doing Dingo, which is

1281
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,040
such an obscure character.

1282
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,040
He's from Disney's Gargoyles.

1283
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,040
He's the Australian member of the pack with the Mohawk.

1284
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,040
Nobody fucking remembers Dingo, but we did Dingo.

1285
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,040
Dingo was one of our guys.

1286
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,040
He has a dome.

1287
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,040
He has many wives.

1288
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,040
He's a polygamist.

1289
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:45,040
And you know, Goofy has dinner parties every week.

1290
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,040
All the friends go there.

1291
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,040
Godzilla's there.

1292
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,040
Shaggy's there.

1293
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,040
Scooby's there.

1294
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,040
Everyone.

1295
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,040
The whole gang and Mickey's there.

1296
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,040
Nobody really likes Mickey, but he shows up uninvited.

1297
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,040
You know, Donald's there.

1298
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,040
Everybody's afraid of Donald because Donald has the worst temper.

1299
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,040
You know, he really beats people up.

1300
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,040
And for the longest time, Goofy and Vegeta were mortal enemies.

1301
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,040
They were bitter rivals.

1302
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:04,040
They were always locked in mortal combat because they were the most powerful guys.

1303
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:07,040
Nobody's stronger than Goofy when he gets angry, but Vegeta's super strong too.

1304
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,040
You know, he's a super saint.

1305
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,040
So Goofy and Vegeta, they would lock horns all the time.

1306
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:14,040
They would have these great epic battles all across the country, but eventually they became

1307
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,040
the best of friends.

1308
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:18,040
It was like fucking Dharmak and Jalad at Tanagra.

1309
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:22,040
It was like fucking Gilgamesh and then Ketu.

1310
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,040
They became like brothers.

1311
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:26,040
And to this day, they're the best of friends.

1312
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,040
But then fucking Donald shows up.

1313
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,040
Donald is a fucking loose cannon.

1314
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,040
He's out of control.

1315
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:31,040
He has the worst temper of all.

1316
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,040
And he's so fucking powerful.

1317
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,040
He kicks everybody's ass.

1318
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:37,040
So Goofy and Vegeta are constantly afraid of Donald.

1319
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:41,040
And you know, sometimes, you know, Donald has the secret stash of 80s drugs.

1320
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:46,040
And one time, Goofy and Vegeta, they raided his closet.

1321
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:47,040
Donald doesn't know about this.

1322
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,040
I hope he doesn't listen to this podcast.

1323
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:49,040
He's really mad.

1324
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,040
But they got into the closet.

1325
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:52,040
They raided his stash of 80s drugs.

1326
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:54,040
Vegeta and Goofy got on the 80s drugs.

1327
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,040
That was a whole fucking thing.

1328
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,040
And you know, they had such a fucking wild adventure.

1329
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,040
That's why Dingo stays out of it a lot of time.

1330
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,040
You know, Dingo stays in his dome now because he's kind of over the hill.

1331
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:08,040
He can't handle the wild partying ways of Goofy and Vegeta when they're on those damn 80s drugs.

1332
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:09,040
They go fucking crazy.

1333
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,040
And then Donald tells us just a fucking psychotic asshole.

1334
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:15,040
He's the worst guy ever.

1335
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:21,040
What fascinates me is that you've been writing these characters into your videos all this time.

1336
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:25,040
And no one knows why.

1337
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:30,040
And not even in a way where I think people are questioning it.

1338
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:34,040
Like they probably just don't even realize there's anything to that.

1339
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:38,040
You know, like Man Child Marsh had like almost all these guys in it.

1340
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:43,040
And they talk like they do in your story.

1341
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:48,040
And that's why in Horseshoe Finale, when I'm doing the CM Punk part,

1342
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:51,040
that part where CM Punk turns to the camera and goes,

1343
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,040
Hi Colt Cabana, how you doing?

1344
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,040
I did that part and the original line was going to be,

1345
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,040
Hi Colt Corona, how you doing?

1346
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:01,040
That's essentially why Colt Corona was created.

1347
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,040
But at the last minute when I was making Horseshoe Finale,

1348
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:08,040
I realized it would make more sense because of what the video became to me,

1349
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,040
that I should go back even farther.

1350
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:13,040
So the line became, Hi Vegeta, how you doing?

1351
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,040
Because Vegeta was the first.

1352
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:20,040
He was like the first character that set me down this wacky path of creativity, I guess.

1353
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,040
So that was a little nod to that.

1354
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,040
Yeah, it's interesting.

1355
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:27,040
I feel like I wonder if anybody has ever questioned,

1356
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,040
because you do these impersonations of the characters,

1357
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:33,040
but again, they're not based on the characters from the shows.

1358
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:37,040
They're based on your interpretations of them from this story.

1359
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:42,040
So Vegeta in a Jesse video is not Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z.

1360
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:45,040
Well, it's weird because when it started,

1361
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,040
it was sort of just a straight impersonation.

1362
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,040
And it was like in character as a TV show,

1363
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,040
but over time he stopped being,

1364
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:55,040
he became so much of like my thing,

1365
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,040
that there was like character development that went on.

1366
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:00,040
And he became the Vegeta that we now know,

1367
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:03,040
who's like sort of a lazy, underachieving,

1368
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:08,040
kind of fucking surfer bro who doesn't give a shit about anything.

1369
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:11,040
Donna Tello is my favorite though.

1370
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:14,040
And you originally did have,

1371
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:17,040
I'm mad that this video is not up anymore,

1372
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:21,040
unless it was taken down the one with just how Donna Tello is insane.

1373
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:25,040
Like, you had collected all the scenes of Donna Tello

1374
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,040
and all the Turtles movies,

1375
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,040
and it was just a video of him being fucking insane.

1376
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:33,040
And like, I think that video,

1377
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:37,040
I never thought, I never realized how crazy Donna Tello was.

1378
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:42,040
Where I started doing Donna Tello was when James Rolfe did

1379
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:45,040
his Angry Video Game Nerd video on Turtles 3, the movie,

1380
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:48,040
because it's the stupidest of the trilogy.

1381
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:51,040
He kept pointing out all of these scenes that are like,

1382
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,040
this is the dumbest line ever in a movie.

1383
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,040
This is so stupid.

1384
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,040
But the thing that he was missing,

1385
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:59,040
that I realized, all of those scenes were Donna Tello.

1386
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:02,040
All of those dumb lines were him.

1387
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,040
And so then I watched,

1388
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,040
I started watching all the movies back to back,

1389
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,040
and I watched the third one, and I realized,

1390
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:12,040
because the original Turtles movies,

1391
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:14,040
Donna Tello is a smart one.

1392
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,040
He's the guy who does machines in the cartoon.

1393
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:19,040
But the movies didn't really have a place for that

1394
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,040
in the narrative.

1395
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,040
They didn't have a lot of him doing computer stuff

1396
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:23,040
or working on machines.

1397
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,040
For a while in the first movie,

1398
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,040
he works on a truck with Casey, but that's about it.

1399
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,040
He doesn't really do machines in the movies.

1400
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,040
So I guess how they compensated for that

1401
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,040
was to just make him the oddball of the group

1402
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:36,040
and make him so fucking weird.

1403
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:38,040
And everything that Donna Tello says in those movies

1404
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:41,040
is the most insane thing you've ever heard

1405
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,040
in your fucking life.

1406
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,040
Yeah.

1407
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,040
It's like,

1408
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:45,040
I think I swallowed a frog.

1409
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,040
I hope it wasn't an ancestor.

1410
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,040
I love stuff.

1411
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,040
It's a legarama shooing.

1412
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,040
Someone in our comments has caught on

1413
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:03,040
that I love stuff is a meme among the procrastinators.

1414
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,040
And that's entirely just because

1415
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,040
of your Donna Tello impressions.

1416
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,040
Because we met at BronyCon

1417
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:12,040
and we were all doing, like, me and you kept going.

1418
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:15,040
The best one is, yeah.

1419
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,040
Yeah!

1420
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,040
Which is just, that is a Donna Tello line.

1421
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,040
Yeah, that's not a Tello.

1422
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,040
It's from the second movie,

1423
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,040
which was the only movie where he was not voiced

1424
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,040
by Corey Feldman,

1425
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,040
which is why he sounds different in the second movie.

1426
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,040
This is some very important turtle's trivia.

1427
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:29,040
Corey Feldman only played Donna Tello

1428
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,040
in the first and third movie.

1429
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,040
In the second movie, he was played by a different guy.

1430
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,040
So while he sounds different,

1431
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,040
he is still the same interpretation of the character.

1432
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,040
He is still insane.

1433
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,040
Yeah! Yeah!

1434
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:42,040
He's in like a toy store

1435
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,040
and there's like this giant, like,

1436
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,040
one of those dolls that just like

1437
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:49,040
goes back and forth and he like pushes it

1438
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,040
and it goes back and he catches it

1439
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,040
and then he pushes it again and he's like,

1440
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:56,040
Yeah! Yeah!

1441
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:59,040
And then he gets the idea to become that guy

1442
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:02,040
and he like, he starts leaning back and forth

1443
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,040
to like disguise himself as that inflatable guy

1444
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,040
and it totally fools the foot ninja

1445
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:08,040
and he starts fucking with him and beating him up.

1446
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,040
It's hilarious.

1447
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,040
Like the best thing that we ever did,

1448
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,040
like what really cemented Donna Tello

1449
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:18,040
as like a part of my fucking haul of heroes

1450
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:22,040
was when I was way back in the fucking commune farm

1451
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,040
where I used to fucking live and work with all my friends,

1452
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:26,040
whenever we weren't working,

1453
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,040
we were in the basement playing video games

1454
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,040
and hanging out and stuff

1455
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:30,040
and we had like three TVs in the basement.

1456
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:32,040
We would all play like Gears of War

1457
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:34,040
or Halo System Link or whatever

1458
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:37,040
and one time, me and my friend Dylan,

1459
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,040
we had all three Turtles movies.

1460
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,040
We had three DVD players.

1461
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,040
We had three TVs.

1462
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,040
So I wonder what happens if we turn on

1463
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,040
all three Turtles movies at once

1464
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,040
and just sit in the middle and absorb it

1465
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:53,040
and we played all three movies at once

1466
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:56,040
and we fucking laid there on the futon together as lovers

1467
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,040
in the middle of these three TVs

1468
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:01,040
absorbing this triforce of power

1469
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:05,040
and the fucking love of the Turtles

1470
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:08,040
and Donna Tello was like going into us

1471
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:12,040
and we laid there for the entire duration of the movies

1472
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:14,040
for the whole things just like

1473
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:18,040
vegging out to this insane cacophony of Turtles.

1474
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:20,040
I'm glad that's caught on now.

1475
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,040
Vegging out, I love it.

1476
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:24,040
And there were like moments when like

1477
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,040
one of my other friends who was so outside of work

1478
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,040
and like he walked in the room like

1479
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,040
hey guys, do you have a...

1480
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:32,040
What the fuck?

1481
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,040
Like he was laying there in the middle

1482
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,040
of like the three Turtles movies

1483
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:38,040
and just fucking closed the door

1484
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,040
and walked out and just fucking

1485
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:42,040
he just left.

1486
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:46,040
And that was one of the greatest moments of my life.

1487
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:48,040
Oh, that's great.

1488
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:51,040
That might be where I got my powers from.

1489
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:57,040
Alright, so to move ahead a bit from that

1490
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:01,040
again I feel like there's a lot of stuff in your videos

1491
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,040
that because I've known you for so long

1492
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:07,040
I get and I feel like no one else can

1493
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:10,040
get because they haven't been.

1494
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:14,040
And that's one of them because we...

1495
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:17,040
the procrastinators have kind of adopted those memes

1496
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,040
because...

1497
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,040
What happened? What's going on?

1498
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,040
What do you mean?

1499
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,040
I'm in a void.

1500
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,040
Can you hear me?

1501
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,040
You cut out for like 30 seconds there, buddy.

1502
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,040
That was scary. I thought that was the end of the world.

1503
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,040
Oh, Jesus.

1504
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,040
Did it just happen again?

1505
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,040
It keeps happening.

1506
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,040
This is madness.

1507
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,040
What's going on?

1508
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:45,040
What is my life?

1509
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,040
Am I here now?

1510
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,040
I don't know what happened. It just disconnected for no reason.

1511
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:54,040
What? Am I here?

1512
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:56,040
Holy shit.

1513
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:59,040
Alright, so anyway, I was saying...

1514
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,040
I can't tell if you're really here or not.

1515
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,040
Can you hear me right now?

1516
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,040
You're not here.

1517
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,040
Oh my fucking god.

1518
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:08,040
What is happening?

1519
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,040
What is this nightmare?

1520
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,040
Oh my god.

1521
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:18,040
Help!

1522
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,040
Alright, uh...

1523
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,040
Jesse.

1524
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,040
Jesse?

1525
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:26,040
I broke discord again.

1526
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:28,040
Sorry, guys.

1527
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,040
I was messing around with the triotubes.

1528
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:34,040
And I broke the audio transistor.

1529
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:38,040
Yes.

1530
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,040
I love podcasts.

1531
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,040
Hey!

1532
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,040
I was saying how...

1533
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,040
like, we...

1534
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:48,040
the other PCP members,

1535
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,040
we all, like, found out

1536
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,040
about this whole lore

1537
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,040
of all these characters.

1538
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:56,040
And so we're all in on the joke now, too.

1539
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,040
So that's why it's so surreal to me

1540
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,040
when I see something like Man Child Marsh

1541
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,040
and I'm like, no one gets this, but us!

1542
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:04,040
You know, like, yeah.

1543
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:06,040
I don't know.

1544
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:08,040
I don't know.

1545
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,040
And another one is

1546
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,040
to sort of seg you into...

1547
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:14,040
or segue, if you want,

1548
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,040
into talking about more of your history

1549
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:18,040
of how you

1550
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:20,040
got started on YouTube.

1551
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,040
You originated from

1552
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:24,040
that guy with the glasses forums, right?

1553
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:26,040
Oh, yeah.

1554
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,040
I had almost blacked that out of my memory.

1555
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:30,040
So what got you into that

1556
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:32,040
and how and where did it go?

1557
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:34,040
Um, it was just...

1558
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,040
it was just...

1559
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:38,040
when I started making videos,

1560
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,040
that was what was

1561
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:42,040
the popular thing.

1562
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:44,040
That was kind of, like,

1563
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,040
considered, I guess, the big boys' club.

1564
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,040
Um, so...

1565
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:50,040
I started hanging out in that forum

1566
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,040
because that forum had, like,

1567
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:54,040
a Your Video Review section

1568
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:56,040
where people would post their stuff.

1569
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:58,040
And, um,

1570
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,040
no real effect to it

1571
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:02,040
because it was just people posting

1572
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:04,040
their own shit and, you know,

1573
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:06,040
the only people who ever watched your stuff

1574
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,040
were the same fucking people who hung out on the forums

1575
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,040
all the time, so it was pretty worthless.

1576
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:12,040
And, um, if you can imagine

1577
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:14,040
the kind of

1578
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,040
content creators who would hang out

1579
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:18,040
on those forums, imagine

1580
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:20,040
that guy with the glasses,

1581
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,040
but worse, somehow more

1582
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:24,040
amateur than that guy with the glasses.

1583
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:26,040
Right.

1584
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,040
Because it was, like, in those days,

1585
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,040
there was no, like,

1586
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,040
there was nothing to compare to.

1587
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,040
You realize just how amateur everyone is

1588
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:36,040
on that fucking website.

1589
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:38,040
Like, even the big names, they're fucking terrible

1590
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,040
video makers, and they haven't evolved.

1591
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,040
They're still making the same trash

1592
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:44,040
they were five fucking years ago,

1593
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,040
and the people on the forum

1594
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:48,040
were, like, the fanboys of that,

1595
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,040
so they were even fucking worse.

1596
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,040
And there were only a few diamonds in the rough,

1597
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:54,040
and you pretty much,

1598
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,040
Digi, you know all of them

1599
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:58,040
because there were the friends

1600
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:00,040
that I made on there. It was

1601
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,040
Digi, and, uh, Johnny Old School,

1602
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,040
who isn't really a YouTube person anymore,

1603
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,040
but he was a pretty good one back in the day.

1604
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:08,040
Um, we became friends really quick,

1605
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,040
and, uh, the Cinemacicist,

1606
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:12,040
we became good friends, I really liked his videos,

1607
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:14,040
I still really do, he's got a great channel,

1608
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,040
and, um, Aiden from the

1609
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:18,040
Examined Life of Gaming.

1610
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:20,040
And we were, like, we were the horseshoe crew

1611
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:22,040
of those forums, and we were the best guys,

1612
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,040
we were the only people on there

1613
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,040
worth a damn, we hated everybody else,

1614
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,040
so much so that eventually I just stopped

1615
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:30,040
going there entirely, and also when I

1616
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:32,040
fell out of love with the whole concept of whatever

1617
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:34,040
that site does. So fuck it.

1618
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:36,040
Yeah. So, like,

1619
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,040
what, what era,

1620
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,040
uh, like,

1621
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:42,040
the last video you would have posted

1622
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,040
to the forums, what do you think it would have been?

1623
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:46,040
Like, when are we looking at for the time frame of this?

1624
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,040
I think, uh,

1625
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,040
it would be around,

1626
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,040
I'm pretty sure you just cut out again,

1627
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:54,040
but I'm gonna keep talking as though you haven't.

1628
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,040
I think it was around,

1629
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:58,040
oh god damn it, this annoys me, this is freaking me out.

1630
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:00,040
I think, I think I'm here.

1631
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,040
Oh, there you are.

1632
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:04,040
I don't think I said anything else after you,

1633
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:06,040
when you said that. Well, I could, god damn it,

1634
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:08,040
I feel like it keeps, I can, I can tell

1635
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:10,040
when it's like the dead air where nothing

1636
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:12,040
is being recorded. Are you sure?

1637
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:14,040
Okay, now you're back.

1638
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,040
Go ahead

1639
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,040
and continue. Okay, um,

1640
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,040
I don't know, I think the last video that I really

1641
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,040
remember posting there, it might have been

1642
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:24,040
Altered Beast, I think that was in

1643
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:26,040
like 2013 or, was it,

1644
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:28,040
I don't even fucking, so that'd be pretty early.

1645
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:30,040
Yeah, I did that in like the Silent Hill Downpour

1646
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,040
review, I know that I posted there,

1647
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:34,040
and that was in 2012.

1648
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,040
So,

1649
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:38,040
so yeah, so you, you were only there

1650
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,040
for, not

1651
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:42,040
too long, but you made those friends

1652
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,040
and then, all of them,

1653
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:46,040
I am assuming left as well.

1654
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,040
Yeah, I got everything

1655
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:50,040
decent out of there that I could,

1656
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:52,040
which was the few friends that I made there

1657
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:54,040
and then we took our talent elsewhere.

1658
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:56,040
And I'd say the, at the time

1659
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,040
the most successful out of all of you was

1660
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:00,040
Johnny Old School, right? Yeah,

1661
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:02,040
because he had his site and he had ads up on

1662
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,040
Spoonie's site, and he got a lot of traffic

1663
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:06,040
on his site. He didn't get a lot of

1664
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:08,040
subscribers or repeat traffic, I don't

1665
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,040
think, but he,

1666
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,040
I remember him saying once that he did get checks

1667
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:14,040
from AdSense on his site, so he must have been getting traffic.

1668
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:16,040
Great.

1669
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:18,040
And he eventually sort of retired

1670
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,040
from YouTube, right? Yeah, he, uh,

1671
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,040
he, uh, started,

1672
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:24,040
he moved around a lot,

1673
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:26,040
he became a chef, he, uh,

1674
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,040
started going to art school, and he had this

1675
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,040
like, uh, this big, like

1676
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:32,040
philosophical, this

1677
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:34,040
burst of hippie, artistic,

1678
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,040
personal growth.

1679
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,040
And he became, like, very, like,

1680
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:40,040
super

1681
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:42,040
one with the earth. We all need to join hands

1682
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:44,040
and be brothers.

1683
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:46,040
So, he's, he's- A midlife crisis,

1684
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,040
essentially. Yeah, well, he's not that much older

1685
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,040
than me. I think he's, like, 33.

1686
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:52,040
But, um,

1687
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,040
yeah, he's, uh, he just decided

1688
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:56,040
that, you know, I don't want to be

1689
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:58,040
Johnny Old School anymore. I don't feel like that person

1690
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,040
is me anymore, which I totally get

1691
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:02,040
because I look back on, you know,

1692
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,040
the beginning of drowning in footwear. Like, that person's

1693
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:06,040
not me anymore, you know? Right.

1694
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:08,040
And you're very into, like,

1695
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:10,040
changing names and having

1696
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,040
names for, uh, yeah,

1697
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:14,040
different meanings and stuff like that, because

1698
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:16,040
there was, like, for the longest

1699
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,040
time, everything was the

1700
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,040
drowning man. You were drowning

1701
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:22,040
in footwear, drowning in horseshoes,

1702
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:24,040
drowning in K-fabe,

1703
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:26,040
and then once the horseshoe

1704
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,040
finale came out, then all of it

1705
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:30,040
changed. And we're

1706
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:32,040
not drowning anymore, as the song

1707
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,040
went. Yeah, it's, um,

1708
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,040
I sorta- I- I like

1709
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:38,040
collecting accolades and titles for myself

1710
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,040
over time, because I sorta feel like,

1711
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:42,040
you know, every chapter

1712
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,040
has its end, and it shouldn't overstay its welcome

1713
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,040
and you should always be evolving and changing.

1714
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,040
And I sort of view it like

1715
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:50,040
how in the Hobbit, in that scene

1716
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,040
in the book, where, um, he-

1717
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,040
he is, like, describing himself to someone

1718
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,040
later on in the book, and he's giving himself

1719
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,040
all these fanciful names, like, I am the

1720
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:00,040
barrel rider, Bilbo Baggins, I am

1721
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:02,040
the troll fucker, I fucking-

1722
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:04,040
I have a ring in my pocket,

1723
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:06,040
I'm the pocket man! Look at me!

1724
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,040
You know, he's, like, giving them- he- he's giving

1725
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:10,040
himself all these fanciful accolades. That's always, like,

1726
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,040
what comes into my head when I think about it. When I

1727
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,040
go on my five minute

1728
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,040
spiels of catchphrases and names for myself

1729
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,040
when I'm-

1730
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:20,040
Yeah.

1731
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,040
Well, now it's been ruined by, uh,

1732
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:24,040
Daenerys Targaryen.

1733
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:26,040
That's true, she took that, she ruined my thing,

1734
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:28,040
that was my thing, she stole it from me,

1735
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:30,040
I should be getting residual checks on that.

1736
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:32,040
Yeah.

1737
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:34,040
Oh, she does it, it's not nearly as cool.

1738
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,040
I am- I am the master of the listing

1739
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,040
of the accolades.

1740
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:40,040
I am the gu- I am the king of names.

1741
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:42,040
I am the gu- I am the king of names.

1742
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,040
And that's a new name right there.

1743
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:46,040
I- I, like, I definitely found it

1744
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,040
exciting when you changed all the names,

1745
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:50,040
but it was really funny just because

1746
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,040
of the fact that again, and-

1747
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:54,040
Ah, fuck!

1748
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:56,040
This is, like, the biggest piece of shit

1749
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:58,040
right now in the history

1750
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:00,040
of mankind. I don't know why he's doing this.

1751
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,040
He keeps cutting out. This is out of control.

1752
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,040
I'm gonna fucking kill myself,

1753
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:06,040
I'm gonna kill every person

1754
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:08,040
in the world, I'm going to grab a fucking

1755
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:10,040
end to mine, I'm going to run

1756
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:12,040
into an angel and blow myself up,

1757
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:14,040
they're gonna replace me from a clone from the

1758
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,040
spank tank.

1759
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,040
Why the fuck is this happening to me?

1760
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:20,040
I just wanna do a fucking

1761
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:22,040
podcast.

1762
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:24,040
Oh god, can you hear me?

1763
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:26,040
Yeah.

1764
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:28,040
Okay, Jesus fucking Christ.

1765
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,040
Oh man, I don't even remember

1766
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,040
what I was gonna say, I was blinded by rage,

1767
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,040
I was fucking screaming when it cut out.

1768
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,040
Um,

1769
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:38,040
yeah, again, just,

1770
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:40,040
when you changed to Endless Jest, it was really funny

1771
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,040
because at the time,

1772
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,040
that was gonna be the, like,

1773
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,040
this is gonna be the channel of just big

1774
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:48,040
videos, and then it, like,

1775
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:50,040
very quickly became

1776
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,040
not the case.

1777
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:54,040
But, um,

1778
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:56,040
I don't know, I've been pretty down for

1779
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,040
everywhere that your journey has been taking

1780
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:00,040
you, because on the one

1781
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,040
hand, yeah, I do want

1782
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,040
the big, intelligent

1783
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:06,040
Jesse Wood content, because

1784
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:08,040
obviously, it's always

1785
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,040
exciting to get that from anybody,

1786
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:12,040
but I still think the stuff

1787
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:14,040
you're doing is stuff I don't get anywhere else,

1788
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,040
you know, like. Yeah, and definitely

1789
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:18,040
I still have the plans for those videos

1790
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:20,040
that I was planning a year ago.

1791
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,040
A lot of them have been pushed back

1792
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:24,040
because so much of what I do is spontaneous,

1793
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:26,040
even big videos, like, what you're gonna

1794
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,040
do, or the two-flaggots videos,

1795
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:30,040
those weren't videos that I planned, I had planned to do,

1796
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,040
you know, I had a whole list of things

1797
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:34,040
that I wanted to analyze and make big tributes

1798
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:36,040
to, and videos about, but those ideas

1799
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:38,040
came up, and I had to focus on those and make those,

1800
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,040
and those were big videos too, so

1801
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,040
I just do everything kind of spontaneous,

1802
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:44,040
spontaneous. Spontaneity

1803
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,040
is my blessing and curse. It gets

1804
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:48,040
in the way of everything that I want to do, but sometimes

1805
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,040
yields positive results, nevertheless.

1806
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,040
Right. I think I'm

1807
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:54,040
a lot more positive, uh,

1808
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:56,040
rather patient as a viewer,

1809
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,040
because, like, for me personally,

1810
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:00,040
I get all these people all the time

1811
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:02,040
who are, like, asking me to talk about this show

1812
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:04,040
or that show, and I'm like, guys,

1813
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,040
my channel's not going anywhere.

1814
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:08,040
Like, this is,

1815
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:10,040
like, for me, when I look at the future,

1816
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:12,040
it's like, it's always gonna be

1817
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:14,040
making more stuff, and making

1818
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:16,040
more videos, and if you hang around

1819
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:18,040
long enough, I'm gonna talk about everything,

1820
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:20,040
you know, and I get

1821
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,040
that same sense from you, where

1822
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:24,040
there's never this sense of, like,

1823
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:26,040
that you're only

1824
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:28,040
that you're just coming up with it on the spot.

1825
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:30,040
There's always a sense that there's way more

1826
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:32,040
waiting in the wings, that it's already planned,

1827
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,040
that there's already more stuff coming,

1828
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:36,040
where, like, uh, you know,

1829
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:38,040
I watch a lot of YouTubers, and I can sort of

1830
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:40,040
feel the moment when they ran out of ideas,

1831
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:42,040
when they, like,

1832
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:44,040
hit the wall, and now they're

1833
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:46,040
they're trying to come up with new stuff

1834
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,040
fast enough to keep their audience

1835
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:50,040
entertained, but they don't really

1836
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:52,040
have the ideas. I have the opposite problem.

1837
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,040
Like, I wish that my hands could work

1838
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:56,040
as fast as my brain. I can never

1839
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:58,040
catch up to the

1840
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:00,040
monument, the monumental fucking

1841
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,040
mountain, the backlog of ideas that I

1842
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,040
have at any given moment, and it's always getting bigger.

1843
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:06,040
I can't really chip away at it,

1844
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:08,040
because, like, I don't feel like

1845
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:10,040
I'm never getting another

1846
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:12,040
big Jesse experiment

1847
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:14,040
thing, like, I know it's gonna happen, because I know

1848
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:16,040
your nature as a creator, you make things

1849
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:18,040
get too big, you blow them out

1850
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:20,040
of proportion, um, so

1851
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,040
eventually it's gonna happen.

1852
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:24,040
Yeah, like, just the other day, like,

1853
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:26,040
I, uh, I got this

1854
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,040
idea to do a vlog about comics,

1855
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:30,040
and I'm like, this is a good idea for a

1856
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:32,040
vlog, so I go to film, I can't

1857
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,040
film because people are home and they're making noise,

1858
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:36,040
so I fucking, I go outside

1859
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:38,040
and I walk around, and while I'm walking around, I'm thinking

1860
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,040
about what I want to say, and

1861
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:42,040
the more I think about what I want to say,

1862
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,040
the more it becomes things I have to say, and the more it becomes

1863
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,040
a script, and so then

1864
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:48,040
I get home, and I can't fucking film it

1865
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,040
as a vlog anymore, because it's become too intelligent

1866
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,040
and too important to just

1867
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:54,040
spew out an inarticulate, incoherent

1868
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,040
vlog, so I gotta write it all out, and now

1869
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:58,040
it's a script waiting to actually be created

1870
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:00,040
and edited, which is ten times more work, and it'll never

1871
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:02,040
fucking get done. That's how it always happens,

1872
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:04,040
and I think another thing that

1873
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:06,040
like, uh, hinders

1874
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:08,040
the videos coming out that I want to make

1875
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:10,040
is because, um,

1876
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:12,040
my videos

1877
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:14,040
just the way that I make them,

1878
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,040
they all tend to have, like, an inherent

1879
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:18,040
continuity to them,

1880
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:20,040
and not even when I'm deliberately

1881
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:22,040
telling a story arc or something,

1882
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,040
not even when I'm deliberately putting continuity

1883
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:26,040
in them, just always in the background

1884
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,040
or, like, philosophically when I'm approaching

1885
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,040
what videos I'm currently making,

1886
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,040
because it'll be, like,

1887
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,040
uh, I fuck, totally lost my

1888
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:36,040
train of thought right there. I like the beer quest.

1889
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:38,040
Yeah, it's like,

1890
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:40,040
if I'm doing fucking, like, I have this

1891
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:42,040
great idea for this video,

1892
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:44,040
but this video will only make sense

1893
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:46,040
after I do this video, and I

1894
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,040
can't do this video until I get all of these

1895
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:50,040
little things out of the way so that that one makes sense.

1896
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,040
But none of these little things are going to make any sense

1897
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:54,040
unless I set them up with this thing first.

1898
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,040
So no matter what I want to do,

1899
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:58,040
it always becomes, like, this weird act of

1900
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:00,040
dominoes where, like, I have to

1901
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:02,040
fucking foresee 30 steps into

1902
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:04,040
the future and then work my way backwards

1903
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:06,040
from what I want to do to get

1904
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,040
to the point where I can make that video.

1905
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:10,040
Yeah, I'd say

1906
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:12,040
more so than a continuity, it's like a

1907
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:14,040
train of thought. Like,

1908
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:16,040
I mean, even with all the

1909
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:18,040
random vlogs, there's always this

1910
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,040
very vague sense of

1911
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,040
them happening one after another

1912
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:24,040
and that that's the best, like, the

1913
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:26,040
reason this vlog is happening is because

1914
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:28,040
of the last vlog, you know,

1915
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:30,040
where, like, something happened in that

1916
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:32,040
one that's affected you to make

1917
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:34,040
this one. And

1918
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:36,040
yeah, I mean, it makes

1919
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:38,040
sense, and I've gotten into

1920
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:40,040
that too before where I've had

1921
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,040
stuff that only made

1922
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:44,040
sense to me at the time, and then once I

1923
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:46,040
held onto the script for too long, it just no longer

1924
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:48,040
felt like it would, like,

1925
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:50,040
why would I do this now? This was

1926
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:52,040
a story for then, you know,

1927
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:54,040
um, and now it's

1928
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:56,040
dead. And it's weird to me that, like,

1929
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:58,040
all of the ideas that I had

1930
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:00,040
for endless just content when I started the channel

1931
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:02,040
are ideas that I still have

1932
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:04,040
waiting in the wings, a series that I want to

1933
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:06,040
do, like, uh, fucking,

1934
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:08,040
I don't even fucking know, like,

1935
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,040
I don't know what it is that makes it so hard

1936
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:12,040
for me, because, like, I similarly have

1937
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:14,040
an endless sea of ideas,

1938
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,040
and it's just a matter of, like,

1939
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:18,040
psyching myself to

1940
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:20,040
write them, like. Yeah, and it's also,

1941
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:22,040
like, you know, um,

1942
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:24,040
breaking them apart into little chunks,

1943
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,040
because I do want to make more,

1944
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:28,040
like, analytical videos, like,

1945
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:30,040
Nerdwriter, and I've, like, as much as I complain

1946
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,040
about Nerdwriter, he's kind of

1947
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:34,040
becoming an influence, like, just the way

1948
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:36,040
that he makes his videos, like,

1949
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:38,040
I don't have to make a huge

1950
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,040
blowout analysis of a show,

1951
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,040
I can pick the elements

1952
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:44,040
of the show one at a time, and make five

1953
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:46,040
minute videos about those. So, for example,

1954
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:48,040
that's, that's a huge thing I've

1955
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:50,040
been doing now. So I have this,

1956
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,040
I have this gigantic, like,

1957
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:54,040
I have a gigantic, I have, like, a 30

1958
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:56,040
page analysis of Hey Arnold,

1959
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:58,040
that I wrote, like, two years

1960
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:00,040
ago, and I'll

1961
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:02,040
never fucking do it, except

1962
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:04,040
just recently, I took a look at it, and, like, wait a minute,

1963
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:06,040
I can segment this off here, and here, and here,

1964
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:08,040
and make, like, four different videos about this.

1965
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,040
And maybe that'll help in the future

1966
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:12,040
to get these analytics, because I want

1967
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:14,040
to go back to having more analytical videos.

1968
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:16,040
I just, I don't just want to be

1969
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:18,040
vlog, I don't ever just want to be one

1970
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:20,040
thing, ever. Right.

1971
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,040
Not just a ranty man,

1972
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,040
it is a, it is a basement. Yeah.

1973
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:26,040
Um, yeah, man, it's,

1974
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:28,040
I, I picked up on that, like, big time

1975
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:30,040
recently, too, where it was, like, it always

1976
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:32,040
felt like I had to either do

1977
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:34,040
a short review that didn't say enough,

1978
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:36,040
or a long review that had to say

1979
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:38,040
everything, and that at some point, I went,

1980
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,040
like, hey, what if I, like,

1981
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:42,040
did Ava episode by episode,

1982
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:44,040
you know? I'd say that was, like,

1983
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:46,040
that was sort of what made me realize I could do

1984
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:48,040
that was the Ava stuff,

1985
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:50,040
because for years, and you've had the same problem

1986
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:52,040
with the same show, I know,

1987
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:54,040
that you've wanted to talk about Ava for so long,

1988
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:56,040
and it's just the daunting nature of it. And here's,

1989
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,040
here's what I came up with

1990
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:00,040
to solve that dilemma, and this is going to be

1991
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:02,040
happening, and I'm going to let this cat out of the bag right now,

1992
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:04,040
because I'm excited about it, I want everyone to know

1993
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:06,040
this genius idea that I've had.

1994
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:08,040
I'm going to make a new series on my Japanese

1995
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,040
animes, loosely based

1996
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:12,040
on Nate's series,

1997
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:14,040
and it's going to be called, Best

1998
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:15,040
Anime

1999
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:16,040
Ever.

2000
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:19,040
And it's all going to be Ava.

2001
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,040
Eh, eh, yes, applause,

2002
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:23,040
applause for that brilliant fucking pun!

2003
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:25,040
I'm a genius! I'm going to take the anime

2004
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:27,040
YouTuber world by storm!

2005
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:30,040
That's pretty great. And then all those fucking

2006
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:32,040
gods on the Ava subreddit

2007
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:34,040
who fucking downvoted and

2008
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:36,040
whined about my Ask

2009
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:38,040
AMV, they're all going to see, when I become

2010
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,040
the internet's undisputed king

2011
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:42,040
of Avangelion analysis, they're all going to see

2012
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,040
how wrong they were, and they're going to

2013
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:46,040
beg me for forgiveness, and I will say

2014
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,040
the nay! Be gone with you

2015
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:50,040
cad! Be gone from my kingdom!

2016
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:52,040
You are banished from the land!

2017
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,040
We'll lead us to kings,

2018
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:00,040
We'll fucking lead us to kings!

2019
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:04,040
Oh man, that is a good idea.

2020
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,040
Yeah, I thought it was interesting too

2021
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,040
you mentioned Nerdwriter, because

2022
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:11,040
you said the phrase, the medium is the

2023
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,040
message twice at the start of this podcast

2024
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,040
which is his video

2025
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:17,040
that I keep quoting all the time.

2026
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,040
But yeah, it's, I would

2027
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,040
love to see more of it, and I think another thing

2028
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,040
that would help you

2029
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:27,040
that I've adopted

2030
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:29,040
is just not being afraid of retreading

2031
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,040
stuff, like

2032
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,040
at some point I realized

2033
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:35,040
that, because I'm always going to hate

2034
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,040
my old review of something, like

2035
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,040
my opinion changes over time, or I figure

2036
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:41,040
out more to say about it,

2037
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:43,040
and so like, when I

2038
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:45,040
first started doing anime videos

2039
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:47,040
it was mostly these 10-20

2040
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:49,040
minute reviews of a show

2041
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:51,040
and now I'm going back

2042
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:53,040
and looking at those, and being like, this doesn't say

2043
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,040
anywhere near all that I have to say about it.

2044
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,040
And I could do

2045
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:59,040
like 30 more videos about this show

2046
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,040
you know, I could just keep doing videos about it

2047
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,040
forever, and what's great about these

2048
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:05,040
vlogs I've been doing is that it

2049
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:07,040
lets me just like

2050
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:09,040
get the basic thought out there, like

2051
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:11,040
you know, all these ideas that I've got

2052
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,040
in my head that I'm like, oh well

2053
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:15,040
it's not enough to make a whole video out of it

2054
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,040
but I kind of have this idea

2055
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,040
and I just like burned through like 30 of those

2056
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:21,040
things that have just been like weighing on

2057
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,040
my mind, and some of them

2058
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,040
it's great because they were stupid

2059
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,040
like the Metroidvania thing

2060
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,040
like for like a year I legitimately

2061
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:31,040
wanted to make like a full analysis

2062
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,040
video about why Metroidvania is a bad

2063
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:35,040
term, and then I made the vlog about it

2064
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:37,040
and like within days I was like, that's the

2065
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:39,040
stupidest vlog ever, like

2066
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:41,040
no one gives a fuck

2067
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:43,040
this would have been a terrible video, it would have

2068
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,040
been a huge waste of time, I'm so glad you

2069
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:47,040
bring up it. It's funny that you bring up the

2070
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,040
Metroidvania vlog because it goes into what we

2071
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:51,040
were talking about before, with things

2072
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,040
spiraling out of control and getting too intricate

2073
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,040
because I made a reply video

2074
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:57,040
to that vlog to go with yours

2075
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:59,040
and Nate's, and

2076
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:01,040
in the making of my reply

2077
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:03,040
video it became

2078
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:05,040
way too intricate and it became an actual

2079
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:07,040
video, and then

2080
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:09,040
I realized that I

2081
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:11,040
can't post this video yet

2082
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:13,040
because in order to make this video how I

2083
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:15,040
want it, Colt Corona needs

2084
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:17,040
to come out of the furnace room and he hasn't yet

2085
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:19,040
so now that

2086
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:21,040
video is now waiting in the wings

2087
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,040
because Colt Corona is still barricaded

2088
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:25,040
in my damn furnace room.

2089
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,040
Do you even still want to do that video

2090
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:29,040
now that you've heard me talk about how

2091
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,040
retarded even I find my own

2092
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:33,040
Metroidvania video? No, I still

2093
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:35,040
want to do it because it's going to be hilarious, it's going to be great.

2094
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:37,040
Don't you have some

2095
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:39,040
Dark Souls 2 response videos that you

2096
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:41,040
made as well? Yeah, I made

2097
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:43,040
Baby Bro plays Dark Souls 2

2098
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:45,040
and it's

2099
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,040
I made a character called

2100
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,040
Baby Bro, first

2101
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:51,040
he was named Dildo Bro, but then I changed it to

2102
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,040
Baby Bro, and it's

2103
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:55,040
just a big fat you in a diaper

2104
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:57,040
going around going

2105
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:59,040
why is the animation

2106
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,040
so bad? These

2107
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:03,040
ladies are mean, they're telling me the game

2108
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:05,040
is hard, it's stupid

2109
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:07,040
and I did

2110
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:09,040
that for about an hour

2111
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:11,040
and then that's still coming out, right?

2112
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,040
Yeah, I made

2113
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:15,040
that, but then to go along with it

2114
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,040
I also made a let's play of me playing

2115
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:19,040
the game with my like normal narration

2116
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,040
talking about the things about the game that I like

2117
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,040
and I was going to splice them together

2118
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,040
and just the act of splicing them together became like

2119
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:27,040
I don't give a shit about this anymore, fuck it

2120
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:29,040
and I don't care at all

2121
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:31,040
about those Dark Souls 2 videos

2122
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:33,040
Yeah, that's the thing, it's a

2123
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:35,040
debate that neither of us care to win

2124
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:37,040
No

2125
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:39,040
I don't, it's like

2126
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:41,040
well like I said, I really went into it

2127
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,040
like with this venomous like

2128
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:45,040
yeah, nobody's chat on this game enough

2129
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:47,040
I'm going to shit on it harder than anybody

2130
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:49,040
and then like very quickly I realized

2131
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:51,040
I have two problems with the game

2132
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,040
that aren't like, obviously

2133
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:55,040
if you like the game, those two things

2134
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:57,040
don't bother you, so

2135
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,040
this is not helpful for anybody

2136
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:01,040
you know, like the only people who are going to be entertained

2137
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,040
are people who already feel exactly like I feel

2138
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:05,040
and don't need me to tell them all this stuff

2139
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:07,040
you know

2140
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,040
so yeah

2141
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:11,040
those videos are terrible

2142
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:13,040
man, especially after like part 4

2143
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:15,040
they just get really... it's funny that like

2144
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:17,040
you did that video

2145
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,040
and then immediately after

2146
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:21,040
Aiden did his Serious Sam video

2147
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:23,040
which was the same video

2148
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,040
but much worse

2149
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:27,040
yeah, but like

2150
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,040
watching both of you guys do that

2151
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:31,040
it like sort of inspired me to like

2152
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:33,040
I wish that there was a game

2153
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:35,040
that I hated this much, that I could also

2154
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:37,040
let's play and do one of these of my own

2155
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:39,040
and just pedantically bitch about

2156
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:41,040
every single tiny detail to the point of absurdity

2157
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,040
but like I couldn't think

2158
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:45,040
of a game that I hate enough

2159
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:47,040
and like take it off the rails in a way

2160
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:49,040
like because I know that's how it would go with you

2161
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,040
you would eventually

2162
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:53,040
it would go beyond the impossible

2163
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:55,040
like the only things

2164
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:57,040
like the only things that I could think of

2165
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:59,040
were like, okay, Final Fantasy 13

2166
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,040
but everybody's already done that

2167
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:03,040
it's the most overdone fucking thing in the world

2168
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,040
and there's only one complaint

2169
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:07,040
it's a hallway

2170
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:09,040
wow, that's the whole fucking video

2171
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:11,040
that and the story doesn't make any sense

2172
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:13,040
two complaints, so why, what's even the point

2173
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,040
and then the other one

2174
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:17,040
was Mass Effect 3

2175
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:19,040
but that's a fucking 40 hour game

2176
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:21,040
I'm not ever playing a 40 hour game

2177
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:23,040
that I know I hate

2178
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,040
well, it's only like 25 hours

2179
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:27,040
well maybe I'll do it then

2180
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:31,040
well that was also the conclusion

2181
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,040
I reached with Dark Souls 2

2182
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:35,040
it's long and

2183
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:37,040
if I had unique things

2184
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:39,040
to say about every level

2185
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:41,040
then it would have been worth it

2186
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:43,040
I recorded three episodes with Shade

2187
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:45,040
two of which I haven't released yet

2188
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:47,040
but when I'm playing with him

2189
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:49,040
because he hates the game too

2190
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:51,040
but he's amazing at it

2191
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:53,040
and watching him play it I really couldn't

2192
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:55,040
even process what was happening fast enough

2193
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,040
to complain about it and I was like

2194
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:59,040
why am I doing this, I have no stakes in this game

2195
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:01,040
and even Mass Effect 3

2196
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:03,040
is so over talked about

2197
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:05,040
who gives a shit at this point

2198
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:07,040
I actually think

2199
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:09,040
Mass Effect 3 might be

2200
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:11,040
underrated at this point

2201
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:13,040
people shout on it so much

2202
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:15,040
when a lot of it's pretty good

2203
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:17,040
there are parts of the story

2204
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,040
that are really cool

2205
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,040
like the fucking

2206
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:23,040
the part with the fucking

2207
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:25,040
yeah

2208
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:27,040
the Morden

2209
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:29,040
the Morden's part is great in that game

2210
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:31,040
that's about it I guess

2211
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:33,040
it's one of the best parts in the whole fucking series

2212
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:35,040
the game has to get some credit

2213
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:39,040
but yeah

2214
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:41,040
so there has to be like I have to find

2215
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:43,040
a game that's like

2216
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:45,040
all gameplay

2217
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:47,040
that only I hate

2218
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:49,040
and I hate psychotically and no one else does

2219
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:51,040
and I don't think a game like that exists

2220
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:53,040
or if it does I can't think of it

2221
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:55,040
so alright

2222
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:57,040
I know that for the future

2223
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:59,040
of your work

2224
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:01,040
you're definitely planning to put more into my Japanese

2225
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:03,040
animes

2226
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,040
that's like the channel you're considering

2227
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,040
this will get me big

2228
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,040
that has to be the channel that I

2229
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:11,040
promote when I'm telling people about myself

2230
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:13,040
because it's the only channel that makes sense

2231
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:15,040
and I'm determined to have it keep making sense

2232
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:17,040
I'm determined to

2233
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,040
keep all of my weird meta shit

2234
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,040
away from it as far away as possible

2235
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:23,040
no dumb story arcs at all

2236
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:25,040
my Japanese anime has to remain pure

2237
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:27,040
for the good of all mankind

2238
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:29,040
well I've always felt like what makes

2239
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:31,040
my Japanese animes work is that

2240
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:33,040
it seems like

2241
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:35,040
you have less

2242
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:37,040
stakes in anime than any other

2243
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:39,040
medium

2244
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:41,040
where it's kind of like you're not the big anime guy

2245
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:43,040
like I am

2246
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:45,040
and because someone like me exists

2247
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:47,040
you don't have to be

2248
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:51,040
cause it's so irreverent

2249
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:53,040
and dumb in a way where

2250
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:55,040
if you made a Hey Arnold video

2251
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:57,040
you wouldn't want it to be that

2252
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,040
cause you want to prove to the world

2253
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:01,040
how cool Hey Arnold is

2254
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:03,040
but with Japanese animes

2255
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,040
it's like attack on Titan who fucking cares

2256
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:07,040
write the dumbest

2257
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:09,040
most irreverent review of it possible

2258
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:11,040
but it's funny and that's what makes it work

2259
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:13,040
and in a lot of ways that's better than doing a critique

2260
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:15,040
or an analysis because I talk all the time

2261
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,040
about how I can't stand

2262
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:19,040
critics or reviewers

2263
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:21,040
and I think reviews are a medium

2264
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:23,040
where I can't lie and be wiped off the face of the earth

2265
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:25,040
and what I like about my Japanese animes

2266
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:27,040
is like even if I sometimes

2267
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:29,040
like I complain about bleach in the video

2268
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,040
but the video is more about

2269
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:33,040
sharing bleach with everybody

2270
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:35,040
the purpose of the videos on that channel

2271
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,040
is to like I like anime

2272
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:39,040
let's all like anime together

2273
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:41,040
and talk about how silly it is

2274
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:43,040
I always felt like what's great about those videos

2275
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:45,040
and this is something that they really have

2276
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:47,040
the most in common with the donkey I think

2277
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:49,040
who I only got into more recently

2278
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:51,040
but like they're good at

2279
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:53,040
cutting very quickly to the heart

2280
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:55,040
of like how you feel about it

2281
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:57,040
it's not about like

2282
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:59,040
it's like a very like with the bleach one

2283
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:01,040
the point of it is

2284
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:03,040
I liked it when I was a teenager

2285
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:05,040
because it was stylish and cool

2286
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:07,040
it went downhill over the years and like

2287
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:09,040
that's the important facts to you

2288
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:11,040
not like the why

2289
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,040
but the fact that that's what happened

2290
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:15,040
and you presented in this hilarious way

2291
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:17,040
or with Pokemon where

2292
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:19,040
that one's fucking amazing because it's really

2293
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,040
it's not really about

2294
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:23,040
Pokemon per se it's about

2295
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:25,040
the disillusionment that comes with growing up

2296
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:27,040
and realizing that you were

2297
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,040
infatuated with a commercial product

2298
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:31,040
that has moved on to another generation

2299
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:33,040
you know and

2300
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,040
it's fucking genius like

2301
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,040
because yeah you could talk about

2302
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:39,040
what actually happens in Pokemon

2303
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:41,040
but instead you just concentrated

2304
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:43,040
on the emotional connection

2305
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:45,040
you have with it and

2306
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:47,040
I think that's what a lot of those videos are

2307
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:49,040
with something like Madoka

2308
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:51,040
it's just like it's a fun blue be cool

2309
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:53,040
show so here's a fun blue be cool

2310
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:55,040
poem about it yeah we did it

2311
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,040
you know there's nothing more that needs

2312
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:59,040
to be said you made the point

2313
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:01,040
it's cool

2314
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:03,040
so yeah I think

2315
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:05,040
that channel works well for that

2316
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:07,040
but anyway back the reason I brought

2317
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,040
it up that channel

2318
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:11,040
I know you're planning to put some more

2319
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,040
focus on you've got the big endless just

2320
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:15,040
videos that are still

2321
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:17,040
stashed away somewhere

2322
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:19,040
at some point the man child incorporated arc

2323
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:21,040
will end is that channel going to stay active

2324
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:23,040
after that do you think

2325
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:25,040
yeah I think man child incorporated will still exist

2326
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:27,040
because I still think it's a funny gimmick and I still

2327
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:29,040
I still have ideas

2328
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:31,040
for shows to cover on it

2329
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:33,040
that I didn't get to do before so I'll probably

2330
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:35,040
get to them after I finish up the stupid arc

2331
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:37,040
it's such a stupid

2332
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:39,040
thing and like it's such a knowingly stupid

2333
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,040
thing like that's the point like

2334
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:43,040
the horseshoes saga was kind of meant to be

2335
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:45,040
deep or like insightful

2336
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,040
or poignant or important

2337
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,040
to me right so that's what it's

2338
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:51,040
so that's what it became but like from

2339
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:53,040
the inception of this one

2340
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:55,040
this was meant to be

2341
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:57,040
retarded and so

2342
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:59,040
I've succeeded more than I thought

2343
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:01,040
possible in that

2344
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:03,040
I've made it so fucking retarded I barely

2345
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:05,040
even want to do it

2346
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:07,040
right I I completely

2347
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:09,040
know that feeling though because I've got

2348
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:11,040
I think that's what happened

2349
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:13,040
with uh I have a lot

2350
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:15,040
of these ideas like plans for very

2351
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:17,040
small anime videos that are

2352
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:19,040
like they'll be easy to write

2353
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:21,040
and like catchy and fun

2354
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:23,040
but they're so

2355
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:25,040
not artistically fulfilling

2356
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:27,040
that I can't bring myself to write

2357
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:29,040
them where it'll be like

2358
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:31,040
like some of the like cool character designs

2359
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:33,040
and stuff like that like I have a bunch of great ideas

2360
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:35,040
for that but for me it's

2361
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:37,040
like if I'm not doing this 12

2362
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:39,040
part you know hours long

2363
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:41,040
takedown of some show or whatever

2364
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:43,040
then I don't feel like I'm

2365
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:45,040
doing like I don't feel like I'm living up to my full potential

2366
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:47,040
you know so it's like

2367
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:49,040
when am I gonna make

2368
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:51,040
the next video that makes people

2369
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:53,040
rethink what an anime analysis

2370
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:55,040
on YouTube can be like that's what I

2371
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:57,040
you know what I'm worried about

2372
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:59,040
even though I don't have any ideas for that so

2373
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,040
instead I'm just doing nothing

2374
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:03,040
because I can't do one way or the other

2375
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:05,040
um

2376
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:07,040
would you say that's comparable

2377
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,040
yeah we all uh

2378
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,040
I think you might have talked

2379
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:13,040
about this on Digi Bros maybe not

2380
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:15,040
but we all as a group decided

2381
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:17,040
that like we had squad goals for June

2382
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:19,040
and we all amongst ourselves

2383
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:21,040
were like okay guys we're gonna kick

2384
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:23,040
so much ass in June we're all gonna have a bunch

2385
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:25,040
of great videos we're gonna stop fucking around

2386
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:27,040
where the fuck's Nate's new video now that you mention it

2387
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:29,040
and

2388
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,040
like we all were gung ho about June

2389
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:33,040
none of us have done anything

2390
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:35,040
with this been the same shit

2391
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:37,040
no it's

2392
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:39,040
it's particularly bad because it was like

2393
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:41,040
the last day

2394
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:43,040
of May I got out of

2395
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:45,040
video you got out of

2396
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:47,040
vlog and uh

2397
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:49,040
I think Hippo had like a short video he did

2398
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:51,040
or no he did the GRPJ video on Kingdom Hearts

2399
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,040
and Nate was saying

2400
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,040
that he had a video that was gonna come out

2401
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,040
that day

2402
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,040
it's been nine

2403
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:01,040
fucking days

2404
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:03,040
and Nate's video hasn't come out yet

2405
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:07,040
what the fuck is happening

2406
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:09,040
I haven't done

2407
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:11,040
jack shit

2408
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,040
you haven't done jack shit

2409
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:15,040
in terms of what you said you were gonna do

2410
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,040
um

2411
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:19,040
I know Hippo's

2412
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:21,040
working towards a video

2413
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:23,040
but he's having difficulty on the technical

2414
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:25,040
end but yeah

2415
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:27,040
it was definitely like squad goals

2416
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:29,040
June's the month and

2417
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,040
yeah

2418
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:33,040
I just keep doing podcasts

2419
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:35,040
instead

2420
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:37,040
it's just easier and again like I said

2421
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,040
like

2422
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:41,040
like when I said like June

2423
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,040
like yeah I'm gonna have all these plans

2424
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:45,040
like I have so many ideas for videos

2425
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:47,040
and I just like I can't get excited about them

2426
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:49,040
because they're not big enough nothing's big enough

2427
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:51,040
to make me feel like I'm following up

2428
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:53,040
the asterisk war videos

2429
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:55,040
yeah it's like fucking it's like heroin

2430
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:57,040
you know that first high

2431
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,040
is the best one and then

2432
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:01,040
you need a bigger one you need only

2433
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:03,040
a huge fucking hit will satisfy you

2434
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:05,040
everything else just feels like small potatoes

2435
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:07,040
and you finish like 10 vlogs in one day

2436
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:09,040
and you've got all this content but none of it means

2437
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:11,040
anything and it's just killing your soul

2438
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:13,040
slowly well for me the hardest part

2439
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:15,040
is that like because

2440
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:17,040
last month I got so used to doing vlogs

2441
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:19,040
and I'm having fun

2442
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:21,040
with it and I like that I'm sort of like finding

2443
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:23,040
new ways to do them

2444
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,040
but I can't

2445
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:27,040
monetize vlogs and I have to pay

2446
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:29,040
the DeVoo like he has

2447
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:31,040
dedicated his self

2448
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:33,040
to full time being my video editor so if

2449
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:35,040
I don't give him videos then he's also

2450
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,040
fucked so it's like

2451
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:39,040
we both need me to be writing scripts

2452
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:41,040
um

2453
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:43,040
and I'm so down on ideas

2454
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:45,040
but uh yeah

2455
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:47,040
enough about me this podcast is about you

2456
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,040
what I was leading up to

2457
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:51,040
by saying that I I know but we are all the

2458
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:53,040
DeVoo

2459
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:55,040
um

2460
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:57,040
I know what the future holds

2461
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:59,040
for the the endless

2462
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:01,040
Jess saga but are there any

2463
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:03,040
like big projects that you completely

2464
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:05,040
will never do that you wanted

2465
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:07,040
to do like throughout your whole career

2466
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:09,040
um I don't know

2467
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,040
I remain hopeful about pretty much

2468
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:13,040
everything I mean

2469
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:15,040
there might be videos that I've written that I wouldn't

2470
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:17,040
now would think are stupid

2471
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:19,040
and shouldn't be done but I can't really think of them

2472
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:21,040
like I still want to do gun buster on my Japanese

2473
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:23,040
anime is I still want to do all my millions of

2474
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:25,040
Ava videos and my big cowboy bebop video

2475
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,040
and all that shit there's a million endless

2476
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:29,040
Jess videos I want to do

2477
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:31,040
I it's

2478
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:33,040
you know logically I know it's impossible

2479
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:35,040
that I'll ever do all of them but I have to

2480
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,040
remain hopeful about my

2481
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:39,040
because I have so many like complete scripts

2482
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:41,040
that are good that are so good

2483
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:43,040
that have been sitting there for some of them

2484
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:45,040
for years and it's

2485
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:47,040
just sad that I that I

2486
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:49,040
don't have like a team of editors

2487
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:51,040
or something to finish this shit for me

2488
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:55,040
and you also are but you also don't trust

2489
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:57,040
editors you're not a fan

2490
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:59,040
of the idea of handing your work away

2491
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:01,040
yeah well I was talking to DeVoo about

2492
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,040
this and it's not

2493
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:05,040
necessarily that I don't trust the editors

2494
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:07,040
it's that I don't trust

2495
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:09,040
my ability to articulate myself

2496
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:11,040
to them over the internet because

2497
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:13,040
if DeVoo and I

2498
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:15,040
if you're if you were editing a video of mine

2499
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:17,040
and we were in the same house I could come up to

2500
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:19,040
anyone and say hey man put this here

2501
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:21,040
and put that there alright but over the internet

2502
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:23,040
like I hate communicating

2503
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:25,040
over the internet it feels not human

2504
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:27,040
and it feels awkward and it's hard to express

2505
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:29,040
like an artistic idea

2506
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:31,040
over the internet

2507
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:33,040
I would agree with that

2508
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:35,040
and I'm not I'm not into collabs

2509
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:37,040
either like again I've said this

2510
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,040
before but the reason I hired DeVoo is

2511
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:41,040
because he understood

2512
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:43,040
everything I was doing perfectly

2513
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:45,040
and can do it better you know

2514
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,040
so there was

2515
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:49,040
because I think I was

2516
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:51,040
like re-listening to some podcast

2517
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:53,040
that we did where I was describing

2518
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:55,040
that like

2519
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:57,040
I just like it's not that I

2520
02:20:57,040 --> 02:20:59,040
don't have an idea of how to make the videos

2521
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:01,040
better I just won't do it

2522
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:03,040
because like I'm lazy and

2523
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:05,040
I want it out too fast

2524
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:07,040
so like I'll think well

2525
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:09,040
this might look better if I did

2526
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:11,040
some effect here but uh fuck it

2527
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:13,040
you know and so I give it to DeVoo

2528
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,040
because he'll have the same instinct but he'll do it

2529
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:17,040
so

2530
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:19,040
that's what makes him a great editor for me

2531
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:21,040
but yeah I could easily see

2532
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:23,040
like you know he can't just

2533
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:25,040
instinctually know what funny

2534
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:27,040
anime face you'd put in at a part

2535
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:29,040
you know yeah

2536
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:31,040
in the editing that you would do

2537
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:33,040
so alright

2538
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:35,040
so you don't have any projects that are just

2539
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:37,040
completely cutting room floor gone

2540
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:39,040
at least at present

2541
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:41,040
I know there was a point

2542
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,040
where you were gonna adopt Johnny

2543
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,040
old school's name and become

2544
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:47,040
oh yeah yeah before I settled on Endless

2545
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:49,040
Jess

2546
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,040
my idea was uh the old school

2547
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:53,040
fool

2548
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,040
and that's where that silly catchphrase came from

2549
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:57,040
where um uh Johnny was gonna

2550
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:59,040
give me his domain name

2551
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:01,040
and I was gonna

2552
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:03,040
because I had so many channels and I didn't know what I was doing with him yet

2553
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:05,040
so I got the idea that I wanted like a website

2554
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:07,040
for all of them I don't really I guess that's

2555
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:09,040
something that's on the cutting room floor that I don't care about anymore

2556
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:11,040
is getting my own website because who gives a shit

2557
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:13,040
right I think we've all

2558
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:15,040
had that like there was a long

2559
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:17,040
time where we were coming up with all these different

2560
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:19,040
ways to make a website for like the whole

2561
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:21,040
horseshoe crew or just some of us and

2562
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:23,040
it's just nobody goes to websites

2563
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:25,040
anymore so it doesn't feel like there's a point

2564
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:27,040
to it

2565
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:29,040
um oh

2566
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:31,040
here's one though that you used

2567
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:33,040
I just remembered this

2568
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:35,040
you used to talk about starting

2569
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:37,040
up the series all the time but I have no

2570
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:39,040
idea if you're still intending on it at all

2571
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:41,040
because I haven't heard you bring it up in well over a year

2572
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:43,040
spirit of the 90s

2573
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,040
oh yeah I forgot

2574
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:47,040
about good old spirit of the

2575
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,040
oh fuck god the thing about spirit of the

2576
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:51,040
90s is that I'm running

2577
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:53,040
out of time because

2578
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,040
the joke behind

2579
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:57,040
spirit of the 90s it was

2580
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:59,040
gonna be like a 90s nostalgia show

2581
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:01,040
but

2582
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:03,040
I would be in like

2583
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:05,040
an old man costume

2584
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:07,040
and the joke was that

2585
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:09,040
I'm only in my

2586
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:11,040
20s but I feel like a fucking old

2587
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:13,040
man so I'm like

2588
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:15,040
doing this like 90s

2589
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:17,040
nostalgia show from the perspective

2590
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:19,040
of remember those stick on

2591
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,040
earrings and that you would put

2592
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,040
in those fucking braces that you'd

2593
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:25,040
slap on your hands I'm gonna

2594
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:27,040
die soon and that was funny

2595
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:29,040
because when I came up with the idea I was

2596
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:31,040
23 now I'm almost 27

2597
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:33,040
I feel like the joke is

2598
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:35,040
running out of time I'm not gonna be

2599
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:37,040
in my 20s much longer

2600
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:39,040
and I'll just be legitimately

2601
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:41,040
an old man which will ruin the entire

2602
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:43,040
joke right I

2603
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:45,040
didn't even realize that was part of it I just

2604
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:47,040
remember that you were buying posters

2605
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:49,040
for spirit of the 90s

2606
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:51,040
like you bought the good burger poster for that

2607
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,040
I think yeah another burger posters

2608
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,040
a part of my room yeah because that was

2609
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:57,040
like I always had the impression that the way

2610
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:59,040
a Jesse Wood saga starts

2611
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:01,040
is you buy everything for the set

2612
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:03,040
and then you start writing the scripts

2613
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:05,040
and all the Genesis it all

2614
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:07,040
starts with me buying a poster

2615
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:09,040
at 4am drunk on Amazon

2616
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:11,040
and then a fucking arc comes

2617
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:13,040
out of it

2618
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:15,040
the fucking Miss

2619
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:17,040
Elizabeth poster

2620
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:19,040
got like 3 vlogs out of it

2621
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:21,040
there's 3 videos and that's still

2622
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:23,040
one of my favorite posters it's super cool

2623
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:25,040
I uh yeah

2624
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:27,040
I now have

2625
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:29,040
more than enough Oscar posters

2626
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:31,040
to put an entire wall

2627
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:33,040
just Oscar

2628
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:35,040
and I'm waiting for the right moment

2629
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:37,040
to unleash that gag on the world

2630
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:39,040
it has to be the right video

2631
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:41,040
I remember

2632
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,040
a time you told me

2633
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:45,040
that you realized

2634
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:47,040
that you suddenly looked around

2635
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:49,040
your room and realized that you had all these

2636
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:51,040
posters of a 14 year old girl

2637
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:53,040
and that you're a 27 year old

2638
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,040
man and you were like this is creepy

2639
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:57,040
even for me

2640
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,040
it's getting weird

2641
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:01,040
I have to change I have to put

2642
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:03,040
Misato posters up now for the next 15 years

2643
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:05,040
and then I'll be 45

2644
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:07,040
and I'll have to put up Gendo posters

2645
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,040
oh god yeah

2646
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:15,040
and then 15 years later it'll be Fuyutski

2647
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:21,040
and then you can just die with that one

2648
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:23,040
my whole life will just be a series of Ava Waifus

2649
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:25,040
and Husbandos

2650
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:29,040
oh shit

2651
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:33,040
I'll just segment my autobiography

2652
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:35,040
into the character names

2653
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,040
so as

2654
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:41,040
I'm wondering if this is going to become clear

2655
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:43,040
when you start doing Ava videos

2656
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:45,040
that much like

2657
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:47,040
the previous mythos we've discussed

2658
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:49,040
of all the

2659
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:51,040
the characters that you have

2660
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:53,040
you have been developing your own Ava

2661
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:55,040
mythos in your head

2662
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,040
that I've heard of

2663
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:59,040
I'm going to just like hype people up

2664
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:01,040
I don't know if you're still working on it

2665
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:03,040
but you sent me the intro

2666
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:05,040
chapter of a fanfic you're writing

2667
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:07,040
that was fucking

2668
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:09,040
amazing

2669
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:11,040
and I

2670
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:13,040
I know I'm a fan of all your work

2671
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:15,040
but even you

2672
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:17,040
if you post an Ava fanfic I go into it

2673
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:19,040
like okay what's this going to be

2674
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:21,040
and I read it and I was like

2675
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:23,040
oh my god this is

2676
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:25,040
like legitimately gripping

2677
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:27,040
character portrait of Ray Ayanami

2678
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:29,040
and the lead

2679
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:31,040
in is that she's going to play Smash Bros

2680
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,040
it's amazing

2681
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:35,040
well the idea of it

2682
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:37,040
I wanted to take

2683
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:39,040
the dumbest possible premise

2684
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:41,040
or the silliest possible spin on the series

2685
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:43,040
but then approach it taking it completely

2686
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:45,040
seriously and like really get into the character's

2687
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:47,040
heads like

2688
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:49,040
like a legit like I was actually

2689
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:51,040
writing for the show and like really show

2690
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:53,040
off that I understand these characters

2691
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:55,040
while also having them

2692
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:57,040
like the whole fucking plot is that

2693
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:59,040
they're playing Nintendo 64

2694
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:01,040
yeah it's

2695
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:03,040
fucking incredible um I hope it

2696
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,040
I hope it gets published at some

2697
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:07,040
point I don't know how much of it you want

2698
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,040
to write before any of it comes out

2699
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:11,040
but the part you had written was fantastic

2700
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:13,040
well it's another one of those things that like

2701
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:15,040
in the making of it it's become more intricate

2702
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:17,040
in my head than it originally was

2703
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:19,040
because originally it was like

2704
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:21,040
I'm gonna make a it's gonna be that

2705
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:23,040
uh

2706
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:25,040
Ray has an existential crisis

2707
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:27,040
and decides

2708
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:29,040
instinctually inherently as all

2709
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:31,040
children know

2710
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:33,040
that Nintendo 64 is the bomb yo

2711
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:35,040
and so

2712
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:37,040
she decides that she has to buy Nintendo 64

2713
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:39,040
um

2714
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:41,040
and what draws her eye to it

2715
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:43,040
this was one of my proudest

2716
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:45,040
little tidbits that I threw in there

2717
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:47,040
was that it was one of the translucent purple

2718
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,040
Nintendo 64s that they came out with

2719
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:51,040
and it reminded her of Ikari's Ava

2720
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:53,040
so

2721
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:55,040
hahahaha

2722
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:57,040
in all this is appropriate

2723
02:27:57,040 --> 02:27:59,040
because Ava takes place well never mind

2724
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:01,040
it takes place in 2015

2725
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:03,040
I was thinking it came out in 95

2726
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:05,040
so it's appropriate but it's not

2727
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:07,040
but that's uh

2728
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:09,040
that's gonna be an element of it when I

2729
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:11,040
because I'm still writing it um

2730
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:13,040
one of the one of the ideas was that

2731
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:15,040
Misato wipes the floor

2732
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:17,040
with everyone at N64

2733
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:19,040
because she's a fucking millennial

2734
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:21,040
and she grew up with it

2735
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:23,040
yeah that's actually genius

2736
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:25,040
oh man I don't want you to spoil too

2737
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:27,040
much of this thing but I legitimately

2738
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:29,040
love it and I'm kind of expecting

2739
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:31,040
that when you start making Ava videos

2740
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:33,040
elements of

2741
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:35,040
your ideas of the characters that go

2742
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,040
beyond what's presented in the show

2743
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:39,040
will probably creep in

2744
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:41,040
because um

2745
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:43,040
Idle Yukai who is a huge fan of all of us

2746
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:45,040
on Twitter yes she's been going through

2747
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:47,040
and she's been drawing pictures of us

2748
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:49,040
like hanging out with our waifus

2749
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:51,040
and I

2750
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:53,040
already have instructed her to incorporate

2751
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:55,040
an element of my coming fan fiction

2752
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:57,040
into the picture just to make it

2753
02:28:57,040 --> 02:28:59,040
that much cooler

2754
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:01,040
I just I have to wonder like

2755
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:03,040
um I think

2756
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:05,040
as I've said before I know your work

2757
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:07,040
probably better than anybody else and

2758
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:09,040
because of that I feel like I get more

2759
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:11,040
out of it just because there's so many little

2760
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,040
jokes and references

2761
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:15,040
and I just wish

2762
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:17,040
there was like a way

2763
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:19,040
to stream every idea you have

2764
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:21,040
out of your brain onto the internet

2765
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:23,040
like just for everyone to know

2766
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:25,040
all of these little details

2767
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:27,040
because it would enhance it all so much

2768
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:29,040
to get the whole narrative

2769
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:31,040
of like

2770
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,040
you know

2771
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:35,040
you make an oska joke and like

2772
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:37,040
it means more to me because I listen to you

2773
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:39,040
talk about oska so fucking often

2774
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:41,040
like I understand that it's this

2775
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:43,040
legitimate obsession and

2776
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:45,040
you haven't made that many videos

2777
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:47,040
that talk about oska she's

2778
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:49,040
around you clearly have a lot of posters

2779
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:51,040
of her but like

2780
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:53,040
you know I don't know if anybody else would

2781
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:55,040
be as it seems like the things that are

2782
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:57,040
like that I'm the most into

2783
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:59,040
I end up making the least amount of content

2784
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:01,040
about yeah I'm

2785
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:03,040
dude I fucking feel the exact same way

2786
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:05,040
just because like almost like I feel

2787
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:07,040
like I owe it something

2788
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:09,040
grander yeah

2789
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:11,040
man like because

2790
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:13,040
in a way it was

2791
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:15,040
like when I started doing anime

2792
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:17,040
videos what allowed me to

2793
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:19,040
talk about all like my favorite shows

2794
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,040
is that they all became my favorite

2795
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:23,040
shows in the process of writing

2796
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:25,040
about them because like all my

2797
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:27,040
old favorites I haven't really

2798
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:29,040
talked about a lot of them like

2799
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,040
like a wreck of seven was

2800
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:33,040
like my favorite anime for a long time and

2801
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:35,040
like you know

2802
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:37,040
now if I watch it again my opinion is

2803
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:39,040
totally different because I've grown up so much so

2804
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:41,040
like I had this weird lucky stroke where

2805
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:43,040
back in my anime blogging

2806
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:45,040
days I would never cover my favorite

2807
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:47,040
shows because I felt like I had to write

2808
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,040
the biggest post ever about each of them

2809
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:51,040
and I just wouldn't

2810
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:53,040
and then because of the fact that

2811
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:55,040
I'd forgotten all my

2812
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:57,040
I forgot everything about anime then like

2813
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:59,040
now it's like I'm rediscovering

2814
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:01,040
each one and I get to write about it because

2815
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:03,040
you know like Kaon I

2816
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:05,040
watch it again after all this time

2817
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:07,040
and like now I'm trying to remember oh

2818
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:09,040
this is why I liked this show so much

2819
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:11,040
oh now I get it and I can write it much

2820
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:13,040
more easily so I feel like

2821
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:15,040
having this two-year gap away from anime

2822
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:17,040
like really helped to make it so I could

2823
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:19,040
finally write about shows I actually

2824
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:21,040
care about as opposed to just random

2825
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:23,040
bullshit because

2826
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:25,040
it's way easier like I said with the

2827
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:27,040
my Japanese anime thing before it's way

2828
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:29,040
easier to go like watch attack on

2829
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:31,040
Titan and you don't give a fuck about

2830
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:33,040
it so you can write a five-minute video and it's over

2831
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:35,040
you know yeah like the stuff that I

2832
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,040
have like a lot of

2833
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:39,040
passion for it's almost

2834
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:41,040
daunting to like

2835
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:43,040
get it done I can't

2836
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:45,040
like get to it like um

2837
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:47,040
like I'm passionate about music

2838
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,040
I've wanted to make

2839
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:51,040
my fucking debut rap album

2840
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:53,040
for like seven years longer than

2841
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:55,040
I've had a YouTube channel

2842
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:57,040
and I release rap songs

2843
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:59,040
all the time I make rap songs all the time

2844
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,040
but they're all like weird freestyles

2845
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:03,040
and dumb shit with like beats that I just

2846
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:05,040
rip off the internet and

2847
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,040
they're not like what I consider to be

2848
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:09,040
part of this album that I formulated

2849
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:11,040
in my head like in my head

2850
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:13,040
in my head I have like

2851
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:15,040
my first seven albums planned out

2852
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:17,040
and there's a fucking they're all

2853
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:19,040
fucking concept albums they all have a

2854
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,040
purpose and a place like a fucking jigsaw puzzle

2855
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:23,040
I you know I think about

2856
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:25,040
but I haven't even fucking made the first one yet

2857
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:27,040
and God knows when so many

2858
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:29,040
things that like I want to do

2859
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:31,040
that I'm almost

2860
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:33,040
afraid that I won't get to do

2861
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:35,040
because YouTube will always be in the way

2862
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:37,040
unless I find a way to pull myself

2863
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:39,040
away from it at some point

2864
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:41,040
like uh like stand up comedy

2865
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:43,040
I love doing stand up comedy

2866
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:45,040
I never fucking do it and I hate myself

2867
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:47,040
every minute that I'm not fucking doing it

2868
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:49,040
yeah I have some uh

2869
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:51,040
I don't know if I'm as

2870
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:53,040
afraid as you are because for me it was

2871
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:55,040
kind of a relief that

2872
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,040
like I feel like I'm a lot better at

2873
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:59,040
YouTube than all the other things I wanted to do

2874
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,040
so like sometimes I think

2875
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:03,040
hey I still want to be a novelist I still

2876
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:05,040
have all these great ideas for novels and

2877
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:07,040
like I'm never gonna write them because it's so much

2878
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:09,040
easier and more fun and fulfilling

2879
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:11,040
to just make YouTube videos and not try to

2880
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:13,040
write this shitty book I watch I'll watch

2881
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:15,040
like a Bo Burnham special like his new

2882
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:17,040
special just came out and I watch like

2883
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,040
the stuff that he does on stage and it's

2884
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:21,040
like very subversive and he does all this

2885
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:23,040
like bombast and pomp and circumstance

2886
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:25,040
he's always got like recordings going off

2887
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:27,040
and lights and like flashing steam and shit

2888
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,040
and it's just like

2889
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,040
I like that's the kind of stuff that

2890
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:33,040
I watch and I feel like I'm I have

2891
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:35,040
to be wasting my potential on YouTube

2892
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:37,040
I should be on a

2893
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:39,040
grander stage I don't fucking know

2894
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:41,040
yeah I

2895
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:43,040
I get you and especially with music

2896
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:45,040
because I obviously

2897
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:47,040
me and you collab on music

2898
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:49,040
yeah and I definitely

2899
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:51,040
think I mean I've been saying all this time

2900
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:53,040
that I think I'm the biggest fan of your videos

2901
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:55,040
but I know I'm the

2902
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:57,040
biggest fan of your music because I don't think anybody

2903
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:59,040
else cares about it but me

2904
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:01,040
but like legitimately

2905
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:03,040
I uh I have often

2906
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:05,040
I have often said this of myself

2907
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:07,040
and I don't

2908
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:09,040
say it necessarily on line

2909
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:11,040
as much because

2910
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:13,040
I feel like I haven't

2911
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:15,040
posted enough to prove this to people

2912
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:17,040
so I feel uncomfortable saying it

2913
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:19,040
but in real life I sell the time

2914
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:21,040
I'm the greatest fucking lyricist who ever lived

2915
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:23,040
in the face of the earth

2916
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:25,040
and I'll fucking plant my flag in it

2917
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,040
I'll fucking draw the line it's my hill to die on

2918
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:29,040
I'll say it until I'm dead

2919
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:31,040
but I just I

2920
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:33,040
I never say that on line because I feel like I haven't proved it enough

2921
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:35,040
I legit from what I know

2922
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:37,040
of your lyrics I can't

2923
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:39,040
immediately disagree with that

2924
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:41,040
like I can't name a lyricist off the top of my head

2925
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:43,040
who I think like blows you out of the water

2926
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:45,040
and like it's such

2927
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:47,040
like an ever present like feeling in my head

2928
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:49,040
that like uh

2929
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:51,040
maybe like old Eminem

2930
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:53,040
yeah Eminem I definitely put up there

2931
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:55,040
Eminem has

2932
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:57,040
made some incredible wordplay

2933
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:59,040
in his time

2934
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:01,040
but then he did fucking

2935
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:03,040
rap god fucking garbage

2936
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:05,040
but um

2937
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:07,040
yeah it's like it's to where like

2938
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:09,040
you've

2939
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:11,040
you've seen the you've seen this phenomenon

2940
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:13,040
play out with me in the past

2941
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:15,040
I cannot stand

2942
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:17,040
to see other rappers complimented

2943
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:19,040
it burns me up inside

2944
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:21,040
on like a primal level

2945
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:23,040
even like like

2946
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:25,040
that video that we're going on like

2947
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:27,040
look at how these rappers are such

2948
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:29,040
great lyricists and look at how

2949
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,040
you know people say things like oh man

2950
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:33,040
Kendrick Lamar he's bringing lyrical rap back

2951
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:35,040
or and I just

2952
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,040
fucking even if it's like an

2953
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:39,040
innocuous compliment of some rapper

2954
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:41,040
who I agree is good I still like if I

2955
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:43,040
hear someone praising

2956
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:45,040
the other rapper I just fucking sit there

2957
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:47,040
and I stew you sons of bitches

2958
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:49,040
don't even fucking know I hate all of you

2959
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:51,040
you're all worms are beneath me

2960
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:53,040
it's well it's

2961
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:55,040
upsetting right because I mean music

2962
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:57,040
is incredibly hard to promote

2963
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:59,040
it's upsetting to me that I haven't

2964
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:01,040
um had

2965
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:03,040
put in the time to prove that to people

2966
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:05,040
because it's something that I feel

2967
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,040
is true of myself but I've

2968
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:09,040
I'm always focused on YouTube well it's that like

2969
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:11,040
you've got you've got great stuff but it's

2970
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:13,040
all hidden behind like

2971
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:15,040
like the fact that the

2972
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:17,040
productions never that good you know because

2973
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:19,040
up until recently you didn't have a great

2974
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:21,040
microphone and

2975
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,040
you know you don't really know

2976
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:25,040
audio mixing and most of the beats like

2977
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:27,040
you said are just ripped from YouTube

2978
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:29,040
so it's harder to have like

2979
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:31,040
something that you can put

2980
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:33,040
out there and be like hey guys listen to this

2981
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:35,040
rap it's on iTunes and they'll be like oh

2982
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:37,040
shit I'm paying for that it's

2983
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:39,040
it always feels like kind

2984
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:41,040
of internet but if you actually

2985
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:43,040
pay attention to it

2986
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:45,040
the songs are great like

2987
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:47,040
legitimately one of my favorite songs

2988
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:49,040
ever is the coolest guy

2989
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:51,040
rap where it's just this

2990
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:53,040
really hype beat that you

2991
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:55,040
took from YouTube

2992
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:57,040
and you just wrap this completely

2993
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:59,040
nonsensical insane

2994
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:01,040
verse over it it's like one verse it's like

2995
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:03,040
four minutes long and it's

2996
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:05,040
fucking great it's legitimately

2997
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:07,040
like that I walk around

2998
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:09,040
my house rapping it to myself

2999
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:11,040
because I've spent years learning it

3000
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:13,040
that's one that if I

3001
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:15,040
ever get around to actually making the album

3002
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:17,040
that I have in my head that would be

3003
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:19,040
on it I would probably re-record it

3004
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:21,040
and tighten up the lyrics

3005
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:23,040
in some spots but that song would definitely

3006
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:25,040
make the cut for an album

3007
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:27,040
but like I could easily see

3008
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:29,040
hearing that song and being like

3009
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:31,040
whatever it's just some

3010
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:33,040
YouTube guy rapping about dumb stuff

3011
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:35,040
but then like when you

3012
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:37,040
really pay attention to it like

3013
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:39,040
the lyrics fit the beat really well

3014
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:41,040
um you know it's not gonna

3015
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:43,040
knock your trunk or anything

3016
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:45,040
but like it's kind of funny how

3017
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:47,040
like a lot of people will listen to something like

3018
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:49,040
uh folk music or

3019
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:51,040
drone or something that's like recorded

3020
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:53,040
or black metal like shitty recordings

3021
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:55,040
uh like that sound like they're coming out

3022
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:57,040
of a fucking cell phone

3023
02:37:57,040 --> 02:37:59,040
but it fits the music and

3024
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:01,040
that can be great and I think that when it comes

3025
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:03,040
to rap so many people have the expectation

3026
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:05,040
that rap is supposed to be this heavy bass

3027
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:07,040
trunk knocking, fun time

3028
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:09,040
listening stuff

3029
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:11,040
and I don't think it has to be

3030
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:13,040
and the coolest guy is a song

3031
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:15,040
that I think works in spite

3032
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:17,040
of the production

3033
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:19,040
not being all there because

3034
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:21,040
it's still a fun hype beat

3035
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:23,040
and it's still fun hype lyrics that have all these

3036
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:25,040
character and you use all these voices

3037
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:27,040
and the part where you know

3038
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:29,040
you just get into this deep rasp and you're like

3039
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:31,040
sitting on the beach and it looks like hell

3040
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:33,040
the water's blood red because it's L-C-L

3041
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:35,040
look at Ray's head

3042
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:37,040
and you can tell everyone's

3043
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:39,040
dead so what's that smell

3044
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:41,040
it's my asshole you know it's like

3045
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:43,040
like in the middle of this otherwise

3046
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:45,040
fairly technical and like

3047
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:47,040
clever wordplay rap

3048
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:49,040
and then it's just this weird

3049
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:51,040
demonic end of Ava

3050
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:53,040
if you listen

3051
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:55,040
to enough of my raps if you listen to

3052
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:57,040
enough freestyles for me

3053
02:38:57,040 --> 02:38:59,040
you will very quickly see that the two things

3054
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:01,040
I always fall back on are

3055
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:03,040
what's that smell

3056
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:05,040
and suck my dick

3057
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:07,040
those two lines will make an

3058
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:09,040
appearance in everything I do

3059
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:11,040
there's no suck my dick in the coolest guy

3060
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,040
but there is what's that smell

3061
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:15,040
but yeah I've heard them

3062
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:17,040
come up a few times

3063
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:19,040
but yeah I really enjoy the rap

3064
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,040
something about what's that smell is inherently

3065
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:23,040
the funniest thing in the world to me

3066
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:25,040
and I can't explain why

3067
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:27,040
and some of the like

3068
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:29,040
again to me knowing a lot more about you

3069
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:31,040
the song Alright

3070
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:33,040
which is

3071
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:35,040
this like very

3072
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:37,040
open-hearted lyrical song

3073
02:39:37,040 --> 02:39:39,040
and

3074
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:41,040
like it just sounds like

3075
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:43,040
if it was any other artist

3076
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:45,040
it sounds like just a list

3077
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:47,040
song kind of thing like you know

3078
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:49,040
you say my friends think this about me

3079
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:51,040
and they're right they're alright

3080
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:53,040
but fuck them I'm alright you know it goes through

3081
02:39:53,040 --> 02:39:55,040
this like chain of each different type

3082
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:57,040
of person and what they say about you

3083
02:39:57,040 --> 02:39:59,040
but because I know you personally I know those are all

3084
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:01,040
exactly what those people think

3085
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,040
like you present

3086
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:05,040
like there's even a difference

3087
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:07,040
between a verse where you're talking about your offline

3088
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:09,040
friends and your online friends and I can tell

3089
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:11,040
which ones which because

3090
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:13,040
you know the

3091
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:15,040
offline friends think of you as like this volatile

3092
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:17,040
like this very honest

3093
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,040
and caring guy who's also very

3094
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:21,040
volatile and has no chill

3095
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:23,040
and then your online friends think of you as this

3096
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:25,040
visionary genius but also just this fat

3097
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:27,040
weirdo you know and like

3098
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:29,040
you go through each

3099
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:31,040
person in your life and like

3100
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:33,040
describe how they feel about your girlfriends

3101
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:35,040
who all think you rock in bed of course

3102
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:37,040
you know and

3103
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:39,040
and then the ending like you know

3104
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:41,040
of your friends you'll say and they're right they're alright

3105
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:43,040
but so what

3106
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:45,040
I'm alright but then when it's your fans

3107
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:47,040
then you're like but fuck you

3108
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:49,040
I'm alright you know it's like

3109
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:51,040
the different levels of regret there's a lot to

3110
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:53,040
get into it and like I

3111
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:55,040
get it all because I know

3112
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:57,040
that it's all real it's a complete

3113
02:40:57,040 --> 02:40:59,040
psychological picture

3114
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:01,040
yeah it's fucking great

3115
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:03,040
and I've listened to that song you know a lot

3116
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:05,040
of times and then

3117
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:07,040
like just

3118
02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:09,040
like with rotten

3119
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:11,040
like I'll break this down because I guess

3120
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:13,040
we did this in the chat so I'm gonna break it down

3121
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:15,040
for the audience the like analysis

3122
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:17,040
I did of rotten

3123
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:19,040
of your verse

3124
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:21,040
this was a song that shade was making

3125
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:23,040
he's just making a beat

3126
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:25,040
in a FL studio

3127
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:27,040
and it sounded kind of like a Tyler the

3128
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:29,040
creator beat so I decided

3129
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:31,040
I was gonna write like a dark grimy like

3130
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:33,040
Earl sweatshirt Tyler the creator type

3131
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:35,040
rhyme over it and I

3132
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:37,040
end up writing this verse about like

3133
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:39,040
just being in my room drinking and trying to

3134
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:41,040
get over my problems right

3135
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:43,040
you know it's got a little bit of fun

3136
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:45,040
in it but I'm not very good at like word play

3137
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:47,040
or like really

3138
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:49,040
complex stuff like my rhymes are usually

3139
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:51,040
very direct it's usually like exactly

3140
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:53,040
what I say is what it means

3141
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:55,040
I record these two verses

3142
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:57,040
I send them off to you

3143
02:41:57,040 --> 02:41:59,040
and within hours

3144
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:01,040
you've completed like you didn't even

3145
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:03,040
you've never heard this song before you didn't know

3146
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:05,040
the concept you didn't know what it was gonna

3147
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:07,040
be and I sent it to you and

3148
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:09,040
you perfectly captured

3149
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:11,040
all of the emotions

3150
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:13,040
that were in my part

3151
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:15,040
in your own you even worked in stuff that I hadn't

3152
02:42:15,040 --> 02:42:17,040
like the very last line of my song

3153
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:19,040
of my verse is I'm grown

3154
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:21,040
I'm grown I'm grown I'm grown I'm grown

3155
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:23,040
which I hadn't planned to be in there

3156
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:25,040
it was just like at the very end

3157
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:27,040
I thought what if I do in this suggestion

3158
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:29,040
that like

3159
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:31,040
you know that I shouldn't be this way

3160
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:33,040
because I'm grown up and then you throw in a line

3161
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:35,040
that's like I used to dream of how I'd

3162
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:37,040
be when I was grown picture me with a six pack

3163
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:39,040
not not the kind that foams which

3164
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:41,040
is a fucking phenomenal

3165
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:43,040
line great word play great imagery

3166
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:45,040
but also

3167
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:47,040
totally is in there just because of my line

3168
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:49,040
I'm grown I'm grown I'm grown like you expanded

3169
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:51,040
on the concept of the song

3170
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:53,040
in a way that it wouldn't have been like that would have felt

3171
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:55,040
out of nowhere at the end if not for the fact

3172
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:57,040
that you put that line in your verse

3173
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:59,040
so it made my verses

3174
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:01,040
better and then the word play

3175
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:03,040
in there is like

3176
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:05,040
I gotta get those like three

3177
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:07,040
like triple syllable rhymes

3178
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:09,040
in a row in it because it's like

3179
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:11,040
come to on the floor in a pile

3180
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:13,040
of trash and piss shit stained drawers I'm

3181
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:15,040
a hot mess hoarder the lord of disorder

3182
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:17,040
calorie absorber performer

3183
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:19,040
a camcorder and on board

3184
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:21,040
that's in insanity

3185
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:23,040
that's four

3186
02:43:23,040 --> 02:43:25,040
three syllable words that all rhyme

3187
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:27,040
and then it goes

3188
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:29,040
like stick more horrors with my thick

3189
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:31,040
pork sword it's crazy

3190
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:33,040
and you didn't even try to make it technical

3191
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:35,040
that was just what came into your head

3192
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:37,040
that's

3193
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:39,040
next level that's what the best

3194
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:41,040
rappers do that's all

3195
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:43,040
the techniques that they were talking about in that

3196
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:45,040
rap analysis video all the things that all

3197
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:47,040
the greats do what they're all known

3198
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:49,040
for you did all that

3199
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:51,040
in an hour

3200
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:53,040
yeah so yeah that was about

3201
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:55,040
three percent of my lyrical

3202
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:57,040
power I'd say

3203
02:43:57,040 --> 02:43:59,040
and yeah so

3204
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:01,040
for me it almost like

3205
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:03,040
hurts to know that

3206
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:05,040
other people like when I played

3207
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:07,040
butt sugar for my friends and they all were just

3208
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:09,040
like this is one of my friends kept saying

3209
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:11,040
this is just Tom Green

3210
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:13,040
this is just my bum is on your lips

3211
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:15,040
I'm like no it's not it's Tom Green

3212
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:17,040
song is fucking stupid butt chugger

3213
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:19,040
has a whole narrative arc

3214
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:21,040
a whole emotional arc about this character

3215
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:23,040
when will people appreciate the technical

3216
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:25,040
mastery of butt chugger

3217
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:27,040
well like

3218
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:29,040
cause that's the thing when you listen to butt chugger it seems

3219
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:31,040
like it's just gonna be a dumb song about

3220
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:33,040
butt chugging but then it has this whole narrative

3221
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:35,040
about this this kid who like

3222
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:37,040
you know

3223
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:39,040
butt chugging is basically a metaphor for

3224
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:41,040
art or for getting into

3225
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:43,040
something that like passion you know

3226
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:45,040
like he discovers a passion but then

3227
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:47,040
society hammers him back down

3228
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:49,040
and forces him to become like a normal

3229
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:51,040
stiff and then he

3230
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:53,040
realizes that the butt chugging was

3231
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:55,040
in him all along and he just has to be

3232
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:57,040
himself it's like a whole fucking

3233
02:44:57,040 --> 02:44:59,040
film you know not to

3234
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:01,040
not to take anything away from

3235
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:03,040
Tom Green's legendary masterpiece

3236
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:05,040
lonely Swedish to bum bum song

3237
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:07,040
which is one of the greatest songs

3238
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:09,040
ever written I just want to clarify that for everyone

3239
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:11,040
that fucking that part

3240
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:13,040
in that song where like he breaks it down

3241
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:15,040
it gets to like the bridge and it gets quiet and he's

3242
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:17,040
like my bum is on the phone

3243
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:19,040
my bum is all alone

3244
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:21,040
and then it like stops and then it goes into like

3245
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:23,040
my bum is all alone

3246
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:25,040
my bum is all alone

3247
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:27,040
my bum is all alone

3248
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:29,040
get the poo off my bum

3249
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:31,040
get the poo off I need the poo

3250
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:33,040
off the bum I gotta get the poo off my bum

3251
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:35,040
that fucking song is

3252
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:37,040
a masterpiece I legitimately love that song

3253
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:39,040
I'm realizing I've never

3254
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:41,040
actually heard the full song

3255
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:43,040
oh god it's great

3256
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:45,040
I mostly know it from fucking M&M's

3257
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:47,040
and then the video ends

3258
02:45:47,040 --> 02:45:49,040
and he's like he's on the beach and he's in like

3259
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:51,040
like waist deep water and the video

3260
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:53,040
just ends with him like picking up this duck

3261
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:55,040
prop and there's like a string on it and he's just like

3262
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:57,040
none of this is real

3263
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:59,040
none of this is real

3264
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:01,040
the video ends

3265
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:03,040
Tom Green was a visionary

3266
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:05,040
alright more credit to

3267
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:07,040
Tom Green's bum song

3268
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:09,040
but yeah but sugar's great

3269
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:11,040
um

3270
02:46:11,040 --> 02:46:13,040
obviously the t-bap

3271
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:15,040
really saw something in it because they became

3272
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:17,040
fans on the basis of that song

3273
02:46:17,040 --> 02:46:19,040
which is fucking fantastic

3274
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:21,040
but yeah

3275
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:23,040
it hurts me to know that you

3276
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:25,040
that you have never achieved in any

3277
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:27,040
avenue the success

3278
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:29,040
that I think you deserve

3279
02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:31,040
um and it's just like

3280
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:33,040
a matter of the audience

3281
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:35,040
I feel like there must be people out there

3282
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:37,040
who would get it you know

3283
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:39,040
I feel like your work is

3284
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:41,040
just oddly more

3285
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:43,040
highbrow than

3286
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:45,040
people appreciate

3287
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:47,040
and I was so glad because

3288
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:49,040
I made that video of the top 10

3289
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:51,040
analysis videos of 2015

3290
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:53,040
and I had both what you're

3291
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:55,040
gonna do and the horseshoe finale in there

3292
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:57,040
and you know my old

3293
02:46:57,040 --> 02:46:59,040
mentor ghost lightning

3294
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:01,040
you know he's more my friend but I always call

3295
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:03,040
my mentor so people get like a mental

3296
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:05,040
picture of you know the fact that he

3297
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:07,040
that I based a lot of my

3298
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:09,040
writing style on him but he's like

3299
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:11,040
you know like an old

3300
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:13,040
like lit major guy he's a dude

3301
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:15,040
who's like big into like high

3302
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:17,040
concept novels and shit and

3303
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:19,040
he watched what you're gonna do

3304
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:21,040
twice after seeing it

3305
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:23,040
in my analysis

3306
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:25,040
video stick it absolutely loved it and I was

3307
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:27,040
like that that to

3308
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:29,040
me was the moment I was like yeah this is the

3309
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:31,040
people who should be watching Jesse's content

3310
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:33,040
like people who appreciate

3311
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:35,040
the like the high-minded

3312
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:37,040
meta nature of it and

3313
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:39,040
that ending fucking

3314
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:41,040
bit that's just perfect

3315
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:43,040
you can't that song will never

3316
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:45,040
be better than it was in that video

3317
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:47,040
that Kanye West song like it's

3318
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:49,040
the most appropriate context that it could

3319
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:51,040
ever be given that's right you're

3320
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:53,040
fucking welcome Kanye

3321
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:55,040
you fucking hack you're welcome

3322
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:57,040
for me making your song worthwhile

3323
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:59,040
for making it art

3324
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:01,040
I mean it was a great song

3325
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:03,040
that's uh that's one of my

3326
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:05,040
that's one of my favorite shots that I've done

3327
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:07,040
as a director

3328
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:09,040
of me sitting in that corner with all those

3329
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:11,040
wrestling posters and the hot red

3330
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:13,040
shirt and um

3331
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:15,040
I think one of my favorite things

3332
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:17,040
because I think like

3333
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:19,040
a lot of the thing the part that

3334
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:21,040
doesn't get talked about

3335
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:23,040
with YouTubers especially

3336
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:25,040
a YouTuber like how I do things

3337
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:27,040
and not even I really talk about this much is that

3338
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:29,040
like the directorial aspect

3339
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:31,040
of it of like

3340
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:33,040
because um I'm really

3341
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:35,040
into

3342
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:37,040
iconic shots

3343
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:39,040
shots that are um

3344
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:41,040
instantly

3345
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:43,040
descriptive of the video itself

3346
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:45,040
or that and that are

3347
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:47,040
completely unique to me like

3348
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:50,040
I've only done two shots like this

3349
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:52,040
I think that really work on that level

3350
02:48:52,040 --> 02:48:54,040
because so much of my writing

3351
02:48:54,040 --> 02:48:56,040
is referential

3352
02:48:56,040 --> 02:48:58,040
and you know has bits and like

3353
02:48:58,040 --> 02:49:00,040
you know like catchphrases that I've stolen

3354
02:49:00,040 --> 02:49:02,040
from wrestlers and little references to things

3355
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:04,040
and in-jokes and stuff um

3356
02:49:04,040 --> 02:49:05,040
but

3357
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:07,040
some of the things that I'm really proud of are these

3358
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:09,040
shots that just completely stand on their own

3359
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:11,040
and encapsulate the video one of them is

3360
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:13,040
at the end of what you're gonna do when that

3361
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:15,040
fucking thing in the corner and the other

3362
02:49:15,040 --> 02:49:17,040
one is the shot of me

3363
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:19,040
right at the end of horseshoe finale where I'm sort of

3364
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:21,040
curled up in the fetal position

3365
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:23,040
and the

3366
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:25,040
and the fucking dog that fucking

3367
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:27,040
dog

3368
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:29,040
Jesus Christ one of the greatest miracles

3369
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:31,040
that ever happened in the history of art

3370
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:33,040
that the day that I was

3371
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:35,040
filming that my sister

3372
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:37,040
happened to randomly bring her dog home

3373
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:39,040
and I fucking

3374
02:49:39,040 --> 02:49:41,040
I brought the dog

3375
02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:43,040
downstairs and I'm like

3376
02:49:43,040 --> 02:49:45,040
this might not work but if it works

3377
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:47,040
it'll be the best thing I've ever filmed in my life

3378
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:49,040
and I fucking laid there

3379
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:51,040
and I had the dog just off camera

3380
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:53,040
and I was just hoping that it didn't come too soon

3381
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:55,040
and then when I got to the

3382
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:57,040
when I felt like I had laid there long enough

3383
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:59,040
I just fucking just a little bit

3384
02:50:01,040 --> 02:50:03,040
on the floor so the dog

3385
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:05,040
would hear and come over and she fucking came over

3386
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:07,040
and it was

3387
02:50:07,040 --> 02:50:09,040
it's the best thing I've ever filmed in my life I'm so

3388
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:11,040
proud of it I look at it all the time and I just

3389
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:13,040
come I come bullets

3390
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:15,040
it's great

3391
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:17,040
yeah I mean we covered a lot of that

3392
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:19,040
in the authorial intent video which again

3393
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:21,040
I know you weren't there for but like we talked a lot

3394
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:23,040
about how nobody

3395
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:25,040
appreciates that every shot has to be

3396
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:27,040
set up it's never like

3397
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:29,040
I mean a lot of the time when we're vlogging it is

3398
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:31,040
just like point a camera at myself

3399
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:33,040
and film but like we choose

3400
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:35,040
what angle to film from and

3401
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:37,040
what like what's going to be in the

3402
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:39,040
background and you know

3403
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:41,040
one of the most complicated ones

3404
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:43,040
that to this day nobody appreciates

3405
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:45,040
because I don't think anyone noticed it

3406
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:47,040
is um

3407
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:49,040
at a certain part of

3408
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:51,040
Horseshoe finale how like

3409
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:53,040
the video is sort of segmented into like different

3410
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:55,040
me's in different parts of the room

3411
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:57,040
that sort of represent like different aspects of my

3412
02:50:57,040 --> 02:50:59,040
personality

3413
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:01,040
and the one where I'm in the

3414
02:51:01,040 --> 02:51:03,040
the bookshelf room and how

3415
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:05,040
there's that corner and it's directly across

3416
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:07,040
from the bookshelf

3417
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:09,040
I put a fucking video camera

3418
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:11,040
in the background

3419
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:13,040
playing video of myself recording on the

3420
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:15,040
other side of the room as though

3421
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:17,040
I was delivering these monologues

3422
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,040
at the same fucking time actually

3423
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:21,040
teleporting across the room and if you look

3424
02:51:21,040 --> 02:51:23,040
at that fucking shot you can see me

3425
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:25,040
in the video camera fucking ranting

3426
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:27,040
while I'm ranting and that was so

3427
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:29,040
retardedly

3428
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:31,040
complex to set up

3429
02:51:31,040 --> 02:51:33,040
and no one notices it until now and

3430
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:35,040
now everyone will notice it and I'll tell me I'm a

3431
02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:37,040
mess all over again

3432
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:39,040
I believe I do remember that I need to

3433
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:41,040
rewatch I have I've never

3434
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:43,040
rewatched all of Horseshoe finale like

3435
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:45,040
it was just a one time

3436
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:47,040
sat down and watched the whole thing

3437
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:49,040
and at the time

3438
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:51,040
it felt so fucking massive

3439
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:53,040
because like

3440
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:55,040
I would say that that video is probably what broke me

3441
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:57,040
to long videos because now I watch them all the time

3442
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:59,040
like I will watch a video that's an hour

3443
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:01,040
and a half long just because I'm sitting

3444
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:03,040
at the computer and it came out

3445
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:05,040
like there's no hesitation there's no

3446
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:07,040
like waiting around for a time

3447
02:52:07,040 --> 02:52:09,040
when I have time it's just like nah it's

3448
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:11,040
put it on so

3449
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:13,040
like at the time Horseshoe finale came out

3450
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:15,040
it was like an ordeal to watch this whole

3451
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:17,040
thing especially because so much

3452
02:52:17,040 --> 02:52:19,040
of it is just ranting and like

3453
02:52:19,040 --> 02:52:21,040
you know like

3454
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:23,040
holding in all this information as it goes

3455
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:25,040
but uh I think

3456
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:27,040
nowadays it would be much easier to just like

3457
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:29,040
consume all at once

3458
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:31,040
I am overdue for a rewatch

3459
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:33,040
of it and uh you know

3460
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:35,040
it's funny because I keep thinking

3461
02:52:35,040 --> 02:52:37,040
I kept thinking well I really have to rewatch

3462
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:39,040
the whole Horseshoe saga but now

3463
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:41,040
that I think about it I've seen End of Ava

3464
02:52:41,040 --> 02:52:43,040
and Gileon way more times than I've seen

3465
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:45,040
Ava so

3466
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:47,040
so maybe it'd be justified

3467
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:49,040
you know there are a lot of people who've

3468
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:51,040
told me over the years that they've only seen

3469
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:53,040
End of Ava or that they saw it first so

3470
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:55,040
maybe people should go watch the Horseshoe finale

3471
02:52:55,040 --> 02:52:57,040
uh because it does kind

3472
02:52:57,040 --> 02:52:59,040
of stand on its own I did get one comment

3473
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:01,040
once of a guy who watched that

3474
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:03,040
first and then worked his way backwards

3475
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:05,040
and he seemed to

3476
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:07,040
enjoy the experience so maybe that works too

3477
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:09,040
I don't fucking know

3478
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:11,040
yeah I'd say it's where I mean it does start off with

3479
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:13,040
like a summary of all the other videos in a way

3480
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:15,040
so maybe it's easier

3481
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:17,040
that way I don't know

3482
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:19,040
I'm overdue for it

3483
02:53:19,040 --> 02:53:21,040
alright well

3484
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:23,040
we're getting close to three hours on this which I

3485
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:25,040
guess is gonna be my time limit

3486
02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:27,040
for these things because it seems reasonable

3487
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:29,040
and it's about how long it takes for my eyes

3488
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:31,040
to start bleeding out of my fucking skull

3489
02:53:31,040 --> 02:53:33,040
so uh do you have

3490
02:53:33,040 --> 02:53:35,040
anything else you wanted to talk about to share

3491
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:37,040
with our fans about yourself

3492
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:39,040
just stuff that

3493
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:41,040
I hope to be able to do in the future

3494
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:43,040
and stuff that I plan to do

3495
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:45,040
um like

3496
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:47,040
stuff beyond YouTube

3497
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:49,040
like I talked about the album and I talked about wanting

3498
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:51,040
to do more stand up

3499
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:53,040
um I also

3500
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:55,040
want to make more videos about comics because

3501
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:57,040
that's like a medium that's important

3502
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:59,040
to me that has been like

3503
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:01,040
woefully underrepresented throughout my YouTube

3504
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:03,040
career like I've never made videos about comics

3505
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:05,040
before and I want to and I should

3506
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:07,040
because there are no good comic book

3507
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:09,040
YouTube people right at all

3508
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:11,040
well now we've got Captain

3509
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:13,040
Christian but his stuff is very general and

3510
02:54:13,040 --> 02:54:15,040
broad

3511
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:17,040
yeah and not just videos

3512
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:19,040
about comics but even like outside of YouTube like

3513
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:21,040
I think all the time about

3514
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:23,040
writing comics

3515
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:25,040
or fucking specifically like Marvel

3516
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:27,040
and DC because I'm so in love with all the characters

3517
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:29,040
and

3518
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:31,040
you know I'm not a fucking comic book person

3519
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:33,040
so it would be impossible

3520
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:35,040
so I always

3521
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:37,040
because like I think about superheroes all the time

3522
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:39,040
like I not even like as

3523
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:41,040
like a YouTube analyst guy I just

3524
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:43,040
lay in my bed every night and I just like reflect

3525
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:45,040
on like what makes

3526
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:47,040
Spider-Man a great character as opposed to

3527
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:49,040
what makes Wolverine a great character

3528
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:51,040
and Superman is totally different in his own

3529
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:53,040
way and the Punisher is great in his way

3530
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:55,040
and I like I feel like nobody gets these

3531
02:54:55,040 --> 02:54:57,040
characters but me and it's like this constant

3532
02:54:57,040 --> 02:54:59,040
nagging feeling in my head like nobody

3533
02:54:59,040 --> 02:55:01,040
I should be writing all

3534
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:03,040
the comics in the world on the own I have all

3535
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:05,040
the best ideas but like

3536
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:07,040
I don't know like I talked I think

3537
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:09,040
all the time about

3538
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:11,040
collabing with Ben and me like

3539
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:13,040
writing out some dumb fan fiction

3540
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:15,040
idea and having him draw it

3541
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:17,040
I've never approached him about it because he's always

3542
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:19,040
busy writing his own comics and I don't want to fucking

3543
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:21,040
bother him with my stupid shit if you have money

3544
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:23,040
then he will

3545
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:25,040
be on board

3546
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:27,040
that's why I'm like I'm such a huge

3547
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:29,040
fan of Ben just because

3548
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:31,040
he's really good at

3549
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:33,040
something that I haven't done yet

3550
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:35,040
yeah that's I think that's exactly

3551
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:37,040
why I'm a huge fan of Ben because

3552
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:39,040
like I just want his I want

3553
02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:41,040
to eat him and steal exactly

3554
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:43,040
I want to be

3555
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:45,040
with him

3556
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:47,040
and he's like

3557
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:49,040
it's just that Ben's good at drawing

3558
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:51,040
and exactly how I want to be good at drawing

3559
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:53,040
like I don't want to be able to draw

3560
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:55,040
like hyper detailed stuff I just want to be

3561
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:57,040
able to draw dynamic poses and like convey

3562
02:55:57,040 --> 02:55:59,040
the idea of what I want

3563
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:01,040
you know and like

3564
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:03,040
since becoming friends with Ben I've gotten like way more into

3565
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:05,040
like

3566
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:07,040
buying like independent comics

3567
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:09,040
that like aren't Marvel or DC shit

3568
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:11,040
like these stories that people come up with

3569
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:13,040
because like I guess it never clicked

3570
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:15,040
before I never realized in my head oh

3571
02:56:15,040 --> 02:56:17,040
that's where these come from

3572
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:19,040
they come from guys like Ben who just

3573
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:21,040
fucking write them and then they become comics

3574
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:23,040
whoa

3575
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:25,040
like I never put two and two together before

3576
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:27,040
yeah you're used to them coming from like

3577
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:29,040
a look at industry

3578
02:56:29,040 --> 02:56:31,040
yeah

3579
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,040
yeah I'm excited for that because I specifically

3580
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:35,040
requested it I think a month

3581
02:56:35,040 --> 02:56:37,040
ago I was like hey Jesse

3582
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:39,040
you've got all those comics in the background

3583
02:56:39,040 --> 02:56:41,040
I want to hear about all of them because

3584
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:43,040
I don't know anything about comics

3585
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:45,040
and what I really want to do I had this

3586
02:56:45,040 --> 02:56:47,040
idea the other day is um

3587
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:49,040
because I've talked before in videos about

3588
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:51,040
uh whatever happened to the Caped Crusader

3589
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:53,040
which is like my favorite Batman story

3590
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:55,040
right and um

3591
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:57,040
I got the idea of like

3592
02:56:57,040 --> 02:56:59,040
doing like a Matthew Matosis style

3593
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:01,040
read through of the whole comic

3594
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:03,040
on a video and like stopping and

3595
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:05,040
analyzing like every panel I want to do it so bad

3596
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:07,040
but it's impossible to do anything it's too much

3597
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:09,040
shit to do as a friend since that never happened

3598
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:11,040
I would love to see that man I mean

3599
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:13,040
I'm I like whenever

3600
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:15,040
there's a medium I don't know much about

3601
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:17,040
like every video that

3602
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:19,040
explains it to me is like

3603
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:21,040
deeply fascinating like that

3604
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:23,040
time you linked me like Razor Fist

3605
02:57:23,040 --> 02:57:25,040
Top 10 Daredevil

3606
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:27,040
comics and I was like I don't know

3607
02:57:27,040 --> 02:57:29,040
anything about Daredevil and I can't stand

3608
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:31,040
Razor Fist but I watched the whole

3609
02:57:31,040 --> 02:57:33,040
thing just because I was like

3610
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:35,040
man I'd really love to know what

3611
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:37,040
makes Daredevil cool like here's a character

3612
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:39,040
that everyone else knows about but me

3613
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:41,040
it seems like and I don't give a single

3614
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:43,040
fuck about him so please

3615
02:57:43,040 --> 02:57:45,040
tell me why he's so cool you know

3616
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:47,040
yeah um and

3617
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:49,040
and and and that it that it so

3618
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:51,040
clearly was like here's

3619
02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:53,040
10 read these you know like

3620
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:55,040
I wish he had put them in order

3621
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:57,040
of like which ones you

3622
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:59,040
should read first as like a new

3623
02:57:59,040 --> 02:58:01,040
reader that would have been helpful too

3624
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:03,040
because for me comics are just overwhelming

3625
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:05,040
there's just too fucking much you know

3626
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:07,040
um

3627
02:58:07,040 --> 02:58:09,040
which is why I was kind of excited over

3628
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:11,040
new 52 I know you're not a huge fan of it

3629
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:13,040
but like it was a great way to be like hey

3630
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:15,040
I can pick up any of them now and it

3631
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:17,040
doesn't matter man you mentioned new 52

3632
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:19,040
this is a totally off topic

3633
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:21,040
I mean then again what is off topic this is

3634
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:23,040
a fucking podcast about me

3635
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:25,040
man that fucking

3636
02:58:25,040 --> 02:58:27,040
DC rebirth comic that just came out

3637
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:29,040
was the best fucking thing I've ever

3638
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:31,040
seen I fucking I like I got the

3639
02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:33,040
feeling that comics were saved

3640
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:35,040
like maybe I got too excited

3641
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:37,040
but it was so cool because like I've

3642
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:39,040
been complaining about the new 52

3643
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:41,040
since the new 52 was a thing

3644
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:43,040
because it's this like it was

3645
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:45,040
this like marketing ploy of like resetting

3646
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:47,040
continuity but they reset continuity

3647
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:49,040
in such a weird way that it like messed

3648
02:58:49,040 --> 02:58:51,040
up everything and like holds

3649
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:53,040
chunks were like gone and you couldn't

3650
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:55,040
fucking figure it out

3651
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:57,040
and so DC

3652
02:58:57,040 --> 02:58:59,040
they printed just two weeks ago

3653
02:58:59,040 --> 02:59:01,040
this fucking 80 page comic

3654
02:59:01,040 --> 02:59:03,040
that was essentially we're sorry

3655
02:59:03,040 --> 02:59:05,040
in comic book form

3656
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:07,040
and the whole fucking comic was like the flash

3657
02:59:07,040 --> 02:59:09,040
has like been phased out of

3658
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:11,040
existence because of flashpoint which started

3659
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:13,040
the new 52 and he's trying to get back he's like

3660
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:15,040
everybody's forgotten we've had 10 years

3661
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:17,040
of fucking of continuity

3662
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:19,040
stolen from us 10 years of love stolen from

3663
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:21,040
us and he comes back at the end and they get

3664
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:23,040
all their fucking memories back or whatever

3665
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:25,040
and it resets the thing and I'm like I'm gonna

3666
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:27,040
jack off I'm gonna jack off and I'm gonna

3667
02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:29,040
come right in this fucking comic pages are gonna stick together

3668
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:31,040
I have to buy a new one I don't care jacking off right on

3669
02:59:31,040 --> 02:59:33,040
it oh yeah DC you did it

3670
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:35,040
it was cool comics are great I love comics

3671
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:37,040
when comics comics are like wrestling

3672
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:39,040
for me in that they're often terrible

3673
02:59:39,040 --> 02:59:41,040
but when they're great they're my favorite thing in the world

3674
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:43,040
right that's the impression I

3675
02:59:43,040 --> 02:59:45,040
that's why for both of those

3676
02:59:45,040 --> 02:59:47,040
I can't like I'd rather

3677
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:49,040
experience them through you

3678
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:51,040
because experiencing them myself

3679
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:53,040
is like it's so hard to find

3680
02:59:53,040 --> 02:59:55,040
the gold nuggets and

3681
02:59:55,040 --> 02:59:57,040
for someone who's an outsider to it it's like

3682
02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:59,040
you know it's too much

3683
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:01,040
like with wrestling I know what's good

3684
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:03,040
about wrestling now that I've had you

3685
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:05,040
tell me so much and I've read some good articles

3686
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:07,040
on it but like I would have to watch

3687
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:09,040
all of wrestling history to find

3688
03:00:09,040 --> 03:00:11,040
the good shit you know

3689
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:13,040
I'd rather just have people

3690
03:00:13,040 --> 03:00:15,040
pick it out and re-explain

3691
03:00:15,040 --> 03:00:17,040
it to me and yeah

3692
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:19,040
like is there any other mediums

3693
03:00:19,040 --> 03:00:21,040
like for me I know

3694
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:23,040
there's no other

3695
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:25,040
only the epic lore

3696
03:00:25,040 --> 03:00:27,040
of the insane clown posse

3697
03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:29,040
that's the one avenue

3698
03:00:29,040 --> 03:00:31,040
of my fandom that nobody

3699
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:33,040
knows about yet

3700
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:35,040
that I have yet to analyze for the world

3701
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:37,040
yeah I know you're

3702
03:00:37,040 --> 03:00:39,040
big into the ICP

3703
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:41,040
and nobody will probably understand

3704
03:00:41,040 --> 03:00:43,040
that unless you

3705
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:45,040
get into it in a deep way

3706
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:47,040
um

3707
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:49,040
yeah I wish

3708
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:51,040
I could get it like

3709
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:53,040
I kind of wish I could talk about music

3710
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:55,040
because music's a big part of my life

3711
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:57,040
uh I

3712
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:59,040
it's so hard to

3713
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:01,040
discuss

3714
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:03,040
I have a whole series that I've wanted to do for a while

3715
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:05,040
called awesome albums

3716
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:07,040
where I just talk about the albums that I like

3717
03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:09,040
and like the thing was that

3718
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:11,040
I would rate them on a scale of

3719
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:13,040
1 to 10 but regardless of what

3720
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:15,040
score I gave them they would all be certified

3721
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:17,040
awesome albums even if it was like a 1 or a 2

3722
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:21,040
like Saint Anger by Metallica gets

3723
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:23,040
a 2 out of 10 and it's an awesome album

3724
03:01:25,040 --> 03:01:27,040
yeah I mean I finally did

3725
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:29,040
something like

3726
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:31,040
again this whole vlogging thing

3727
03:01:31,040 --> 03:01:33,040
I mean you already vlog

3728
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:35,040
but I do recommend it as a way to

3729
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:37,040
like for some of this shit

3730
03:01:37,040 --> 03:01:39,040
where I was never going to write a video

3731
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:41,040
about my beautiful dark twisted fantasy

3732
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:43,040
but like I just sat down and talked about it for

3733
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:45,040
45 minutes and it was pretty fucking gratifying

3734
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:47,040
to just like have all the

3735
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:49,040
thoughts about that album out there

3736
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:51,040
and now I never have to explain it again

3737
03:01:51,040 --> 03:01:53,040
you know like I don't have it eating away

3738
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:55,040
at my consciousness that nobody understands

3739
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:57,040
why I like this album so much

3740
03:01:59,040 --> 03:02:01,040
I think there's something very liberating about

3741
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:03,040
random vlogs

3742
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:05,040
and people seem to eat the shit up is what I don't

3743
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:07,040
get like I'm amazed at how much people

3744
03:02:07,040 --> 03:02:09,040
like don't hate them because I definitely

3745
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:11,040
hate my own vlogs but the

3746
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:13,040
fucking the people it's what the people crave

3747
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:15,040
apparently

3748
03:02:15,040 --> 03:02:17,040
yeah it's it's people just want more

3749
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,040
they just want more of everything like

3750
03:02:19,040 --> 03:02:21,040
I started I did this video

3751
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:23,040
of me laying on the couch

3752
03:02:23,040 --> 03:02:25,040
watching an anime and just turning

3753
03:02:25,040 --> 03:02:27,040
the camera on I don't know if you have you seen

3754
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:29,040
either of my two latest vlogs I haven't watched

3755
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:31,040
them yet I've seen them on my sub feed

3756
03:02:31,040 --> 03:02:33,040
you should definitely watch the newer one

3757
03:02:33,040 --> 03:02:35,040
it's like an hour long

3758
03:02:35,040 --> 03:02:37,040
you could probably skip the first 30 minutes

3759
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:39,040
but the second half of it is fucking hilarious

3760
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:41,040
and it's so Jesse like

3761
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:43,040
it's amazing because

3762
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:45,040
I got really drunk and just started

3763
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:47,040
like screaming about everything

3764
03:02:47,040 --> 03:02:49,040
and like getting really emotional and like

3765
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:51,040
going into different locations and like

3766
03:02:51,040 --> 03:02:53,040
taking a breather and stuff like that

3767
03:02:53,040 --> 03:02:55,040
and trying to kill myself

3768
03:02:55,040 --> 03:02:57,040
it's great

3769
03:02:57,040 --> 03:02:59,040
but like the first one

3770
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:01,040
is just literally 45

3771
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:03,040
minutes of me turning on a camera

3772
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:05,040
after each episode of the show and going like

3773
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:07,040
well that episode was kind of stupid

3774
03:03:07,040 --> 03:03:09,040
you know and then like people

3775
03:03:09,040 --> 03:03:11,040
like loved it

3776
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:13,040
and I didn't I thought nobody was

3777
03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:15,040
gonna like it and it got like 7000

3778
03:03:15,040 --> 03:03:17,040
views and I was like what the fuck

3779
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:19,040
this is nonsense and everyone's like

3780
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:21,040
make more make more and I was like

3781
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:23,040
okay I guess so I made the next one

3782
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:25,040
an hour long and I was like no one's

3783
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:27,040
gonna watch that and then

3784
03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:29,040
cause first they want a second one

3785
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:31,040
and then it becomes a series

3786
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:33,040
and then it becomes something you're tied to forever

3787
03:03:33,040 --> 03:03:35,040
and they all want it

3788
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:37,040
and like I recorded a third one

3789
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:39,040
today and like after I was done with it

3790
03:03:39,040 --> 03:03:41,040
I was like I legitimately don't care

3791
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:43,040
about this like I will release this

3792
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:45,040
and people will like this but this video

3793
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:47,040
I legitimately could throw away

3794
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:49,040
right now and it will make

3795
03:03:49,040 --> 03:03:51,040
no difference to me I don't care

3796
03:03:51,040 --> 03:03:53,040
you know the only

3797
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:55,040
incentive to release it is knowing that it

3798
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:57,040
will get views anyways and there's

3799
03:03:57,040 --> 03:03:59,040
like how hard is it to throw the

3800
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:01,040
clips into a thing and render them for an hour

3801
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:03,040
you know that's a nightmare

3802
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:05,040
yeah

3803
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:07,040
anything else you wanted to

3804
03:04:07,040 --> 03:04:09,040
talk about that you're

3805
03:04:09,040 --> 03:04:11,040
I'm the best guy

3806
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:13,040
with the biggest dick and I have the most

3807
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:15,040
women's and I'm the best

3808
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:17,040
at art

3809
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:19,040
alright

3810
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:21,040
I guess we covered everything

3811
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:23,040
thanks for listening guys

3812
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:25,040
yeah
