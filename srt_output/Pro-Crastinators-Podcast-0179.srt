00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm the best guy ever. Let's see who we've got in the menagerie today. We've got Gibbontake.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,800
A-yup, lad.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,000
We've got Tom Oliver.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, me too.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ah, she has some fucking enthusiasm. You pathetic, cum-addled brain losers.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,800
You fucking coomer.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Yeah, Ben's saying it. There he goes. Tell you tell him, Ben. Who tell him?

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Coomer extraordinaire.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
You're no better though, you are.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Audience, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry the show is not good anymore. It's my fault. Please.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Coomer on the streets. Coomer in the sheets.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,800
I want to be that big army guy who's shielding that little kid in the bed from all the attacks and death attacks.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
You know that political cartoon? This is a little baby boy sitting lying in the bed.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
I can think of a way better example. There's this incredible image.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,800
My soul is just like, hmm, as flames and knives blast him from behind to protect him.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
That's the gay millennial version of the actual good one.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,800
The soldier is me. The PCP is the baby.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Okay, I appreciate that. But the better one is there's a glorious knight in shining armor shielding a beautiful princess as they're walking through a thing.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,800
As the crowd is throwing shit and he's protecting her. God, I love that fucking image.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Anyway, we've got Digibro. There he is.

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,800
This is the first time I've been awake at the time this show is recorded since the last episode that I was on.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
I think that was at least a month ago.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,800
I don't even remember who are you again?

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
No one knows.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm that guy who isn't in the endless war.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,800
What? In 2019?

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
I know.

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
And Lethal Aurora Mage. There she is.

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
You exist as I always do.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,800
You do exist, Mage. And how? And let me just start off by saying let's get this out of the way, everybody.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Ladies and gentlemen, you will have seen on the PCB channel by now the release trailer.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Right now at this very moment, the PCP Minecraft server is live.

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
It is live. It is active. It is a thriving community already. No doubt.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,800
And you can be a part of it for a monthly. It's got a separate Patreon, $5 and you're in the Discord and you can play the game every month.

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
That's how it is. It's got to be incredible.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Get excited.

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Come join us. Play with us. We want to play with you. It's fun. It's going to be fun.

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Okay, that's out of the way. We can move on with our lives.

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
But that is the most important thing we'll say today.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I just have to ask, how long do you think you're going to play Minecraft for?

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Who can say?

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Let's say it lasts two months.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,800
I mean, I think Mage will be playing it until the day she dies in 2020 by my hand.

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
That's for me. I don't know.

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Wow. Wow, Ben. Wow.

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I expect to check in regularly.

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Besides, like if we use it for streams and stuff, we like, I don't know, do stuff there.

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
It could be a gold mine. And you know, why not try it?

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,800
I just, I read the bones and that's what they told me. Don't hate me. Hate the bones, okay?

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Hey, what's up guys? Nate from the future here.

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Hey, one clarification point about the Minecraft server, just to make sure everybody understands exactly how this is working,

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,800
is we are going to be grandfathering in everybody with a PCP pledge of the $10 or up,

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
of which there's a handful of people.

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Those people are going to be given access to the server now without having to go pledge any additional money to the new Patreon.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:37,800
But for everybody else who isn't currently at 10 or higher, everybody else has to go pledge to the new patreon.com.

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
So don't bother raising your pledge up to $10 that isn't going to work for you.

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
We're trying to make a clear distinction here.

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,800
So if you want to get in the server, you got to go to the new Patreon and pledge the $5 there.

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,800
If not, that's totally cool. Don't worry about it. Have a great day.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,800
And again, that's patreon.com slash PCB Minecraft. See you there.

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
What were we talking about?

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Well, I mean, let's get into it, whatever else is going on.

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Hey, you guys, I suddenly remembered that drawing can be fun again, right?

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Because I'm drawing fucking Endless War comics. I'm drawing fucking Nightstar comics.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm drawing fucking Phantom Horn comics.

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
I just read all of that like two days ago.

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I can't believe how fast you're fucking putting it out.

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
It is incredible.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Fucking blast. I've made like 110 images, 120 images, something like that.

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
It's really fun.

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
In the span of like a couple of weeks, right?

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Well, a couple of them I made a while back, like the first like 15 or so.

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
But other than that, yeah.

75
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,800
I think initially it was more born out of the excitement over meeting Chris Chan, right?

76
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,800
It was because the genesis of this, the genesis of the love hogs, if you will,

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,800
is that I was reading through Sonichu issue 12.9, and in one of her backstory lines,

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Nightstar says that her eye is green because she got some slime in it during a science experiment.

79
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,800
And suddenly my mind expanded to encompass all of not only dimension 12.18, but also C197.

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,800
And I realized that it was all connected in a great circle of life, and it was a story that I had to tell.

81
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,800
It very quickly becomes like, it seems like you're trying to make it a tutorial for Endless War as well.

82
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Like a user book almost, like to lure in new people.

83
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Like hey, because your biggest video is your Chris Chan video, so it's like, hey, Chris Chan people,

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,800
come look at this comic that is secretly trying to teach you how to play my underground discord video game.

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I mean, Chris Chan is in Endless War right now. Like they entered.

86
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
That's true.

87
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
That's fucking crazy.

88
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Yeah, the world, this is one of those moments where it's like, oh, our lives have gotten too fucking weird now.

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
It's so cool.

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,800
She's in there, she's got the special role of visiting mayor of Quickville, although technically, she is dead.

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
She is a corpse in the sewers.

92
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
And has her scalp.

93
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,800
No, no, Dupati Shmoopal has been messaging me.

94
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Dupati Shmoopal has acquired the scalp through various trade deals and barter swapping,

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
and I guess he wants to barter with me for various objects.

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
That's the kind of thing Dup would do.

97
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:43,800
So it's not exactly a tutorial, it talks about, like I do bring, I do mention game mechanics every here and there,

98
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,800
just because I think it's funny, and you know, I drop links in there and stuff.

99
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,800
It is kind of, Matthew told me that people are joining because they're finding the game in the comic,

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
which is really funny, and kind of what I wanted, but also it's just sort of like a loving tribute.

101
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
It's just sort of a fucking...

102
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Alright, I have the whole first chapter, ready to go.

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
It might be done, but I think I said this last week.

104
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm getting close to there.

105
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,800
I just have all these key points, I have these key images in my head that I must hit,

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:23,800
and in between those, I'm just scribbling out, I have to fucking power my way through to that image that I see.

107
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
The next page is one.

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I see it, I have to make it, because there's tons of artwork from Endless War, right?

109
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,800
And these locations, do they, within the context of the game, do they have accepted visuals?

110
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Do people have a joined sense of what the minds look like, or have you just now defined that through this comic?

111
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Is that official canon, or should people continue to interpret it differently?

112
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
It's both.

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
It's sort of loose, there's a loose canon.

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,800
If somebody draws a really cool version of, like, all of the locations have flavor text describing them,

115
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,800
but they're vague enough that you could interpret it in many ways.

116
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
So anything goes, but the coolest stuff is the thing people stick with.

117
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Every district is a big place, so the fact that two people draw the minds differently,

118
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
you can just be like, oh well, okay, I mean it's a big place, you know.

119
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,800
There's two different spots, and like, this is, like, the agreed, if you draw it is canon.

120
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Like, this is the understanding, this is the community, this is a collective understanding,

121
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,800
is that it's all canon, and like, you just gotta find a way to understand that it's all canon.

122
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
And I mean, did you, I mean, I just want to, I said this last time, but not only, yes,

123
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
everything that's happening here is canon, Endless War, that's how it works,

124
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,800
but the involvement of Christian, and by Christian's explicit word, has made all of this stuff,

125
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
all of this canon to real life.

126
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,800
It's canon to real life explicitly, and that's just right, so far as I'm concerned.

127
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Just right.

128
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,800
So wait, what you mean by canon to real life is that it's canon to the Christian universe,

129
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
which is real life.

130
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Well, yes.

131
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I mean, Christian is canon.

132
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Sonichu is canon, okay, well, first of all, all this is explicitly canon to Sonichu,

133
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
because Chris said so.

134
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,800
But on top of that, so now, this, everything adjacent to this, and Sonichu itself,

135
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,800
and Endless War, and T-Bat, and even Radcon, if you can believe it,

136
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,800
all these things are now canon to real life, in that they literally physically exist somewhere in the universe,

137
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,800
because all fiction, this included, takes place in C197.

138
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
So, it's all real.

139
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,800
We will go there soon, as the dimensions collide.

140
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Magichan is already here.

141
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Magichan has been appearing, he's been making appearances in YouTube videos lately.

142
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Chris has been making tweets about, like, oh, look who showed up in one frame of such and such video,

143
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
too fast for the human eye to see.

144
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
It's Magichan.

145
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Right.

146
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Excellent.

147
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,800
I just want to know what it feels like to have gone from somebody who, like, a decade ago,

148
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,800
was, like, researching Chris Chan, and, like, following her output with Sonichu,

149
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
made a lecture that was, like, the biggest thing you've ever made,

150
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,800
and now Chris considers everything you've ever made canon to her universe.

151
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
It's not enough.

152
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
It's not enough.

153
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I want more.

154
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
What I want, I will not be happy until...

155
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I will not be happy until Chris draws...

156
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Chris starts drawing comics with your characters in you?

157
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Until Chris starts drawing.

158
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
And not in, like, a weird idea, guys, way.

159
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Just in a...

160
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
I just want to see...

161
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,800
I want, like, a genuine back and forth.

162
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Like, a genuine artistic back and forth between me and Chris.

163
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
And once...

164
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Do you think that Chris would be bothered by any of the content in your comic?

165
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
I think that she was bothered by the 9-11.

166
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
But not...

167
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Okay, Chris was not...

168
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
That was the funniest fucking thing in that comic, by the way.

169
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
That was the same thing.

170
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
And the gigantic explosion of blood.

171
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
That was awesome.

172
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Chris was not bothered by the blood at all.

173
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Chris was not bothered by Red Man's murder.

174
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Well, I thought that you was pretty violent, right?

175
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Well, okay. It was and it has been.

176
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,800
But I think that Chris has, like, really walked back on that

177
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,800
because the reception to the end of...

178
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Whichever one with the Alec Benson Leary trial...

179
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,800
That one has these, like, gruesome executions.

180
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,800
But all those were made non-canonical and, like, retcon

181
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
so that they didn't technically happen.

182
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Chris, like, fully walked back from that, right?

183
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Because the negative reaction was huge.

184
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
So, like, Chris has learned through, like,

185
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
the application of one's hand to a hot stove

186
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
that you don't touch that anymore, right?

187
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,800
So, Chris knows on some level that, like, violence is bad.

188
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
And that's why I think she was like,

189
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
whoa, okay.

190
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
This 9-11 was no fun, you guys.

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Because, like, people reacted negatively to her

192
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
over that one video where she makes fun of Clyde Cash

193
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
by saying that he is like the Twin Towers.

194
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Weak.

195
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Ah!

196
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Oh, my God.

197
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Yeah.

198
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Weak like water.

199
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
And he could...

200
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,800
He, at the time, could blow Clyde Cash out,

201
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
like, birthday candles, just like the Twin Towers.

202
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Right.

203
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,800
So, I think that was why Chris was like...

204
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
She said something about the Twin Towers about 9-11.

205
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
It's like, oh, good thing this didn't happen in real life.

206
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
This isn't the real 9-11.

207
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
This is a different thing.

208
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
This is fictional. Those buildings were empty.

209
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
It's got her bases covered, totally.

210
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Good job.

211
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
But she didn't care about the fucking gruesome death of Red Man.

212
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
So, I don't really...

213
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Red Man's fine.

214
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Well, Chris doesn't know that Red Man's fine.

215
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Yet.

216
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
This is a big reveal.

217
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
This is a big reveal that's coming.

218
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
The revive system is a big reveal

219
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
that's coming in the comic later.

220
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Okay, that's fair.

221
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
So, I don't know what's going on in that head of Chris's.

222
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
I don't know what upsets her and what doesn't.

223
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
It's hard to say.

224
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
We'll just have to wait and see, I guess.

225
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
And wait for those sweet lures to be added to his comic.

226
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Like, at the point when Phantom and Strawberry

227
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
are standing around just dripping blood,

228
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
just like coated in it,

229
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
for pages and pages and pages as they discuss

230
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
their situation,

231
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
like, at that point,

232
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
I thought I was over the line.

233
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
And, like, I was like, Chris is gonna see this

234
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
and be like, what the fuck is this?

235
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Fuck off. But she didn't.

236
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
So, who knows.

237
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
What would you do if she got upset over something you drew

238
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
and wanted to sue you over the use of the carry?

239
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Wanted to sue me?

240
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Oh, well, I mean, she can't.

241
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
So, whatever.

242
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Okay, drama.

243
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Chris was talking to this person,

244
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
and this is something I didn't know about,

245
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
but, like, I've heard about it lately.

246
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Chris was talking to someone named Sockness.

247
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
And this Sockness person was going to go

248
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
and see Chris.

249
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
And this person was really weird online.

250
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
And apparently, there were, like,

251
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
dating question marks, and, like,

252
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Sockness got a ticket

253
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
and was gonna go see her.

254
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
And then, like, Chris called up.

255
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
But she called it off in, like,

256
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
the most lukewarm, stupid way possible,

257
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
where she's like, hey,

258
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I still love you

259
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
and I want to see you,

260
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
but it's too soon, you know,

261
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
to send too many red flags,

262
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
at which point, message over,

263
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
you know, this relationship's off red flags,

264
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
but then it continued.

265
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Actually, in reality, it continues, like,

266
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
oh, no, we'll do it later,

267
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
when there are fewer red flags, right?

268
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
It's like, okay, whatever you fucking need.

269
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Chris has never been good at, like,

270
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
what's the word, cutting off when you realize

271
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
it's not gonna work out and making a hard decision?

272
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
This is, like, what's going on

273
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
in the Chris Chan life right now.

274
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
This is the drama.

275
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
They're not gonna fuck or whatever.

276
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
But, right before this happened,

277
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Sockness messaged me on Twitter

278
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
being, like, hey, stop using

279
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Sonichu shit, stop, like, doing this,

280
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
or we'll sue.

281
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
This is copyright infringement.

282
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Who's we? Who are you, individual?

283
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
And Chris responded to Sockness, like,

284
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
chill out. It's fine.

285
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Ah!

286
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Chris is into it.

287
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
When you are more autistic than Chris.

288
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
No offense, Chris.

289
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
I think she's less interested in it

290
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
now that, um, Nightstar isn't

291
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
now that, like, it's not, like,

292
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
she's not liking every tweet anymore,

293
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
but, like, I'm assuming she's still seeing it.

294
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
You are tagging her

295
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
every single one.

296
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
I gotta bring Nightstar back,

297
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
like, just for, like, a little visual call.

298
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I just gotta, like, test the waters,

299
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
make sure Chris is still paying attention,

300
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
trot the little image of Nightstar out

301
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
in front of her, like, hey, you just see,

302
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
you see us, it's still canon.

303
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Yep. Yeah.

304
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
That's the easy fix. Get that.

305
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Also, Chris has been,

306
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
those two panels of

307
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Nightstar going, hmm,

308
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
I get it, you're lying.

309
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Um, Chris has been using those

310
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
as, like, reaction images on Twitter.

311
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Like, when someone says something

312
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
that Chris doesn't agree with,

313
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Chris will respond with those two images.

314
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Cropped very badly

315
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
in such a way that you literally

316
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
cannot see Nightstar's face in either

317
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
panel, but whatever.

318
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
The intent is there, I guess.

319
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I love it.

320
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Yeah, so that's, so that's,

321
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
that's what's up with that, I suppose.

322
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Pretty fucking fun.

323
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Pretty fucking fun. It's really fun.

324
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Tom, what's the state of a Zoomie game right now?

325
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Um, well,

326
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
I'm getting ready to

327
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
start Devtober again.

328
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
It's been one year since

329
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
the production of the game has started.

330
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Yo, Tom, are you far from the mic?

331
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
You sound kind of quiet.

332
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
I didn't think you sounded that quiet.

333
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Okay, that sounds better, I think.

334
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Sounded okay to me.

335
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Okay, well, Devtober

336
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
starts in two days, and that'll be a year

337
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
since I started working on the game.

338
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
So I'm gonna try and get the final public demo,

339
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
like, complete, feature complete.

340
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Nice. Like, a level and stuff.

341
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I have a couple people who are helping me now.

342
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
The game's come pretty far.

343
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
I've been updating it every couple weeks

344
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
for Patreon. What are people helping you with?

345
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Just if you don't mind, Sharon.

346
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Um, well, I have three people...

347
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I have, uh,

348
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Sixten and my friend, Adar, who've been doing

349
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
the soundtrack, and we've been going back far.

350
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
They've been making some new tracks. It's pretty fucking sick.

351
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
They got the authentic OPM

352
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
emulator things.

353
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
So it sounds authentic to Sega Genesis,

354
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
which is dope.

355
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
And then this other dude messaged me on Twitter,

356
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
out of the blue, was like, hey, I do 3D,

357
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
uh, let me help.

358
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
And I'm like, what can you do?

359
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
And then I just took one of my concept arts,

360
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
that I just showed him randomly,

361
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
and he's like, here's a fully complete model

362
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
in like three days. I'm like, okay,

363
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
sure, let's do it.

364
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
So, he's like,

365
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
super stoked about that. So I got a couple people

366
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
to kind of help lighten the load,

367
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
because there's a lot of shit that needs to get done.

368
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
It's, yeah, that's the way.

369
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
When was the last, like,

370
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
uh, well, no, I guess I should ask, like,

371
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
um,

372
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
when...

373
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
when can we,

374
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
the rest of us see,

375
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
when can the general public see,

376
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
like, the new build or something?

377
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
You got one plan?

378
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I'm hoping by the, the plan right now

379
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
is to get the final demo,

380
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
that's like, basically an entire level

381
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
with a boss fight, by the end of December.

382
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Nice. A boss fight. Okay, cool.

383
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Cool, cool, cool.

384
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Yeah, so I have like a boss that I've modeled,

385
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
I gotta figure out, like, how to...

386
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Did you end up, like, finding somebody to consult with

387
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
not yet, that is my next thing.

388
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
I gotta find somebody who's, like,

389
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Tom, Tom, if you want to win every indie game

390
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
award, here's what you do.

391
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
You, okay, there was, like, a thread on,

392
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
on Vee about this the other day, it's like, you, you,

393
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
you know, you know what, like, the jumping capabilities

394
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
of your character are, you just make

395
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
tunnels of spikes, and just make it

396
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
so that you can barely make the jumps,

397
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
and everything except a perfect jump is surrounded

398
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
with spikes, and you will win

399
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
every indie game award that there is

400
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
if you just do that, because that's what

401
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
the game design looks like, right?

402
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
No, you should base it, I think if you,

403
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
the more you base it on, like,

404
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
going back and playing,

405
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
like, Genesis Shinobi,

406
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
and just, like, try to copy the level designs

407
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
to some extent, because, like, if you're,

408
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
you know, I mean, obviously your mechanics

409
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
are more advanced, I think, than Shinobis are,

410
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
but, like, you know, if you want it

411
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
to feel, like, more authentic to Genesis,

412
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
like, you know, try to do Genesis

413
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
level design.

414
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Yeah, I mean, that's the idea.

415
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Examine that stuff. The biggest,

416
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
I don't want to say issue, but the

417
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
challenge right now is going to be that, like,

418
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Izumi's movement is insane, like, you can

419
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
traverse, like, huge distances

420
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
with, like, a double jump plus a double dash,

421
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
so you can, like, go crazy

422
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
ape shit, so I might have toned that down,

423
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
even though it's super fucking fun, and it's the best part

424
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
of the entire game. I mean, you can also look

425
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
at stuff, like, like, Mega Man X

426
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
has more, like, agile movement

427
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
than, say, like, you know,

428
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Shinobi, like, there's, like,

429
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
dashing and stuff like that, and

430
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
there's definitely some

431
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
games from that era that, you know,

432
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
that, like, you just use

433
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
they just, like, make the levels bigger.

434
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
They're just taller and more vertical, you know?

435
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Yeah. There's just going to be a lot more

436
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
space. I mean, the funny thing is, like, I was

437
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
playing it, I was working on the mechanics,

438
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I'm, like, getting really, like, into, like,

439
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
the hit stop and, like, the cathartic, like,

440
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
game feel. I'm like, why didn't I just make a beat

441
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
him up? Then I wouldn't have to worry about levels.

442
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
All those levels are literally just a straight line

443
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
approach things. That's true.

444
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I would have solved, like, 90% of my power right there.

445
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
It's always been crazy to me, though, that beat-ups are, like,

446
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
we're such a big genre, because, like,

447
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
they aren't, like, really straightforward.

448
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Yeah. I mean, they literally are

449
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
go left the game. I mean, those are

450
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
go right the game, depending on the level.

451
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I think the appeal of those is just the sound effects

452
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
of the punching, and it's just really cathartic.

453
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Exactly. And that's, like,

454
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
that's the thing that I'm, like, being

455
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
really autistic over, like, the last, like,

456
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
month has just been, like, I gotta make

457
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
maybe if I put the hit stop, like,

458
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
a little bit more to feel even better.

459
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Maybe if I make this part not part of the hit stop,

460
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
so it keeps animating, even though everything else is frozen,

461
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
it'll feel even better. And I'm, like,

462
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Great sound effects will

463
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
enhance, like, anything.

464
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Like, if the animation is so-so,

465
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
if you get a perfect sound effect,

466
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
nobody will ever notice.

467
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
If it's not, like, the animation's a bit

468
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
roof. There was a game someone recommended

469
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
to me. I was watching a playthrough of it,

470
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
and I muted it, and instantly

471
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
the game didn't feel nearly as good,

472
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
because the sound was doing all the heavy lifting.

473
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm like, huh, that's interesting.

474
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
So when I did that, I muted my game and made sure

475
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
it still felt good. I'm like, hey, hey, I'm better than you.

476
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah, so...

477
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
It's cool.

478
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I'm hype. It's gonna be, it's gonna be good.

479
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Yeah, this reminds me of, back in the day,

480
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
me and my buddy John, I mean, in college,

481
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I made a couple of games. There was a game design club,

482
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
study and that stuff, etc. But,

483
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
after college, me and my buddy John were working on

484
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
a game. I forget

485
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
and I think we gave it a name. It was something

486
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
musical related.

487
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
And the conceit of it was,

488
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
I was doing level design, and most of

489
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
the programming, I mean, whatever,

490
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I was a more experienced programmer and stuff,

491
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
and I had done level design for a game.

492
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Me and my buddy Rich had done in college,

493
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
so I was doing it again. That was

494
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
primarily a platformer, and I'll just tell everybody

495
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
the gimmick, because that's the most interesting

496
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
thing about it. And it's when you establish

497
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
your mechanics, then you build the levels around it.

498
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
That's the way to make it the game

499
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
that I would want to most play, because I love

500
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
platformers and stuff. And so,

501
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
here was the conceit of the game. It was

502
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
that every level

503
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
had its own music,

504
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
or maybe every world would have its own song

505
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
that plays in the background. And here was the thing.

506
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
On the beat, and sometimes irregularly

507
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
on the beat, there would be an

508
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
indicator that would flash. And so, on

509
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
beat, again, this is like a musically

510
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
themed game, you would get abilities

511
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
that you could only do basically on the

512
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
beat. It was kind of like a

513
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
R-Hero meets, I don't know, Super Meat Boy

514
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
or something. And so, like, just for one

515
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
example, you would, like, your jump

516
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
would go like twice as high if you jumped

517
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
on the beat as opposed to not on the beat.

518
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
It's a little bit necromancer, right?

519
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Yeah, yeah, this is before necromancer.

520
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
But yeah, it was like that. It was like that.

521
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
But you would, yeah, I mean,

522
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
we thought it was cool. We made a couple of levels.

523
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
We actually made quite a few levels. But I mean,

524
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
this was, I made a little

525
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
character designs. It was cute. It was a good stuff.

526
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
But actually, this was the time when,

527
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
right at the beginning, I was spending my free time.

528
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I was, you know, going to work. I was spending my free time

529
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
working on this game with John. But then I

530
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
decided to do YouTube. So I'm like, hey, John,

531
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm going to spend my time doing YouTube instead

532
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
of working on this game. So, you know,

533
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
I won't have as much time. Maybe it just doesn't

534
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
work out. I'll come back. So

535
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
maybe one day, me and John will pick up that idea

536
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
and run with it again.

537
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
But I thought it was a good

538
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
idea. I love doing it. I kind of miss making

539
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
games because it's pretty fun. It's also

540
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
really, really hard. So the big problem

541
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
that I'm reading about now with games,

542
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
and that scares me immensely is

543
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
everyone's like indie games are over. It's

544
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
impossible to get noticed or make

545
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
any money off of them. Oh, that's fucking bullshit.

546
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I don't believe that. It's crazy.

547
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
The entire fucking like

548
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
industry, not industry, but like community seems

549
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
like so fucking down on everything.

550
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
And I'm just constantly reading things about that.

551
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I mean, maybe, maybe it's a pragmatic thing.

552
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Like we can point to things like Hollow Knight and

553
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
even like Blasphemous that just came out.

554
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
But those, those are like, okay, how many

555
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
indie games were made for like two or three

556
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
or four or five to stand out at the peak?

557
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Maybe just realistically. The big gay panic

558
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
in the indie scene right now

559
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
is that everybody is

560
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
doing, they're adopting

561
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
a Netflix subscription service now.

562
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
So like you only, you get,

563
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
you're going to get paid on this. Like Humble Bundle kind of stuff?

564
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Well, the platforms

565
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
like, like a lot of people who do

566
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
indies right now are doing mobile. And

567
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
both Apple and Android

568
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
both just announced a $5 a month

569
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
spot, not streaming service,

570
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
but subscription service for games.

571
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
And so you're only under that model

572
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
you only get paid for how many minutes

573
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
people are playing your games. Oh my goodness.

574
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
So you're incentivizing like pointless endless

575
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
bullshit that just wasted your time.

576
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Because you're just, just like

577
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
you know, fucking Netflix

578
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
fucked over like movies and, and Spotify

579
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
is like bankrupting the indie musicians.

580
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Everyone's like, well, the subscription service

581
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
is coming for games now too.

582
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
So everyone's butt hurt about that. Feels like

583
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
more every day, like we're coming

584
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
closer to just have your own

585
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
website, forget stuff,

586
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
just be, be cool and have your own

587
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
shit. Tom, yeah.

588
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Tom, you're planning to sell the game, right?

589
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Uh, initially I wasn't,

590
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
but now that it's becoming such a

591
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
big fucking to do and it's becoming

592
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
a brain blast of like cool ideas that

593
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
have no idea how I'm going to pull off, I'm probably going to have to just

594
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
to justify all the effort.

595
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
How much do you think you charge for it?

596
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
I don't know, more than

597
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
$10. It's only going to be four levels.

598
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Probably be like an hour to play through.

599
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
I think, I think if the game is only

600
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
like, you know, 10 bucks or less

601
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
and like we have a platform

602
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
to promote it, so like at the

603
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
very least it's going to get some sales. I mean

604
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
you could talk about it on I Am Games,

605
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
you could talk about it on here, we could

606
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
talk about it, everybody's probably going to want to

607
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
promote that shit because it's going to be a fucking

608
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
just like we did with Davoo's game, at least a little bit.

609
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
And uh, if you, if

610
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
the game was successful enough, do you

611
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
think you would try to like figure out if you

612
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
could like reproduce it onto

613
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
a Genesis cartridge?

614
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
I mean, I don't know if it's even like

615
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
technically possible, because like I don't know what the exact

616
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
specifications of the Genesis are.

617
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
I mean, I would love to have that, it would be

618
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
like the biggest come of all time.

619
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
How many people actually have a physical Genesis anyway?

620
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
You know, these days?

621
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Well, lots of people. Everybody?

622
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Yeah, maybe. There's currently like

623
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
it's kind of like a boutique market right now

624
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
to make like limited run

625
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
like repro cartridges of games.

626
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
But usually the games are

627
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
designed like literally around the systems

628
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
capabilities if they're going to do that, you know.

629
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
In Tom's case, it's more of just an aesthetic.

630
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
You know, what would be interesting, there's

631
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
there's a, there's a video

632
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
on um, on YouTube

633
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
of some guy that

634
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
it was just, it was called Doom running on an NES.

635
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
And I guess

636
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
what he did is you just have a, you have

637
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
you open up a NES cartridge,

638
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
you put a Raspberry Pi in there, and then

639
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
you can have it output through

640
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
the NES, but it just runs the game off the

641
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Raspberry Pi.

642
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah, Raspberry Pi is like a mini computer.

643
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Why would you put a Pi in your fucking Nintendo?

644
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
That sounds pretty messy.

645
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
What were they thinking?

646
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Oh, it was a parody video, no one told me

647
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
shit. I thought this was...

648
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
But like, I'm just thinking like maybe you could do that for a Sega,

649
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
like you get like a Raspberry Pi, it runs

650
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
the game off that, but it like interfaces

651
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
through the Genesis's video out.

652
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
For a Genesis, you would use a chili dough.

653
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Apparently it is possible.

654
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
What's up? I, I, I don't know

655
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
anything about this. I've only heard that like indie

656
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
people say that like getting your

657
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
uh, game on Nintendo is pretty, is pretty good.

658
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Uh, would it that... Yeah, the switch

659
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
is pretty fucking hot right now for

660
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
indies, but even, even now it's like starting

661
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
to get super saturated, just because everyone's

662
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
targeting that. Cause there's way too much fucking bullshit.

663
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Like they are not quality controlling it.

664
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
So you go on there and just like switch the

665
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
new Steam.

666
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
It's, it kinda is, yeah.

667
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Steam's kind of, I guess, I was reading

668
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
today in a thread that I guess Steam's reduced

669
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
like profits for indies by 50%

670
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
or something, like some update to the policy

671
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
and everyone's fucking butt heard about it

672
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
and I'm just like, I don't even know what's going on.

673
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
I'm just over here in my corner, coloring.

674
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
So,

675
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
I have no fucking clue. It's very strange.

676
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
I can't, I can't believe, I really can't believe

677
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
that like indies are getting released on the switch.

678
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
That seems like, that's like the

679
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
opposite of like Nintendo's old

680
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Goose game. Oh, someone was telling me

681
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
about Goose game just yesterday.

682
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
My friend, yeah, my friend

683
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Toby was telling me that I got

684
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
to check out Goose game. My friend Toby

685
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
Fox. My friend, yes, yeah.

686
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
He was like, hey, Ben, love the

687

Ben St. Slash Vapors 2.

692
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Love your, love your stuff. However,

693
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
have you played Goose

694
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
game? And I said, I'm titled

695
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
and I said, Toby Fox, you're a fucking

696
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
hack. Deltarune wasn't that good.

697
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Come back

698
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
when you've fucking grown a brain, a dick

699
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
and a heart and

700
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
um

701
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Has anyone actually, I mean

702
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
I've seen a little bit of the footage of Goose

703
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
game. It's just Goat Simulator 2, right?

704
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
I mean, who cares? That's what I said.

705
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
I don't know about it. I know

706
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
people love it. I mean

707
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
it's at least visually appealing

708
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
and Goat Simulator was not. I love it so much.

709
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
I agree. It's true.

710
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Have you seen the Goose Waddle? That's all I need.

711
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Oh my god. See, that's what people are paying

712
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
for. Lol, cute Goose Waddle.

713
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Wow, that's worth my $1,000.

714
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I'm here for this Goose.

715
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
I stan Goose.

716
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
I mean, that's all you need, I guess.

717
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
I'm thinking this whole video game thing.

718
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Did you watch

719
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Dunke's video about Goose game?

720
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
I did not. I did not.

721
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
You'll see that like, there's a lot of

722
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
it's like the AI scripting

723
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
of the people that makes the game

724
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
interesting. You can like really fuck with the NPCs

725
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
and like do weird things.

726
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
You can lock the little boy into a like

727
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
what's it called? The phone booth.

728
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
You can no clip through the little boy

729
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
and

730
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
QPU over a couple dimensions.

731
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
Oh, can you backwards long jump as the Goose?

732
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
You gotta keep your Goose QPU

733
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
aligned at all times.

734
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
That's the meta.

735
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
I want to see, I want to hear

736
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
like the Mario wahoo, but like a Goose

737
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
like honk.

738
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Uh oh, it's secret Waluigi propaganda.

739
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Imagine if Goose makes it into Smash

740
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
and Waluigi still isn't.

741
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
This game looks like

742
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
this game looks like a

743
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
like a Kurzgesagt video or something.

744
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
This game looks like

745
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
a like mass appeal

746
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
YouTube video.

747
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
It reminded me a bit of Ooblets

748
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
that you guys know about Ooblets.

749
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
I know the name, but I've never met the man.

750
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
I've heard of Ooblets. I've seen a bit of it.

751
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
They're the ones who got in trouble

752
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
for being on Epic Game Store, right?

753
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Yeah, yeah. I've actually

754
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
knew about them way before.

755
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I was looking forward to their game

756
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
on Steam.

757
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
So what's the deal? Did they get fucked?

758
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
They signed an

759
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
deal with the Epic Game Store

760
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
that they were like really...

761
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
That wasn't a big mistake.

762
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
They were up their own ass about it.

763
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
They made a whole thing just like,

764
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
you guys are gay. This is fucking great.

765
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
We're better than you because we made a game

766
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
and everyone was like, go fuck yourself.

767
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Yeah, they were kind of rude about it.

768
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
If they had just been like, hey guys,

769
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
we're going to Epic Exclusive because

770
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
we really need the funding, whatever.

771
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
If they were honest about it

772
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
and just nice people.

773
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
When I see people arguing about the Epic Store,

774
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
like the argument

775
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
that I see online

776
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
is like, people are like, guys,

777
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
indie devs have to go

778
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
on the Epic Store because it makes them money

779
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
because they need money.

780
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Duh, you idiots. And the response is

781
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
like, well,

782
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
fine, yeah, business is going to make

783
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
money, of course.

784
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
The thing people say is like,

785
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
yeah, but a lot of people

786
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
kickstarted their project, crowdfunded their project

787
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
or something for a public release

788
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
and then turned around

789
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
and released on an exclusive platform.

790
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
You bought, you backed the project

791
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
to get a Steam key and then like, oh, there's no Steam keys now.

792
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Double-dipping, as it were.

793
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Right, right.

794
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I believe that Bloodstain, for example,

795
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
was originally supposed to be on Wii U,

796
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
but now, it's been so many years or whatever,

797
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
like, no one's, like, what's the point?

798
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
No one's gonna buy it. So they just ditched,

799
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
and I mean, it's fair to have a grievance

800
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
if you want it on the Wii U, but...

801
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
I mean, if you had a Wii U,

802
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
you probably have a Switch by now.

803
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
I feel like it would probably not be

804
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
here. You don't want to be changing your ways.

805
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
I mean, I was the oldest codger of them all

806
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
and I don't even have a Switch by now.

807
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
That's true. If you finally moved,

808
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
whatever, people are entitled to their grievances.

809
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
If people break their word, fair enough.

810
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Patreon.com

811
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
slash PolyStation2 to play my game.

812
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Play the new build. You can play

813
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
all the new moves I've added. It's pretty sick.

814
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
The hit stop is now

815
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
perfect, feels like the best

816
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
shit of all time.

817
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Yeah, I'm really happy with it so far.

818
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Hey, let me give you guys an update from the

819
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Nate Overse, which is this thing.

820
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
So, me and Gib talked about this yesterday

821
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
when we recorded the Pawnee cast.

822
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Was that yesterday? Yeah, okay, I think it was.

823
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
And there's a couple things going on,

824
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
but I've noticed a few things.

825
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
It's the subject of hype culture and hype stuff

826
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
that I talk about sometimes, but I just wanted

827
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
to bring up this one, particularly,

828
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
I don't know, a perfect example of what's going on.

829
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
And there was even a new one a little bit after

830
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
I saw that from yesterday that's even more

831
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
interesting. And so, the

832
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
new chapter of One Piece, I won't get into the specifics,

833
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
but among other things,

834
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
the new chapter had a big

835
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
flashback to some of Roger's

836
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
history, like Roger's greatest

837
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
rival of the past, and we learned about

838
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
a lot of deep lore about him and Garp

839
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
and things like this, and

840
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
the relationship of the Yonkos back in

841
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
the day, like the big, important people in One Piece, blah, blah, blah.

842
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
I know a lot of people don't know, that's fine.

843
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
And then the second

844
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
half of the chapter, what it did was it just dumped

845
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
all the Yonkos

846
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
bounties, which are like the

847
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
they're like the One Piece equivalent of like the power level

848
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
rating, it's different. People decide that it's not exactly

849
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
the same as like Rayatsu from Bleach or whatever,

850
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
but you know, there's a similar kind of hype

851
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
surrounding them, and we got them for

852
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
all the Yonko, Whitebeard,

853
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
and Goldfucking Roger. We got

854
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
like all their historical bounties that are

855
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
like said to be the highest of all time.

856
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
So like this, this is a chapter that gave

857
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
us numbers that don't really

858
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
indicate anything other than like

859
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
how much value like the Marines put on these guys,

860
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
and then we learned like some back

861
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
story that like, I mean

862
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
just thinking about it rationally, like Oda

863
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
could have just made this up like yesterday

864
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
and read it into the story as like something

865
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
he's planning for the future. It's not like this

866
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
was something that was really planned out for a long time

867
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
necessarily.

868
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
And I think given my experience with this series,

869
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
I think this would have been hinted if he was going to do it before.

870
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Okay, but the point is

871
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
everything in this last chapter was like

872
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
pure hype bait.

873
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
It's like, okay, there will be future developments

874
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
about like Roger's past. Okay, cool.

875
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
And like his old

876
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
adversary, this guy rocks, etc. etc.

877
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
his old crew. And then also we just learned

878
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
a bunch of bounty stuff, and that stuff really

879
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
doesn't actually matter very much

880
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
to the narrative of One Piece. It's just

881
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
like satisfying for like us

882
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
like lore fags. People who are like

883
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
we want to know these numbers. It just

884
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
satisfies the autism.

885
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
And some people were saying this

886
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
was the best chapter of One Piece.

887
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
And I went on, I mean

888
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
some people who are like respected members of the

889
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
quote unquote One Piece community.

890
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
And I just found that so strange

891
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
that like as opposed to like

892
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I hope you're not gonna go on, yeah, don't do the entire

893
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
rent again, it was really wrong. No, I'm not.

894
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
I'm just saying as opposed to like

895
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
a big end of arc moment where like

896
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
all this artistic stuff

897
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
that's been set up for like months and possibly years

898
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
all is like satisfyingly

899
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
concluded in an artistic

900
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
climax. Instead

901
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
this like hype chapter is called

902
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
like the best moment in One Piece. And I

903
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
find that like the wrong way

904
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
to read One Piece basically.

905
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
So it's hype culture at work. And then

906
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
just yesterday after I saw that

907
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
somebody tweeted me on Twitter

908
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
and they said, hey Nate, have you seen this?

909
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
This is what they led

910
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
with like Nate, did you hear about

911
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
the Sekiro DLC rumors?

912
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Have you heard about the hints about Sekiro

913
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
DLC? Okay, so first of all

914
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
there's no one on the planet who's more

915
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
interested in Sekiro DLC than me.

916
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
I am the number one most

917
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
strongest Japanese boy

918
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
who wants my strongest Japanese DLC

919
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
for my samurai game.

920
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
This is what I want more than anything. So

921
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
when I actually, I'm like, okay, don't lie to me now.

922
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Don't tease me boy. What is this?

923
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
He links me a

924
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
post from here. I'll fuck, I've got it right here.

925
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
It's a post on Sekiro's

926
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
Twitter that it just looks like

927
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
this and it says

928
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
the one armed wolf awakens

929
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
and it's just a picture of Sekiro

930
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
of Wolf, like from the

931
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
opening area of the game.

932
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
So people are taking this like statement

933
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
of the one armed wolf awakens

934
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
as like, ooh, could this be like a reawakening?

935
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Could this be like more DLC?

936
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Well, okay lads, let's use a little

937
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
critical thinking here. First of all

938
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
if you scroll down beyond like

939
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
two fucking posts, you can

940
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
see that this Twitter feed

941
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
regularly, it is the official Sekiro Twitter feed

942
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
it regularly posts

943
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
like still images of the game

944
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
with quotes exactly like this.

945
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
There's one from a couple days ago that's Kuro

946
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
the little boy that you work for, your lord

947
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
or whatever and it's just him and it says

948
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
I heard stories of your death, yet here you are

949
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
and there's more just like

950
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
the point being, like this

951
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
image is such a

952
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
poor indicator that there is actually

953
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
any intention of DLC, there has

954
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
been no other like

955
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
clues that any DLC is coming

956
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
and yet when you just look at the numbers

957
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
this image has been retweeted

958
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
4,000 times and all these other

959
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
ones have been retweeted like

960
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
100, maybe 200, like

961
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
150 and like there's like 10

962
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
times the amount of likes because people

963
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
have been like tricked into

964
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
thinking that this is like a hint of DLC

965
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
when there's like nothing implied

966
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
here and this is my point

967
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
this is the vicious hype machine

968
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
at work. I don't want to be

969
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
led to believe there's actually hints

970
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
of DLC coming when the actual

971
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
evidence when you do and you look at it

972
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
critically there's just no reason to believe

973
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
that and it just sets people up

974
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
like me in this case for

975
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
disappointment. So it's just

976
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
endlessly frustrating to me

977
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
that all these people involved, like I feel like

978
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
people say to me on the episode yesterday

979
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
they said like Nate we just want to get hyped

980
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
and excited about things, why you poo poo

981
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
in our hype and it's like well like

982
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
because it's disappointing

983
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
and people like if I bought Securo

984
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
now under the expectation that

985
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
DLC was coming that could be a waste of money

986
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
if like that's what I'm buying it for

987
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
customers and consumers can be

988
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
falsely led down paths. What if I read

989
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
all of One Piece because I believe

990
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
something that was wrong and then I get to it

991
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
and I'm like oh well shit that isn't what I expected

992
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
my time was wasted. I mean I

993
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
love One Piece but you get my point

994
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
I'm endlessly frustrated

995
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
by how people view this subject

996
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
and they just don't want to believe

997
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
that there could be any negative consequences

998
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
of any kind by like believing

999
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
things that have no substantiating

1000
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
evidence by overhyping

1001
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
things and possibly poisoning the well for

1002
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
other people. You know

1003
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
what I'm saying Lads, does this make sense

1004
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
are you with me?

1005
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
It could be fun like you know it's

1006
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
actually coming and like and you

1007
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
and your friends are like yeah it's

1008
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
going to release this day let's get hyped

1009
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
it's going to be fun and it's sort of fun

1010
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
in the moment just to share the information

1011
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
excitement with someone but also

1012
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
like the hype itself if

1013
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
you don't know if it's confirmed or not

1014
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
or just like if you get like

1015
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
toxic about it or violent about it

1016
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
it's just or aggressive

1017
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I guess. Yeah that's true

1018
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
or even just set up for disappointment

1019
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
that's the great bugbear here

1020
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
I don't want people to be disappointed by

1021
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
things because I feel and it can

1022
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
mislead consumers and money could be

1023
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
spent places where it doesn't deserve or

1024
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
time or energy I just want to save

1025
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
people from that and myself

1026
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
so I don't know. I feel this

1027
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
reminds me of a situation like it pops up

1028
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
every few years I keep seeing it

1029
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
it used to be on Tumblr but I don't use Tumblr anymore

1030
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
so I haven't seen it in a while

1031
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
every few years season 2

1032
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
of Oran High School House Club

1033
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
is going to be announced soon

1034
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
and everyone gets so hyped

1035
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
and just like guys no

1036
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
that will not happen

1037
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
they keep promising the reboot

1038
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
of reboot you know that old CG show

1039
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
reboot

1040
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
every now and then they'll announce it

1041
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
as a way to like generate fake hype

1042
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
but they never do it

1043
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
if you look down at the evidence behind

1044
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
any of these claims I would bet almost 100%

1045
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
the actual evidence for it is like terrible

1046
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
you know what this your stance reminds me of

1047
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
is when the new generation

1048
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
of consoles started

1049
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Super Bunny Hop had a series of videos

1050
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
that were kind of what like first

1051
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
drew attention to his channel

1052
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
where he was pointing out that he just

1053
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
was not hyped for the upcoming consoles

1054
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
and he had first it was like

1055
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
the Xbox one why I'm not

1056
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
hyped which nobody was

1057
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
so like it was just kind of seen as part for the course

1058
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
but then he put out a video where he was

1059
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
why he was not hyped for the PS4

1060
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
and his argument was basically the same

1061
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
as yours it's like a lot of the claims

1062
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
they're making they have no evidence for

1063
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
and in the PS3's case

1064
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
what they tried to bill it as was not what we got

1065
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
you know so like

1066
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
we look like villains when we are just

1067
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
when we poo poo and people want to be hyped

1068
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
he got overwhelming dislikes on that

1069
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
like even though it got enough views

1070
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
that people paid attention to his channel from then on

1071
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
like it's like 40%

1072
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
dislike bar maybe even more maybe it's

1073
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
more than 50 I have no idea how it evolved

1074
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
over time but like people were just really

1075
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
upset that like just the

1076
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
PS4 literally on that

1077
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
E3 just because it was presented

1078
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
so much better than Xbox one is

1079
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
considered to be why it is so

1080
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
successful and it's like one of the most successful

1081
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
consoles of all time after the

1082
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
PS3 had been didn't even

1083
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
sell half as much you know with a long

1084
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
lifespan and weigh the fuck more games

1085
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
I just found the video

1086
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
5 reasons to not get hyped for the PS4

1087
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
13,000 upvotes

1088
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
17,000 downvotes the

1089
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
the case is clear

1090
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
and like he's not being unreasonable and like

1091
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
shitting on it he's just like hey man

1092
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
don't take the claim seriously until they've been

1093
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
proven and like some of this

1094
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
shit is they're talking out of their

1095
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
ass you know like yeah it ended up

1096
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
being a good console anyways it's just like

1097
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
don't buy into the marketing just

1098
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
wait till it comes out and if it's good

1099
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
then great you know like modern day

1100
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
triple A games a lot you know they promise

1101
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
a lot you pre-order

1102
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
and then like it's shit

1103
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
you know I'm

1104
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
working on

1105
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
here and there I'm working on a concept that I'm

1106
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
going to reveal at some point

1107
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
in the future it's like a think piece

1108
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
I've been wanting to talk about for many years

1109
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
like my whole gaming career has been leading up

1110
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
to it it's like it's like I think I've

1111
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
mentioned a little bit it's something like

1112
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
the intellectual limit on like

1113
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
what a game or any kind of product

1114
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
can be it like when I like for example

1115
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
with someone like Final Fantasy 15

1116
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
when I see people being like this game looks

1117
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,800
so incredible like look at all the things

1118
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
look how like complicated the animations

1119
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
are I already know

1120
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
that the developers first of all

1121
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
technical limitations on how much you can do with

1122
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
a controller and how much brain power

1123
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
the average player can be expected

1124
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
to commit to any given game 100%

1125
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
tell me you are not controlling

1126
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
the precise movements of these characters

1127
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,800
it's mostly AI stuff happening

1128
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
and then also I know for a fact

1129
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,800
there's only so much work a dev team

1130
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,800
can pour into any given game

1131
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
to make it like feasible to release

1132
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
I just know for a fact

1133
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
that like Kojima levels of detail

1134
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
are like an incredible rarity

1135
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
we like never get that much detail

1136
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
as like a Metal Gear Solid 3 environment or whatever

1137
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
so like it's it's silly

1138
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
to just allow the hype machine to be like

1139
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
it's going to be like No Man's Sky

1140
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
generation stuff almost every single time

1141
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
and people just allow their imaginations

1142
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
to run wild and they inevitably

1143
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
set up for disappointment

1144
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
I think that the culture has

1145
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
somewhat shifted after like

1146
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
Watch Dogs because so many people

1147
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
that and the one you just said

1148
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
and also like No Man's Sky

1149
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
the non-release of like Star Citizen

1150
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
over the course of all these years

1151
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
you know or Spore

1152
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
it's just like all these games that over promise

1153
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
and then like but particularly

1154
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
like Watch Dogs where it like didn't even resemble

1155
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
the original thing it's like

1156
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
it's just a generic shitty game

1157
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
and everybody was like buying fucking

1158
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
special editions of it because what they

1159
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
showed in the trailers

1160
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
looked awesome but like

1161
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
it was like a technical benchmark

1162
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,800
but they didn't achieve that in the game

1163
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
this has been going on forever

1164
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
I mean the Killzone 2 trailer

1165
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
from fucking all the way back

1166
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
the Dark Souls 2 trailer

1167
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
fuck

1168
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,800
the entire Anthem reveal

1169
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
haha yeah exactly

1170
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
like did you guys hear about

1171
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,800
Anthem how like

1172
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
they had this huge big reveal and it looked

1173
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
gorgeous and everything and then later it came out

1174
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
it's like yeah the entire dev team

1175
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
working on Anthem found out the game was called

1176
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
Anthem on that reveal trailer

1177
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
that's how like far behind in development they were

1178
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
and it's just like

1179
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
oh dear

1180
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
I mean one facet of this

1181
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
this isn't I mean this isn't directly

1182
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
into the subject but like your video recently on

1183
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
Digi or Digi's video about

1184
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
the new remake of Link's Awakening

1185
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
or whatever like that

1186
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
you know this is a little bit different but it's like

1187
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
it's like what's the selling point

1188
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
of that game yes apparently

1189
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
some things have been improved in like the gameplay

1190
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
but like why

1191
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
a lot of it matters just what are you looking

1192
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
for out of the game if you just want

1193
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
a game that looks like that and you want to experience

1194
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
then I have nothing critical

1195
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
to say basically that's that it is

1196
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
what it is there's no doubt no point

1197
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
doubting it it's weird we've entered

1198
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
a period now where like

1199
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
we people have gotten used

1200
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
to buying the same game multiple times

1201
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,800
on different consoles like whichever

1202
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
console you have hooked up to your TV because

1203
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,800
of the fact that we use our consoles for fucking

1204
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
everything like my brother

1205
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
Victor he does all of his

1206
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
YouTube viewing everything

1207
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
internet browsing usually just because he's too lazy

1208
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
to open a laptop all through the

1209
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
ps4 so it's like

1210
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
just you know

1211
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,800
Jesse is somebody Jesse and

1212
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Tom I know are both people who bought the same game

1213
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
multiple times

1214
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
like you bought doom on the switch even though

1215
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
you already had it on PC

1216
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,800
like to be fair I bought doom on the switch

1217
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,800
I thought I was going to be living in a car and I wouldn't

1218
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,800
be able to fare on a ps4 anymore

1219
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,800
okay fair enough but like

1220
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,800
you know still buy it

1221
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
will buy it on the on the sake of like oh

1222
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
I want to have it on the switch

1223
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
and like a lot of people had links

1224
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
I did that with Hollow Knight I straight up just

1225
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
bought it on the switch I wanted on it

1226
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
I bought guilty gear double X like at least seven times

1227
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
I also did them with forager so yeah

1228
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
yeah there you go

1229
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
I'm not going to get ruined factory 4 on the switch

1230
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,800
even though I have it on the 3DS

1231
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
I had bought links Awakening DX

1232
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
on the 3DS and played it for the first time

1233
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
there in the virtual console

1234
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
and like because switch doesn't have virtual

1235
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
console yet I think they were just like

1236
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
alright well we've been remaking Zelda games

1237
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
which one hasn't had a remake and it's like

1238
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,800
Link's Awakening had a remake but it was still on the

1239
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,800
Game Boy we could a lot of people

1240
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
like it let's just update it

1241
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
with better graphics and sell it for

1242
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
60 fucking dollars and people will pay for

1243
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,800
it because it's got the Legend of Zelda in the name and like

1244
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
to me it's like it's obscene

1245
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800
but I almost bought it anyway you know

1246
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
I was just kind of like well I'll play it

1247
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
I know I was really tempted

1248
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
I'm still kind of tempted to buy it

1249
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
but I think I really do want to just play

1250
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,800
the original more and it was absolutely your

1251
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
if you haven't played the original I would encourage

1252
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
you to because it's fun it's a fun

1253
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
game like it holds up

1254
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
it's you could pick up and play it

1255
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
the only thing that's frustrating about it

1256
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
is that you can only hold two items at a

1257
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
time and the sword is one of the items so you

1258
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,800
almost always want your sword equipped so

1259
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
every time you want to switch items you have to open up the menu

1260
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
and you will do it a lot

1261
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
the number one only thing that's really not

1262
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
good about the game everything else is good

1263
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
so that game

1264
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Link's Awakening an Oracle of Ages

1265
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
and Seasons I couldn't get into them because

1266
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,800
all of the micromanaging of your inventory

1267
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,800
I beat all of those though that was annoying

1268
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
it was definitely annoying

1269
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
they did somewhat

1270
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,800
like they mostly fixed it because they gave

1271
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
you an assigned sword button

1272
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
and an assigned shield button and I think

1273
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,800
the gauntlets are just permanently on so it's

1274
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,800
like you don't have to do it as much

1275
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
but there still were ways they could have

1276
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,800
made it even better like they could have

1277
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,800
given you like a weapon wheel or something that you

1278
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
could just instantly switch between because

1279
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,800
it's not that there's a ton of them but there are a

1280
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
few that you need to use a lot

1281
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
so it's just like why make it so I have to go

1282
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,800
into the menu at all

1283
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,800
but you know this is the thing this was funny

1284
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
I was like trying to get answers about this

1285
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
I tweeted out I mean I don't know I've been doing this a bunch lately

1286
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
I'll just say it like I was thinking about doing

1287
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
this with Code Vein

1288
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
Code Vein has been discussed on V for a million years

1289
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,800
like the waifu creation people are going

1290
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,800
hog wild about it but like

1291
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
I'm just like okay I could maybe enjoy

1292
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
the waifu playing as and the creation

1293
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,800
and jacking off to IO like your waifu

1294
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,800
in the game whatever I could do that for like

1295
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
I don't know maybe even up to an hour

1296
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
but once I'm done with that

1297
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,800
I'm gonna want to actually play the game

1298
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
it's apparently Dark Souls-esque so like

1299
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
I didn't do this yet but I've been doing it with other games

1300
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
I want to tweet like so guys is this game actually good

1301
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
I think it is

1302
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
I believe it is but I'm not

1303
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,800
100% sure I know it was just a development for a million years

1304
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
I mean people fucking love Monster Hunter so

1305
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
I never got into it I still need to

1306
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
it's the one from the

1307
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
big difference it's the one from the God

1308
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,800
Eater people yes okay it is

1309
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
like just like that one yeah

1310
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
but they're copying they're trying to know it's

1311
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,800
it's from the God Eater people but I think it's like

1312
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,800
more of a Monster Hunter type of game

1313
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
because I read an article about it in like a game informer

1314
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
or something before it came out

1315
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,800
well I mean the way that ties into this the Zelda thing

1316
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
is like so I actually did do this with Zelda

1317
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,800
I just tweeted like guys like you know

1318
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,800
me I mean this was like mostly

1319
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
I'm a nostalgia blinded old fuck boy

1320
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,800
and I hate everything that's new

1321
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,800
but like just tell me like

1322
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,800
I want to play a game for the gameplay the aesthetic

1323
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,800
will only last for like a little bit then I'll get

1324
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
tired of it because that's how I play games I want

1325
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
good gameplay will I enjoy

1326
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
the new Zelda remake it's considering

1327
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
that I've like loved every classic Zelda I played

1328
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,800
when I was young and I'm okay with that

1329
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,800
kind of game remake which game

1330
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,800
Link's Awakening was

1331
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
that was on the original on the Game Boy

1332
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
that's correct

1333
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
did I ask the same question last week

1334
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
no but we did just

1335
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
cover this right now sorry I was

1336
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
trading I was completing the trade the trade

1337
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
is done I've given Master Slimal into Dupati

1338
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
Smuple and I am Schmuple and I am now

1339
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
in possession of visiting mayor

1340
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Christine Weston Chandler's scalp

1341
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
in Endless War congratulations in my

1342
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
pocket just had to announce it

1343
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
I'm very excited anyway

1344
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
mm-hmm what the fuck

1345
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,800
were we talking about

1346
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
Zelda will I actually like the Zelda gameplay

1347
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
I think that you would definitely

1348
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
prefer to just emulate

1349
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
the old game like

1350
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,800
if you I mean I don't it's free first of

1351
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
all that's a big plus right there

1352
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
the fucking game is $60

1353
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
it's only five hours

1354
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,800
long if you play it fast like

1355
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
it's not a they didn't

1356
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
change anything about it it's the same

1357
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
fucking game they just change your

1358
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
controls so it's like this is a Game Boy

1359
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
game I can like I bought

1360
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
it on the 3ds it was like eight

1361
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
bucks maybe ten you know

1362
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
like I was willing to pay that for the

1363
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
ease of playing it on my 3ds

1364
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
because I wanted to play it there I had been playing

1365
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
a lot of 3ds but like

1366
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
yeah I play a lot of switch but fucking

1367
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
$60 I can literally just

1368
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
download this game and play it on

1369
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
any computer in the fucking house and it's not that

1370
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
long that's how I played all the other classic

1371
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
Zelda games it's not like there's a fucking

1372
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
collection pack where I can just buy all

1373
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
of these in one thing like you can do with

1374
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
Mega Man or Sonic or the entire

1375
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
fucking Sega Genesis library

1376
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
like how fucking hard

1377
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
is it for them to just put together

1378
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
a pack of all the classic Zelda games

1379
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
Nintendo knows they don't have to

1380
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
because they can tell us $60

1381
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
reskills they're the apple of gaming

1382
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
they can go against before

1383
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
before we go even further down

1384
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
and like I wanted to talk about hype

1385
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
for a bit if we're still on that

1386
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
okay the

1387
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,800
the whole thing with like hype I mean in video

1388
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
games specifically I don't feel it because

1389
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
I'm extremely cynical like the last

1390
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
time I was hyped good for

1391
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
any video game was

1392
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Dark Souls 3 and since then

1393
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
I haven't really cared about anything that's

1394
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
come out

1395
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
do you feel any hype

1396
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,800
at all for the promise of the next

1397
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Hida Takamiya Zaki game

1398
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
the one that's being

1399
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,800
written by the Game of Thrones guy

1400
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
I mean yes and no

1401
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
when's the next fucking book when's

1402
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
wins of winter George

1403
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
I don't know give it a couple years

1404
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
it's been like a fucking decade

1405
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
George is gonna drop dead and we're all gonna

1406
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
die along with it

1407
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
Elden Ring is

1408
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
wait that's it

1409
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
George George

1410
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
he's known for killing characters

1411
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
his final act is tragically killing

1412
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
the ultimate character himself

1413
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800
before the books are done

1414
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,800
the ultimate twist he's gonna die

1415
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
at the ledger

1416
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
anyway he's gonna die at the ledge of a fucking

1417
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
cliff

1418
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
usually with games

1419
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,800
I'm not like I don't get hype

1420
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
for media in general I don't get hype

1421
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
but I do effect

1422
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
I do get the hype thing

1423
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
in other areas and I have

1424
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,800
I've experienced

1425
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
the unbelievable

1426
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,800
anger that comes from somebody quashing

1427
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,800
my hype

1428
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
which is why I understand

1429
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
the people who get upset about it

1430
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
is because

1431
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
I forget exactly what the situation was

1432
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
but I was like trying to figure out

1433
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
some things with learning to draw

1434
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
art

1435
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
stuff

1436
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
just techniques

1437
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
or approaches that are good or bad

1438
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
or whatever

1439
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
I was thinking I had something pretty good

1440
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
and I was like talking about it

1441
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
and then somebody comes in

1442
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
actually I don't think I was talking about it

1443
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
but I was reading people's things

1444
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
I was like yeah this sounds really good

1445
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,800
and then the people come in and say

1446
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
by the way all of that stuff was

1447
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
really stupid and

1448
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,800
here's some examples of better artists

1449
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,800
who are explaining why that isn't true

1450
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
and it was like it destroyed me

1451
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
and I got really mad but I didn't say anything

1452
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,800
because I was just like

1453
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
they're right they have the proof

1454
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
and

1455
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,800
the anger was like

1456
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,800
this thing is provably stupid

1457
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
in whatever way I forget exactly

1458
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,800
but the thing that

1459
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,800
the feeling was is that I had hope

1460
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,800
you know I had hope for this thing

1461
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,800
I was invested in this

1462
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,800
approach and I realized

1463
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,800
that oh yeah this doesn't make sense

1464
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
and it's stupid and this guy came

1465
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800
you know he's destroyed

1466
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,800
my hope and I feel like

1467
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,800
a lot of the reason people get hype for things

1468
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,800
is that they really want to be hopeful about something

1469
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,800
and any negativity

1470
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,800
that gets in their way is just like

1471
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,800
how fucking dare you I have enough to deal with

1472
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,800
without you making video games

1473
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,800
upsetting for me god damn

1474
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,800
people think that video games aren't

1475
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,800
serious enough business to like

1476
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,800
worry about this stuff with which I understand

1477
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
to a degree it's 2019

1478
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,800
the planet is dying

1479
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,800
I just want to get hype for fucking

1480
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,800
what's that condemned

1481
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
what was the one with the cone head man

1482
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
a blasphemous

1483
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,800
I just want to be hyped for blasphemous and then you

1484
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,800
come in and tell me that the art is good

1485
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
but the gameplay is mediocre get the fuck

1486
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,800
out of here what am I supposed to live for

1487
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,800
yeah it's that

1488
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,800
it's literally that feeling and it's like

1489
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,800
how do you fix that

1490
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,800
well you know what

1491
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,800
let me just give one other counter example

1492
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,800
you know what I'll tell you how you fix it

1493
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,800
you do it eventually

1494
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,800
I've been enjoying video games which is

1495
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,800
you go and

1496
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,800
watch videos of people

1497
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,800
reviewing old games

1498
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,800
and then find out

1499
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,800
what ones are interesting and then go play

1500
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,800
interesting old games and fuck

1501
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,800
all that shit

1502
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,800
how was that more work

1503
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
I don't get it

1504
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,800
I'm not specifically asking about like video game hype

1505
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,800
because obviously the thing is just wait for it

1506
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,800
to come out and then look at reviews

1507
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,800
so that you don't get disappointed but like

1508
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,800
I'm trying to figure out why people are so

1509
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,800
set on being hyped that it makes them so angry

1510
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,800
when people

1511
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,800
quash their hype or tell them not to get too excited

1512
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,800
because they're

1513
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,800
it feels bad though

1514
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,800
I don't know whether people were this hopeful years ago

1515
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,800
is it because the world sucks more and we're so

1516
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
we're so

1517
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,800
we're so

1518
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,800
we're too

1519
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,800
we're too linked in with the brain nodes

1520
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
to all of the bad things that are happening

1521
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,800
we just want something

1522
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,800
probably

1523
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,800
I totally agree

1524
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,800
that is a real thing that sucks

1525
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,800
I've had people tell me that I ruined anime

1526
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,800
for them because they started

1527
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,800
looking at it too critically and now

1528
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
maybe anime was never good guys

1529
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
and I'm just like well I don't know how you could

1530
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
reach like I don't know how I could bring you

1531
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,800
to that conclusion because I'm thinking about it more critically

1532
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,800
than you are and I still find shit to like

1533
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
all the time dude that's that's how I feel about

1534
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,800
I shit on one pieces little imperfections all the time

1535
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,800
but I always end with one piece is my

1536
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,800
favorite thing ever and people still

1537
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,800
take away that I'm like taken away their joy

1538
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,800
which I find perplexing

1539
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,800
but I uh yeah I mean it's the same

1540
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,800
same phenomenon I love

1541
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,800
Dragon Age but I also love all the

1542
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,800
videos at Bastion Dragon Age because so

1543
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
interesting to see like

1544
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
what sort of issues people have

1545
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,800
with Dragon Age and I can go

1546
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,800
hmm oh okay that's an interesting view

1547
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,800
I'm about to go very pretentious

1548
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
you know what it is it's that their love

1549
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,800
is shallow and not founded

1550
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,800
on critical thinking it's founded on shallow

1551
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,800
hype and so when we criticize

1552
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,800
from a deeper level perspective they

1553
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,800
have lost their argument they have nothing

1554
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,800
to fall back on because they haven't really thought about it

1555
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,800
until this point I think there's also a lot

1556
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,800
of identity tied up in it because nobody

1557
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,800
wants to have bad taste

1558
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,800
and like there's a lot of reasons to like

1559
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,800
something um you don't

1560
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,800
have to like every part of it like you

1561
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,800
should not expect to like absolutely

1562
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,800
everything about anything like maybe

1563
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,800
you like 99% of it there's only

1564
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,800
one thing that bothers you but it's still like

1565
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,800
worth addressing but there's some people

1566
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,800
who are like if you point out that it's

1567
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
flawed at all that it's like oh shit are you

1568
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,800
trying to tell me that my favorite thing isn't the

1569
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,800
best possible thing like I can't

1570
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
be wrong about this but it's like

1571
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,800
you have enough experience to know

1572
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
that there are other things other stories

1573
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
that are more complete

1574
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,800
that don't have these issues that this

1575
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,800
thing has and it's like look one piece

1576
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,800
is my favorite thing it has

1577
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,800
more good in it more things I care about

1578
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,800
in it than anything else but

1579
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,800
I have seen things that didn't fuck up

1580
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,800
the way this thing has you know let me tell you

1581
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,800
there was one perfect example of this I was

1582
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,800
talking to Pa Diaz Gord boys yesterday about

1583
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,800
this issue do like this is this is the

1584
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,800
perfect example okay so early on in one

1585
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,800
piece there's a thing called the log pose

1586
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,800
this is just how they got through the grand line

1587
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,800
okay cool it's a compass

1588
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,800
that guides you along towards the end

1589
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,800
okay but but but here's the thing

1590
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,800
here's the thing it when they get to the

1591
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,800
new world after like the halfway point of

1592
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
the time skip or whatever like Nami gets

1593
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,800
a new log pose that has

1594
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,800
like three nodes it's like it's like a it's an

1595
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,800
upgrade it's I believe it's

1596
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,800
only used one time to

1597
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
get them to punk hazard after

1598
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,800
they leave Fishman Island it's like the first

1599
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,800
place they go after the time skip basically

1600
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,800
okay the log pose like

1601
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,800
automate a big deal out of this log pose

1602
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,800
and like establishing this was he even goes

1603
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,800
on like a little spiel about in the narrative

1604
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,800
like this is how you will find your way further

1605
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,800
you know towards the end of the grand line

1606
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,800
in one piece but but though

1607
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,800
that log pose has not been

1608
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,800
used for the last like five

1609
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,800
arcs and they've been traveling through

1610
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,800
totally other means and basically

1611
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
it basically seems like the log pose

1612
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
yes it could come back to relevance later

1613
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
it basically seems like it's been totally

1614
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,800
abandoned because after that plot point

1615
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,800
Oda introduced a totally different

1616
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,800
like end point that doesn't involve

1617
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,800
the log pose basically at all with these

1618
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,800
road poneglas and now those

1619
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,800
are the true way to get to like

1620
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,800
Raftel or Laugh's tail and to like

1621
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,800
actually beat like he he

1622
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,800
pretty clearly he introduces this element

1623
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
at the beginning of like after the time skip as

1624
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,800
this is the new thing we're doing but then

1625
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,800
he totally has scrapped it later which to

1626
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,800
me just clearly reveals he did not

1627
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,800
actually have this plan all the way thought

1628
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,800
through and he just changed tax I don't

1629
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,800
see how any of this is

1630
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,800
necessarily a bad thing like you're

1631
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,800
saying that like the fact that he didn't

1632
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,800
plan certain things make sure like

1633
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,800
does it make you dislike one piece

1634
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,800
I mean I guess you could argue that this is the problem

1635
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,800
time wasted in the narrative

1636
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,800
emotional emotional investment

1637
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,800
you see the thing is the thing is

1638
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,800
I like this for the log pose

1639
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,800
the thing I like one of the things I love

1640
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,800
about one piece is that

1641
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,800
you know there's so many curveballs

1642
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,800
despite the fact that it's been going on so long

1643
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,800
and so many arcs are like

1644
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,800
on surface level seems similar

1645
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,800
but a lot of things happen in them that are just

1646
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,800
so like unexpected even though

1647
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,800
you know I mean you know

1648
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,800
what this reminds me of is the equivalent

1649
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,800
there's an equivalent to this there was a time

1650
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,800
when before the time skip the

1651
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,800
strats meet this guy Papagu he's a starfish

1652
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,800
he says I'm best friends

1653
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,800
with the mermaid princess after the

1654
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,800
time skip like because because

1655
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,800
Oda did not plan this after the time

1656
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,800
skip when they meet Papagu

1657
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,800
they're like hey didn't you say you were friends

1658
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,800
with the mermaid princess and the character says

1659
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,800
because now like the way that

1660
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,800
Oda writes the story it wouldn't make sense for him

1661
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,800
to have met the mermaid princess Papagu

1662
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,800
says oops I was lying

1663
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,800
before that is clear indication

1664
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,800
of Oda thinking

1665
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,800
on his feet having to change

1666
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,800
like what did this character canonically lie for

1667
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,800
no other reason other than

1668
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,800
to appear a little bit shady later

1669
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,800
no that's because that's not the guy's character

1670
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,800
in the context of his first

1671
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,800
appearance surely like he was

1672
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,800
always a bit of a showboating like

1673
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
like

1674
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,800
I'm not defending it

1675
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,800
but I'm like I'm criticizing

1676
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,800
your criticism you're saying it's absolutely

1677
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,800
like certified proof

1678
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,800
that Oda no I'm not saying that I'm saying

1679
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,800
it's very strong

1680
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,800
saying that there's room for it to not like

1681
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,800
Papagu is like

1682
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,800
he was kind of like that I mean it's kind of stupid

1683
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,800
but I don't think that in any way

1684
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,800
like lessens my

1685
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,800
appreciation of the thing it's just sort of

1686
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,800
look it just means it's a flaw

1687
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,800
it doesn't ruin one piece it's just

1688
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,800
clearly it's not a hundred percent confirmed

1689
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,800
but it's very likely just proof

1690
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,800
I mean to get the

1691
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,800
reason for the log pose thing

1692
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,800
the point of this all is that when you introduce

1693
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,800
a plot element that you expect to be capitalized

1694
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,800
on and the narrative sets you up like

1695
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,800
the log pose served great purpose through

1696
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,800
the beginning of one piece and absolutely

1697
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,800
fulfilled its function and I have no criticisms

1698
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,800
but when he goes all out of his way

1699
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,800
to introduce that it's going to be used in this way

1700
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,800
and then totally changes tech

1701
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,800
that's where it's like oh like I thought

1702
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,800
we were getting like maybe the new thing is

1703
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,800
even better but it's not crazy

1704
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,800
to be like oh you kind of dropped this

1705
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,800
other thing I guess that's too bad maybe

1706
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,800
it's for the best but like I just wish you

1707
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,800
hadn't bothered doing that before

1708
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,800
since you know it wasn't going to do

1709
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,800
anything what this reminds me of in

1710
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,800
another manga that I know all three of us have read

1711
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,800
is Bakuman

1712
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,800
so like

1713
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,800
in Bakuman which is like it's

1714
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,800
my favorite manga you know like so much

1715
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,800
good shit happens it's so

1716
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,800
interesting as a look into the industry

1717
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,800
especially into the magazine of Shonen

1718
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,800
Jump and like the mentality

1719
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,800
which with these stories

1720
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,800
of being written which you can also apply to

1721
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,800
the manga itself which is really interesting

1722
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,800
in a meta sense because like

1723
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,800
in Bakuman they're writing

1724
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,800
a story that is clearly

1725
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,800
based on death note which they had

1726
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,800
before real the same guys had written

1727
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,800
and like in the

1728
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,800
in Bakuman they're saying

1729
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,800
that they want to end the series

1730
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,800
when the rivalry ends

1731
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,800
like when one of the characters dies

1732
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,800
and like there's nothing more to the rivalry

1733
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,800
that's where the manga should end

1734
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
but they're already making

1735
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,800
an anime adaptation

1736
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,800
so the animators are like

1737
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,800
can you keep the manga running

1738
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,800
and in Bakuman

1739
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,800
they do not they cancel the manga

1740
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,800
so that it can have a real ending

1741
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,800
and

1742
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,800
and it ends up working out

1743
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,800
but that's not what happened with death note

1744
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,800
death note had

1745
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
continued on and everybody hates the later section

1746
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,800
so obviously they're trying to make

1747
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,800
like they're trying to explain

1748
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,800
why that happened

1749
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
and kind of make good on it in the next manga

1750
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,800
like you know we get to live the fantasy

1751
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,800
leave out the fantasy of what if we could have ended

1752
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,800
the story when we wanted to end it

1753
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,800
but the funny thing about it is that

1754
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,800
Bakuman also teaches us

1755
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,800
basically L did nothing wrong

1756
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,800
sorry I mean light did nothing wrong

1757
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,800
that Shonen Jump manga are designed to go on

1758
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,800
for as long as possible

1759
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,800
like they might have an ending

1760
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,800
in mind and certain ones

1761
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,800
are designed to be shorter

1762
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,800
but like one piece was designed

1763
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
for instance with the capacity

1764
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,800
to go for as long as Oda

1765
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,800
had continued to have ideas

1766
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,800
and inevitably

1767
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,800
if he keeps adding in new things

1768
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,800
like I'm sure he does have the ending planned

1769
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,800
and like the basic structure of the story planned

1770
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,800
but like you know he wants to add

1771
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,800
in new stuff and sometimes he adds in something

1772
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,800
and then going along just like

1773
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,800
oh this isn't as good of an idea

1774
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,800
and or like oh I had a better idea later

1775
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,800
of what this could have been

1776
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,800
let's just fucking let's just go

1777
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,800
with that instead you know

1778
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,800
you're totally right Digi and like

1779
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,800
such things are 100% inevitable

1780
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,800
I simply will not ignore

1781
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,800
no and the funny thing about it is that

1782
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,800
Akumon shows you how that's the case

1783
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,800
but it also has that flaw itself

1784
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,800
because they introduce this character

1785
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,800
relatively like

1786
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,800
later into the series because like

1787
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,800
most of the stuff that the main characters

1788
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,800
have had to deal with is like their personal growth

1789
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,800
in the early part of the manga

1790
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,800
then once they've like started to become successful

1791
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,800
they deal with the problem of having a shitty editor

1792
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,800
and that's like a whole arc

1793
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
it's like volumes of them dealing with this editor

1794
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,800
and then they reach the stage

1795
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,800
where they have to be competitive with other people

1796
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,800
who are other manga authors in the magazine

1797
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,800
everybody starting new series

1798
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,800
they all have to keep their stuff interesting

1799
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,800
they struggle with you know different kinds of things

1800
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,800
and then there's the part

1801
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,800
where they discover the serious comedy

1802
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,800
which is like their personal style that they're going to use

1803
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,800
to get popular which you can see in Death Note

1804
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,800
you know so it all ties in

1805
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,800
it's a good metatapestry

1806
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,800
but then like 14 volumes in

1807
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,800
they introduce a character

1808
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,800
who's like a weird

1809
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,800
mastermind character

1810
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,800
he's like this evil guy

1811
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,800
who's like hiring

1812
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,800
old manga authors to

1813
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,800
is this the guy who writes by committee?

1814
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,800
the guy who like

1815
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,800
yeah he

1816
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
it was the guy who was like trying to overthrow

1817
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,800
he was like trying to make it to number one by coming up

1818
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,800
with really crazy concepts and giving them to like

1819
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,800
old retired manga authors

1820
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,800
this is the guy who made up Panty Flash Fight

1821
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,800
right? yes

1822
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,800
he creates Panty Flash Fight

1823
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,800
and like because of

1824
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,800
Panty Flash Fight being so great

1825
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,800
and his introduction like

1826
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,800
his first arc is okay but it's kind of weird

1827
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,800
because he's a very different like he's not a realistic

1828
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,800
character you know

1829
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,800
like up to this point this is felt like a real story

1830
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,800
about what happens when you create manga for jump

1831
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,800
now we've got like a super villain

1832
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,800
and then they kind of

1833
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,800
beat him and the story

1834
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,800
continues along but then really

1835
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,800
weirdly like three or four volumes

1836
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,800
before the end of the manga because it's 20

1837
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,800
volumes long they reintroduce

1838
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,800
him and they start setting up for a

1839
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
second even more complicated

1840
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,800
arc where he has a really weird

1841
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,800
scheme that didn't really make sense

1842
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,800
the second arc

1843
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,800
he has like a team he hires like a whole team

1844
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,800
they write by committee

1845
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,800
basically but it was kind

1846
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,800
of unclear like what his goals were

1847
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,800
and like ultimately

1848
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,800
this arc just kind of

1849
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,800
it starts it's like setting up

1850
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
but then it's taking too long

1851
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,800
and it's clear at this point that like we're close enough

1852
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
to the end of bakuman's story

1853
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
that we do not need another arc

1854
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,800
like this manga could end

1855
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,800
it could wrap up soon and it would be satisfying

1856
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,800
um you know we're already well

1857
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,800
into the characters careers

1858
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,800
all that's really left is to finish off the like

1859
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,800
central romance and all that stuff

1860
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,800
like and get them the number one manga you know

1861
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
wrap up reverse side but like we've introduced

1862
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,800
this new villain arc and then it

1863
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,800
just kind of wraps

1864
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,800
and it's obviously because

1865
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,800
people saw this and went

1866
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,800
this isn't really that interesting you know

1867
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,800
and the authors kind of went uh yeah

1868
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,800
fuck it and like it ends really abruptly

1869
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,800
this arc like it's

1870
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,800
it still seems like it's in the setup phase

1871
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,800
and then all of a sudden they like wrap everything up

1872
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,800
and boot him from the story and then there's just like

1873
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,800
a volume and a half left before the story

1874
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,800
ends and I really think it was like

1875
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,800
you know they thought they could just keep it going

1876
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,800
but then they started this arc and it was kind of

1877
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,800
retarded so they just said uh

1878
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,800
fuck it let's move on I remember that character

1879
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,800
pretty well because he embodied

1880
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,800
like a um it was basically

1881
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,800
like this when he comes back from

1882
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,800
he's got this team that he hired to sort of like

1883
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,800
all like get together and make a think tank

1884
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,800
about what would be the perfect manga

1885
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,800
and like they kind of do it and it's kind of

1886
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,800
working but then that one older guy

1887
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,800
comes in and he like and he just

1888
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,800
like tells this like story he's had in his head

1889
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,800
for years and it's like his passion project

1890
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,800
and it beats them in the polls or something

1891
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,800
so I mean I'm sure they could have done more

1892
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800
with that arc but like I mean that arc

1893
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,800
that character that arc is there

1894
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,800
for a reason and like it does explore

1895
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,800
a theme I just remember like yeah

1896
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,800
I just remember it feeling weird

1897
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,800
that he came back that like they

1898
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,800
had thoroughly bested this guy

1899
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,800
and then like in the like such a late stage

1900
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,800
of the game when like we really are

1901
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,800
you know we're more focused on the main characters

1902
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,800
and like them wrapping up their arcs

1903
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,800
and then all of a sudden this shit comes out of nowhere

1904
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,800
and there's a ton of exposition like

1905
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,800
tons of explaining what this plan is

1906
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,800
and uh it was just

1907
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,800
kind of like this is like a diversion

1908
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,800
you know this is this is

1909
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,800
not as interesting as the main story

1910
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,800
and then it just kind of wraps up and then the story ends

1911
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,800
it's true that it's true that

1912
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,800
it's like a slight black mark on the series

1913
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
it's true those guys aren't as interesting

1914
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,800
that villain is not as interesting as like

1915
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,800
the main characters like personal

1916
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,800
struggle and whatever I think I think that's like

1917
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,800
okay I guess it's like

1918
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
the manga's attempt to sort of comment

1919
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,800
on like a trend in manga that maybe

1920
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,800
the the the authors

1921
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,800
don't really approve of like the like

1922
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,800
outsourcing your writing

1923
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,800
or writing by committee

1924
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,800
I think I think they're good ideas

1925
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,800
my like as time has gone

1926
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,800
I've become a little more annoyed

1927
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,800
by how much of how much

1928
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,800
Apologia Bakumon engages in

1929
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,800
for like the like

1930
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,800
you know just like the worst

1931
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,800
tendencies of the manga and like

1932
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,800
Japanese cultural markets in general

1933
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,800
like the way that it's it's sort of

1934
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,800
criticizes the whole idle

1935
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,800
thing and like oh isn't it

1936
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,800
wacky that they're not allowed to have boyfriends

1937
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,800
so people can imagine that they could

1938
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,800
date them one day it's it doesn't

1939
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,800
go hard enough into like weird shit like that

1940
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,800
I don't know it's a little too

1941
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,800
it's a little too willing to forgive the manga

1942
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,800
Anderson be like oh that's just the way

1943
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,800
it really also comment on

1944
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,800
like it doesn't really criticize the like

1945
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,800
absurd crunch that is the

1946
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,800
job you know like it's

1947
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,800
as it is

1948
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,800
but it's just well it's just like

1949
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,800
the people who work for jump it's like I mean you gotta

1950
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
be this kind of person like yeah I mean

1951
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,800
just consider like the people writing the story

1952
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,800
are people who chose this lifestyle it seems

1953
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
reasonable they would you know be pretty

1954
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,800
into it unless they like hate it but

1955
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,800
they're choosing to do it so I assume

1956
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,800
they find some value and definitely seen a bunch

1957
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,800
of criticisms of bakumon online from people

1958
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,800
who like work in the manga industry

1959
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,800
and just felt that like it didn't present

1960
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
it realistically enough like

1961
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
in terms of the the troubles

1962
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,800
of it and like even though

1963
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
the manga does go out of its

1964
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,800
way to have the characters encounter

1965
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,800
like lots of common problems that happen

1966
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,800
to people like through this just

1967
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,800
the necessity of the fact that they are

1968
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,800
it's a story about them becoming the number

1969
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,800
one you know so like

1970
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,800
ultimately things are gonna go

1971
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,800
yeah under like better than they normally

1972
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,800
would because most manga

1973
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,800
authors don't make it to know I have

1974
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,800
these characters are major critically

1975
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,800
create like they are the perfect mangaka

1976
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,800
I love bakumon

1977
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,800
I've long had a criticism is that the one

1978
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,800
greatest of the main character disgusts me

1979
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,800
it utterly repulsed me

1980
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,800
his obsession with the one girl

1981
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,800
like who even cares I'm not even interested

1982
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,800
in the

1983
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,800
it serves as a good motivation beyond that

1984
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,800
I never cared about the girl at all

1985
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,800
it would have been better if they just made her more of a character

1986
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,800
like she's just kind of a trophy

1987
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,800
yeah absolutely I wanted

1988
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,800
she had like an arc that'd be great

1989
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,800
her arc is non-existent

1990
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,800
I mean I guess it's her becoming a voice actor

1991
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,800
she's pretty much just a macguffin for like

1992
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,800
95% of it

1993
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,800
she does become a successful voice actress

1994
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,800
but like we barely focus on that at all

1995
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,800
she has a story just not like

1996
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,800
a character arc

1997
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,800
maybe that story is covered in girl jump

1998
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,800
I mean I don't read girl jump

1999
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
I would show it in jump because I'm a boy

2000
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,800
yeah her character doesn't really do that much

2001
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,800
but like I guess they used her

2002
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,800
as sort of a vehicle

2003
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,800
you know they comment on the whole idol thing

2004
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,800
which is like yeah okay that's I guess you wanted to

2005
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,800
talk about that

2006
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,800
it reminds me that I need to watch

2007
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,800
what's that anime you love so much didgy

2008
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,800
with the guys becoming animators

2009
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,800
and becoming a share of friends

2010
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,800
share of friends

2011
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,800
even I've seen share of friends

2012
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
I've been fucking around Ben

2013
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,800
I know

2014
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,800
I'm a little mad still about like the

2015
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,800
the one piece

2016
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,800
the thing with the Papaku

2017
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,800
I went a little hard there

2018
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,800
I have like a thing because it's like

2019
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
the ending of death note whether it continued

2020
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,800
the point where it should have ended

2021
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,800
that's like a flaw that I feel is a notable flaw

2022
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,800
and I could understand people getting upset

2023
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,800
about it and I could also understand people

2024
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,800
ignoring it but you know

2025
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,800
it's more understandable that people would be upset

2026
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,800
something like

2027
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,800
the whole like Papagu lied thing

2028
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,800
it's so insignificant

2029
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,800
Papagu lied people died

2030
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,800
it's like why would anyone devote

2031
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,800
memory to something like I've read the

2032
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,800
thing I remember him saying that when you

2033
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,800
say it but like it doesn't

2034
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,800
mean so much to like devote

2035
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,800
any memory to it

2036
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,800
it's Nate's autism is the problem

2037
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,800
it's like you can't

2038
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
some of us cannot erase

2039
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
this thing from our minds it's like

2040
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,800
just the knowledge that

2041
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,800
knowing Nate and

2042
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,800
knowing Ben because you guys are both really into

2043
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,800
stories being as robust as possible that

2044
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,800
like every question has an answer

2045
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,800
everything like makes

2046
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,800
sense in context and it's like

2047
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,800
it's not that you expect one piece

2048
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,800
to be perfect it's not that

2049
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,800
you would

2050
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,800
you would most like it to have been

2051
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,800
perfect but it's no big deal

2052
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,800
because in the end there's just so much

2053
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,800
in one piece that it's like it's not comparable

2054
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,800
to anything else it's like

2055
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,800
if that takes it down from like a

2056
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
100 to a

2057
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,800
999

2058
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,800
1000 to a 999

2059
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,800
the next show is at like a

2060
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,800
7000

2061
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,800
yes

2062
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,800
right like that's again

2063
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,800
like let's say that you're

2064
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,800
you're thinking of it as like a

2065
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,800
954

2066
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,800
and this takes it down to a

2067
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,800
943 you know again the next show

2068
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,800
is at like

2069
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,800
it's like you make a pie you make a pie

2070
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,800
and maybe you burn a little bit

2071
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,800
of the crime maybe like maybe that's got a lump

2072
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,800
in it or something but like you know it doesn't

2073
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,800
make it doesn't make it a bad pie

2074
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,800
it doesn't really even make it a worse pie it makes

2075
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,800
it a rustic pie

2076
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,800
you can see the author that's the author's finger

2077
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,800
that's the author's finger you run into a little

2078
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,800
you run into a little gristle in your steak

2079
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,800
you just pull that shit out of your mouth

2080
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
and put it on the side of the plate and you go

2081
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,800
man I wish I didn't have to look at this on the side of my plate

2082
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,800
but whatever you go remember that time

2083
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,800
that Oda introduced that one guy

2084
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,800
and he said this one thing and then like the next time

2085
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,800
he was like oh I was just lying about that haha

2086
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,800
what what a gas

2087
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,800
it was just it was just such a small

2088
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,800
moment I think it's just that I can't

2089
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,800
imagine defaulting like

2090
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,800
part of like I've only got so much

2091
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,800
memory I've only got so many gigabytes

2092
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,800
in my brain like I'd rather

2093
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,800
fill it with like joy

2094
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,800
than like anything like stupid

2095
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,800
well I mean sure surely

2096
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,800
you realize your memory shaming me right now

2097
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,800
surely you understand that this is unacceptable behavior

2098
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
I know I mean if anything I'm memory

2099
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,800
shaming me because I have less maybe

2100
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,800
and then you have so much

2101
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,800
you have like a big brain or something

2102
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,800
and you got all the one key

2103
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
flaws like take up like a thousand

2104
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,800
terabytes

2105
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,800
you know it's just it when I point out stuff like

2106
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,800
this I get your perspective give and we've long

2107
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,800
approached one piece at the very beginning

2108
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,800
of our show we approach it even from more

2109
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,800
kind of different perspectives you said that

2110
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,800
I think you said something like you didn't understand

2111
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,800
one piece had flaws or I'm not

2112
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,800
trying to say no I think I said it like

2113
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
I never like I just loved it so much

2114
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,800
that like I criticizing

2115
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,800
it was never even in my brain

2116
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,800
how much

2117
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
how many times have you read through one piece

2118
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,800
all the way

2119
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,800
I haven't read through it all the way

2120
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,800
I've I've watched the anime

2121
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,800
all the way to like episode like

2122
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,800
500 couple times

2123
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,800
good lord even I haven't read

2124
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,800
every single chapter going back I just go back

2125
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,800
and regularly read excerpts from there

2126
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,800
it seems like

2127
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,800
it seems like you are like always going back

2128
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,800
through shit so like

2129
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,800
discussion I pulled from like

2130
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,800
we went back yesterday arguing about

2131
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,800
like exactly what Raftel was arguing about

2132
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,800
Ponyglyphs I went and re-read like several

2133
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,800
chapters to do research for this

2134
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,800
ongoing live discussion that benefited

2135
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,800
me 0% just because

2136
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,800
I wanted to make sure I had the correct information

2137
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,800
like that's the way I can say I did go back

2138
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,800
set of kind of recently

2139
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,800
to reread Dressrosa which is like

2140
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,800
one of the longest and

2141
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,800
controversialist arcs

2142
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,800
because of the amount of stuff that gets

2143
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,800
shoved into it and it sort of makes it

2144
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,800
at the second half of it sort of ruins

2145
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,800
it gets ruined by the amount of

2146
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,800
like character climaxes

2147
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,800
that are supposed to be going on and nothing

2148
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,800
you know I wanted to make sure

2149
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,800
that like

2150
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,800
like hindsight we weren't like shitting on it too hard

2151
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,800
or anything do you do you stand by

2152
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,800
your general feelings before

2153
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,800
is it oh yeah I mean it's all stuff

2154
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,800
the first half of Dressrosa

2155
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,800
is really good though which is why

2156
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,800
I think I understand why people still

2157
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,800
like is they think of the first half of it

2158
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,800
and then there's plenty

2159
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,800
it's just sort of like there's three

2160
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,800
characters that have a back

2161
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,800
story that have a

2162
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,800
climax with the

2163
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,800
you know the final fight with everyone

2164
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,800
yeah and if you

2165
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,800
had only one of those it would be a perfect

2166
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,800
really good arc but because

2167
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,800
there's two or three then it's just like too much

2168
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,800
you know here's one

2169
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,800
of the problems is that we're selling with Skypia

2170
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,800
like everything perfectly in a

2171
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,800
writing sense swirled into the ringing

2172
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,800
of the bell like every character had attachment

2173
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,800
to the ringing of the bell

2174
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,800
and the defeat of Enru with Dressrosa

2175
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,800
for example it's like totally separate

2176
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,800
plots that vaguely tie into

2177
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,800
Doflamingo but like they're kind of just

2178
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
independent like Rebecca and Kyros

2179
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,800
their mom getting killed by

2180
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Diamante like sure that

2181
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
technically ties into Doflamingo but really

2182
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,800
that was a Diamante thing and so they fight

2183
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,800
him and get revenge on him wasn't

2184
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,800
really like Doflamingo personally

2185
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,800
like if it was like

2186
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,800
like you know

2187
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,800
if Doflamingo ruined this kingdom

2188
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,800
the story then it would be great

2189
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,800
if it was Doflamingo ruined Law's backstory

2190
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,800
without Dressrosa

2191
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,800
then it would be great but because it's both

2192
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,800
they neither character has

2193
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
a satisfying end at the end of that

2194
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,800
anyway

2195
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
let me just say my one final point

2196
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
on the one piece subject is just that like

2197
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,800
a lot of people you know I love one piece

2198
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,800
but you know people here we talk about it critically a lot

2199
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,800
because those are the main things that I focus on

2200
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,800
because I don't know maybe that's just how my brain is wired

2201
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,800
and interesting but

2202
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,800
it's just true that none of this

2203
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,800
moves the needle particularly far

2204
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
and when I bring up these little examples

2205
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
like Papagu that being a mistake

2206
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,800
like these are just examples that

2207
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,800
I mean I have a pretty good memory of one piece stuff

2208
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,800
generally speaking I don't remember everything

2209
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,800
it's just that I remember them but I don't

2210
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
it doesn't keep me like people

2211
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,800
disproportionately think they bother me or disproportionately

2212
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,800
make me think that one piece is way

2213
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800
worse than I actually think it is

2214
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,800
I think that you hate one piece

2215
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,800
because of Papagu but it's like

2216
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,800
I guess

2217
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,800
I question the motivation to

2218
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,800
devote memory to this

2219
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,800
like I don't think I have a choice

2220
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,800
if it builds up to such a level

2221
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,800
will you hate one piece more

2222
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,800
like if it's death by a thousand cuts

2223
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,800
if the flaws of one piece

2224
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,800
if the flaws of one piece piled up then absolutely

2225
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,800
yeah absolutely nothing is sacred

2226
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
small flaws like Papagu like happening

2227
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,800
like a lot

2228
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
would be not that bad

2229
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
but like a big flaw would be

2230
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,800
like if it ended badly

2231
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,800
then it would be bad but if there was

2232
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,800
a bunch of Papagu's

2233
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
there's fears that one piece will end badly

2234
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,800
and the things like the Papagu mistake

2235
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,800
what they really do is they reveal like

2236
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,800
oh that Papagu thing really reveals

2237
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,800
he did not 100% plan that arc

2238
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,800
that doesn't really matter to me

2239
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,800
I would still argue that it does not

2240
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,800
necessarily reveal that

2241
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,800
I mean okay

2242
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,800
I think it does

2243
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,800
I imagine the reason is because

2244
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
him knowing the princess

2245
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,800
got you hyped for meeting the princess

2246
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,800
thanks to Papagu or something

2247
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
I just didn't think- I didn't even really care about that

2248
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,800
well that's the thing if it didn't matter when it was set up

2249
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,800
then when it gets like

2250
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,800
the setup that you didn't care about

2251
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,800
didn't have a payoff

2252
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,800
or had a payoff that you didn't care about

2253
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,800
then what is the problem

2254
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,800
because what is the issue there

2255
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,800
is that it reveals Oda did not

2256
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,800
have a plan and it caused him to make a mistake

2257
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,800
in his narrative

2258
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
I can't

2259
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,800
whatever

2260
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
you can just say the good outweighs the bad

2261
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,800
so it doesn't matter to you

2262
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
I'm arguing that the bad that you're explaining is not bad

2263
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,800
it's not even a thing

2264
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,800
well then I guess we just disagree

2265
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,800
I've made my case

2266
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,800
die

2267
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,800
let me just go way back to the beginning of this

2268
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,800
because I've got one final point we can move on

2269
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,800
talking about anything else

2270
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,800
way back when we were talking about Zelda

2271
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
I just went like because I tweeted

2272
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,800
like hey guys tell me if Zelda is good or bad

2273
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,800
it was interesting to me for what most people said

2274
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,800
when I said guys is this game good

2275
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,800
most people said that like

2276
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,800
Nate you will like it

2277
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,800
without giving a lot of detail

2278
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,800
the people who gave more detail would say like

2279
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,800
it still plays fun if you like the old Zelda you like that

2280
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,800
but there was a very large contingent of people

2281
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,800
who were just saying like it looks great

2282
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,800
play it like it's fun

2283
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,800
these are very general non-specific terms

2284
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,800
and I don't blame anybody

2285
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,800
for not giving me the exact details

2286
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,800
that I would find most interesting

2287
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,800
I'm just asking random people on Twitter

2288
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,800
there's nothing wrong with that

2289
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,800
but it was Digi's video

2290
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,800
that gave me the kind of detail I wanted

2291
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,800
I mean Digi hadn't played a ton

2292
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,800
but just that one observation

2293
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,800
that like in the original

2294
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,800
everything's broken into square units

2295
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,800
and like as a result of that

2296
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,800
the village feels bigger

2297
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,800
that's how it was intended to be played

2298
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,800
and by radically changing how the game plays

2299
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,800
it totally changes how the game feels

2300
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,800
and these illusions we create

2301
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
for ourselves

2302
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,800
Digi's point I thought this was a brilliant point

2303
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,800
like it's way easier in the original

2304
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,800
to feel that this is an abstraction

2305
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,800
of a village that like in quote-unquote

2306
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,800
real life would be you know

2307
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,800
bigger have more to do etc etc

2308
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
but by making it like a playhouse

2309
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,800
that's the design sense they're going for

2310
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,800
like now it feels real

2311
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
but like oh this really is like an insubstantial

2312
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,800
village it really is that this isn't

2313
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,800
like a real village and that I

2314
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,800
I'm not as into that

2315
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,800
there's one thing that I had not

2316
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,800
observed when I made the video

2317
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,800
because I haven't actually played the game

2318
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,800
and it's an argument

2319
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,800
that I think can work to make the game

2320
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,800
interesting it's still very different from the original

2321
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,800
it still changes it fundamentally

2322
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,800
but the thing about Link's Awakening

2323
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,800
and I guess this is a spoiler

2324
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,800
but I don't care

2325
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,800
the whole game is a dream

2326
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,800
because Link

2327
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,800
it's the same Link from a Link to the Past

2328
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,800
he is knocked out

2329
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,800
during a storm

2330
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
and in both versions of the game

2331
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,800
the opening cutscene is an anime cinematic

2332
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,800
it's like

2333
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,800
in the original game you see him

2334
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,800
as like a full-bodied

2335
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,800
you know Link

2336
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,800
he looks like the Link from a Link to the Past

2337
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,800
if he was drawn as an anime character

2338
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,800
but like you know

2339
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,800
when you see the Game Boy graphics

2340
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,800
it's a very abstract representation of that character

2341
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,800
when you see it in

2342
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,800
Link's Awakening they still have the cutscene

2343
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,800
where he is drawn as like a fully formed

2344
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,800
man

2345
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,800
so like it's only in the dream world

2346
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,800
that he looks like a play set

2347
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,800
and you know there's the tinges

2348
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,800
on the edge of the screen where everything has that

2349
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,800
like blur effect

2350
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,800
so you could argue that even though it is

2351
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,800
literally meant to look like a play set

2352
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,800
it is a dream world

2353
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,800
and like

2354
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,800
in the real world Link is

2355
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,800
the Link from a Link to the Past

2356
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,800
he is still drawn as an adult man

2357
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,800
this is just what the world looks like

2358
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,800
inside his dream

2359
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,800
and so that's kind of good

2360
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,800
but it still changes everything

2361
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,800
yeah it's kind of good but it's like that wasn't the intention

2362
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,800
of the world in the Game Boy

2363
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,800
original

2364
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,800
no it was not portrayed that way

2365
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,800
it was more meant to just feel like a fever dream version

2366
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,800
of a Link to the Past

2367
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,800
it's meant to be a direct sequel

2368
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,800
I mean in the original

2369
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,800
I think it's more of a twist to realize

2370
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,800
that it's all a dream

2371
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,800
and you could argue that that's more valuable

2372
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,800
I think like generally you should

2373
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,800
err on the side of the original

2374
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,800
especially if it's a short game

2375
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,800
you play that first

2376
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,800
and then the new game will just be like

2377
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,800
oh quality of life improvements

2378
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,800
oh it looks nicer

2379
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,800
and then the original experiences is maintained

2380
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,800
because I'm in the position of

2381
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,800
I beat Link's Awakening

2382
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,800
years ago

2383
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,800
I'm in the perfect moment

2384
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,800
where

2385
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,800
I would rather play the new version

2386
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,800
with the new art style and the new controls

2387
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,800
just to

2388
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,800
if I'm going to play it again why not play this one

2389
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,800
but like if I was right now

2390
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,800
today in a situation where

2391
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,800
I had never played either one

2392
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,800
I would 100% recommend DX

2393
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,800
over the new game because the new game is $60

2394
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,800
and DX you can play for free

2395
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,800
and like it's great

2396
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,800
fucking game you will not be let down

2397
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,800
like we live streamed it

2398
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,800
for my last live stream in May

2399
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,800
was having the time of her fucking life playing that game

2400
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,800
which is like two hours of just like

2401
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,800
not even paying attention to what

2402
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,800
I was talking about in the chat

2403
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,800
just being like completely enthralled

2404
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,800
in this fucking Game Boy game because like

2405
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,800
it takes you back man

2406
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,800
those classic top-down Zeldas are great

2407
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,800
I played them all I fucking love them back in the day

2408
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,800
I love Zelda 1

2409
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,800
I love Link to the past

2410
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,800
it would probably be a fun game

2411
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,800
if it wasn't such a fucking pain in the ass

2412
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,800
but that one plays totally different

2413
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,800
Oracle of Seasons and Ages were like

2414
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,800
my favorite games growing up

2415
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,800
they were so fucking sick

2416
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,800
the Minish Cap is like one of my top

2417
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,800
yeah that too

2418
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,800
I fucking loved the shit out of

2419
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,800
I never had a Gamecube so I never played Wind Waker

2420
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,800
but I loved Phantom Hourglass

2421
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,800
I thought Phantom Hourglass was the shit

2422
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,800
oh yeah I had that as well

2423
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,800
I did not play that because of the fact that

2424
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,800
with the touch screen and it was just like

2425
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,800
let me tell you this lads

2426
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,800
you have a journal in that game and one of the things you have to do

2427
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,800
is in a certain dungeon

2428
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,800
it uses the two dual screen

2429
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
the DS was the best console ever made

2430
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,800
fuck every other console and one of the things you have to do

2431
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,800
is you have to stamp your thing

2432
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,800
you have to physically fucking close

2433
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,800
and open the fucking DS

2434
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
to stamp your journal

2435
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,800
I went Gadzooks for that shit

2436
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,800
you have to blow in the microphone

2437
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,800
to blow away sand

2438
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,800
you can't get that kind of quality

2439
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
with a fucking switch

2440
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,800
with a piece of shit PC

2441
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,800
what about the Wii U

2442
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,800
you can probably do it on the Wii U

2443
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,800
that's a decent comment

2444
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
you have to snap

2445
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,800
I'm gonna snap my switch in half

2446
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,800
as I'm emulating the fucking Phantom Hourglass

2447
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,800
on that fucking game

2448
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
you just have to buy a switch to light and tape them together

2449
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,800
that's their long game

2450
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,800
console gimmicks are great

2451
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,800
I know I've basically given up

2452
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,800
and become a switch man

2453
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,800
but it still makes me sad to think about the fact that I think the Wii U is better

2454
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,800
as an idea

2455
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,800
having the

2456
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,800
two screens

2457
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,800
two screens was a great idea

2458
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,800
on the DS and the 3DS

2459
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,800
and translating it to a console was a great idea

2460
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,800
I still really want to play zombie U

2461
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,800
it made Zelda the best it could possibly be

2462
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,800
is zombie U good?

2463
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,800
I have no idea

2464
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,800
it's such a fucking good cool idea

2465
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,800
of the Wii U

2466
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,800
the way zombie U works

2467
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,800
is that the game

2468
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,800
it's like a first person zombie apocalypse kind of game

2469
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,800
and you walk around

2470
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,800
you kill zombies and shit

2471
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,800
but the controller is your backpack

2472
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,800
and that's how you do all your item management stuff

2473
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,800
and there's no pause

2474
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,800
so every time you do your items

2475
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,800
you have to look down and not look at the zombies that are around you

2476
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,800
and fiddle with shit

2477
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,800
and you can get fucking impacted anytime

2478
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,800
bro fatal fucking frame

2479
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,800
in fatal frame 3

2480
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,800
gamepad as the camera

2481
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,800
so you hold it up to the screen

2482
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,800
and like take pictures of shit

2483
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,800
that's fascinating

2484
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,800
they should have made pokemon snap with it

2485
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,800
oh my god what were they thinking

2486
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,800
I've been screaming about that

2487
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,800
ever since the fucking Wii U came out

2488
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,800
how was there no fucking

2489
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,800
pokemon snap it was bullshit

2490
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,800
that's a big oof for me lads

2491
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,800
that's a big gomen aside from Nintendo

2492
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,800
if there ever was one

2493
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,800
I don't know if we'll ever get another pokemon snap

2494
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,800
the switch could still do it

2495
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,800
turn the switch around

2496
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,800
do they have a camera?

2497
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,800
I don't know

2498
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,800
you just hold it up and spin around

2499
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,800
oh yeah

2500
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,800
kinda works

2501
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,800
I have a video that will probably come up before this podcast

2502
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,800
it's about how they need to bring back pokemon puzzle challenge as well

2503
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,800
fuck yeah

2504
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,800
shit

2505
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,800
alright well that's enough about all this shit

2506
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,800
I forgot to mention

2507
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,800
something that happened to me this week

2508
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,800
was me getting trolled

2509
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,800
oh no

2510
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,800
is that that video

2511
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,800
oh yeah I saw that shit

2512
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,800
it's on twitch

2513
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,800
I clipped it

2514
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
the video is called

2515
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,800
ben saint gets epically trolled by ween CWC

2516
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,800
defenders

2517
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,800
and it was just a bizarre interaction I had

2518
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,800
I was on twitch doing my stream

2519
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,800
doing a draw stream for the nightstar comic

2520
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
and these kids

2521
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,800
start messaging me on discord

2522
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,800
and they assume they're kids

2523
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,800
and they're saying like

2524
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,800
hey I got some interesting stuff to tell you

2525
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,800
and I say in the stream

2526
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,800
like what are these guys doing

2527
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,800
these creepy messages

2528
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,800
and they give me a call and I decide to talk to them on stream

2529
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,800
and it turns out

2530
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,800
these are like three guys

2531
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,800
and this one autistic girl

2532
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,800
who later turns out is being blackmailed

2533
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,800
to go along with them

2534
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,800
she joins the rfck and she says

2535
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,800
these guys aren't my friends

2536
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,800
they're really blackmailing me

2537
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,800
threatening to dox me and stuff

2538
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,800
and these guys they get in

2539
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,800
they get in my call and I'm like

2540
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,800
hey guys what's up and they tell me

2541
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,800
you better stop talking to Chris

2542
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,800
she's our fucking mark

2543
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,800
they keep pretending

2544
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,800
they're her real friends

2545
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,800
and I'm muscling in on it

2546
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,800
but they're talking like they're mafiosos

2547
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,800
they have this weird affective importance

2548
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,800
they threaten me

2549
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,800
they say we'll be keeping an eye on you

2550
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,800
now that you're interacting with Chris

2551
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,800
they say don't touch the poop

2552
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,800
don't touch the poop

2553
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,800
they say chris is their friend

2554
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,800
but they're like don't touch the poop

2555
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,800
because like

2556
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,800
they keep misgendering chris

2557
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,800
and I'm like hey you guys should use

2558
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,800
the pronoun she asked for

2559
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,800
and they're like no me and him have an understanding

2560
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,800
these are like some

2561
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,800
nonsense

2562
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,800
they're obviously not chris's friends

2563
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,800
they're obviously some shitty trolls

2564
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,800
they fucking and then after the call

2565
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,800
they keep messaging me they're like threatening me

2566
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,800
to dox me

2567
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,800
they went into rfck

2568
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,800
and like literally doxed me

2569
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,800
but like nobody cared and

2570
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,800
that's like the weirdest place to dox me in

2571
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,800
who would do anything

2572
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,800
so they do that

2573
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,800
and I don't know

2574
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,800
it was fucking bizarre

2575
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,800
I don't know what's going on with these dudes

2576
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,800
you're tapping into some primal forces

2577
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,800
some realms

2578
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,800
I don't understand I suppose

2579
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,800
I mean this is a big league

2580
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,800
lol cow chris

2581
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,800
yeah I guess so

2582
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,800
it was so strange listening to them

2583
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,800
cause there was parts where

2584
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,800
they were implying like

2585
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,800
don't hurt our friend

2586
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,800
but also like if you do

2587
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,800
you may as well make it entertaining for us

2588
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,800
they were not on

2589
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,800
one person was like hey don't be mean to chris

2590
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,800
the other was straight up like make it entertaining

2591
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,800
you need to make this entertaining for us

2592
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,800
they were not

2593
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,800
you better

2594
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,800
like deliver

2595
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,800
with that comic cause there's a lot of more people

2596
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,800
watching it now

2597
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,800
things like that it was just really funny

2598
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,800
it was funny

2599
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,800
yeah we'll be in touch

2600
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,800
we'll all be watching you

2601
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,800
I believe this is anonymous and they do not forgive

2602
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,800
and they do not forgive

2603
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,800
they claim to be from kiwi farms

2604
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,800
I saw a couple people talking about

2605
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,800
the incident on kiwi farms

2606
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,800
the overwhelming response was

2607
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,800
yeah these guys are embarrassing

2608
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,800
it was just bemusement

2609
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,800
it doesn't strike me there's a lot of solidarity

2610
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,800
among the kiwi farms

2611
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,800
like any one of these

2612
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,800
troll people who extends above

2613
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,800
who raises their head above the crowd

2614
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,800
just knowing the kiwi farms a little bit

2615
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,800
I expect them to be struck down

2616
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,800
what makes you so special sir

2617
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,800
if you actually cared about kiwi farms

2618
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,800
for whatever reason

2619
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,800
yeah I know but if you were a troll

2620
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,800
and you're like I'm on behalf of kiwi farms

2621
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,800
I will strike a blow against the enemy

2622
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,800
you wouldn't show up and be like

2623
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,800
hey so I'm here on behalf of kiwi farms

2624
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,800
to say fuck you

2625
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,800
yeah

2626
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,800
did you have a kiwi farms thread about you

2627
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,800
no

2628
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,800
probably will soon at this point

2629
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,800
I'm lately because of the nightstar comic

2630
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,800
I've been brought up a bit

2631
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,800
in the Chris Chan thread

2632
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,800
and there is like an old super thread

2633
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,800
there are tons who talk about Chris online

2634
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,800
which I am like my video is mentioned in

2635
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,800
but I don't have like a

2636
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,800
a thread about me

2637
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,800
I think like a lot of the PCP

2638
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,800
shit talk it's just rolled into my thread

2639
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,800
I think so

2640
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,800
probably because I have a big ass thread

2641
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,800
think of the PCP as Digi Bro's podcast

2642
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,800
about anime exclusively

2643
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,800
if you're on the outside looking in

2644
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,800
that's probably how it looks

2645
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,800
I don't think anybody is under the illusion

2646
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,800
that this is a podcast about anime at this point

2647
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,800
maybe people who have like never

2648
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,800
or just heard about it for the first time

2649
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,800
and are like oh a podcast

2650
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,800
that Digi Bro's on

2651
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,800
the less information you know

2652
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,800
the more likely you are to think it's Digi Bro's podcast about anime

2653
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,800
I mean the thing is I don't really promote

2654
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,800
the PCP anymore so like whatever

2655
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,800
growth it has is from people

2656
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,800
if new people are coming

2657
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,800
from me they would have to really

2658
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,800
like get into like the discord

2659
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,800
and like find out

2660
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,800
about you guys before they were gonna know

2661
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,800
the podcast and like I do have people in there

2662
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,800
who are like oh yeah I've listened to PCP

2663
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,800
but I've never even like watched any of

2664
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,800
certain people's videos

2665
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,800
usually there's one or two people they have though

2666
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,800
it'll be like oh I'm a huge fan

2667
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,800
of you and give and take and I don't watch

2668
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,800
nobody else in that motherfucking thing

2669
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,800
and I'm tired of hearing Ben's fucking ass

2670
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,800
and talking about politics

2671
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,800
and then

2672
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,800
classic line

2673
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,800
and like I think that there's

2674
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,800
I think like there's two general camps

2675
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,800
like I do think that

2676
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,800
still to this day a bulk of PCP

2677
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,800
fans

2678
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,800
were at the very least have been

2679
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,800
my fans at some point

2680
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,800
like you know like

2681
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,800
whether they necessarily came from me or not

2682
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,800
like I think there's not

2683
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,800
a ton of people who are like huge PCP fans

2684
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,800
who don't like Digi Bro shit at all

2685
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,800
I mean there is a contingent of people who have been around

2686
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,800
since the pony days

2687
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,800
but I also think that like

2688
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,800
there's certain like there's a lot

2689
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,800
of people who are much more into

2690
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,800
endless war than they are into

2691
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,800
you know my shit or anybody else

2692
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,800
the endless war subgroup

2693
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,800
is like a weird it's

2694
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,800
they squeeze took the PCP

2695
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,800
fan base squeezed it and a little

2696
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,800
like tumor protrusion like squeezed

2697
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,800
out to the side and that's

2698
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,800
the endless war people

2699
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,800
it's a double edged sword in a way because

2700
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,800
the double edged of the the endless war

2701
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,800
people are probably like the most engaged

2702
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,800
with the PCP because of the fact that

2703
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
several of us are in it

2704
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,800
and they come to the meetups and stuff like that

2705
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,800
and like often times again a lot

2706
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,800
of them are also fans of all of our content

2707
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,800
anyways because they found endless war through

2708
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,800
the PCP so it's like

2709
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,800
they're endless war fans and PCP fans

2710
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,800
cool those people are very supportive

2711
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,800
and they give us a lot of money and stuff like that

2712
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,800
but like I mean it also

2713
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,800
does make the podcast harder to penetrate

2714
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,800
for if we did want new people

2715
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,800
so it's like it's

2716
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,800
like the favorite thing of people who are

2717
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,800
deep lore but if you were to

2718
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,800
go listen like I've often said

2719
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,800
if you were to just like put on a random

2720
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,800
PCP episode from recent times

2721
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,800
it really depends on what the topics happen

2722
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,800
to be like this episode probably fairly

2723
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,800
accessible but like if you

2724
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,800
didn't know who any of us are you've never heard of

2725
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,800
endless war you literally have no idea what we're talking

2726
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,800
about right now you know that's right and

2727
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,800
like there's definitely episodes that start off

2728
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,800
with like the one where you guys talked

2729
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,800
about the meetup in

2730
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,800
London I think yeah

2731
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,800
there was one about that

2732
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,800
it would have been totally incomprehensible

2733
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,800
to anybody who didn't have like at least a modicum

2734
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,800
of knowledge how hardcore you have to be

2735
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,800
make like a playlist of like

2736
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,800
the basic bitch ones

2737
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,800
like a scoville rating

2738
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,800
I've got good news

2739
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,800
for everyone because what could be more

2740
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,800
accessible than a simple five dollar pledge

2741
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,800
to join the PCP

2742
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,800
Minecraft heads and our new

2743
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,800
faction that will absolutely dethrone the

2744
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,800
RFCK fuck boys

2745
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,800
if that happens because I'm also

2746
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,800
definitely not going to play Minecraft

2747
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,800
so like

2748
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,800
that would just be another sphere where I would

2749
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,800
just be like oh Nate and Maj are talking

2750
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,800
about Minecraft shit now

2751
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,800
Munchie and Ben are talking about ready fuckers cop

2752
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,800
killers Nate and Maj are talking about

2753
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,800
Minecraft

2754
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,800
Tom Gibber talking about their comics

2755
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,800
you guys are talking about potty cast

2756
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,800
and I'm just talking about my

2757
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,800
latest research into the world of autism

2758
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,800
and that's all I've got

2759
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,800
seems pretty good

2760
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,800
it's kind of a cool mix I kind of like it

2761
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,800
it's like you guys want to hear my latest research

2762
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,800
into the world of autism yeah man

2763
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,800
lay it on I've come up okay

2764
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,800
I've come up with an autism rating scale

2765
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,800
right

2766
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,800
there are seven

2767
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,800
seven different levels of autism

2768
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,800
present on the internet

2769
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,800
and I can categorize them by the kind

2770
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,800
of stuff that they like

2771
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,800
I'm planning to make a video where I'm going to do

2772
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,800
just anime like like an anime

2773
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,800
autism chart like how autistic is

2774
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,800
this anime

2775
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,800
and like grade everything

2776
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,800
so there's basically

2777
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,800
how autistic you are comes down to how obsessed

2778
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,800
you are with things on like

2779
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,800
a systemic level

2780
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,800
like how

2781
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,800
how much like detail and complication

2782
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,800
you either

2783
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,800
require there to be for you to enjoy something

2784
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,800
or that you yourself read into

2785
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,800
the things you enjoy

2786
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,800
and there's different sliding scales

2787
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,800
like different shows of different intelligence

2788
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,800
levels which contributes to people's

2789
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,800
ability to enjoy them and generally

2790
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,800
you can enjoy

2791
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,800
like if you're a level one autistic you can

2792
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,800
probably enjoy things going down to level

2793
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,800
three autism but any more

2794
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,800
autistic than that and it becomes harder for you to

2795
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,800
enjoy I see

2796
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,800
but there are some people who are like autistic

2797
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,800
authors who can project like they can

2798
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,800
make stories that are less autistic than

2799
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,800
themselves so for instance

2800
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,800
Quentin Tarantino probably a level

2801
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,800
three or four autistic but he makes

2802
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,800
level two autism works

2803
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,800
so Quentin Tarantino movies level

2804
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,800
two autism generally

2805
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,800
even the general public can appreciate

2806
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,800
something as low as level two autism

2807
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,800
that's like not so autistic

2808
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,800
as to be for voting

2809
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,800
to the average general population

2810
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,800
is everything on the autistic spectrum

2811
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,800
or is there non-autistic

2812
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,800
work

2813
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,800
there is non-autistic work all

2814
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,800
anime is at least level one autism

2815
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,800
there is no way to watch anime

2816
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,800
with no autism

2817
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,800
to get a sense of scale is somebody like

2818
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,800
Ulillia like a seven

2819
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,800
he is a six

2820
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,800
on this scale

2821
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,800
the new story teller

2822
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,800
is a seven

2823
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,800
so the way the scale goes

2824
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,800
is basically like this level one autism

2825
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,800
is basically where

2826
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,800
the reason that you're

2827
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,800
into anime

2828
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,800
Dragon Ball Z is a level one autism show

2829
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,800
because the autistic elements

2830
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,800
of it are like the power levels

2831
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,800
and the fact that it's like a super long

2832
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,800
form narrative with a large cast

2833
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,800
so like there's things to keep

2834
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,800
track of but

2835
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,800
if you are like really into keeping track

2836
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,800
of things you'll quickly realize that

2837
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,800
there's tons of plot holes and ass

2838
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,800
poles and retcons and just

2839
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,800
the story doesn't seem to care enough about itself

2840
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,800
so if you're like autistic enough to

2841
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,800
really care about that shit or intelligent

2842
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,800
enough because those are also like

2843
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,800
elements of the intelligence and construction

2844
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,800
I'm planning to make a chart for like

2845
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,800
basically each show will have an autism

2846
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,800
level and intelligence level

2847
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,800
um

2848
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,800
whether it appeals to masculine or feminine

2849
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,800
where do these charts

2850
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,800
where do these charts appear on the scale

2851
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,800
the good question the charts themselves they gotta

2852
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,800
be pretty high on it

2853
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,800
the charts themselves are like level three

2854
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,800
to borderline on level four autism

2855
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,800
which is where I sit

2856
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,800
I'm like a little bit more than level three

2857
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,800
but like going down

2858
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,800
to level four which is the Evangelion tier

2859
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,800
is level three autism

2860
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,800
and so basically depending on what tier you're on

2861
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,800
it is most likely that

2862
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,800
the things that are on that tier

2863
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,800
will be your absolute favorite things

2864
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,800
like even if you find flaws

2865
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,800
in them because they are like perfectly

2866
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,800
on your autism wavelength

2867
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,800
it's like this is my favorite thing

2868
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,800
you know so for instance

2869
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,800
something that I would put in between level one

2870
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,800
and level two autism is

2871
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,800
one piece

2872
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,800
one piece gets more into level two

2873
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,800
because of the sheer amount of shit that there is

2874
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,800
to keep track of if you're keeping track of all of it

2875
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,800
you don't have to keep track of all of it to enjoy

2876
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,800
the show so it can appeal to more normie

2877
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,800
taste as well but

2878
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,800
people like Nate who I would consider to be

2879
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,800
a level two autism

2880
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,800
are into it for the level two autism

2881
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,800
reasons I as a level three autism

2882
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,800
am into stuff like Eva

2883
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,800
that has more of a meta

2884
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,800
more into the meta outside of the work itself

2885
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,800
like the involvement

2886
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,800
of it's place in history

2887
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,800
the people who created it

2888
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,800
comment on itself as a work

2889
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,800
you know stuff like

2890
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,800
Homestuck level three autism

2891
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,800
and like even if you are

2892
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,800
level two you could

2893
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,800
a level three autism thing might be your favorite thing

2894
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,800
if it's just so good

2895
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,800
and like you're like yeah I might not be

2896
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,800
quite autistic enough to love everything about this

2897
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,800
but it's so fucking good

2898
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,800
I have a question then

2899
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,800
cause like I'm super

2900
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,800
into Homestuck in every aspect

2901
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,800
like I'm a big Homestuck autism

2902
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,800
but like I can also

2903
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,800
look over the things that Nate can't

2904
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,800
look over in one piece which is less

2905
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,800
how's that work

2906
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,800
I think that

2907
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,800
the different people have different

2908
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,800
priorities in what they think makes

2909
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,800
the story good or bad I think that

2910
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,800
like the level two autism

2911
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,800
I consider to be okay so here's

2912
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,800
there's interesting things that happen as we go down

2913
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,800
the autistic spectrum because

2914
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,800
on the one hand the lower you go

2915
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,800
the more like broad and ridiculous

2916
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,800
the systems of the story

2917
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,800
become but also

2918
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,800
you care less and less about it being

2919
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,800
good like in air quotes

2920
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,800
like people at like

2921
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,800
level one and two

2922
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,800
probably care the most about everything

2923
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,800
like being functional

2924
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,800
like they want

2925
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,800
to be believable in the end

2926
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,800
like you know like JoJo's

2927
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,800
Bizarre Adventure is a perfect example of a show

2928
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,800
that like people enjoy because

2929
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,800
it seems logical

2930
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,800
even if everything happening is bad

2931
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,800
no it's not at all and it's totally

2932
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,800
riddled with mistakes

2933
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,800
so I would put that at like level

2934
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,800
1.5 autism

2935
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,800
like it's got tons of shit for you

2936
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,800
to sink your teeth into if you like the deeper stuff

2937
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,800
but it doesn't do quite

2938
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,800
a good enough job to satisfy

2939
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,800
a level two autism who wants everything to be

2940
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,800
like dotted every i, cross every t

2941
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,800
but when you get to level 3

2942
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,800
it's where you kind of enjoy the chaos

2943
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,800
more than the order

2944
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,800
it's like you don't even care as much

2945
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,800
about it answering all of its questions

2946
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,800
if it has just as much to say as possible

2947
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,800
like Evan Gellion

2948
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,800
certainly doesn't answer every single

2949
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,800
question it raises

2950
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,800
but like it just has so much

2951
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,800
shit in it you know there's so much to take in

2952
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,800
and there's so much meta

2953
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,800
layering to it there's so much to like

2954
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,800
enjoy after the fact that it adds to it

2955
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,800
for you know the level 3

2956
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,800
autism but when you get to level 4

2957
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,800
that's when you get to like mega franchises

2958
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,800
and where there's like just huge

2959
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,800
databases like Gundam perhaps

2960
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,800
like fate

2961
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,800
like the fate franchise

2962
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,800
like where you have to consume all this

2963
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,800
any like deep lore of a major

2964
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,800
franchise like Star Wars lore

2965
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,800
Star Trek lore like if you're reading

2966
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,800
the tie-in novels and shit that is level

2967
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,800
4 autism

2968
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,800
if you're playing like more

2969
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,800
mainstream visual novels

2970
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,800
that's around here

2971
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,800
but then you get to level 5 autism

2972
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,800
and this is where you get to like the more

2973
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,800
obscure visual novels the people

2974
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,800
who are just consuming like

2975
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,800
everything because they categorically need

2976
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,800
to have seen everything

2977
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,800
sounds like you with anime

2978
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,800
well there's I also

2979
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,800
want to clarify that there's a difference

2980
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,800
if you do things as a stunt or in order

2981
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,800
to talk about it because like

2982
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,800
I will watch shows that I

2983
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,800
not necessarily going to enjoy because it has

2984
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,800
a like career benefit to me

2985
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,800
so like there's some kind of

2986
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,800
there's some kind of pride tangled up

2987
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,800
in that but like there are

2988
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,800
shows that are

2989
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,800
just like too dense for me to fucking

2990
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,800
wrap my head around have you ever heard of horizon on the middle of nowhere

2991
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,800
don't think so

2992
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,800
horizon on the middle of nowhere is the most

2993
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,800
like over the top with like

2994
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,800
having just dozens and dozens of

2995
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,800
characters who all belong to different factions

2996
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,800
who all have different races and powers

2997
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,800
and like different fucking magic

2998
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,800
systems and like it's so

2999
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,800
fucking dense and complex that there's like

3000
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,800
it's a light novel that's like

3001
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,800
600 pages in the first

3002
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,800
book it has a huge index

3003
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,800
just to keep track of what the fuck is going on

3004
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,800
I tried to watch the anime couldn't comprehend it

3005
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,800
so that's what I consider level 5 autism

3006
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,800
level 6 autism something

3007
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,800
happens we cross the

3008
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,800
warning

3009
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,800
we're losing functionality

3010
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,800
we're losing functionality

3011
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,800
so

3012
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,800
when we get to level 6

3013
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,800
then

3014
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,800
there's two different directions that level 6

3015
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,800
autism will take things either

3016
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,800
they're very strident

3017
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,800
about staying within the canon

3018
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,800
and therefore they have

3019
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,800
found an unimaginable depth

3020
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,800
in every element of the canon

3021
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,800
this is where we get the people who are upset about them

3022
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,800
putting like taking sonic's gloves away

3023
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,800
like because

3024
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,800
they've put they've ascribed a ton of meaning to sonic's gloves

3025
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,800
because they're obsessed with sonic and like

3026
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,800
every part of the canon matters

3027
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,800
sonic

3028
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,800
by the way sonic meta is level 6 autism

3029
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,800
tifa's tips are

3030
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,800
3 centimeters too small in the remake

3031
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,800
and I will not stand for this this is unacceptable

3032
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,800
her bra should not be

3033
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,800
exposed okay alright got it

3034
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,800
but then there's the other route

3035
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,800
that they might take which is

3036
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,800
if they don't care about the existing canon

3037
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,800
they're going to pump as much

3038
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,800
of their own shit into the canon

3039
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,800
as humanly possible

3040
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,800
so this is where we get like the extreme fanfic writing

3041
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,800
and like I would say fanfics in general

3042
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,800
start at level 4 autism

3043
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,800
like if you're even

3044
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,800
writing a fanfic at all

3045
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,800
that's pretty autistic

3046
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,800
some people who are maybe

3047
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,800
a little bit less autistic are doing it

3048
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,800
just as a way to like test their writing skills

3049
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,800
you know respectable but like

3050
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,800
if you're taking it seriously as like something that has

3051
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,800
like its own involved canon

3052
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,800
level 4

3053
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,800
if you're at level 6 it means

3054
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,800
that you are somebody who is

3055
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:08,800
maintaining like a wiki of my little pony

3056
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,800
youtubers like

3057
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,800
that's level 6 autism it's like

3058
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,800
an obsession of level

3059
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,800
a level of obsession with the meta of everything

3060
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,800
that goes beyond it being good at all

3061
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,800
like it doesn't have to be good you just have to be

3062
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,800
obsessed with it

3063
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,800
and you'll find depth and complexity

3064
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,800
in it

3065
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,800
like Chris Chan and

3066
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,800
Ululila and

3067
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,800
I wish I had a sound board right now so I could play

3068
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,800
and this is what it means to go even further

3069
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,800
beyond

3070
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,800
and then level 7

3071
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,800
is where we get to

3072
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,800
like just functional

3073
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,800
enough to use the internet and that's where I put

3074
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,800
like the new storyteller where he like

3075
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,800
clearly he's not participating

3076
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,800
in social media he's not like

3077
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,800
he might like read his own comments on youtube

3078
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,800
but he posts like 7 videos a day

3079
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,800
clearly lives in his parents basement

3080
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,800
and he plays with Thomas the Tank Engine toys

3081
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,800
like that is the that's as autistic

3082
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,800
as you can get before you're not really

3083
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,800
consuming media anymore you are not

3084
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,800
functioning highly enough for that so like

3085
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,800
it could be that autism continues past

3086
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,800
level 7 I don't know how far it goes but

3087
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,800
like any further than that and I can't

3088
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,800
ascribe a show to it you know

3089
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,800
sure okay so that's my 7

3090
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,800
layers of autism and then the other scales

3091
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,800
that you have to grade on it's like so each show

3092
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,800
will have an autism rating and then

3093
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,800
an intelligence level rating

3094
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,800
and so like people who are intelligent

3095
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,800
across the board might

3096
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,800
enjoy things from different categories

3097
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,800
and I'll also make side

3098
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,800
notes about things like Astro Boy or like the

3099
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,800
works of Osama Tezuka I think Tezuka

3100
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,800
was himself a level 5

3101
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,800
autistic but all of his work is like level

3102
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,800
2 or 3 autism you know

3103
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,800
although he has some obscure works that go

3104
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,800
truly into the depths he has some stuff

3105
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,800
that's more autistic than I think even he is

3106
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,800
just because he was curious about it you know

3107
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,800
because he wrote like a thousand

3108
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,800
manga he wrote lots of shit

3109
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,800
on the side

3110
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,800
but yeah so that's the intelligence

3111
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,800
category you might like

3112
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,800
the reason that normies who are really

3113
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,800
smart can enjoy Tarantino movies

3114
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,800
is like they're not as attracted

3115
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,800
to just the meta element like level

3116
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,800
2 autists they just like the movies because

3117
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,800
they're out of order and it gives you a lot of shit to keep track

3118
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,800
of you know yeah like

3119
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,800
normies who are smart are just like oh

3120
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,800
intelligent writing good characterization

3121
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,800
you know but like they're not as

3122
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,800
interested in it as like fetishistically

3123
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,800
as like a autist

3124
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,800
is you know so then we've got

3125
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,800
the masculine versus feminine

3126
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,800
rating because this makes a difference as well like

3127
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,800
just how masculine

3128
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,800
or feminine you you conceive yourself to be

3129
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,800
like what you enjoy out of works

3130
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,800
you know if you

3131
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,800
are more of a dude bro you're gonna like

3132
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:48,800
more dude bro kind of shows and I did not expect

3133
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,800
a Z axis to be added to this

3134
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,800
oh there's another axis because there's gonna be

3135
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,800
two different charts

3136
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,800
one is the autism versus intelligence

3137
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,800
so like there'll be

3138
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,800
one chart of like the autism level and intelligence level

3139
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,800
and then another chart of the

3140
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,800
male versus female

3141
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,800
as well as

3142
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,800
masculine feminine

3143
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,800
to be politically correct

3144
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,800
I fall

3145
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,800
you know like barely into the masculine

3146
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,800
side I would say like lots of really feminine stuff

3147
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,800
you know but there's also

3148
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,800
the

3149
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,800
the emotional

3150
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,800
thinker versus

3151
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,800
what was the word I wanted to use

3152
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,800
pragmatic

3153
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,800
that's a good word yeah pragmatic

3154
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,800
thinker because there are

3155
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,800
a lot of shows are beloved because

3156
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,800
of the fact that they just have lots of information

3157
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,800
in them and like I think

3158
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,800
of Ben as maybe somebody

3159
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,800
who likes a lot of the pragmatism

3160
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,800
and shows a lot of like oh they set up this

3161
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,800
really interesting rule system you know and

3162
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,800
like and it says it

3163
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,800
it's built out of like realistic

3164
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,800
concepts and stuff like that like

3165
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,800
um I think of something

3166
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,800
like that no game no life scene

3167
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,800
where he removes columns force from the universe

3168
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,800
appeals to like the pragmatic

3169
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,800
thinker who's like oh wow science

3170
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,800
used in storytelling cool you know

3171
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,800
whereas like emotional

3172
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,800
good idea even though the execution doesn't make

3173
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,800
any fucking right

3174
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,800
yeah and uh and maybe you're too pragmatic

3175
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,800
for it maybe it's like a little too emotional

3176
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,800
or something but like

3177
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,800
emotional thinkers are people who more

3178
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,800
like don't really care about the logic of it

3179
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,800
as much as you know whatever it makes them

3180
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,800
feel so like that would be the other axis

3181
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,800
I'm gonna I think I could apply

3182
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,800
this to every anime I know of I think

3183
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,800
I could make a reasonable deduction

3184
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,800
of how autistic is it if anybody wants

3185
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,800
if you have any questions any anime

3186
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,800
you want me to put through the test I could

3187
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,800
give you my quadrants

3188
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,800
of what I think it falls into does anybody have

3189
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,800
a suggestion

3190
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,800
well I'm just on that last

3191
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,800
I haven't seen double-decker

3192
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,800
I'm comparing two series that are I think pretty smart

3193
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,800
but like Technolize is probably

3194
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,800
extremely emotionally based and then

3195
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,800
versus like Ghost in the Shell extremely

3196
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,800
like intellectual brain based

3197
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,800
yeah you know I would say that

3198
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,800
Technolize is definitely

3199
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,800
more emotional but like

3200
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,800
it does have a lot of interesting

3201
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,800
it has a lot of like weird sci-fi

3202
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,800
concepts that come out later in the show

3203
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,800
so like you'd have to have some interest in

3204
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,800
sci-fi to like get the most out of it and like

3205
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,800
but yeah I would definitely

3206
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,800
say it's more of like a feeling

3207
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,800
kind of show it's more of

3208
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,800
driven by that for sure

3209
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,800
you know what's a good example of this

3210
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,800
fucking Space Patrol Luluko

3211
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,800
that's like pure emotion like no logic

3212
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,800
Luluko I would put on like level 3

3213
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,800
autism because it's so

3214
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,800
so much of it is obsessed with the meta of itself

3215
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:34,800
of its own existence you know that like

3216
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:36,800
incorporates elements from all the other trigger shows

3217
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,800
and it's like none of that shit even means anything

3218
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,800
to you unless you've seen all these fucking shows

3219
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,800
so you know it's

3220
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,800
it's fairly autistic but

3221
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,800
it's also like definitely way

3222
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,800
more emotional thinker than logical thinker

3223
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,800
because none of it really makes any sense or tries to answer

3224
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,800
its own questions it's just pure over the top

3225
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,800
you know teen

3226
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,800
angst and emotions are what

3227
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,800
controls the story you know

3228
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,800
so like emotional thinking

3229
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,800
probably right in the like

3230
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,800
on the line between masculine and feminine I think

3231
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,800
it tries to appeal to both

3232
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,800
yeah I agree in equal measure

3233
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,800
and intelligence level

3234
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,800
I would say is like

3235
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,800
just above average not like

3236
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,800
high but you know like

3237
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,800
yeah it plays around with some

3238
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,800
concepts and it moves really fast

3239
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,800
so it doesn't try to like hold your hand

3240
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,800
and walk you through everything but like

3241
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,800
yeah so that's my rating level 3

3242
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,800
autism slightly above

3243
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,800
average intelligence

3244
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,800
right in the middle between masculine and feminine

3245
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,800
and

3246
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,800
what was the other paradigm I had

3247
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,800
emotionally like yeah much more emotional

3248
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,800
than rational

3249
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,800
or what the fuck was that

3250
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:44,800
pragmatic yes

3251
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,800
psychopaths I would say is like

3252
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,800
psychopaths isn't very

3253
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,800
autistic at all actually it's

3254
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,800
pretty straightforward you know

3255
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,800
like well another

3256
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,800
thing I put at like level like 1.5

3257
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,800
to 2 is like shows that

3258
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,800
play around with

3259
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,800
like real world theming stuff like

3260
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,800
Star Trek where like it has application

3261
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,800
to real life because that's meta in a

3262
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,800
sense like if that's what you care about

3263
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,800
about it which I think people who like

3264
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,800
psychopaths would appreciate that

3265
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,800
you know like there's not a ton

3266
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,800
to keep track of the complications in the story

3267
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,800
but it does make a lot of like literary references

3268
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,800
it does like

3269
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:22,800
you know reference other movies

3270
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,800
and you know sort of

3271
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,800
expound on the

3272
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,800
conversation through media about the future

3273
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,800
so like in that sense I would say it's like level 2 autism

3274
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,800
a series that has

3275
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,800
tons of references should definitely

3276
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,800
like that should inch up the autism

3277
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,800
like significantly and like maybe the

3278
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,800
intelligence a bit but like it's just a

3279
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,800
reference that doesn't do anything that smart

3280
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,800
can you give me an example of a level 0

3281
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,800
autistic work

3282
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,800
um ooh

3283
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,800
a marvel movie

3284
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,800
any marvel any like

3285
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,800
disney marvel movie those are

3286
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:56,800
crunchy lore and those have like lots

3287
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,800
of references to an extended canon though

3288
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,800
they okay maybe iron man one

3289
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,800
I would say that those movies

3290
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,800
they can appeal to both

3291
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,800
like they're made to market to both

3292
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,800
oh uh yeah

3293
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,800
I was just reminded by May writing it down

3294
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,800
sports is a

3295
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,800
depending on your level of engagement

3296
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,800
I mean if you're into

3297
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,800
like a fucking saver metrics and stuff

3298
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,800
if you get into like

3299
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,800
fantasy football that's like

3300
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,800
at least level 2 or 3 autism

3301
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,800
yeah I feel like this this

3302
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,800
chart is not like where would you put

3303
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,800
the thing but like

3304
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,800
for the people who are in these brackets

3305
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,800
what could you recommend to them

3306
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,800
level 0 autism is

3307
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,800
the article in the mag the article

3308
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,800
in the magazine that you see in the grocery

3309
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,800
store saying that you know

3310
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,800
brad and fucking angelina

3311
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,800
are back together again

3312
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,800
well if I present

3313
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,800
this whole thing something I want to

3314
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,800
clarify is like people

3315
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,800
anywhere on the spectrum can enjoy stuff

3316
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,800
that I would categorize as anywhere on the

3317
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,800
spectrum depending on how they engage with

3318
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,800
it so like for instance may was

3319
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,800
telling like telling me about warrior

3320
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,800
cats right and like the warrior cats

3321
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,800
books are meant to just be

3322
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,800
like children's books they're

3323
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,800
kind of autistic you know like

3324
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,800
they have a lot of factions and like

3325
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,800
relationships and stuff to keep track of

3326
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,800
a lot of characters but like generally

3327
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,800
they're kids books you know

3328
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,800
but there was a heavy online

3329
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:22,800
community for warrior cats and like

3330
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,800
a lot of them like it because they're

3331
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,800
furries or just into like animal

3332
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,800
project projecting themselves on the animal

3333
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,800
characters or they're like

3334
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,800
really intent on keeping track of all

3335
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,800
the factions and like creating

3336
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,800
you know diagrams creating their own

3337
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,800
fan content and animations and fan

3338
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,800
fictions making up their own OCs and like

3339
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,800
the more of that you get into the more

3340
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,800
autistic it becomes the more it's like

3341
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,800
you're trying to take this

3342
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,800
story and make it more complex

3343
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,800
make it have more to offer

3344
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,800
because you like the aesthetic

3345
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,800
elements of it or maybe you just haven't

3346
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,800
seen stuff that would appeal to your level

3347
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,800
of autism like maybe there's something

3348
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,800
that if you knew about it

3349
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,800
you wouldn't have to you know

3350
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,800
obsess over warrior cats but you're 13

3351
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,800
and it's you know it's

3352
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,800
put in front of you so that's just what

3353
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,800
you apply your autism to. So there's a

3354
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:12,800
distinction to be made obviously between any

3355
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,800
individual consumer and the work itself

3356
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,800
to be on totally different pages. Exactly

3357
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,800
but I do think that there's

3358
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,800
a like I think there's a limit to

3359
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,800
how far out of somebody's autism

3360
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,800
range they'll generally tend towards

3361
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,800
and like what

3362
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,800
made me think about this whole chart

3363
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,800
like my placement of everything had to do

3364
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,800
with the fact that I think

3365
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,800
I'm in a position

3366
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,800
where I'm like in the middle ground on almost

3367
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,800
all of these statistics like by

3368
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,800
being like level three autism

3369
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,800
I can appreciate level one shit

3370
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,800
I can appreciate level five shit

3371
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,800
it has to get to level six

3372
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,800
it has to get to the level of like appreciating

3373
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,800
bad sonic games because you

3374
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,800
can't tell the difference that's where it's like

3375
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,800
too autistic for me you know

3376
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:56,800
that's pretty far gone most

3377
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,800
people aren't that autistic so like

3378
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,800
I'm in a good acceptable range to talk about a lot

3379
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,800
of different shit and appreciate it you know

3380
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,800
and being like

3381
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,800
the hardest thing for me to

3382
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,800
appreciate is just really dumb shit you know

3383
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,800
regardless of its autism level if it's not

3384
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,800
intelligently constructed that's the hardest

3385
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:14,800
thing for me to pass you know

3386
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,800
but like anything else I'm like right in the middle

3387
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,800
of pragmatic and emotional I'm right in the middle

3388
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,800
of masculine feminine I can appreciate

3389
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,800
stuff all over the spectrum

3390
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,800
and you know I

3391
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:26,800
from that vantage

3392
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:28,800
point it's like I can look at absolutely everything

3393
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,800
and I can say okay

3394
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,800
I've seen all this type of show and like

3395
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,800
only these types like the same guys who

3396
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,800
like JoJo also like

3397
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,800
all this other shit that's like the same amount

3398
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,800
of autistic you know

3399
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,800
except for guys who like it for

3400
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,800
really autistic reasons you know

3401
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,800
so

3402
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:48,800
that's kind of how I base my ranking

3403
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,800
anyway

3404
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,800
this will all have possibly

3405
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:54,800
already been explained in a video I have no idea

3406
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,800
but now I just wanted you guys to be

3407
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,800
in on it because I thought you'd all be interested

3408
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,800
I think you'll all you would all be

3409
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,800
like looking at stuff

3410
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,800
and asking yourself like how autistic is this

3411
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,800
I've been doing it constantly like

3412
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,800
watching YouTube channels and be like

3413
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,800
how autistic is this creator

3414
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,800
because like some of them

3415
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,800
like there's this guy I don't do not mean

3416
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,800
for this to sound like a call out but

3417
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,800
I've been watching shit loads

3418
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:20,800
of like gaming reviews and documentaries

3419
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,800
and like retrospectives

3420
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,800
just tons of game shit

3421
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,800
and I stumbled upon this guy called

3422
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,800
Ant Dude and

3423
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,800
he's like he's

3424
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:32,800
fairly well spoken he does like

3425
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,800
in-depth breakdowns of games

3426
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,800
that are pretty

3427
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,800
you know he addresses most of the stuff

3428
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,800
in the game it's fairly in-depth

3429
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,800
and enjoyable

3430
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,800
his sense of humor is like

3431
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,800
pretty much borrowed from like Egoraptor

3432
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,800
and John Tron but not like

3433
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,800
nearly as impactful as them

3434
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,800
he's not like super funny

3435
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,800
but like his super in-depth

3436
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:56,800
reviews are of like Kirby and Yoshi

3437
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,800
games

3438
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,800
and I'm like that's kind of hella autistic

3439
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,800
you know

3440
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,800
almost everything on his channel is covering

3441
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,800
some kind of mascot platformer

3442
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,800
and it's like he's really positive

3443
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,800
about these games for the most part

3444
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,800
he can recognize their flaws

3445
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,800
but he doesn't hold them against the games that much

3446
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,800
he's like really positive about these games

3447
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,800
and I look at it and I think like this is what happens

3448
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,800
if you're like really intelligent

3449
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,800
but like level 4 autism

3450
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,800
you know not to like try to

3451
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,800
diagnose this guy or anything I don't even know

3452
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:28,800
if he's autistic I just find his taste

3453
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,800
to be like what I would consider to be

3454
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,800
in that realm you know

3455
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,800
where it's like yeah I just want to look at like

3456
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,800
cutesy fun stuff

3457
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:38,800
and like I get enough depth out of analyzing it

3458
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,800
that it doesn't have to

3459
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,800
actually be that deep

3460
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:44,800
you know

3461
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,800
whereas something that's like absurdly deep is like

3462
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:48,800
a dwarf fortress or something

3463
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,800
that's like the appeal is that it's

3464
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,800
super deep

3465
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:54,800
and you don't have to read anything

3466
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:56,800
into it because it's completely

3467
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,800
all there

3468
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,800
that would definitely be like

3469
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,800
level 3 bordering level 4

3470
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,800
autism level is like the games like that

3471
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,800
yeah

3472
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,800
oh my god do any of you watch the channel called

3473
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,800
Seth to Zenrec

3474
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,800
I know that guy I've seen some of his stuff

3475
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,800
people like him a lot I've been getting into him

3476
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,800
he's very demolition de-esque

3477
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:18,800
but even more of like an edgy meme lord

3478
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,800
but he plays like Ben

3479
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,800
you gotta watch this channel just because

3480
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,800
he plays every fucking

3481
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:26,800
one of these like super robust games

3482
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,800
like what's his name

3483
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,800
Seth to Zenrec

3484
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,800
Seth with two S's

3485
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,800
if you just type Seth with two S's you'll probably get the channel

3486
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,800
oh Seth scene

3487
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,800
yeah something like that

3488
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,800
yeah

3489
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,800
he has like an African warlord as his avatar

3490
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:44,800
like he always like shows that on screen

3491
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,800
if it's like him talking

3492
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,800
it's very weird aesthetically

3493
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:50,800
but he plays like all the super robust games

3494
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:52,800
and he goes into all the systems and like

3495
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,800
why they are so deep

3496
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,800
and what kind of crazy shit can you do

3497
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,800
in these games

3498
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,800
is it like video essays?

3499
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,800
I think this is the guy who made

3500
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,800
the Heroes of Might Magic 3

3501
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:06,800
review that people kept comparing me to

3502
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,800
because it came out at the same time

3503
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,800
he's done all of the Heroes of Might Magic games

3504
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,800
I think

3505
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,800
but he's covered all kinds of stuff

3506
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:16,800
like a lot of classic RPGs

3507
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,800
and a lot of like sandbox games

3508
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,800
and like usually the main focus of the video

3509
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,800
is just showing you how crazy of things

3510
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,800
can happen with the systems in this game

3511
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,800
you know or like

3512
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,800
how broken the game could be

3513
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,800
like sometimes he'll play games that he's like

3514
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,800
this game's not even good but because of the weirdness

3515
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,800
of the mechanics and how broken it is

3516
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,800
you can play it in like really entertaining ways

3517
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,800
or mod it to be entertaining in ways

3518
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,800
you know so

3519
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,800
I'm just impressed by the level of depth he plays

3520
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:44,800
the games to before he talks about them

3521
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,800
which no other critic fucking does

3522
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,800
nobody even touches stuff like Dwarf Fortress

3523
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,800
so it's really cool that he's doing it

3524
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,800
with fucking need

3525
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,800
alright he's a good man

3526
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:56,800
preemptively so

3527
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,800
you know what I'm not subscribed to

3528
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:00,800
no I think I am I don't know whatever

3529
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,800
for some reason like there is like a wall

3530
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,800
I'm like intimidated to get really into his videos

3531
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,800
I mean I fucking binge them all the day

3532
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,800
pretty much he doesn't have

3533
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:10,800
like even though his channel

3534
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:12,800
goes back farther than like the type

3535
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,800
of videos he does now

3536
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,800
like initially he was doing more like meme videos

3537
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,800
it wasn't quite like serious reviews

3538
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,800
over time he'd like somehow

3539
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,800
became a reviewer but sometimes

3540
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,800
the memers can grow

3541
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,800
into the best serious people

3542
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:28,800
because they get those memes in there too

3543
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,800
and they just hit the sweet spot

3544
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:32,800
I don't know what this guy does because I haven't watched him but

3545
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,800
that's what it seems to be the case

3546
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,800
do you want to move on to voicemails?

3547
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:38,800
I think we should

3548
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:40,800
before we go on to voicemails

3549
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,800
I wanted to say one thing quickly

3550
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,800
I solved a minor inconvenience

3551
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,800
of mine that has been plaguing me for years

3552
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:50,800
and I wanted to share it with everyone

3553
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,800
on the off chance that you might have had

3554
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,800
the exact same problem

3555
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,800
and have been subconsciously looking for a solution

3556
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,800
one of the veins of my existence

3557
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,800
of just using computers

3558
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:04,800
is having tabs

3559
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,800
open of

3560
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:08,800
sites I frequently use

3561
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,800
and living in constant fear of my browser crashing

3562
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,800
or my computer

3563
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,800
updating or turning it off and losing all those tabs

3564
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,800
that drives me

3565
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,800
insane

3566
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:20,800
so my

3567
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,800
system before this is that you can pin

3568
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,800
tabs and chrome and shit

3569
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:26,800
so you can right click on a tab and pin it

3570
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:28,800
and it'll stay nested in the corner

3571
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,800
so you can have an army of all your frequently

3572
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:32,800
used sites

3573
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,800
so that's the old

3574
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,800
system I had but the problem with that

3575
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,800
is that that was originally something from

3576
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:40,800
Max and the max version works great

3577
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,800
every time you open the browser it automatically loads

3578
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,800
all your tabs that you have pinned

3579
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:46,800
and if you are in a pinned tab

3580
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,800
and you go to another site it actually automatically opens

3581
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,800
a new tab and keeps your pinned tab there

3582
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,800
which is great no other

3583
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,800
fucking browser works like that

3584
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,800
so the features basically use this on anything that's not a

3585
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,800
Mac but

3586
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,800
earlier this week I discovered

3587
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:02,800
a feature of chrome

3588
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,800
that has solved this problem

3589
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,800
completely and has no longer made me

3590
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,800
worried about my browser tabs

3591
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,800
or losing like or having access to sites that I use all the time

3592
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,800
and it's if you're on a website

3593
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:14,800
any website as far as I can tell

3594
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,800
and you click the menu

3595
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:18,800
you go to more tools and do create

3596
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,800
shortcut it'll pop up and it's like

3597
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:22,800
oh create a shortcut

3598
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,800
then you can check off open as window

3599
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,800
and when you hit create

3600
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,800
it takes that tab and just makes it a web app

3601
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,800
like it's in its own container

3602
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,800
it's pulled out of the

3603
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:34,800
out of the browser

3604
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:36,800
and it's just you can pin it to your

3605
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,800
taskbar and open it just like a regular application

3606
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:40,800
and so you no longer have to

3607
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,800
worry about your tabs anymore

3608
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,800
they just work just like regular apps

3609
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:46,800
like I have patreon

3610
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,800
youtube and twitter all in my

3611
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,800
taskbar along with like all my graphic design

3612
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,800
apps and blender and game dev engines

3613
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,800
and every time I want to use them you just click it

3614
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,800
and it just opens up its own dedicated window

3615
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,800
it doesn't open it up in your browser it just

3616
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:00,800
runs its own self

3617
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,800
contained version of itself

3618
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,800
like a native application

3619
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,800
and it's the best fucking shit

3620
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:08,800
of all time

3621
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,800
okay let me just let me play devil's advocate for a moment

3622
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,800
here I see the one downside of this being

3623
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:14,800
that like now that you're you've got this open

3624
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,800
is dedicated like I've got the I just did this with

3625
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,800
youtube just now but like

3626
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,800
now I've lost the ability to like

3627
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,800
on the top menu go to another website

3628
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:24,800
while I have this open because it's dedicated to

3629
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,800
like just youtube is this is this

3630
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,800
correct am I missing anything

3631
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,800
no that's it's it's it's it's designed

3632
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:32,800
to run like a application

3633
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:34,800
okay it just runs it in a container

3634
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,800
that works like an application

3635
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:38,800
sick the the the benefit

3636
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,800
is that again like

3637
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,800
you don't have to worry about your browser crashing

3638
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,800
your computer updating all these things going away

3639
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:46,800
because they're always in your taskbar like anything else

3640
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,800
and it's changed my life

3641
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,800
and I'm gonna try it

3642
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,800
if you're level 3

3643
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,800
computer autistic like I am this is a godsend

3644
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,800
so

3645
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:58,800
check check it out

3646
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,800
let's try it out and let us know

3647
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,800
in the comments if this is making a positive

3648
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:04,800
difference in your life I'm curious how many people

3649
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,800
want to use this

3650
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,800
I have

3651
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:10,800
I have something I want to say before we go

3652
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,800
into voicemails I just want to do a quick update

3653
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,800
on the Vapors to Kickstarter

3654
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,800
which is that we have smashed all the

3655
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,800
stretch goals

3656
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,800
and at this moment of recording we're just shy

3657
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,800
of eight thousand dollars

3658
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:24,800
and the next stretch goal is ten thousand at which point

3659
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:26,800
pins for

3660
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,800
all everybody who is credible

3661
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,800
if we hit ten thousand dollars everyone

3662
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,800
who has already pledged at fifteen

3663
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,800
or higher will just get a free pin

3664
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,800
a new pin a third pin it's my heart

3665
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:38,800
st logo black on silver gonna make those

3666
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,800
just give them to everybody

3667
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,800
fuck it how much time is left in the campaign

3668
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:44,800
when you're listening to this there will be one

3669
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,800
week left to donate

3670
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:48,800
there's usually that bump at the very end as people

3671
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,800
realize they gotta get it in so this seems

3672
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,800
achievable this seems pretty doable I think

3673
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,800
so I'm optimistic anyway

3674
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:56,800
kickstarter.com slash project slash

3675
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,800
bensane slash papers to link in the description

3676
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,800
is the stretch goal that everybody gets

3677
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,800
a free pin yes everybody

3678
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:04,800
who has wanted to donate

3679
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:06,800
so I can get a free pin everybody

3680
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:08,800
was for a physical reward at least

3681
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,800
if you donated fifteen dollars

3682
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,800
say for just the book

3683
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:14,800
and then the

3684
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:16,800
well already you will receive one dollar

3685
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,800
in your package because

3686
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,800
we hit the stretch goal that everybody gets a dollar

3687
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:22,800
because communism

3688
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,800
and then if we hit ten thousand dollars then

3689
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,800
you poor

3690
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,800
who merely ordered a book before

3691
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,800
will then receive the book

3692
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,800
the dollar and the

3693
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:34,800
pin just for having contributed

3694
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,800
to the cause what is the pin gonna be

3695
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:38,800
it's the my heart logo

3696
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,800
Ben shouldn't you demand

3697
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,800
I want the infinite chest pin

3698
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,800
well you gotta pay you gotta get that one on

3699
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,800
its own level that's like 45 bucks

3700
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:48,800
for that one I think no for infinite chest pin

3701
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,800
that's the first pin twenty five twenty

3702
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:52,800
twenty five would get you the book and

3703
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,800
the infinite chest pin

3704
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,800
I paid the amount where I got both comics

3705
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,800
just both comics

3706
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,800
I got both comics

3707
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,800
and the infinite chest pin

3708
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:04,800
45 was the lowest I could do

3709
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:06,800
to get the books and the pins

3710
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,800
if you just got the book okay well let me

3711
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,800
hold on let me look at the rewards

3712
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,800
twenty five would get you

3713
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:14,800
either both books or a book and a pin

3714
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:16,800
if you wanted to get both books

3715
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:18,800
and the pin you'd have to do thirty five

3716
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:20,800
that's how it is

3717
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,800
I didn't want to pay an extra ten dollars

3718
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,800
because I don't put pins on anything

3719
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:26,800
I just wanted because of the meme of infinite chest

3720
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,800
I had a row of pins here

3721
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,800
that bring me such joy every day

3722
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,800
including my poobah pin and my rad come three

3723
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:34,800
I still have my poobah pin

3724
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,800
it's on my laptop bag

3725
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:38,800
this Kickstarter is at least a level

3726
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:40,800
two and a half autism based on

3727
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:42,800
the amount of highly

3728
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,800
specific reward tiers and combinations

3729
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,800
of things one might

3730
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,800
pay very specific amounts of money to achieve

3731
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,800
I would generally categorize

3732
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,800
both you and Nate into

3733
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,800
level two autism

3734
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:56,800
but I definitely think that

3735
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,800
that's probably a bit higher than me I guess

3736
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,800
I think you both like a lot of stuff

3737
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,800
that's outside of your category

3738
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:04,800
just based on how good it is

3739
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,800
like I said

3740
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,800
really good stuff can transcend

3741
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,800
its categorization more easily amongst

3742
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:12,800
intelligent people just because you're like wow

3743
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,800
this thing might be really autistic

3744
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,800
but it's really interesting

3745
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,800
and you might even enjoy ironically some things

3746
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:20,800
like Ulila's book obviously that's like

3747
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,800
a level six autism book

3748
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,800
but it's fun to read

3749
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,800
it's fun

3750
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:28,800
conceptually

3751
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,800
I feel like my autism

3752
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,800
must spike when I read

3753
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,800
something like that because that is not a good

3754
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:36,800
book it is not fun to read

3755
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,800
and yet somehow

3756
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,800
I can maintain

3757
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,800
I can keep myself erect through the entire

3758
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:44,800
process of reading it somehow I can

3759
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:46,800
maintain enough interest that I could get

3760
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,800
through it like multiple times

3761
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,800
it's even though it's not even there

3762
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:52,800
we move on to voicemail yes

3763
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,800
yes indeed let's do that

3764
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:56,800
okay I've got them pulled up right here

3765
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,800
okay let me see here we go

3766
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,800
okay so everybody of course leave us voicemails

3767
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,800
we love them people speakpipe.com

3768
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,800
there's a link in the description just go click on that

3769
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,800
give us voicemails their quality

3770
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,800
perhaps you'll be as as as

3771
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,800
lucky enough has skilled enough to get into

3772
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:12,800
the PCP voice grail

3773
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:14,800
or perhaps you'll be degenerate lowly

3774
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:16,800
to be locked away forever in the PCP

3775
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,800
jail the voice jail

3776
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,800
so it's a real gamble be careful

3777
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:22,800
before you submit how many

3778
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:24,800
how many voicemails we got

3779
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:26,800
I think 10 I think an even 10

3780
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:28,800
okay there's one

3781
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,800

3783
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:34,800

3800
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:08,800
and becoming part of the PCP can

3801
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,800
indeed I can't believe

3802
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:12,800

02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,800
could be a little dangerous you know

3821
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:50,800
we really can't have him saying

3822
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:52,800
those things he says

3823
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:54,800
and you know Nate I can't guarantee

3824
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,800
anything but joining the disney

3825
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,800
family could get you in on

3826
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,800
well you know

3827
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,800
something you're really

3828
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:04,800
you know whoop that's all for now

3829
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,800
I gotta go take Pluto for a walk in the

3830
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,800
dead of night

3831
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,800
getting touched once you've you know

3832
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:12,800
done something about Ben sainte

3833
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,800
um yeah I knew he'd have it

3834
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:20,800
out for me

3835
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:22,800
disney money and no more Ben sainte

3836
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,800
this sounds like a win-win to me

3837
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,800
yeah I gotta agree where's the downside I ask

3838
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,800
where's the downside

3839
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:30,800
well it's been fun

3840
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:32,800
alright as Charlie mickey mouse

3841
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:34,800
and his cohorts live as opposed to communist hell

3842
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,800
in capitalist heaven and that's where I

3843
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,800
aspire to be eventually

3844
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:40,800
absolutely

3845
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:42,800
they have a direct line to capitalist god

3846
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:44,800
and they're definitely under the

3847
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,800
under the

3848
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,800
under the purview of you know emperor matthew

3849
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:50,800
is from final fantasy 2 with his administrative

3850
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:52,800
powers operating this whole thing

3851
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,800
you know like clockwork

3852
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:56,800
um okay let's go to the next one

3853
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,800
uh this is uh

3854
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,800
grailers and jailers

3855
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,800
okay uh get to it

3856
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:04,800
I gotta say I'm really

3857
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,800
tired of this jail

3858
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:08,800
grail shenanigans

3859
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,800
I gotta say

3860
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,800
it's cool people have been

3861
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:14,800
submitting more quality

3862
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,800
voicemails but this shit is

3863
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:18,800
insane it doesn't matter

3864
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,800
it's up to the PCP man

3865
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,800
it doesn't

3866
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,800
matter if you send in

3867
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,800
six quality voicemails

3868
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:28,800
in a row and they all get played and everyone

3869
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:30,800
laughs it doesn't matter

3870
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,800
you guys need to do something epic

3871
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,800
you can't

3872
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,800
pander and make all these

3873
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:38,800
retarded ironic

3874
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,800
memes like you got

3875
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,800
put in the grail and then

3876
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:44,800
you immediately dropped your spot

3877
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:46,800
retarded

3878
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:48,800
stupid

3879
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:50,800
gay

3880
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,800
okay I think we're all thinking we

3881
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:54,800
I'm sure we're all thinking the same thing

3882
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,800
voice grail I think voice jail

3883
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:58,800
voice jail

3884
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,800
well okay we'll obviously

3885
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:02,800
we'll have to cut them in half and put half of them in one

3886
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,800
and half in the other

3887
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,800
we're opening voice limbo

3888
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:08,800
for people who are just like

3889
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,800
yeah it's just a big shrug room

3890
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,800
where people shrug

3891
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,800
does everybody get in voice limbo then is that

3892
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,800
yes or just

3893
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,800
voice limbo doesn't have a good rhyming scheme

3894
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:20,800
to it like grail, mail

3895
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,800
and jail we gotta come up with a better name

3896
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,800
I mean I agreed with him he was just very boring to listen to

3897
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,800
I'd call that a big voice fail

3898
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,800
if you ask me

3899
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,800
100% agree

3900
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:32,800
he doesn't even deserve to be on paper

3901
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:34,800
how dare you speak

3902
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:36,800
against our system okay next up

3903
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:38,800
you were speaking against

3904
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:40,800
the system like the people calling

3905
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:42,800
in try to

3906
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:44,800
like joke their way into the voice

3907
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,800
grail but they're not doing it right

3908
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:48,800
that's true those are the real criminals

3909
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:50,800
those are the real criminals and I won't have

3910
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:52,800
any of it

3911
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,800
next up we've got

3912
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:56,800
from or says dictator Nate

3913
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,800
presumably it's two dictator Nate that being me

3914
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:00,800
okay let's let's hear it

3915
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:02,800
go

3916
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,800
calling out

3917
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:06,800
Nate Massman

3918
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:08,800
Ben Heads

3919
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,800
it is time to rise up

3920
02:17:10,800 --> 02:17:12,800
Nate has suppressed

3921
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,800
is he under the bed?

3922
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:16,800
he has not played them

3923
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:18,800
I tried to make them funny

3924
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:20,800
I tried to have a good meme

3925
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,800
make it so maybe they would laugh

3926
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:24,800
is he just speaking through a toilet roll

3927
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:26,800
it's suppressed

3928
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:28,800
it's not helping your odds

3929
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:30,800
it is time to rise

3930
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:32,800
low quality low energy

3931
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:34,800
that was low energy

3932
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:36,800
see this guy is like

3933
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:38,800
oh all my yang voicemails were so quality

3934
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:40,800
were they equally as quality as this voicemail

3935
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:42,800
and you wonder why they weren't playing

3936
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:44,800
sounds like it's playing from the other

3937
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:46,800
side of the wall

3938
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:48,800
I think he's literally just like cupping his hands

3939
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:50,800
cupping his hands over his mouth

3940
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,800
sounds like it

3941
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:54,800
as a sort of makeshift voice filter

3942
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,800
listen I'm an equal opportunity

3943
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:58,800
there are people who are like yeah fuck

3944
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:00,800
Ben man I'm on Nate's side

3945
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:02,800
and I don't play them either cause they're not funny

3946
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:04,800
cause they're lame just make it good

3947
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,800
and it'll get played I don't care what it is

3948
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:08,800
except when Nate wants to talk about how the voicemail

3949
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,800
suck and then he will play anything

3950
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:12,800
like he just did

3951
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,800
cause it's really funny

3952
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,800
okay fair fair

3953
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:18,800

3957
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:26,800
presumably okay go

3958
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:28,800

4001
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:08,800
it is me

4002
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,800
elu gay samurai

4003
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:19,800
After my disgrace by the digital blow, I have been training for my comeback.

4004
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:31,800
When I finally returned, I am very shocked to see you are playing very racist stereotype on your show.

4005
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:43,800
The Chinese dog, Mao Zedong, is using very racist accent to sound like Japanese.

4006
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:52,800
Chinese don't sound like Xato, it is very rude to me as a Japanese.

4007
02:20:52,800 --> 02:21:12,800
I have dedicated myself to finding the way to hell, so I can kill all the communists and restorers to Japan.

4008
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:17,800
Nanking 2 coming soon to communist hell, it's only a matter of time.

4009
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:24,800
Who is the Chinese character that has had a fake Japanese accent?

4010
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:30,800
Chairman Mao has been calling in from communist hell to make nice with the PCP, which we appreciate.

4011
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:37,800
Maybe Eroge Samurai just thinks Japanese sound like shit, maybe that's what he thinks.

4012
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:38,800
I think it's contention.

4013
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:43,800
He thinks Mao Zedong's stupid accent just reminds him it hits too close to home.

4014
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:49,800
Perhaps the demon one is in his own eye all along and needs to do some self-reflection.

4015
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:53,800
Think about Eroge Samurai, leave those good communist boys alone.

4016
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:55,800
They just want justice.

4017
02:21:55,800 --> 02:22:02,800
Speaking of communists, we've got Carl Liebknecht at communist hell.

4018
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:04,800
Do you know this guy? I don't know who he is exactly.

4019
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,800
I assume he's a communist.

4020
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:11,800
Is that like his email? Carlliebknechtatcommunisthell.edu?

4021
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:13,800
Probably something like that.

4022
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:14,800
Dot gov, of course.

4023
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:17,800
I don't know, he'll tell us about it.

4024
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:18,800
Carl, go.

4025
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:21,800
Hello, this is Carl Liebknecht, the good boy of communist hell.

4026
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:24,800
I'm really just here to spend some time with my comrades.

4027
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:29,800
Anyways, I want to remark that you placing only certain denizens of communist hell in the voice grill

4028
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:32,800
is the best pointless and adverse to counter-revolutionary act.

4029
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:37,800
The ascension of our comrades is the ascension of all the peasants and the proletariat of the world

4030
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:39,800
beyond your artificial stratification.

4031
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:43,800
This, oh god, what was that?

4032
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:47,800
Again, how is this happening here?

4033
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:51,800
Oh man, another classic communist faux pas.

4034
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:53,800
Another comrade falls.

4035
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:57,800
That's alright Carl, just exclamation revive, you'll be fine.

4036
02:22:57,800 --> 02:23:00,800
I thought they had gun laws in hell.

4037
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:06,800
They have so many gun laws, it's like, you know, Chicago, you know, politics, et cetera, et cetera.

4038
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:10,800
It's like they say, the only solution to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,

4039
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:12,800
but there are no good guys with guns.

4040
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:15,800
There are no good guys in communist hell, so it's just bad guys with guns.

4041
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:18,800
By touching a gun, you become a bad guy.

4042
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:23,800
Yeah, and that's how you wind up in communist hell.

4043
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:24,800
Alright, let's move on.

4044
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,800
We've got one from Zulfur.

4045
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:28,800
Zulfur, okay, go.

4046
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:33,800
Last week, upon hearing that the virgins are banned from making voicemails,

4047
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:40,800
unless we fuck the PCP, I paused, reflected, and decided I want to sleep with a band.

4048
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:43,800
The only question left is, who do I fuck?

4049
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:44,800
Who do I marry?

4050
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:46,800
And who do I kill?

4051
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:50,800
I think about for a minute, Ben, Munchy, and Nate.

4052
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:54,800
Fuck Nate, because he has 100k subscribers that could blackmail him later.

4053
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:55,800
Did she has more?

4054
02:23:55,800 --> 02:24:00,800
Very Munchy, because I can introduce him to my parents without dying of embarrassment.

4055
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:05,800
And kill Ben, because there's problematic egalitarian hate speech.

4056
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:08,800
That's being disguised as far left talking points.

4057
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:10,800
Oh, you can't force Ben.

4058
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:14,800
My body, my body is ready.

4059
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:18,800
This is hate crime.

4060
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:21,800
We gotta cancel this guy right fucking now.

4061
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:27,800
I appreciate him at least respecting our updated system, where no virgins allowed to leave voicemails.

4062
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:30,800
So that's, you know, big appreciation for that.

4063
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:32,800
Yes, yes.

4064
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:35,800
Oh, you know, okay, I knew this day would come.

4065
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:38,800
Everyone's out for me today.

4066
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:44,800
Well, yeah, all the online scrolls, the de-packers.

4067
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:49,800
They know I'm a danger to their precious system.

4068
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:51,800
Indeed.

4069
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:53,800
Okay, we've got another one.

4070
02:24:53,800 --> 02:24:56,800
Nate, this one's from, okay.

4071
02:24:56,800 --> 02:24:58,800
Nate, you uncultured fuck.

4072
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:01,800
It's de-enverred.

4073
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:02,800
De-enverred.

4074
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:04,800
And again, this is another classified voice.

4075
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:05,800
De-enverred?

4076
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:06,800
He's German.

4077
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:10,800
De-enverred called in last time, but this is de-enverred.

4078
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:11,800
He's calling in.

4079
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:13,800
Have you made a mistake last time?

4080
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:14,800
I don't know.

4081
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:15,800
Okay, anyway, go.

4082
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:22,800
Somewhere in the deepest, darkest reaches of phlogmological space-time.

4083
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:26,800
Go!

4084
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:27,800
There he is.

4085
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:28,800
I made it.

4086
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:31,800
Sensei, thank you.

4087
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:34,800
Ah, Agent 1488.

4088
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:36,800
I see you've returned from your undercover mission.

4089
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:39,800
You certainly know how to make an entrance.

4090
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:41,800
I trust you have the intel.

4091
02:25:41,800 --> 02:25:42,800
What's happening?

4092
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:43,800
My furor.

4093
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:45,800
Apologies for teleporting directly to your inner chamber.

4094
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:49,800
But the information I have obtained is of the utmost importance.

4095
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:52,800
The pinkos have established contact with the other side.

4096
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:56,800
Somehow they are able to punch through the veil between our phlogmos and physical space-time.

4097
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:57,800
What?

4098
02:25:57,800 --> 02:25:58,800
How is this possible?

4099
02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:01,800
No signal can reach the other side?

4100
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:04,800
The phlogm just don't create too much background noise.

4101
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:05,800
It gupples the signal.

4102
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:10,800
I want our top scientists working on these until their message is uncovered.

4103
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:11,800
Yes, my furor.

4104
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:13,800
There's just one more thing I have to report.

4105
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:16,800
I managed to trace their signal back through physical space-time,

4106
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:20,800
and have confirmed who is receiving the signal from Communist Hell.

4107
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:23,800
Excellent work, Agent 1488.

4108
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:26,800
Who is the person listening at the other side?

4109
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:27,800
My furor.

4110
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:29,800
It's not a person.

4111
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,800
It's an entire organization.

4112
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:33,800
There's nothing in our records about them.

4113
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:39,800
But they've somehow amassed enough power to break through the barrier between their world and Communist Hell.

4114
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:44,800
They call themselves the PCP.

4115
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,800
Oh my God.

4116
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:48,800
This is the dawn of a new alarm.

4117
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:50,800
I didn't know Batman was a Nazi.

4118
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:53,800
I didn't know Batman was a German man.

4119
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:55,800
I guess he was all along.

4120
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:56,800
Maybe this is like...

4121
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:59,800
There's something about phlogmatogical space going on in there.

4122
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:03,800
The phlogs, the phlogmos, is very intriguing to me.

4123
02:27:03,800 --> 02:27:06,800
Now I gotta look at phlogiston theory right now.

4124
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:08,800
Figure out what it's all mean.

4125
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:13,800
It seems like we're developing an alliance with the fine folks down in Communist Hell

4126
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:17,800
against these clearly fascist motherfuckers,

4127
02:27:17,800 --> 02:27:20,800
Agent 1488 and this evil boss there.

4128
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:23,800
Are they operating out of PC limbo?

4129
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:25,800
Maybe they are.

4130
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,800
They're somewhere in the in-between spaces.

4131
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:32,800
This is level 3 autistic, level 4 autistic.

4132
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,800
This whole arc.

4133
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:35,800
I can't keep track of it.

4134
02:27:35,800 --> 02:27:37,800
Somebody do a lecture, please.

4135
02:27:37,800 --> 02:27:42,800
Okay, we've got one final voicemail,

4136
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:45,800
and this is a continuation of another beloved saga.

4137
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:50,800
This is not even Clusterpunk can save the PCP from me.

4138
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:52,800
Okay, here we go.

4139
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:55,800
Luckily I escaped from PC prison, but you guys were about to let me rot there.

4140
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:57,800
So for retribution, I hacked some of your search histories.

4141
02:27:57,800 --> 02:27:58,800
Prepare to be exposed.

4142
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:00,800
Okay, so Nate, we have Naked Girl.

4143
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:02,800
Naked Girl abs.

4144
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:04,800
Hillary Clinton leaked nudes.

4145
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:06,800
Why was slavery abolished?

4146
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:08,800
Why can't I own slaves?

4147
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:09,800
Slave Black Market.

4148
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:10,800
Good question.

4149
02:28:10,800 --> 02:28:11,800
Slave Black Market price.

4150
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:14,800
Slave Black Market price USD.

4151
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:17,800
Overnight live guarantee US shipping rates.

4152
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:19,800
Okay, we can see where this is going.

4153
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:20,800
Ben.

4154
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:21,800
Ben energy.

4155
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:23,800
Keto Pizza Crust.

4156
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:24,800
Sonichu.

4157
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:25,800
TeeSpring.com.

4158
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:26,800
This is all true.

4159
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:28,800
Is it gay to be around by burning Sanders neck fat?

4160
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,800
What the fuck?

4161
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:32,800
How to remove a cucumber stuck in my...

4162
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:33,800
Okay, never mind.

4163
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:35,800
This family is fucking loony.

4164
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:36,800
How did he know?

4165
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:38,800
Don't seem to have any search histories.

4166
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:40,800
No doubt covering up many heinous crimes.

4167
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:41,800
No doubt.

4168
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:44,800
He's only searched one thing the last few months.

4169
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:48,800
How to convince my friends I'm in college so I don't have to talk to them anymore.

4170
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:49,800
Classic.

4171
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:53,800
That's the easiest ways to kill someone.

4172
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:55,800
Tips on where to bury a body.

4173
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:56,800
Best alibis.

4174
02:28:56,800 --> 02:28:58,800
Rhonda Rousey home address.

4175
02:28:58,800 --> 02:28:59,800
Okay.

4176
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:04,800
It's just hippopotamus porn.

4177
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:09,800
I've never seen so many pictures of Gloria from Madagascar in one place before.

4178
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:12,800
Okay, well I'm having a good time with this guys.

4179
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:14,800
No wonder the police are arrested, PCP listeners.

4180
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:15,800
Jesus Christ.

4181
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:16,800
Yeah.

4182
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:19,800
They're doing fine work, the PCP police.

4183
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:22,800
We're the reason people are dying in jail.

4184
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:25,800
All right, that's it everybody.

4185
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:26,800
Speakpipe.com.

4186
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:27,800
Send us your voicemails.

4187
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:29,800
You know, we asked and you guys are delivered.

4188
02:29:29,800 --> 02:29:33,800
The PCP voicemails are seeing marked improvements and I'm appreciating it.

4189
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:35,800
The ratings are skyrocketing.

4190
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:36,800
It's just insane.

4191
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:37,800
The climbs.

4192
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:40,800
The financial benefit we're reaping from these voicemails.

4193
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:42,800
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

4194
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:45,800
The corporate sponsorships such as with Disney Plus are flooding in.

4195
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:47,800
So let's just keep it going.

4196
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:48,800
Speakpipe, link down below.

4197
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:49,800
Leave yours.

4198
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:52,800
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

4199
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:53,800
$1.

4200
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:54,800
Discord.

4201
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:55,800
$5.

4202
02:29:55,800 --> 02:29:56,800
All the bonus episodes.

4203
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:59,800
It's gonna be like 29 or 30 by the time you hear this fucking episode.

4204
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:00,800
Incredible benefits.

4205
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:01,800
Incredible deal.

4206
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:03,800
And anymore we appreciate.

4207
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:06,800
And now at a $10 pledge, guess what you get into?

4208
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:11,800
The fucking PCP Minecraft server which also has a separate Patreon for just $5.

4209
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:13,800
Oh my God, come play with us.

4210
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:15,800
Video games, streams, build a home.

4211
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:20,800
Wait, so we ended up making a separate Patreon and incorporating it into ours?

4212
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:26,800
We thought it was a reasonable thing to just make an additional bonus for those people who are already pledging like $10 or more.

4213
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:29,800
We're just giving them a free entry if they want to.

4214
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:31,800
But we expect most people to do the separate Patreon.

4215
02:30:31,800 --> 02:30:33,800
Wow, wacky and crazy.

4216
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:36,800
I know it's absolutely bonkers, folks.

4217
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,800
So kooky and ridiculous.

4218
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:40,800
Maybe it's crazy enough to work.

4219
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:41,800
We will find out.

4220
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:43,800
If it doesn't work, we'll change tags.

4221
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:44,800
We'll keep you posted.

4222
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:46,800
So go give us money at all these fronts.

4223
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:50,800
Leave more voicemails and follow us at TPcrastinators on Twitter for all kinds of fun things.

4224
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:56,800
And we will see you next week for another but blasting episode of the Procrastinators podcast.

4225
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:57,800
See you there.

4226
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:58,800
Bye.

4227
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:01,800
Yeah.

4228
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:03,800
Ding.
