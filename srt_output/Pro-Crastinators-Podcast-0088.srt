The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hippocrit.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello everyone and let's commence this episode of the PCP.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I am the best guy ever.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And the PCP is an internet show to podcast with a bunch of internet creators.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We make stuff. You might know us. You might have heard of us around the world.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We're pretty good.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're joined today by Ben Saint.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's me. I'm an internet boy and so are all of you folks.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hippocrit is also with us.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
YouTube.com slash not doesn't exist.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And lethal Roar Mage.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I assume this is going to go up near the holidays. So happy holidays to all.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Indeed. Well said. This will go up. Let me say I think this is out on the 24th.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It'll be Christmas Eve. This episode goes out.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Merry Christmas everyone.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why didn't we change this to be about Christmas?

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What?

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Didn't we consider making a Christmas episode?

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We did.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We did consider it. We did consider it.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I guess we did around but we decided to be big old gringes and not go over there.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's right.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We were actually going to do that after this one, I think.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, that's right. Yes.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I think so. I think that was the plan.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Right. Okay. So enjoy that next time after Christmas is over.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't wait to hear the Urban Dictionary for Christmas anyway.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Speaking of which, I was about to read or I'm getting to our topic for today.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
All right. Tell me if you guys, you fair viewers, can guess what our topic today is

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
given this definition from our Goods Friends over at Urban Dictionary.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
They should sponsor us.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Here's the top definition.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The place that will give your old poor grandma a heart attack after reading the comments.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Tumblr.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So that's the definition for YouTube, everybody, for YouTube.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But our actual topic is a little bit broader.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's about the end of YouTube.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
About the distant past that lies beyond what would happen in a theoretical world.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The distant past of the future.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, wait.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
AKA right fucking now.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Just like the end of Ava.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Get your timelines in order, Nate.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
With all the things happening this year, with all the ad apocalypses and the vicious racial slurs

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
being said to the poor children's ears on all manner of YouTube videos.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't forget about the death of net neutrality.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's a good one.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That is a good one.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That we have a BCP all fully endorsed and are very excited about.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You know, it's actually funny, a last episode that we recorded before that vote was cast

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
but it's coming out after the vote was cast.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Like I defended a little bit.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I raised some issues about why it would be a decent, or like there are reasons to get rid of net neutrality.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But yeah, I don't actually share that really was a great idea guys.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So watch out for that shit.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You got a little egg on your face there now.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I feel 100% responsible for the outcome of this vote.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, because you are.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it official? I think it still needs to go to quarter something.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I mean, there are like appeals and things that are still going to happen.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But like the initial big vote thing that they wanted to happen did happen.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So we will see.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But on the left, we did it guys.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hashtag we did it.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
All these things, all these things though.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I mean, if that happened, I mean, shit, YouTube stuff couldn't even,

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
couldn't, might not even matter anymore.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But nonetheless, we are here.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We're all internet content creators.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
All of us make videos among other things.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And we all use YouTube for that stuff.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And let's just, let's just gaze into the future and think about what it will be like when YouTube is no longer king.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And you know, that could come from YouTube like, indeed.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That could come from YouTube like going away forever.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And then like having to scramble to see whatever else there is around there.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like vid me just died.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So there's no vid me option anymore.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Rest in peace.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Rest in peace.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The anime snob.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I think the first question we need to ask ourselves is would we continue making videos if YouTube wasn't around?

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a good question.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a very good question.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Would it even be on our minds to continue with that?

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Or would we go elsewhere and do other types of things?

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I mean, that is a very good question.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I mean, this is open-ended.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So we can pretty much just go anywhere we want with that.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So let's just start with that.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Wait, can I pose a question that I think is important?

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, let's say that YouTube just dies.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Do you think that the YouTube audience will like cohere somewhere else?

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like will that audience like move to a new place and there will be some new, there will be like a new way to reach them?

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Or do you think they'll just be scattered and like it will be, do you think they'll just be lost?

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Like that platform will just go away?

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think what would happen is if YouTube died for some reason, companies would be scrambling to scoop up all of the talent because they know they can get like views.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But they won't be able to make a good actual thing to host their content on.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So it'll be a big mess for a very long time and most people, like most people who watch YouTube casually will just forget that it ever existed.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, like the community of YouTube is very strong at the time.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Like it's taken what, like 10 years or something, but now YouTube has a very strong, you know, like individual identity.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And it is like, I think it's like the premier viewing, obviously the biggest like viewing, you know, streaming website in the world,

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
but it like rivals like television.

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It exist and destabilizes the hold that things like television have had on us for all these centuries and eons.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And like with it, if it, for it to crumble will absolutely shatter like that community, that community will absolutely go away.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But what I wonder is, you do agree, you agree on that?

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I disagree.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh really?

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, because I feel like with the absence of YouTube, there's going to be like a gap in our internet society and like these people will congregate somewhere else.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There's a demand now, so people will want that back.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Think about like MySpace, that used to be a huge thing, and then suddenly Facebook came along and took over.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I agree, Mage, because like people, like the people that are used to watching streaming video, like the people that are used to the things YouTube offers,

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,000
which is like, you know, creator, creator-owned, creator-driven, like personal content and, you know, streaming video, like those people can't go back to TV.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Like they're going to want-

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
TV is a nightmare by comparison now.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They're going to want-

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, there's going to be a demand to like get that back.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, the thing I was getting at is that the large swath, like the large majority of people on YouTube are kids and normies, and they will not come back.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They will not go into their little cliques.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But, hey, let me ask you this though.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
An individual like community, like, you know, the animation meme community, or the people who like video game reviews and analysis, or, you know, anime analysis,

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,000
like those people will find ways to host their content and their fans will follow them, but the vast majority of the viewer base of everyone will not be able to come back.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Like if you have a million subscribers now, you're going to have maybe 100,000 people following you in the future if YouTube is just gone.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There's a lot of data counts as well, so you have to account for that.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, sure, sure.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But I mean, that just really feeds into his point of like less people will follow you and you'll get less, you know, numbers overall.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But what I'm wondering is, like, you say that the views definitely come from the normos out there, and that's absolutely true.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But, but, are those people really indicative of the patrons of these people?

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I would say absolutely not.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And that's where I think that's kind of where this question is going.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Like individual specific fan funding of these projects.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, well, here's a here's a sticky quagmire of an issue.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:05,000
My question is, okay, those like the hardcore fans who are, you know, incentivized enough, they're invested enough that they will like actively support a creator.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Will they feel the same way when they don't see, you know, a huge community of people commenting and like, you know, hundreds of thousands of views on the videos that this artist person is putting out?

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That is a great point.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, I think that I think that without that sense of like, you know, importance and community and relevance, like, I think, I think it's going to be bad.

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Like, I think there will be people that would have maybe supported if they'd gotten that same impression, but like without that, they might not be as moved.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We've been talking a lot lately and shitting on like comments in several episodes after this, you know, these last couple of months.

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I you've been saying this and I totally agree that the community aspect of YouTube is absolutely one of the reasons why it was so popular and so many people like to engage with it and watch it.

145
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
In addition, in addition to like just the fact that people like to be part of something that's gone viral and they find it interesting just in its own way.

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think also part of that is that YouTube was one site and you could go from all this sorts of different content to others by clicking on, you know, recommended videos and links.

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And it felt like, you know, it was a congregation, everyone would come to this site and they would be able to just switch between different creators.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If creators all move to their own websites, you'll never be able to find other people.

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So it will feel like, you know, you don't know where to go.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,000
People will try, will like go to like largely, will go to a place that is like an aggregate for interesting content, whether that's a site that exists right now.

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But like that's what Reddit is.

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Like you just go to Reddit and like they'll collect the links of like whatever you want to see and you could just go through something like that instead probably.

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The thing I'm thinking about is like if YouTube is gone, videos will be hard because like YouTube is like an unbelievably expensive thing to run.

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And who could like match that? I don't think anybody could.

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And where would all these video creators make their videos? Where would they upload them?

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:15,000
In the absence of like some YouTube successor coming along and like picking up the slack, I guess it would mean a return to the days of like people just host their own content on their own websites.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And that's what like did you and Tom have been talking about a bunch lately? And you do this yourself, Ben. You've got your own website for your public stuff.

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I do. Yeah, I mean my content is not stuff that could really be hosted anywhere else.

159
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Like there's no like, well, I mean there are platforms, but they're not. They're not robust like YouTube is. Yeah.

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So if that happened, I don't know. I have mixed feelings because I feel like that experience of like just a creator, you know, curating their own content and putting their own website together and placing their work in the context that they deem appropriate for it to be experienced in.

161
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's good. And I like that. But like, you know, the YouTube algorithm is really powerful. And like that's how a lot of people succeed and get noticed in the first place. And it's going to be really, I don't know.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
A lot of people are going to just lose their jobs and not be able to recover and have to do something else.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I want to say something.

164
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I have one more thing to say that the like as much as I hate the I hate like the way that the algorithm can be gamed to like to like, you know, guarantee success.

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But without it, they're just like, you know, there is so much less opportunity for success.

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Period. Looking at you, pedantic romantic.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

168
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Earlier, but my engineer was dying and so I couldn't hear you guys talking up until it was kind of like over. But like when it was saying, like, you can, you know, find different creators on YouTube and stuff like that.

169
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I kind of like the rabbit hole. You can jump down by like clicking on the.

170
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Absolutely. Yeah.

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That part of YouTube, you know,

172
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's like, it's like clicking links on Wikipedia. Yeah.

173
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You don't know where you're going to end up and you find interesting stuff.

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I really think this will be become an outsource thing to a site like Reddit where, but like you will have to choose what kind of content you're interested in.

175
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And like, let's just say there was like a, maybe there could be like a YouTube revival subreddit or something that's just like, ah, we assemble all the most popular links.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So, hey, want to see the new fucking like Colbert show on whatever it is?

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yay. My favorite. No, fuck that.

178
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I mean, the thing is really just about the fact that you need to be extremely, you will need to be extremely successful in order to maintain, you know, the amount of bandwidth at, you know, the site you would have to run to keep your videos on would have to be like, or you'd have to go to another video thing.

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No, none of us, none of us are at a level to survive from this shit. It may be Digi, but maybe not even him.

180
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah. I mean, in a way, in a way, like I like YouTube. I like the fact that there's so much interesting stuff there.

181
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But there is a lot of crap and I feel like if YouTube dies, a lot of the people who make crap will die and a lot of the absolute best people will survive like red letter media and stuff like that.

182
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, they'll be fine.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It will be kind of good in a way, but for most people it would be terrible.

184
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The barrier to entry will become higher, like people will have to work harder to find content and they'll be pickier about what they want to watch, which is kind of good.

185
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And the savage part of me wants to see that happen.

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's very convenient for guys who are already like a John Tron, a big guy. I think they'll be okay in general, but I don't know.

187
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And for guys like me, for example, I've already learned everything I need to know to become a successful YouTuber for the most part.

188
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I understand the video editing, all that stuff, but when the barrier to entry goes up so much, like remember Ben, we even made our first video,

189
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
like the bar was so, you got to make the video and then you just put it up and you're ready to go. It's done.

190
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And so like the opportunities to join are there and like it has a very low skill floor.

191
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What do you actually need to do to get your foot in the door, but as an extremely high skill ceiling, having both of those things.

192
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, I mean, I'm using the word skill, but really I just mean like success rate that you're going to climb to eventually.

193
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I really like that. And it seems like what we could be getting to at this point is a raising of the skill floor as in you just, you can't even get in without being more leveled up in all these skills

194
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and possibly also lower the skill ceiling and that you can only, you know, succeed so much because like there isn't a gigantic aggregated platform that is YouTube.

195
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And I think those both, those are both unfortunate things.

196
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I really like in theory how YouTube is a meritocracy and how it just you succeed or fail on your own merits.

197
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And I know that it's not really like that, you know, like, like that's that's an idealistic picture of it.

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But I like that idea.

199
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's sort of like that, like trends come and go like a few months ago, there was that whole trend of like the hot knife cutting through things and everybody was doing it.

200
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And that one guy got so many subscribers, so many views, completely dead, like no one cares.

201
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah, like that guy isn't building a career off that one meme, you know, it's gone.

202
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He's lost what like foothold he had because he didn't make anything actually interesting.

203
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Realistically, he probably made several thousand dollars and like that's it.

204
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And that's, you know, everything. And that's fine, you know, that's not a bad amount of money to make for making a popular meme.

205
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Like the good stuff by the good people does stick around and get rewatched.

206
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You know what I was thinking recently? I was thinking about how like changing things in this way.

207
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Like, okay, so for example, if YouTube dies, then everyone has to individually host their own content.

208
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And like maybe, okay, so like this is something I was going to talk about.

209
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's the fact that economically speaking, YouTube has never ever made money, which is terrible, which is a disgrace.

210
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And it's because they were planning on turning this around and they're held afloat by their, you know, parent company, Google and whatnot.

211
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
For the hope that one day they will be making money with like YouTube red or whatever.

212
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But like economically speaking, just based on the incentive structures, if people have to like pay a certain amount of money for like the video file size that they're uploading

213
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
or the length of time that their video is, those sorts of things give an actual cost to uploading like massive amounts of content,

214
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
which makes sense because you're asking more of the person hosting that content.

215
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

216
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And because of that, it incentivizes making like the highest density quality content for amount of time or file size that you have uploaded,

217
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
which sort of like incentivizes things to go back to the way initial YouTube was,

218
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
where like guys like Egoraptor got famous for like big animations that they worked really hard on.

219
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I mean, you know that I certainly would be in favor of content going back to that sort of stuff as opposed to this kind of just like upload literally anything you want,

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
just keep trying forever at no cost to you and hopefully you'll eventually figure something out.

221
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I kind of like that. I kind of like how that sounds.

222
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Right? Isn't it great?

223
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It makes sense.

224
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's especially because like a lot of long form, many, many, many episodes, let's play content is basically just like a friendship simulator.

225
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So like if that content goes, people will actually have to try making real friends.

226
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're right, dude. You're absolutely right.

227
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's so terrifying. I don't even want to think about it.

228
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If you just, that right there, I think is actually could potentially be a very positive thing.

229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't get me wrong, I love consuming tons of garbage content.

230
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Like I watch tons of garbage ASMR every day that I just play forever.

231
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But I really would prefer, more important to me than that, is increasing the quality of content overall.

232
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And I'm sure there will still be plenty.

233
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Nothing is more important than ASMR.

234
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Indeed. But like by changing the, like YouTube is not making money right now, right?

235
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And like it'd be good if they made money.

236
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So if YouTube like asked the people uploading video to pay for what it actually costs them to host the videos to some degree,

237
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
perhaps they finally could get into the black and like, I'm willing to do it, you know?

238
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Like I get that people at the very bottom, you know, again, this raises the quote unquote skill floor way higher

239
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
because you have to actually put in money to do this stuff anyway.

240
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But like money is just a way to measure like effort and shit that you're willing to put into something in a way.

241
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Like I don't know, I don't think that's a crazy idea.

242
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The way you're saying it like suddenly asking creators to pay, like, I don't know whether that would actually make...

243
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's an idea.

244
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know whether that would make animation come back because animation takes a long time to do

245
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and they need like confirmation that it's going to get big views.

246
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What it does is de-incentivize thoughtless content or, you know, flip it.

247
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's the idea.

248
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So it changes the landscape overall.

249
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It wouldn't be that expensive, right?

250
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No.

251
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Like how much do you think they'd have to charge to host like an hour's worth of video?

252
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's say maybe ten bucks maybe.

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Whoa, that's more than I thought.

254
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There's no way it's 200 bucks.

255
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Like you've got a hard drive with so much space.

256
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's because they charge nothing right now that they're in such a hole.

257
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's more than just like how much it would cost to have it on a hard drive.

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's the cost of having it on a hard drive and then distributing it to people like different YouTube servers

259
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
across the world.

260
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Right.

261
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

262
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
YouTube does not have distribution costs.

263
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
No, no, no, no.

264
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's just in their fucking...

265
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
They've got server farms and stuff to maintain.

266
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's not as simple as just having the file on a computer.

267
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's totally true.

268
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You're totally right.

269
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But like, yeah, that's the thing.

270
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There could theoretically be a calculated cost that YouTube could come up.

271
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
In a sustainable way to actually support all this content.

272
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I would be very curious what that figure would look like.

273
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah.

274
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The problem, of course, that people object to.

275
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I haven't tried myself, but I've heard, I remember hearing that hosting video files

276
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
of any size on your own website, on your own like video player, is extremely expensive

277
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and nobody can really afford to do it ever.

278
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, that is exactly why we should outsource that process to giant companies that can afford

279
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
to for some fee.

280
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Like, what are we doing just expecting YouTube to give us stuff for free?

281
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Like, obviously their game plan was that...

282
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It is pretty incredible.

283
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It is pretty incredible that they operate the service at a fucking loss.

284
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And don't get me wrong, I understand why YouTube does it.

285
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's because by doing so, they have taken over the streaming market and they are a fucking

286
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
juggernaut.

287
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I get all that.

288
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But you do need to stay afloat economically when you're a business.

289
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So, I'm just putting out solutions here that might be able to work to help this problem.

290
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So, you know, I'm sure nobody wants to have to pay money for anything, me least of all.

291
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But I recognize the economic reality here that like, what's better?

292
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
YouTube starting to charge people and changing the economy of YouTube and making it, you

293
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
know, like into an economically sustainable model or YouTube just dying or YouTube going

294
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
away.

295
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And I don't know, seems like a good idea to try to shift things around instead of changing

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
them or instead of letting it die.

297
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah, I mean...

298
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I feel like the backlash, if they actually changed it to something like that, it would

299
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
be like terrible.

300
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay, but here's the thing about that backlash, it'll be from whiny entitled babies who I don't

301
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
care about.

302
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Who don't care.

303
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And they can make those...

304
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
They can complain.

305
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
They can say all those things.

306
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And there is a case to be made that it disincentivizes like, uploading to YouTube, which it actually

307
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
does.

308
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,360
But that economically disincentivizing things is not evil and YouTube is a company that

309
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,440
is trying to survive and make money.

310
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
So like, everyone's...

311
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,000
I can hear the millennial screams already, the shrieks of woe about how upset they'll

312
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
be.

313
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Yeah, you know, as much as I agree that it would not be wrong and I could see why they

314
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,760
do it and part of me is interested in that idea, I think that the backlash would be so

315
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
intense.

316
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,000
It would be such an upheaval that it could be the death of YouTube if they did.

317
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's possible too.

318
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Kind of a bummer.

319
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah, I'm not...

320
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm not...

321
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't fully disagree or anything, but I feel like the animation...

322
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,240
The animation community would just die because a lot of them are like kids and teens and

323
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
stuff like that.

324
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,000
And so they wouldn't be able to cough up the money.

325
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,160
Now, Mage, I hear what you're saying, but here's the thing though.

326
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,640
If a company or if any community or business or whatever cannot sustain itself economically,

327
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
it should die.

328
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
It should die.

329
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
That's what comes down to.

330
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,600
I said I don't disagree with you, I'm just sad that like communities like these would

331
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,240
just die off because they're...

332
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,920
I'm just like...

333
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,040
People get so wrapped up in that they love how things are right now and this is not an

334
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
attack on you, Mage.

335
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,960
I just mean like people in general out there.

336
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,600
They just say like, oh, you know, I love that I get to upload videos to YouTube for free.

337
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
That's so great.

338
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,480
Therefore, it should always be this way and nothing must ever change and things must stay

339
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,840
exactly as they are.

340
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,720
I don't care how in the fucking red YouTube has to go, give me free video uploads forever.

341
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,920
Well, there's that, but like I don't think people like all of them are whining that they

342
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,680
just want it to stay the same.

343
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,880
A lot of them need it to stay the same because they have a career based around it now.

344
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
They have to pay rent now.

345
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
That's just entitlement.

346
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
That's just entitlement.

347
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,080
It's entitlement based on the fact that it has worked for years now and suddenly if

348
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,440
they don't have a house, it's kind of...

349
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,520
They need to scream about it because like they're going to be homeless.

350
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,040
But that's what the market is.

351
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,600
YouTube is a business and it's not YouTube's job to maintain people's lives.

352
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Okay.

353
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Yes, go on.

354
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Okay.

355
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,000
If it's just about like YouTube getting money from it, what if instead of making people

356
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,280
pay, they just take the money from the ads because it seems to be working out for illegal

357
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,400
anime sites and stuff like that, you know?

358
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
They're just hosting.

359
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,200
Well, those are much smaller operations than YouTube.

360
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
And when you do things illegally, I don't know, like you can...

361
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,040
Yeah, never mind.

362
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Never mind.

363
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,440
I mean, I was just like, who knows how big an operation like KissAnime actually is in

364
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,680
terms of how many people they have to employ, what kind of 401K they got going, what kind

365
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,080
of dental insurance they got for the employees of kissanime.com, my favorite website.

366
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:15,680
If YouTube is operating at a loss, I'm a little confused how they can justify like offering

367
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:22,360
ad revenue to people, like are those people making some of the money back?

368
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,240
Maybe that's why the ad apocalypse is happening, they're slowly taking back the months.

369
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
No, it's not that.

370
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,600
It's because YouTube specifically has catered its entire ecosystem around incentivizing

371
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,040
people to just upload as much fucking video as possible all the time.

372
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,320
What we're talking about is shifting the incentive structures here and that will cause problems.

373
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,720
Like for example, guys like Game Grumps make their living by uploading just massive amounts

374
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
of videos, like three every single day.

375
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,400
I guess here's my question, people who upload tons of video and are really popular, like

376
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,000
the Game Grumps, those people make ad revenue off of those videos.

377
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm just wondering if the cost of hosting, does Game Grumps make money for YouTube or

378
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,280
does Game Grumps cost YouTube money to host?

379
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,040
I don't know for sure.

380
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,160
Because YouTube does take a percentage off of the ad revenue, don't they?

381
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Yeah, but I think that the idea is like-

382
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,560
I wonder if the most successful channels are the ones that are not a drain on YouTube.

383
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,680
Like the successful ones help YouTube and the unsuccessful ones hurt YouTube.

384
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
Oh, I see your point.

385
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Sure, sure.

386
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,120
I would guess that that's how it works.

387
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:36,160
I guess that the thing is like the more views, like they must have come up with a formula

388
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:44,000
so that an amount of video file space and then the amount of views it gets, like that's

389
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,800
how many ad bucks are generated because of the amount of people who see that, and then

390
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:55,080
they take, like, they must have thought about being able to pay for itself when they came

391
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,600
up with how much percentage the content creator gets.

392
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,640
And you know, okay, this whole discussion that we're having right now about like the

393
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,880
idea of expecting uploader people to contribute some amount of money to like make it sustainable

394
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,680
of their videos being hosted or whatever, like the thing about that, that in that idea

395
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,200
like hurts guys like me more than almost anyone.

396
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,440
Like that would be a direct attack against me economically.

397
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,160
But the thing is though, like I accept the reality that economics, you have to conform

398
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,320
yourself to the economic situation you find yourself in.

399
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,680
So rather than bitching and moaning about like, eh, why can't I get shit for free forever?

400
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,360
Like instead I will mold myself economically into whatever fucking contortionist rhombus

401
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,040
strip cube I need to be in in order to make this stuff work because I'm just dedicated

402
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,600
to making it happen.

403
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,200
And I understand that there is like, there is a privilege here because I have not like

404
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,960
founded a business upon the current model that YouTube exists in and changed that model

405
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,240
will definitely fuck up some people.

406
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,440
But also YouTube needs to go in the black and if YouTube just dies, the businesses will

407
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,760
be fucked up anyway.

408
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,200
So I'm just trying to fix these issues.

409
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,240
Here's an idea.

410
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,520
What if YouTube just very temporarily like very briefly started charging to host enough

411
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,360
to put it in the black because I'm sure you've heard the saying once you go in the black,

412
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,920
you never go back.

413
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,680
Business proposal to think about I feel like we've gotten far off the topic of the podcast,

414
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,440
which is what we would do if YouTube dies.

415
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,480
We're talking about YouTube possibly dying.

416
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Yeah.

417
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Okay.

418
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Okay.

419
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Let's say it's gone.

420
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Would we want?

421
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
What would we do?

422
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,800
First of all, what would we I would try to do my like work would be pretty much unchanged

423
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,720
because I'm already kind of post YouTube like YouTube is already like a secondary platform

424
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
for me.

425
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,160
I mean, I would lose we would lose the PCP.

426
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,320
I would lose exposure like like my YouTube channel and the PCP are like where a bunch

427
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,440
of my exposure comes from and I would lose it so that I would I would be hurt in that

428
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
way.

429
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,560
But like I would do what I was doing and I would probably just put more focus on, you

430
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,000
know, like doing like running kick starters and stuff and and you know, just putting out

431
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,720
I don't know, just pushing pushing my stuff in other ways.

432
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,840
I don't think the PCP has to go because it's a podcast.

433
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,600
We already have it on Google Play and I do.

434
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Oh, yeah.

435
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,520
But it's like I forgot we could we could survive without I mean, you're right and all and actually

436
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,600
that the PCP actually does already have a WordPress website that we could slightly remodel

437
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,720
and just like make it our hub for like all PCP content and stuff, which would not be

438
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
particularly difficult.

439
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,400
So like that's true.

440
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Yeah.

441
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,720
Like we could shape ourselves to that.

442
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,760
But like the factor of the exposure that YouTube gives us, you know, like that's that

443
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,800
would be quite a loss, especially considering how I hope the PCP will continue to grow.

444
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,120
And, you know, that growth exists on YouTube where everyone is right now.

445
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,680
So, you know, that'd be that's certainly be challenging.

446
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,720
Like imagine if we were just in a in a pool competing with like literally every

447
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,400
podcast, like on a podcast subreddit or something.

448
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,040
And it's just like, yeah, listen to the PCP and they're like, why?

449
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,040
And we're like, we have no answer to that question.

450
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Yeah, exactly.

451
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,840
As for what I would do, I think

452
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,680
I would be okay with saying goodbye to YouTube reviews and analysis and funny,

453
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
funny fucking videos forever.

454
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,760
I'd be okay with getting because like it's it's been good for me to do.

455
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,840
And I had fun doing it, but sometimes it is a slog.

456
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:49,560
And I have never really broken through the, you know, I'm still below the

457
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,560
subscribe account of my old pony channel.

458
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,520
It's if, you know, if it if it goes today, I'd be okay just quitting and doing

459
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,200
something else, maybe getting more into drawing or music.

460
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,360
It would be difficult, obviously.

461
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,000
But I also have

462
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:13,720
like actual job opportunities in like writing for for cartoons and TV.

463
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,920
So like I could go and do that and that be my job as a freelance.

464
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,560
And then I could still, you know, upload things to Bandcamp, maybe once in a

465
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,400
blue moon or draw some stupid comics, comics for my for, you know, for things.

466
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,360
Like I have very economically viable though, very skills that could work outside of YouTube.

467
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,080
So I feel like I'd be OK, but I wouldn't I wouldn't be too sad to say goodbye to Hippocrates.

468
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,000
I have.

469
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,560
I just had a thought like, OK, say YouTube announced today like guys were dying.

470
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,280
Yeah, you know, get get your shit out of here.

471
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,360
We're going to be dead in a week.

472
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:59,480
I would what I would like to do then is get all my YouTube content, like download

473
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,200
it and like host it on my website, like maybe make like a separate section for

474
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,120
like video and just have like a big archive of all the videos I've ever made

475
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,560
and just host them there.

476
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,880
And I just wonder how much that would cost, because that's a lot.

477
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,640
That's like, yeah, that's a good question.

478
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,920
That's like tens or hundreds of hours of the thing just from my channel.

479
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,560
Plus T-Bap, like, you know, like that's a lot.

480
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:20,960
I don't know.

481
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,880
I wonder how prohibitive I wonder how prohibitively expensive.

482
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,080
Well, I feel emotion or something to host your videos.

483
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,040
You know, I guess that's true.

484
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,800
Yeah, yeah, but I like with the idea that you can't host YouTube videos.

485
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,040
And like, I feel like, well, I know that the cost goes up depending on how many

486
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,080
people, you know, ask to see your video on your website.

487
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,640
So if you get a lot of traffic on your video, like that's a lot more than just

488
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,920
getting a lot of traffic on a, you know, a page with an image on it.

489
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah, yeah, I see.

490
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,520
Paying for people to watch your entire

491
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,200
Nuzlocke series and let's say a hundred people do that.

492
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,720
That's that's a big fucking.

493
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,400
How much so you pay for you pay for you pay for bandwidth rather than like storage?

494
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,280
So I think so.

495
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,520
OK, well, yeah, I don't really know much about the back end of this of the like

496
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,000
the hosting process.

497
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,960
It would make sense for both of those things to like be things that you have

498
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,400
to compensate someone for if they're hosting your video and like the amount of

499
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,120
traffic that like your content.

500
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,400
Oh, I'd be so sad.

501
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,800
I'd be so sad if all my content was just lost.

502
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,160
Or if it was just economically impossible to preserve it.

503
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,920
Right.

504
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,760
I think the first thing I would do,

505
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,040
but I mean, my videos, a lot of my videos are kind of like throw away, like they're

506
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,080
not that important, but there's a few pretty good ones.

507
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,840
And I still have all the files.

508
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:49,600
So I might kickstart a DVD Blu-ray collection, just like the idea because he's got

509
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,160
all of his Angry Video Game Note episodes on Blu-ray that you can get.

510
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,400
And it's like, yeah, like physical media, that might be the way to go.

511
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
That's because I know just watch it whenever you feel like that's just that's

512
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,280
just making me fantasize about the about like two Blu-ray box sets for Nuzlocke

513
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,000
Conquest and Nuzlocke Genocide.

514
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,240
Hey, that'd be pretty cool.

515
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,640
Oh, my God, that would be so cool.

516
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,960
Maybe I'll do that anyway.

517
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,960
Put that in your Kickstarter that you have right now.

518
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,200
Oh, my stretch goal.

519
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm actually very curious what how much how hard that would be to do.

520
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,040
And if that doesn't work, yeah, like maybe as a separate.

521
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,640
I'll just buy one for myself.

522
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,520
Yeah, like all of your first

523
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,120
Nuzlocke series on two Blu-ray discs.

524
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,800
Oh, well, OK.

525
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,040
All right. Good.

526
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,600
Yes, please continue this.

527
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,160
But but so what about you, Mage?

528
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,880
What would you do if YouTube just went away?

529
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,960
I feel like I'm in the same boat as Hippocrates.

530
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,800
Like, I wouldn't be too sad about it going away.

531
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,440
I mean, I would be sad to lose the videos and stuff.

532
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,440
I probably save them if they give a proper poor warning.

533
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,080
But I still have my deviant art and

534
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,000
I am still sort of trying to work on that comic thing.

535
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,560
And I am actually like, do you guys know about adaptables?

536
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,840
Like adaptable? No, I know about it.

537
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,080
Oh, seas. I don't understand them.

538
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
They confuse me a lot.

539
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,000
But I know what is this.

540
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,320
Explain. OK, so very quickly.

541
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,760
OK, I'm glad it's not just me.

542
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,120
Yeah, you create like these signs of these original characters of yours.

543
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,040
It could be like it could be like oh.

544
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,280
Pokemon, because it could be just

545
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,440
animal people, whatever it could be.

546
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,160
People, angels or you can create action for example.

547
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,720
Yes, yes.

548
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,840
You create like different designs for them.

549
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,280
You could use the same base usually, but the design has to be different.

550
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,480
So they all look, you know, distinct from one another, despite being in the same pose.

551
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,200
And you sell them.

552
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,880
They're kind of like like imagine like toys, I guess, but just virtual.

553
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,720
And they're drawings, it's kind of like selling.

554
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,360
So it's it's just artwork or is there some sort of Neopets website?

555
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,440
Here's here's here's what I don't understand is what do people do with them

556
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,920
once they buy them?

557
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,680
They create characters out of them and usually do they have them.

558
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,920
All right, so why do they need to the character, right?

559
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,640
But why do they need to buy them to do that?

560
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,480
That's where I guess that's where I get confused.

561
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,960
Some people can't draw then.

562
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,000
I I understand.

563
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,240
But if I was just googling and I found one, why can't I just use that?

564
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,160
But like you buy you buy you buy you buy someone else legal issues.

565
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,160
You buy an adoptable.

566
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,200
There's no there's no legal issues about

567
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,360
fantasizing that you are a character.

568
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,760
There are no legal issues.

569
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,880
The art and the character design.

570
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,920
OK, but do you need but do you need to own the art?

571
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,280
Like, do you like put it on things?

572
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,080
Well, well, hang on.

573
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,800
If you like commission a new character to be drawn as you're adoptable, perhaps that

574
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,760
like it doesn't exist until you pay for it.

575
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,680
That I could understand like that makes sense to me.

576
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,040
The way I see it is that people are they don't know how to design characters.

577
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,920
Maybe they can't draw, maybe they can.

578
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,280
And maybe maybe somebody designs a character

579
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,600
and like, oh, oh, I want that to be in my furry RP.

580
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,360
Yes. And then and then they say,

581
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,960
can I buy the rights to use your character as my own?

582
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,800
And they say yes.

583
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,800
And that's how it starts.

584
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,080
Yeah, I guess.

585
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,640
I guess that makes sense.

586
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,440
Like it kind of really feeds into people's need to collect pretty shiny

587
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,920
sparkly things because a lot of the signs are really cute instead of like,

588
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,360
I just want to own it.

589
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,680
I guess here's OK.

590
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,120
Here's I'm just going to be a big asshole right now.

591
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,600
Well, like I don't see the need to purchase the artwork unless you're then

592
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,240
putting it into like a commercial product that you're then selling like it's not

593
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,320
like it's not not for people like you then.

594
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,720
But I don't understand people who aren't like me.

595
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,680
I can't say that.

596
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,520
Well, what I'm understanding here is the honor system, like it's there's no legal,

597
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,760
like you can't say, oh, I'm going to sue you because you you drew fan art of this

598
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,200
adoptable, you're not allowed, you didn't pay me yet.

599
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,600
Like there's no it's just like people decided that this is the system they're

600
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,080
going to use and they are I guess that system.

601
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,080
You kind of treat them like kind of like in digital toys, toys, let's call them.

602
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
It's just like you see a plushie.

603
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,240
Oh, that's a cute plushie.

604
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,920
I just want it.

605
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,480
There's no reason for me to own it.

606
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,720
But, you know, it's cute.

607
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,960
I want it. So I had to make sense.

608
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,480
All right. So what I'm hearing here is that the adoptable economy is booming right

609
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,120
now. And that's where I need to be going.

610
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,000
That's where all our all our ships need to be pointed in the same direction

611
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,760
straight towards the do I do I hear one million dollars for action.

612
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,160
Oh, it's a drop in the bucket for his medical fees.

613
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,360
But it's a start.

614
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,400
It's not like.

615
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,240
He's a big handful.

616
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,040
He's a fixer upper.

617
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,320
He needs a rich patron to keep him going.

618
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,920
Let me tell you, though, like some people do earn like several hundred dollars

619
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,840
per drawing off of these adoptables.

620
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,200
OK, so it can be very successful.

621
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,440
And I've made a few I'm not successful, not yet.

622
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,560
And I don't expect to be any time soon, but they're really fun.

623
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,000
I like I like making designs of like and I like creating species.

624
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,080
And it's it seems like a fun thing to do.

625
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,840
So I might try focus on that.

626
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,840
Like if you don't goes down and I might OK, don't get me wrong.

627
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,520
I fully understand the appeal from the creator's perspective.

628
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,280
Like you draw a nice thing and someone pays you for it.

629
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,160
Like that that that I get.

630
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,880
Ben, we will never penetrate these childlike minds of these people buying these things.

631
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,160
They simply belong in a different universe than than we we men.

632
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,600
We true men in the real world.

633
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,640
You told plus she's OK.

634
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,000
So that's that's interesting.

635
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,160
I like that I like that you're thinking economically.

636
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,200
But what I'm wondering is that like these are cool ideas, but are these actually

637
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,120
long term economically viable things to do?

638
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
Because that is all I ever think about.

639
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,000
And how to how to achieve that?

640
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,800
I mean, I don't know like the one of the more popular

641
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,240
or most popular, at least the one I hear about the most, like they've been doing

642
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,360
that for years and like each drawing gets just more expensive each time.

643
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:34,720
So OK, I guess as long as the internet stays up, it is I mean that the thing is

644
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,840
sure people have survived before YouTube, before even Patreon, before any sort.

645
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,840
Like people used to just have PayPal links and and they would do a commission work

646
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,280
on your website or whatever.

647
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,040
They would they would do commission work.

648
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,000
And you know, people like artists will definitely be able to survive.

649
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,160
I mean, at least the good ones.

650
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,280
Like if you're good at art, you'll you'll you'll get you'll get an audience

651
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,720
and you get you get people buying your stuff.

652
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,600
OK, here's here's where I'm at with this whole discussion.

653
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,480
I have now tasted the fruit of freedom that that YouTube has provided me.

654
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,480
And I have found it succulent.

655
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,000
And so I want to continue doing it to making a living like getting my opinion

656
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,240
out there and sharing who I am.

657
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,600
And and now that I know what it's like on the outside, I cannot go back in.

658
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,160
I when I think of a like a lifetime spent continuing like as my at my programmer job,

659
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,880
it would not be horrible.

660
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,600
But it'd be like that episode of Star Trek,

661
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,400
the next generation where Picard like goes back and changes something in his

662
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,680
past a little bit and he ends up as like a shitty, worthless, not captain.

663
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,960
He's like a science engineer.

664
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,640
It's terrible. Oh, he's just he's just like a sad.

665
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,280
He's just living like a depressing, sad life where he didn't achieve his

666
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,920
potential. And I when I think about that, I would rather die.

667
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:53,600
So I will do whatever is necessary to not only I do not want to just survive

668
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,760
as a artist, I want to live, I want to thrive as an artist.

669
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,920
I hear you.

670
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,920
I want to hear what Mage has to say about please, please.

671
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,320
You say you say YouTube is freedom.

672
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,560
But I say YouTube is a cage like any other, just maybe more spacious.

673
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,320
Oh, well, I mean, that's juicy in what terms.

674
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,760
It all depends on how you do it, you know, like perhaps you make an argument

675
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,720
based on the way that like you have it.

676
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,600
You have to do like Mia Mavva or we Agua.

677
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
And that's like not exactly what you want to be doing.

678
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,160
But you have to do it.

679
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,560
No, Mage, tell us more about the cage.

680
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,240
So long as you're reliant on the Mage cage.

681
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,680
So long as you're reliant on YouTube as your source of income, you are, you know,

682
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,640
in the cage of YouTube, you have to keep producing.

683
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,400
I'm about to fucking dismantle you on an atomic level.

684
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,600
You're you're you're you're beholden to to what the people want to see.

685
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,400
You have to keep delivering what the people want to see.

686
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,480
You need to entirely true, entirely true.

687
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,040
But, Mage, you have no fucking idea what it's like to be a corporate tool.

688
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,520
You have no idea what it's like to go into work every day and be afraid of the

689
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,280
people in charge of you because you're afraid you're not living up to their

690
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,480
expectations and to be at their mercy to do whatever the fuck they want to do with you.

691
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,440
Whereas when I am working on YouTube, I do both of these things.

692
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,640
I do both of these things.

693
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,240
And YouTube gives me such a sense of freedom and personal empowerment because I

694
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
am running my own ship.

695
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,600
It is the entrepreneurial spirit that I crave more than anything else.

696
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,640
It gives me purpose and rewards me in life and gives me control over succeeding by

697
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,080
how hard I work at things that I actually want to be doing.

698
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,960
And to compare those two, to say that they are the same fucking thing just proves

699
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,800
that you have no fucking idea what you're talking about.

700
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,200
I'm not saying it's the same thing.

701
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,920
Also, side note, I do know what you're talking about.

702
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,520
I have worked in the workforce before, but yeah, so noted.

703
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm not saying it's the same thing.

704
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,720
I'm just saying it's still a cage in a way.

705
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,080
It might be more spacious and more grants more freedom, but in a way, it's still a cage.

706
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,760
Major, I will happily grant you that life is a cage.

707
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,960
Exactly. Life is a cage and death is the key.

708
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,440
We are all trapped by the crew.

709
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
We're all trapped.

710
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,560
Look, man, we've really come a long way today.

711
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,440
You've covered some real ground here.

712
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,640
I never stated whether or not being in a cage is bad.

713
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,280
By the way, Major, I wasn't actually mad at you.

714
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,920
I was just speaking emphatically.

715
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,080
I know, I know, I'm aware.

716
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,040
I can sense the mood.

717
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:31,240
I'm just, I wasn't saying it was bad or good or like looking down on your knee.

718
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,400
I was just making a statement that in a way, it's still a cage.

719
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, OK, I'm totally with you on that.

720
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,160
Well, here's what I think, like the freedom of YouTube.

721
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,320
Like, OK, you might be some schmuck and you're like, hey,

722
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,640
making videos where I cut through things with a really hot knife is really popular.

723
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,000
So I'm going to do that and then you do it and it's really popular.

724
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,360
OK, well, now my living is cutting things with a hot knife.

725
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,280
So I'm going to do that.

726
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,120
I'm going to do that from from nine to five every morning and I got to keep doing it.

727
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,640
And, you know, I'm sure that would suck and that would be a cage.

728
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,680
But like, but what if you construct your own cage to your own specifications?

729
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Like, what if you go out there and you're like, here's what I'm making

730
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,720
and this is what I want to make and it just, you know, and people like it.

731
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,560
And like, so there you like you like you are beholden to continue producing the content.

732
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,360
But if it's the content that you want to be making, that the people also want to see,

733
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,680
then yeah, it's a cage.

734
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,560
But it's a cage of your own.

735
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,880
I have a cool metaphor for this.

736
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,760
It's like, and you can leave when you want.

737
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,920
The more spacious the cage you want, the more expensive it is to maintain.

738
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,440
Like, like, like if you've got a huge cage, you can do whatever you want,

739
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,200
but you're going to have to, you know, you need a lot of money to have

740
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,880
like the ultimate freedom, you know, I mean, they're less money.

741
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,640
You have the smaller the cage there.

742
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,240
There is major. You're right.

743
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,800
I think we're speaking on slightly different scales here, but you're right.

744
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,720
There is no true freedom in this world.

745
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,320
We there are things that you will never be able to avoid doing.

746
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,200
You always have to work to support yourself in some way or another.

747
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,360
Or I mean, if you don't, then you're if you're living like a like a socialist

748
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,960
style life where like everyone else is supporting you, then you just like you

749
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,280
don't have control and that's bad in many ways as well, as well as I don't

750
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,120
think it's economically sustainable long term for like other people to support

751
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,440
people like that in a mass scale, but that doesn't matter.

752
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,240
I totally agree.

753
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,280
But like Ben was saying, it's just I'm doing both of these things right now.

754
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,200
And not only do I feel like I prefer one over the other, it's it's the sense

755
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,200
of empowerment, which leads to a much greater rate of productivity doing one

756
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,480
that is that is such a tangibly better way to do things.

757
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,040
And I can see myself growing as I do it.

758
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,800
And I just like my whole life, my whole life, I've been hating myself

759
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,680
because I would never able to like commit to doing things.

760
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,120
And now I finally stumbled upon the one thing that I actually don't need

761
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,680
to like beat myself up to keep doing, I just find myself doing it.

762
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,160
And so to live my life in that way will will will definitely just be a more

763
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,200
pleasant experience.

764
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,120
I totally agree.

765
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,560
It is not total freedom.

766
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,040
None of us have total freedom in the world, but it's closer and that's that's

767
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,960
all. But if you love your but if you love your work, if you love your work,

768
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,320
it might be a cage, but it doesn't feel like one.

769
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,800
Humans need suffering.

770
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,920
Humans need to suffer in order to maintain their their it's like you have

771
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,640
to you have to have resistance in this world or you never grow.

772
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,680
You have to have a challenge in your life.

773
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,400
I am like I totally relate to you because, you know, I'm also in the YouTube

774
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,840
cage, but I kind of like you here, you know, I do.

775
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,080
Yeah, we find it generally pleasant so far so far.

776
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,240
OK, all right.

777
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,000
So we're on the same page.

778
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,400
Generally, I mean, it's like like when I when I sit down to draw a page,

779
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,600
it's like, oh, I got to do this.

780
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,360
Yeah, I wouldn't say like like the work like the work is still work.

781
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,240
But it's just that the the the gratification of finishing it and putting

782
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,640
it out there is worth it.

783
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,840
And so that's what I've chosen other job.

784
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,400
I'd rather be doing other.

785
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,360
Yeah, right.

786
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,080
Yeah, and like Ben's Ben's made a physical comic now.

787
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:57,920
He's done it.

788
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,960
He's like that will be there forever, both online and in it's it's real.

789
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,800
It's in real life.

790
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,840
And he did it.

791
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,880
He put in the effort.

792
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,040
Now he's got something to show for it and he's going to be able to at least

793
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,280
make some money off of doing it.

794
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,120
So yeah, it just it just it's such a better feeling.

795
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,280
Exactly how I always wanted my life to be.

796
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,600
And it's it's getting there.

797
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,800
Any way that we can sort of structure society in a way that things are

798
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,360
sustainable long term and people are the happiest and doing the things that they

799
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,760
want to be doing with their lives.

800
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,840
That certainly is the direction I prefer to steer into.

801
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,160
Yeah.

802
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,320
And things like YouTube are useful tools for getting there, I think.

803
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,320
So I I mean, YouTube, for all these reasons of like the growth potential

804
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,560
that it has, like I would be very sad to say YouTube crumble, but I would be

805
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,600
absolutely willing to work to put in my fair share of the effort to like help

806
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,800
support YouTube if it's by like paying the fees that I have to to host my content.

807
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,360
I will find a way to make it work.

808
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,480
I'll do whatever it takes.

809
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,080
I'm I'm in this for the long haul and and if YouTube doesn't eat crumble,

810
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,520
I will find some other way to do it.

811
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,680
I'll go to daily motion.

812
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,200
I'll I'll do whatever else.

813
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,160
Maybe I'll need to totally change the kind of content I make.

814
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,680
If so, I will do it.

815
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,840
But yeah, like we we Agua and me and Maffova were created because of how

816
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,440
YouTube works and the way that I wanted to steer into what works on YouTube.

817
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,560
And I would be happy to steer out and do something else, you know,

818
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,040
if it if it worked better.

819
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,840
In I like the series, though.

820
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,840
I hope I hope to be last.

821
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,840
Me too. Me too.

822
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,440
So have we have we all said what we're what we do if YouTube crumbled?

823
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,160
I think we did.

824
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,720
Have we have we all have we all set our our our take on the topic?

825
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,960
Yeah. Now is there is there any anything else to say on the matter?

826
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,240
I mean, I think none of us actually want YouTube to go away.

827
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,280
We're all obviously happy to have it here.

828
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,240
Yeah, like even if even if YouTube

829
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,400
just decides to get rid of ad revenue entirely so that it can support itself,

830
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,360
I would be OK with that because I like putting a funny video up for like

831
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,680
just a little joke and to have people go, oh, I get it.

832
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,120
Yes, same as most popular video is demonetized and I don't get shit for it.

833
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:12,520
So I don't like I don't like the fact that someone else is earning money

834
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,640
because of it from it.

835
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,320
But like, if no one was earning money from it, neither me nor anyone else.

836
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,480
Like, yeah, sure. OK, that's misery loves company.

837
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,040
Do you think Patreon would?

838
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,320
I mean, OK, I don't think that Patreon would have started without YouTube.

839
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,280
But now that it's here, I wonder I wonder if YouTube dying would end Patreon

840
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,280
or if Patreon would just keep on going in its own.

841
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,440
Keep on going because a lot of artists who just like, you know,

842
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,960
draw comics or whatever and don't even touch YouTube are being supported on Patreon.

843
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,400
So they are.

844
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,240
Do you do you think I I feel like a lot of what people support on Patreon

845
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,040
is YouTube content?

846
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,640
I'm sure that's a large part of it. Yeah.

847
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,120
Yeah, I mean, now it is a large part.

848
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,880
But I think the majority is like weird porn shit.

849
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,880
So they're not for long.

850
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,000
Not a Jack Conti has anything to say about it.

851
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,360
Jack sexually repressed Conti.

852
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,400
Yes, my my hero, my hero.

853
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,160
All right, yeah, I don't know.

854
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,560
I think it'll continue to exist for the next while.

855
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,440
Let's let's just give our predictions.

856
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,200
What do we think is actually going to happen to YouTube?

857
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,160
Because guys like Digi and I think to do maybe I've been saying that like

858
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,800
they see it dying in like the next several years based on this shit.

859
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,560
What do you guys think is actually going to happen?

860
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,240
I see ad revenue just thinning and thinning

861
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,680
and getting less and less.

862
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,360
You know, the adpocalypse won't just the adpocalypse won't really recover.

863
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,640
But I feel like it'll it'll it'll be around for maybe another five years.

864
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,400
I don't know beyond that.

865
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:53,280
But I feel like it's just about to die right now.

866
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,440
Like I feel like it's got some power left.

867
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,160
It's just I can't see beyond five years with my mind brain.

868
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,160
Ben, what do you think?

869
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,280
What do I think is going to happen to YouTube?

870
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,640
Yeah, what's your prediction for actual the fate?

871
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,280
Oh, man, I mean, do you think it'll crumble in the end?

872
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,600
It's hard for me to imagine it ever going away.

873
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,920
But if it's operating, it'll like I don't see how it can just

874
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,960
continue to operate at a loss forever.

875
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,920
Well, I mean, if Google's other businesses just make enough money,

876
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,720
theoretically, YouTube could operate at a loss forever.

877
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,320
Yeah, but why would they?

878
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,640
That's a good I don't know.

879
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,640
I don't know.

880
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,360
I mean, maybe YouTube really does like work in indirect ways

881
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,760
to support the other businesses.

882
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,440
It must.

883
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,000
Right.

884
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,880
It's like it must serve some purpose.

885
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:42,480
Yeah.

886
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,480
YouTube Red is like if YouTube Red actually really, you know,

887
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,360
takes hold and everybody gets it because the stuff that you can get

888
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,720
with YouTube Red is so good that you can't live without it.

889
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,840
Then YouTube will be saved.

890
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,960
But I don't know whether that will actually work.

891
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,680
Because even though, like, you know, Vsauce has his YouTube Red series,

892
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,880
I kind of want to see all of those, but I also don't care enough.

893
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,240
Well, here's OK.

894
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,320
I guess here's my prediction.

895
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,080
I don't see YouTube ever just going away.

896
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,640
It'll probably continue to do what it's always done and like change

897
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,280
its algorithm all the time and make everyone mad and keep changing

898
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,120
how it works behind everyone's back with no with no announcement given.

899
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,440
I think that probably a successor will come along at some point

900
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,480
that will do right all the things that everyone hates about YouTube.

901
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,280
And like I because because nobody like everyone complains about YouTube

902
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,680
all the time. Some eventually like I think eventually

903
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,280
like with more and more YouTube alternate like with like I don't know

904
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,280
Netflix and and I feel I think you do will probably lose traction

905
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:53,000
until it becomes less enough less of a monolith that something else can can come

906
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,120
in and feel like the place that it once held and maybe and maybe it'll be better.

907
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,560
I feel like the only competitor would be Facebook.

908
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,440
If Facebook video actually started.

909
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,880
Yeah, they're working on like pushing that real real hard down our throats.

910
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,520
Please not.

911
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,200
Then everybody would go over there because.

912
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,360
Yeah, but that's like the huge monolithic website

913
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,000
that might have the money to support such an such an amount of stuff.

914
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,240
But is this what we want?

915
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,440
Just juggernaut companies like the literally the biggest in the world

916
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,200
to just trade hosting of like video stuff.

917
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,400
What else could it work?

918
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,520
I don't I mean, everyone pays their own way.

919
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,960
They pay the I made a vlog the other day.

920
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,640
The other the other week about like what could solve it.

921
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,760
And it would be science.

922
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,880
It would be making making really, really cheap.

923
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:51,440
Like making the ability to host and and, you know, display a video

924
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,880
incredibly cheap to the point where it doesn't even matter anymore,

925
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,760
which it does get every year, which we are, which we are marching towards steadily.

926
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,000
Sure, surely, but surely.

927
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,120
Yeah, and I was going to say like the way I see is possibly to fix this

928
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,760
is just YouTube, just I mean YouTube or anyone else.

929
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,640
There's a service that just simply does not host video.

930
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,760
It is simply an act.

931
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,040
It works exactly like YouTube, but you got to supply the connection

932
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,040
to your videos to whatever way it's just the comments section.

933
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,160
But I mean, all the algorithm stuff, all that stuff still works.

934
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,800
But like you you are the one who pays the weight of like supporting your content

935
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,240
and whatever manage in a whatever way that has to be done.

936
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,920
Like if people could do that, I agree.

937
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,880
Then that definitely way raises the like the the skill floor.

938
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,720
But nonetheless, it could be it's just one one idea.

939
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,360
I mean, sort of with what Ben said, I I I expect to maybe one day

940
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,600
for for some something else to take over, not any time soon.

941
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,200
But like I feel like the story was like, you know, my space in Facebook

942
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,720
is going to repeat itself with you.

943
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,280
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

944
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,000
I've got it. I've got the solution.

945
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,840
OK, now that that worthless pilot trash net neutrality is gone,

946
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,120
what we can do now is we can have YouTube can host like videos for free.

947
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:09,120
And the dragon that is now that that beast is out of our sights,

948
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,240
that Leviathan is dead on the ocean floor.

949
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,680
We can now what we can do is YouTube can itself host content for free,

950
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,960
but that would be on the slow shitty lanes that cost a little bit of money.

951
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,680
Whereas everyone like everyone who wants to like do their own shit

952
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,000
can pay YouTube for like the faster upload speeds.

953
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,280
And so they can be an economic structure here where like the content

954
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,200
that people really want to see is on the fast lanes that they themselves contribute to.

955
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,400
Therefore, everyone can still have their free shitty content.

956
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,360
It'll just take longer to load and whatnot.

957
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,040
I'm just making me and hypocrite.

958
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,080
Thank you, Ajit Pai. Thank you.

959
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,680
Me and hypocrite are free from this, right?

960
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,280
For now. For now.

961
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,360
I honestly don't know. I don't even know.

962
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:56,480
I mean, I don't know anything about it, so I won't talk as if I do.

963
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,560
But I feel like that's that's an American problem

964
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,480
that won't affect us directly, but it will affect the fact

965
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,920
that we can't see American content creators anymore as much.

966
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,720
Oh, that's true.

967
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,720
Like doom and gloom ways, like, oh, all of America is like turned off.

968
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,200
And we still have like UK vloggers.

969
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:16,920
Oh, good.

970
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,200
Everyone knows that people only watch YouTube

971
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,400
so they can fantasize about living in America.

972
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,040
The greatest country in the world.

973
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,120
And then and then a PCP HQ will come to the UK at last.

974
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,480
You don't have to lift a fucking finger. Of course.

975
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,800
Of course. That's the master plan.

976
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,920
By the way, I am Ajit Pai.

977
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,680
You guys may have orchestrated this whole thing.

978
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,200
You're working behind the scenes like you see under Ajit Pai's robe.

979
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,320
There's a small diminutive, a small Hagrid on top of major shoulders

980
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,240
forming Ajit Pai, the flesh golem.

981
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,320
OK, now let's to close this discussion.

982
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,360
I'd like to read you one more definition from Urban Dictionary.

983
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,360
Oh, few. OK, here we go.

984
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,840
I didn't get my fix yet.

985
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,560
The word is actually used in the definition itself,

986
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,760
which is the cardinal sin.

987
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,880
But nonetheless, the word is at the end.

988
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,200
OK, here we go.

989
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,680
When good things about you are searched for and found

990
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,520
through the YouTube search engine, you are YouTube-alicious.

991
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,360
And here's the example.

992
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,400
Donald Trump is very YouTube-alicious.

993
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,760
Wow, that's very illustrative.

994
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,480
All right, I think that's it. Shall we go to questions?

995
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,400
I'm shell shocked by that one.

996
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,400
I know.

997
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,400
Oh, Ajit Pai, a.k.a. Mage and Gib, collectively.

998
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,520
You guys, you guys.

999
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,000
That's our Jamfusion.

1000
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Oh, yeah.

1001
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,480
Oh, no.

1002
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,680
Oh, my God.

1003
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,280
And your weapon is the giant Reese's Cup mug

1004
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,000
that he wields with such skill and grace.

1005
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,280
Got to do the Harlem Shake.

1006
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,000
We've got a fidget spinner.

1007
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,480
That's our jammed weapon.

1008
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,880
Oh, my God. That's our attack.

1009
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,720
Disgusting.

1010
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,120
What a disgusting display.

1011
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,160
OK, here's a question, a pity question,

1012
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,560
from our friends on Twitter, using hashtag AskPCP.

1013
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,800
This one's from at Daniellius, I believe.

1014
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,280
And it's relevant to what we've just been discussing.

1015
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,360
If the apocalypse happened today, how would it happen?

1016
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,920
Or what would you like it to happen?

1017
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,960
OK, that's the letter.

1018
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,440
I want to answer this question

1019
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,720
because this has been a religion for a while now

1020
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,440
and no one has picked up on it.

1021
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,360
I want a meteor to strike Earth and annihilate it

1022
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,360
in one fell swoop.

1023
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,480
Oh, dude, I love Homestuck as well.

1024
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,080
And that's completely unrelated to Homestuck, though.

1025
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,880
I would, OK, I would much rather

1026
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,240
the world be destroyed than die, personally.

1027
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,920
I would much rather the world end with me.

1028
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,920
You know, as Christopher Hitchens so elegantly put,

1029
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,320
the cruellest thing about death is not that you have to leave the party.

1030
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,240
It's that the party goes on without you.

1031
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,640
Yeah, I want I indeed want that Earth fucking destroyed.

1032
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,000
Well, guys, I don't think it's exactly Kickstarter to end the world.

1033
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,240
I would like to indeed.

1034
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,840
And I would like to point out that this is, in fact,

1035
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,240
this is, in fact, the plot of Final Fantasy Nine

1036
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,800
and Kuja's entire motivation as a character.

1037
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:30,200
So shout out to our boy, our fellow our fellow popcorn nihilist, Kuja.

1038
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,640
Now, this is terrible.

1039
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,800
This is terrible.

1040
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,440
Oh, wait, wait, I just want to say,

1041
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,760
if I want I want the apocalypse to be a little green aliens come

1042
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,120
and just shoot us, that will be cute.

1043
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,960
That would be cute.

1044
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,320
OK, while you're while you're going through our questions,

1045
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,120
I'll I'll ask a question from the patron lounge.

1046
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,520
By sure. Sure.

1047
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,160
Are you in favor or against the term law?

1048
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,280
As in League of Legends or very against League of Legends.

1049
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,480
I I. OK, I think that sometimes I really show my age

1050
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,920
because I will just type lull into messages.

1051
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,920
And I think that that's not cool anymore, but I've been doing it for.

1052
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,120
No, I think lull is fine.

1053
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,840
Saying kek is something I could I would never get into.

1054
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,640
The cool kids are all saying kek now.

1055
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,720
We're all doing. Sometimes I say kek.

1056
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,840
I don't know which makes me feel dirtier.

1057
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,040
I would prefer to stay.

1058
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,840
It's like lull is vanilla ice cream.

1059
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:33,720
You know, kek is like the new like crazy like popping candy thing

1060
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,240
that everyone's got kek is like that guy who orders

1061
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,120
like forbidden chocolate ice cream and then opens up several pixie sticks

1062
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,440
and sprinkles them on top and crushes up M&M's and, you know, kek is kek is

1063
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,320
kek is the young Ben St in the mall food court going up to the Dairy Queen

1064
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,640
and saying, hey, make me a blizzard, but put these nerds into it instead.

1065
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,520
Exactly.

1066
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,680
Exactly. Personally, personally, I do test lull

1067
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,080
and I only use it ironically when I want to be obnoxious.

1068
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,560
I know you don't have notice.

1069
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,080
I wish I had your courage.

1070
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,360
I wish I had the courage to abandon lull.

1071
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,360
Did you have you guys notice that I did you like always types lull in all caps?

1072
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,240
Have you noticed this? I've noticed this.

1073
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,560
I'm not just down with Digi.

1074
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,040
Yeah, it looks like it's down to Digi.

1075
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,400
It looks like he's really excitedly laughing,

1076
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,320
but I don't think he's actually that excited about it.

1077
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,320
I think it's a normal level.

1078
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,880
It's disingenuous. It's very confusing.

1079
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,560
Yeah, what the fuck, dude?

1080
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,560
Get your shit together.

1081
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,680
I never used. No, I'm defending lull.

1082
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:34,000
Lull is is my thick crust pizza in this in this debate.

1083
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,440
You'll never change my mind.

1084
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,080
Lull is the funniest.

1085
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,800
Oh, it makes me lull lull lull every time I do test lull.

1086
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,920
I never used it, but recently I started using it only to be obnoxious

1087
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,240
because I find it obnoxious.

1088
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,760
There's nothing more obnoxious than someone saying lull at the end of your

1089
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,400
you can't you can't spell you can't spell

1090
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,680
with cake. That's stupid.

1091
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,240
I guess I guess you got a point.

1092
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,040
You got us there.

1093
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,040
It's not a song.

1094
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,760
Yeah, you win this round.

1095
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,880
All right.

1096
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,560
Hey, I've got another question that I that I like from at Luke Chef 99.

1097
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,760
It's everyone. I know that.

1098
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,280
Oh, you do. What is his what's his reputation on the streets?

1099
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,320
Well, I've talked to him and he I think he just I think he just pledged to my

1100
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,320
Kickstarter.

1101
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,760
Well, isn't that interesting?

1102
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,600
Because his question is, is everyone excited for Ben to finally get his

1103
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,160
oculus rift long last?

1104
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,240
But no, no, I will I'll be I'll be I'll you got me.

1105
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,400
You got me. We're going.

1106
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,240
We're going the final stretch goal will be Vapors VR, just like Munchie says.

1107
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,840
Yeah, yeah.

1108
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:48,440
Then only only on please add buying an oculus ripped to your incentives.

1109
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,760
Maybe I will.

1110
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,880
Maybe if I just run it, maybe if it just takes off beyond my wildest

1111
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,800
yeah, put it like nine thousand one nine thousand one dollars and we'll buy

1112
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:02,040
an oculus rift, I did I did quite like my suggestion of a stretch goal for

1113
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,320
nine thousand one dollars, which was stretch your neck out under the guillotine

1114
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,200
blade. That was my I think that's a good one.

1115
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,840
All right, well, nine thousand two dollars will be that's good.

1116
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,960
That's good.

1117
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,200
So I can retreat to VR after death.

1118
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,280
That's that's my plan.

1119
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,440
My severed head will fall right into those goggles.

1120
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,800
And here's just like the same question.

1121
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,800
But at Monkey Away asks, also, did you expect Ben's Kickstarter to do so well?

1122
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,240
And what did you pledge?

1123
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,720
Did you guys pledge to Ben's Kickstarter?

1124
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,040
I did. I was the first guy to pledge 25 bucks.

1125
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,160
Really? The first one for the book and the pin.

1126
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,440
You know, that pin looks great.

1127
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,880
It's so good. I know.

1128
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1129
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,400
Yeah. Fuck yeah.

1130
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,400
There's there's so nice.

1131
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,400
They're shiny.

1132
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,640
You know, what's great about PCP Kickstarter's, I just noticed, is that

1133
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,960
they all have really such humble asks and then people just always like

1134
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,200
shatter them immediately, which is great.

1135
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,240
Which Ben clearly showed like exactly what needed to be like what the money

1136
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,800
was going toward and in a totally, you know, transparent way.

1137
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,600
And like it was just easily broken and it's just it just keeps going.

1138
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,000
People. Yeah, I cannot like, you know, I was I was going to plug it at the end,

1139
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,200
but I guess I'll just say it now.

1140
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,000
Like I can't I can't fucking believe it hit the goal in 10

1141
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,200
hours and it's well on its way to its first stretch goal.

1142
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,480
I'm so fucking stoked about it and thank you, everyone that donated.

1143
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,960
And I'm just I'm just going to give myself a little Christmas,

1144
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,440
an early Christmas present.

1145
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,240
I'll link in the description because it's going on.

1146
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,560
It's going on now, right?

1147
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,040
OK, it's it's cool if I link my Kickstarter in the description of this video.

1148
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,320
Right. I got no problem with that.

1149
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,880
I got no problem with that.

1150
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,720
And here is just a related question.

1151
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,520
Monkey away.

1152
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,000
Also, Ash, what do you want for Christmas?

1153
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,200
It is Christmas Eve.

1154
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,760
This is coming out, everybody.

1155
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,080
Like last week, did we?

1156
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,920
Yeah, I think last podcast, like I said, I said I was torn between

1157
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,760
like getting like a hoping for a switch or a PS4.

1158
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,120
Oh, that's right. We did.

1159
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,160
OK, well, anyone who wasn't on last time, was it with Ben?

1160
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,120
Were you not on?

1161
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,640
I know I was on last week.

1162
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,320
OK, well, this is a terrible mistake.

1163
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,080
I fucked up massively.

1164
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,800
I want for Halloween.

1165
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,080
I want to get fucked on Halloween.

1166
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,960
I want paydays. I want I want paydays to the best.

1167
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,480
They're the best part.

1168
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,080
Yeah, paydays.

1169
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,640
I want I want a real payday.

1170
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,080
You know what I mean?

1171
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,400
I'm going to be hitting up my local bank, if you know what I'm saying.

1172
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,760
It's going to be a big payday for me with a fucking balaclava on

1173
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,480
and and and and and it's going to be an explosive with the orange part at the end.

1174
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,840
So it's going to be some men just want to watch the world burn.

1175
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,040
I'm going to reenact the dark night of that.

1176
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,160
I will reenact the dark night in this bank.

1177
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,760
Yes, I am.

1178
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,880
If you could do something, I would do it for free.

1179
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,000
For Halloween, I want clowns to disappear.

1180
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,440
Just like for the last Halloween.

1181
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,440
This is Halloween.

1182
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,760
Clowns will just multiply.

1183
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,440
May the greatest gift for mage is a world without laughter.

1184
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,680
Who laughs at clowns?

1185
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,680
Did you did you guys see me every day by any chance?

1186
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,400
Because I actually thought it was pretty pretty dope.

1187
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,400
I like what?

1188
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,360
The new it, the it remake.

1189
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,680
No, I didn't see it.

1190
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,000
I'd recommend it. I'd recommend it.

1191
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,680
I liked it.

1192
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,560
He looks like a giant baby head.

1193
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,640
I hate it.

1194
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,400
He I mean, he looks goofy and retarded.

1195
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,600
He absolutely does.

1196
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,400
But it is still pretty.

1197
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,080
Is is the sequel to it?

1198
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,080
It's within a post.

1199
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,920
Monty Python's Flying Circus.

1200
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,320
Yes, that's what it is.

1201
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,280
I have it's like alien and aliens.

1202
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:39,200
It's it and it's a question I want to answer.

1203
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,600
It's by a G shoot or a shoot.

1204
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,760
Not sure how to pronounce that in the patron lounge.

1205
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,600
And they're like, what's the most efficient emoji?

1206
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,320
And I just like for people who know about those blobs,

1207
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:55,000
like there's like this really cute blob that has like the o-woe face

1208
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,640
and it has like tiny arms going up, like grab your little arms.

1209
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,360
And it's like the best emoji and I'm going to send it to Bennett.

1210
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,080
Please, please edit this into the podcast.

1211
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,720
I know I'm asking the impossible.

1212
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,800
You are. No, no, no, I'm going to.

1213
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,040
No, I'll do it. I'll do it.

1214
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,040
I honor I honor the requests of my PCP comment.

1215
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,680
It is the best emoji.

1216
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,840
If you do not see this emoji on screen,

1217
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,600
please remove your pledge from Ben's Kickstarter

1218
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,040
and delete your pledge to his patron and all other, you know,

1219
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,040
give them to me as compensation for emotional trauma

1220
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,160
that private message private message me.

1221
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,080
So I don't forget.

1222
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,400
Yes, it's the best emoji.

1223
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,360
It's the most efficient.

1224
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,840
It's the best. It's the greatest.

1225
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,120
I cannot live without it.

1226
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,400
OK, I've got I've got I've got one last question here

1227
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:43,440
that I that I absolutely love from our from our pity section on Twitter.

1228
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:48,800
At Eskimo Bob, two asks, what is the best kind of milk?

1229
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,440
Two percent, whole, etc.

1230
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,840
I like chocolate, strawberry and whatnot.

1231
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,240
Unpopular opinion.

1232
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,320
I actually like skim milk.

1233
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,720
I skim skim.

1234
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,520
I find skim.

1235
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,800
I find skim milk to be refreshing and it's still nutritious.

1236
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,760
And I don't mind that it's not like thick.

1237
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,320
I like that I can just drink it kind of like water.

1238
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,920
I think a lot of people think it's disgusting, but I don't think so.

1239
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,000
I think I think semi skimmed.

1240
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,840
I semi skimmed one percent or something.

1241
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,120
Or is that even more skim?

1242
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,080
I don't know. I just buy in the UK.

1243
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,480
There's there's whole milk skimmed milk and semi skimmed.

1244
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,000
Yeah. OK. No.

1245
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,280
I don't know what fucking you fucking savages.

1246
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,720
There's there's whole skim one percent and two percent.

1247
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,120
I don't know.

1248
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,040
The first time I heard like one percent milk,

1249
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,360
it becomes like wait, no, but then there's one percent.

1250
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,240
And then 90, 99 percent water.

1251
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,120
Wait, then there's the dark souls of milk cream top milk.

1252
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,280
You guys know what the fuck is that cream top milk is unskimmed milk

1253
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,960
that just has the cream that comes to the top of the bottle.

1254
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,680
And I knew I knew I knew someone once who would just put her finger in

1255
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,000
and scoop out the cream and just eat and just like eat the cream off the top.

1256
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,040
Yeah, it was just like a treat for I hated it.

1257
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,240
That goes against everything I've ever.

1258
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,480
I don't know why.

1259
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,680
That's all known laws of physics.

1260
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,000
I don't know why I don't know why you would buy cream top milk.

1261
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It just seems like a waste unless you're a weirdo and you just want to love.

1262
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,080
I just want to eat a dollop of unsweetened cream off the top.

1263
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,840
Unbelievable milk, really hard.

1264
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,760
Like it's it does form a little bit like that.

1265
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1266
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,080
Oh, the skim on top.

1267
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,280
Yeah, it forms a bit of a skim.

1268
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,040
And I hate that skim I detested.

1269
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,800
I hate that I hate it on the top.

1270
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,080
Yeah, it's so gross.

1271
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,320
I don't know why, but it is.

1272
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,640
I mean, I associate stuff like that with like the milk has gone off

1273
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,400
and now you can see lumps.

1274
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,920
Is anyone here going to chime in for strawberry milk or chocolate milk at all?

1275
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,040
Banana milk, banana, banana milk.

1276
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,040
I know we're increasing the complexity of this question

1277
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,480
exponentially by introducing these these other factors.

1278
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,640
I was I was shocked and appalled because when I was in Europe,

1279
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,800
I realized that there are like other milks because in America in America,

1280
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,560
it's like strawberry, chocolate and sometimes coffee.

1281
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,440
Those are the flavors.

1282
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,960
But in in Europe, I saw like like raspberry milk was a thing.

1283
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,280
OK, OK. In a lot of ways.

1284
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,880
And I remember, oh, in cookie clicker, in cookie clicker,

1285
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,360
you can upgrade your milk and the milk turns pink.

1286
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,640
And I assumed that it was strawberry, but I read like some some dev log or something.

1287
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,080
And it's actually raspberry milk.

1288
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,000
And I guess it's because or teal is French.

1289
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,240
And I guess in France, raspberry milk is more common.

1290
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,720
What the fuck?

1291
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:21,240
Incidentally, when you evolve your your milk high enough in cookie clicker,

1292
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,760
it becomes orange juice.

1293
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,120
So I'm just going to say orange juice is the best milk.

1294
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,960
Yeah, without a doubt, without a doubt.

1295
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,280
Do you guys like the way it looked?

1296
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,240
Cream top milk, the Dark Souls of milk.

1297
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,120
I'm really proud of that.

1298
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,960
And I just want to call back to that and make sure that gets.

1299
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,920
Yes, quite quite apt.

1300
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,800
Quite apt indeed.

1301
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,040
And the Dark Souls, too, of milk is cheese.

1302
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,480
Impenetrable and dense and a nightmare to deal with.

1303
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,040
Yeah, well, I'll agree.

1304
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,920
Question. Yes, mage. Yeah.

1305
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,000
Having a question.

1306
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,400
OK, but on patronage by Squidmiku,

1307
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,960
what's a holiday tradition you have?

1308
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,200
I thought it would be relevant considering this is on Christmas.

1309
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,880
OK, Christmas.

1310
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:06,080
I go around like a Viking and destroy everyone I see.

1311
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,680
Well, me and me and Nate have a bunch of family traditions.

1312
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,960
Our dad always leads us in a round of bizarre,

1313
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,480
in a nonsensical playlist of cobbled together

1314
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,360
show tunes and college fight songs that have no relation to the holiday.

1315
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,640
It's specifically related to the Holy Cross University of Boston, Massachusetts.

1316
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1317
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,920
There's some some some Yankee Doodle, Dandy,

1318
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:37,720
and like some other shit that I've never heard anywhere before or since.

1319
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,800
I don't know what these songs are.

1320
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,640
Wait, is Holy Cross actually in Boston?

1321
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,720
I have to Google this now. I think it is, maybe.

1322
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,800
It's around there. It's around there.

1323
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,680
For Boston, for Boston.

1324
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,680
The Irish one the day.

1325
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,480
Dubzinski from Dublin.

1326
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,280
Letch up from Galloway.

1327
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,160
All right, that's all it does.

1328
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,320
Lockhease of Bilski to all the try and get into Boston.

1329
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,800
For Boston, the Irish one, the day.

1330
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,800
What a bunch of bologna.

1331
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,040
You know who won the day.

1332
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,200
Boom, boom.

1333
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,760
I don't get it. I've never understood.

1334
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,400
It's always been like a bizarre, a bizarre, like mystery to me.

1335
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,080
I mean, we also sing still lot,

1336
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,040
which is just like a Polish celebration song.

1337
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,280
That would make sense.

1338
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,040
But then there's like show tunes and college fight songs

1339
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,400
and just some other shit.

1340
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,200
He just grew up, his family sung them.

1341
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,040
I guess.

1342
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,360
Oh, it did be fine.

1343
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,200
Simply divine when a goon sits in the presidential chair.

1344
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,720
I just can't wait.

1345
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:37,960
Won't it be great when a goon sits in the presidential chair?

1346
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,880
What the fuck does that song mean?

1347
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,440
Someone fucking explain that one to me.

1348
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,920
I've never understood why I sing it every birthday.

1349
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,400
What's a college fight song, though?

1350
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,880
Well, it's just like a song.

1351
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,280
We'll give a holla in a choo-chee or a rah for Holy Cross.

1352
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,480
They're just singing like, yeah, go Holy Cross football team.

1353
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,240
Yeah, that's it.

1354
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,120
Just like, it's weird.

1355
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:01,760
OK, so my traditions, like other than going to visit my parents

1356
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,800
for holidays because that's that thing.

1357
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,520
We have this tradition in our family.

1358
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,720
I think it's like either pagan or religious or whatever,

1359
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,440
but it's a Christmas thing.

1360
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,240
You have to have like 12 different meals on the table,

1361
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,320
but it also includes bread.

1362
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,560
So it's not like, you know, big meals.

1363
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:29,440
But it can't contain meat, but it can contain fish.

1364
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,080
So and also mushrooms.

1365
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,120
I like mushrooms, though.

1366
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,400
I believe this ritual is called vegetarian.

1367
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1368
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:43,200
It's like, there's a word, but I don't remember it in English,

1369
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,920
that I think it has something to do with religion,

1370
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,840
though I think we do break the religion of no meat

1371
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,760
by adding poultry sometimes.

1372
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,480
Is it like kosher or halal or something?

1373
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,240
No, no.

1374
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,280
I believe it's known as the holocaust.

1375
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,680
No, no, no, it's no.

1376
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,080
The original holocaust was of the dining room table.

1377
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,000
Everyone knows this.

1378
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,960
No, I think it's something to do with religion.

1379
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,000
But it's like a mix of Christianity and paganism,

1380
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:12,360
I think.

1381
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,320
I mean, hey, Christianity is like, or rather Christmas

1382
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,600
is like a pagan holiday anyway, that we like mixed

1383
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,360
with Christianity in weird ways over the years.

1384
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,160
Exactly, exactly.

1385
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,000
That tradition.

1386
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,960
It's a Lithuanian thing.

1387
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,960
I haven't heard many other countries do that.

1388
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:26,640
That's cool.

1389
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,320
Got a lot of food.

1390
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:27,880
I like that.

1391
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,680
I like that.

1392
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:33,040
Well, like you said, even a plate of bread,

1393
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,800
just sliced bread, also counts.

1394
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,240
So we always try to have like 12.

1395
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,000
And drinks also count as well.

1396
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,600
OK.

1397
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,280
So it's not as much as you think, but yeah.

1398
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,720
Incidentally, I just looked up where

1399
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,280
the College of the Holy Cross is,

1400
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,360
and it's in Worcester, Massachusetts,

1401
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,840
which is where Tom lives.

1402
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,040
So it's probably.

1403
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,760
Maybe he knows the song.

1404
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,480
Maybe he could join us.

1405
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,360
Yeah, shout out to Tom.

1406
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,080
He should have joined us, but did.

1407
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:01,960
He failed.

1408
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,680
He's deleted for life.

1409
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,720
My tradition, there's not really like anything

1410
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,800
extremely special.

1411
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,600
It's just like Christmas, family, whatever.

1412
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,160
But we never have like a family around the dinner table

1413
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,120
except like the immediate family, like mom, dad, and siblings.

1414
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,480
And that's nice.

1415
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,080
I want to ask you, because I don't know whether this

1416
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,400
is a thing in America, because I feel like somebody's

1417
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,320
called me out for it being weird, is a Christmas crackers.

1418
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,240
Are those the popper things, like the poppers?

1419
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,120
The things that you like pull.

1420
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,520
I know those from Mr. Bean.

1421
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,000
I know them from Mr. Bean specifically.

1422
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,480
All right, so it is in English, or at least the European thing.

1423
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,680
Yeah.

1424
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,720
I mean, I've seen them in America.

1425
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,880
I think I've done them in America, but they're not like.

1426
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,280
I've seen them in anime.

1427
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,360
Yeah, me too.

1428
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,160
Me too.

1429
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:48,560
Anime.

1430
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,600
I love them.

1431
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,320
Anime, famously taken place in England.

1432
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,080
That's the only place I actually ever saw them.

1433
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,400
Super wizard crackers.

1434
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:58,960
Yes.

1435
01:16:58,960 --> 01:16:59,520
Yeah.

1436
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,600
That's the one.

1437
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,800
See, I was really confused reading Harry Potter for the first time.

1438
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,360
I'm like, why are they eating all these crackers?

1439
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,280
You're going to get so many empty calories.

1440
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:11,240
Why do they hate white people so much?

1441
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,720
Oh, Hermione was always black.

1442
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,600
All right, everybody.

1443
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,760
Well, shall we?

1444
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,600
Let's wrap it up.

1445
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,240
I think we had some good questions there.

1446
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,680
We had a good discussion here.

1447
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,480
Oh, it was good.

1448
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,800
So let's go through the normal rigmarole at the end here.

1449
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,200
Thanks for listening, everybody.

01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,240
PCP shirts, it's Christmas time, people.

1470
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,360
They're going to want those PCP merch.

1471
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,200
So get in there and get mugs, get cups, get glasses,

1472
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,400
get containers, all containers of all types.

1473
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,480
Oh, and the stickers, of course.

1474
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,360
To hold your cream top milk in.

1475
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,600
And when you put your stickers on,

1476
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,360
take a picture of them and tweet them at me,

1477
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,040
because I want to know what you put your stickers on,

1478
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:30,520
and what you use them for.

1479
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,920
Yeah, we retweet people.

1480
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,120
We retweet when people have PCB merch.

1481
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,840
So if you want yourself retweeted,

1482
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,840
tweet yourself, tweet your picture right over it.

1483
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,640
If you want to be retweeted, buy our merch.

1484
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,280
Pretty much, at TPGrasinators, guys.

1485
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,800
That's the price of admission.

1486
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,360
Basically.

1487
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,440
If you want to play in the big leagues.

1488
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:52,040
And of course, our podcast is available on iTunes and the

1489
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,800
Google Play podcast app thing, which I think is slightly

1490
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,200
separate, I haven't actually looked at it.

1491
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,480
But I know we're on iTunes, so you can check us out there.

1492
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,400
And I think that covers everything.

1493
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,360
Well, one last time, I just want to say that my Kickstarter

1494
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,800
for printing physical comics of the Vapors chapter one is

1495
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,920
going on now.

1496
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,240
We got stretch goals to go.

1497
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,760
We got stretch goals for extra content and stuff.

1498
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,560
They'll be added if we reach them.

1499
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,560
We're fucking, yeah, grab yourself a copy.

1500
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,720
Grab yourself a poobah pin.

1501
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,240
The pins are fucking sick.

1502
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:29,160
The URL is kickstarter.com slash project slash 56159055

1503
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:33,080
slash the-vapors-chapter-one.

1504
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,600
That's very unwieldy, and I'm quite disappointed in it.

1505
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,600
Do you think that any kickstarters about porn

1506
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,160
have, like, vagina stretch goals?

1507
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:46,120
If you know what I'm, you see what I'm, you see what I'm

1508
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:46,880
going with that?

1509
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,880
I'm glad I put that image in your mind, everyone.

1510
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,520
I don't understand.

1511
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,160
Think about that.

1512
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,400
Think about that while you sleep at night.

1513
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,440
OK, well, anyway, thanks for listening, everybody.

1514
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,280
And we'll see you next week.

1515
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,280
Bye.

1516
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,280
Bye.

1517
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,600
Yeah.

1518
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,600
Yeah.

1519
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:08,040
I'm supposed to be working right now.

1520
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,040
But I'm not working.

1521
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,040
I'm doing nothing.

1522
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,040
My dick, I'm jerking.

1523
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,040
Myself, I'm sucking.

1524
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:21,040
I am an asshole.

1525
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,040
I am a stupid.

1526
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,040
I've got a deadline.

1527
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,040
Don't want to do it.

1528
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,040
I've got a deadline.

1529
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,040
Don't want to do it.
