1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I see the game you're playing. Alright, I'm cloning. I'm cloning.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Alright. Rowdy. Fuckers. Cop. Killers. In. A whole bunch of games. The whole gaggle.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Wait, wait, wait. Nope, that's a spoiler. No, we're not playing that game just yet. Whoops.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What a blunder. What an unbelievable blunder.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, that's a secret for later. You don't fucking... Anyway, we're playing fucking...

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're playing the game that's... We're playing the hit new game Road Toads by Charlie Batten,

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
aka Hippo's brother. Yeah, Hippo's younger brother, I believe.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, younger brother. His younger... Jesus. Is that loud?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, a little bit, for me at least. Let me hear something.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, that's very loud. I always get confused. I'm pretty sure that Charlie is his youngest brother,

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and Henry is the middle one, although I might have them flipped around. I might have them flipped around.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You never know what those fucking three little pigs...

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I know that...

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All I know is that they're tasty, and I shall blow their house down.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I've never... I don't think I've ever spoken to Charlie, but Henry is really funny.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Henry, aka HGB guy, is fucking hilarious, and I love him.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
HGB guy is great. He was a big fan of me and the Japanese Juggalo, though I haven't heard from him in a really long time,

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
so he might not think I'm cool anymore, or he might just be gone forever.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I haven't even heard a peep out of him for like six months.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, yeah.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He was in The Rowdyfuckers, but then when Endless War was brutally attacked and subdued by the Megaslam,

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
he kind of fell off the map, which, you know, makes sense. Societies and ruins.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's really been a real drag to move our entire PC gaming rig down here in the sewers with all the raw and the stench,

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but you know, we're making do.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But whether our entire society and civilization has collapsed or not, we have to record this let's play due to contractual obligations,

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
so you're getting the show on the extremely regular basis that we record it. You're getting this.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah, I mean, we have to... Wait, am I still recording? Yes, I am recording. Okay, that's good. A good thing.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, but you know, we have to do it because the only color, the only color that exists in the world anymore is in the form of video games.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So without it, I mean, life would... Shit, I control all deleted off the game, and now my cursor is gone, and I can't select anything.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Jesus. Alright, I'm gonna...

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Rain? No, no, no. Whether it's snow, hail, sleet, shine, or rain, we will maybe record a podcast or let's play one day.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Like, no matter what elements are against us, we may choose to record a let's play. That's how dedicated we are to this.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Maybe. It could happen. Alright, let's do Cool Race. Should I be an egg? Should I be a car, an egg, or a bird?

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Be the bird. Is that not a toad? Is that not what that is? What is this game?

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Uh, okay, here we go. Drive through the yellow beams. I think, oh, I'm a toad.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, you pilot these things. Oh, Ben, you're fucking bad at this.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hold on. Oh, wait, oh, I move with the mouse. Okay.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Jesus. Okay, we're already losing.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's fine. Losing is fun. This game is great. I don't even... I have no idea what's happening, but this game is great.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You gotta fucking Tokyo Drift through the beams. We should play Mario Kart Double Dash.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I hate racing games. No, they're great. I actively hate them. Why? Why do you hate racing games?

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're boring. No. That's false.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And some people are like, oh, but Mario Kart isn't just a racing game. You've got all this shit that you do. You pick up fucking items.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mario Kart is the most boring game I've ever played. I hate it. I actively hate it.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I hate, like, you know, Gran Turismo or whatever. In fact, I've never even played it before.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But Mario Kart is fun because you didn't get ahead. And even if people try and throw the blue shell and stuff at you,

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
if you're a god like I am, then you know the strats and you know how to tongue your banana with the throws in order to destroy the blue shell.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What you were describing sounds like the opposite of fun.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No. No, it's great because that means... that means, like, I ruin the mood of the party.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know, we turn on Mario Kart 8. I just get so far ahead of everyone that no one stands a chance against me.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then the party is not fun. And then everyone starts to leave and all of my friends don't want to hang out with me anymore.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It doesn't matter. Because I'm top leaderboard, so Mario Kart 8.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I guess when you put it like that, it makes sense.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Man, I'm running out of toads. I'm getting low on toads. I need to, like, up my to- Oh, no.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In this economy, how can you spare a toad?

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I can't spare any toads. But I think I'm about... Okay, I'm in the positive. I'm in the green for toads now.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm so glad that video games are cool again.

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Um, are they?

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah. There was like an entire, like, year or two where I didn't boot up any video game.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Where I just had like a ton of games on Steam.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I didn't want to play any of them because video games are boring and they're a distraction,

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and they make you lose sight of what's real in the world.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And they don't allow you to, you know, produce any content and they're just a distraction for people who are stoners

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and slash who are chronically dependent upon masturbation and porn, aka degenerates.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But lately, I've just been turned on Nuclear Throne, just doing, like, a run or two, and it's really great.

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Video games are cool again.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait, well, that... No, that doesn't make any sense because nothing changed.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Something happens.

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wow, you drove real good. First place.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wow, I have these many to- Whoa, shit!

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I never got this to happen before.

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Um, look, nothing changed about video games. You just decided to play Nuclear Throne again.

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Now, afraid video games are still not cool.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No, no, no, that you're completely missing, you're missing the forest through the trees.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I have decreed that video games are cool again, therefore they are.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Uh, well, sure.

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay.

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I haven't, I haven't, I haven't stopped.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Lately, I've been, I've been licking my lips and I've been, I've been sweating profusely outside local game stops.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm, I'm wiggin' out because like, there's actually way more to this game than I thought.

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Like, I didn't think, I thought there was only one map.

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But no, apparently this is like a journey. This is like a journey to collect toads.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Uh, it's like a real video game.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Charlie's not gonna skimp out on the content.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I mean, shit, I thought this was just like some kind of little experiment that he did.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And I mean, maybe it is that, but it is also a real video game.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is, this has like 12 Tony's under its spell.

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Um, not more than SpongeBob the musical.

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Ah, jeez.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You know, I've been salivating and having bodily fluids just, just splurge out of my body outside local game stops.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Just meticulously like watching like a hawk over the Nintendo Switch section.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I have almost like, just like straight up just like been in a mall and just thought,

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
today's just the day I'm gonna get Nintendo Switch.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna bite the bullet and do it.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I've just, I've just walked into the game stops and then I've chickened out at the last moment.

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I really want to switch. I really, I want Splatoon.

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Splatoon is literally in Rattyfugger's Cockilers.

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like, okay, okay, I think that Mario Odyssey is probably pretty fun.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I think Breath of the Wild looks pretty cool.

102
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But when I like look deep inside myself and ask, do I really want to play a video game?

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That is either of those.

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Probably not who fucking gives a shit.

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But Splatoon, yeah, I would actually, I would actually play Splatoon if I had a Switch.

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's the one, that's the one video game that I would want to play.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Splatoon is like a miracle that it exists.

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's like, okay, so you got, you got Nintendo.

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
By the way, also I can hear myself echoing.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Wait, really?

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, whatever, who cares?

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You got, you've got this fucking, you've got Nintendo.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's like the, like the, the modern like Marvel movies of the video game industry.

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where there's pumping out sequels and, you know, Smash Bros. and New Mario's and New Zelda's and whatever the fuck.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And no one really cares.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then just out of nowhere, Splatoon comes out.

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's, it's a completely new IP.

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's super refreshing.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's, it's a third person shooter.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And not only is it a great game and it's own right.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's, it's lovable.

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's an instant classic.

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But Nintendo treats it like it's an instant classic.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So now Splatoon's in fucking Smash Bros.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Splatoon's treated like, like one of the greats, like Mario and Zelda.

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's, it's like, you know, a new video game that's treated with dignity and respect.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And not just like, oh, that's just, you know, that's just like a new IP.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We can't put that in Super Smash Bros.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Some, some fucking shmucks of Nintendo actually made a new video game.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
To be fair, it's not that new anymore.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like it's what?

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Like five or six years old now?

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Maybe not that.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, still, they're still going shrugged.

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They're still up Splatoon 2.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And with the way the video games are released,

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
it's not like there's, there's been any other brand new IP.

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That is an instant classic the way Splatoon is.

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hey, is your, is the echo any better?

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, probably.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't tell it right now, but probably.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, that's so many toads.

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's so many frogs.

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, well, you're at 180.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't think I did that well that time because I like, I like stopped to do some shit.

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But you know, I'm just going to get as many toads as I possibly can.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Prepare for a swift drift.

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh shit.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm going to go until I've seen every level.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Like I wonder if, I wonder if there's like something that you can unlock if you like.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The secret character.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Is there?

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't know, probably.

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Like I wonder if you can unlock more characters by getting more toads or something.

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh my God.

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That would be beautiful.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I mean, I'm already like really shocked that there's at the level of content that is in

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the scene.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh God.

164
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The only problem with Splatoon is that I don't want to play it at all.

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What do you mean?

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I like it.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I like all the gameplay mechanics.

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I think it's a good game and I cherish it.

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And I would play it, but I've grown up with a computer.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And so trying to play a game that requires any amount of precision at all with a controller,

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
like I just can't do it.

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Like I just been spoiled.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I cannot do it.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like I'm so used to having the control of a mouse that trying to like, especially like

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
shoot things with the controller, I can't do it.

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I just can't do it.

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't think I agree with you.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I mean, I like, I feel like normally I would be like the first person to agree with you

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
on that.

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But because like, because I'm a PC boy, but I mean, I, I was playing.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, I did hate, I did hate the Wii U controller.

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But nevertheless, I played Splatoon one with Wii U and it was fucking great.

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And I loved it.

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Sure.

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I did too.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I bet it's a million times better on the Switch.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sure it is too.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The fact of the matter is, I don't have a mouse.

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So it won't like, like, can you imagine?

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I, it's one of these times where I just wish the Nintendo would have like some of her periphery

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
where I can just like, you know, the Switch has USB.

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
She's really plugging a mouse and a keyboard.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
How fun would it be to play Splatoon and like actually have some sort of like, like even

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the phantom of a competitive scene, because now you have a massive keyboard, you can actually,

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
you know, have that sort of thing.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That'd be great.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I would love that so much.

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But no, they'll never do that.

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It'll never happen.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I'll just kill myself then.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Do it.

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I am going to, I'm going to get Splatoon on, uh, Switch though.

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, oh god.

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is like, I'm getting nervous.

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Like, it's hard.

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is pretty, this is actually pretty difficult.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh, oh, oh.

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh shit, dude.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You know what?

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm going to have to send a letter to Nintendo.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The next, uh, Splatfest needs to be, uh, Rowdy versus Killer.

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to send that to Nintendo.

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It needs to be.

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh my god, dude.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We're going to have to, we're, okay.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Get, get the, get the top Rowdy fuckers tattooed, like, like New Los Angeles City physicians

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and mathematicians online with some physicists and scientists.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Get them on the fucking line.

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We need a mod of Splatoon where instead of like, Callie Marie's mean you.

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Imagine that.

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh god, yes.

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Uh, yes, please.

224
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Uh, I mean, I mean, I think we pretty much invented Splatoon at this point.

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Uh, with, with the amount that we carry in its name, the amount that we set the beliefs

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and constitutions, we might as well have created it.

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The, the, everything about Splatoon, like, like the whole urban, the whole urban like

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
setting and style and aesthetic of it is just so, it's so, you know, they pretty much

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
just completely ripped off Rowdy fuckers cop killies.

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What are we supposed to do?

232
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, whoa.

233
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's cutscene.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
How are the toads coming along?

235
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Whoa.

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Sorry, boss.

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I was distracted.

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What was?

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
How are the toads?

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
They're, um, coming along very well.

241
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Hmm.

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is enchanting.

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hmm.

244
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh god.

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I have a goal now.

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have to reach a thousand toads.

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We, we, we've all said that under our breath at what moment.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This game is so much more robust than I thought.

249
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Do the ships have different controls?

250
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh my god.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Look at this.

252
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is good.

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I like that.

254
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Uh, no, they all control the same, at least as far as I can tell.

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, this place is cool as hell.

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Wait, wait, wait.

257
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Look at that purple sky.

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, oh.

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I was hitting the wrong button.

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This is, this, this game is a marvel.

261
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Can we have like a link to this in the description?

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Um, yeah, yeah, I can put a link.

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I can put a download link.

264
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Is this like public, is this public domain?

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Is this like in the public sphere?

266
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I mean, I just asked, uh, Hippo for, for it, or Hippo just like gave me the link to download

268
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
from.

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't remember like if it was on like a site or something.

270
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

271
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's beautiful.

272
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I love it.

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If, if Charlie doesn't have a website or something, you should, you should get one.

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Or maybe, maybe Hippo would host him on, on app.

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I hope so.

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I, I've recently caught up on episode.

277
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I, I love jail.

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I have, uh, I don't even remember what the name is.

279
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I have not, I caught up a while ago, but I haven't read it in a while.

280
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Um, is Bail Jade still going on?

281
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No, no, no, not, not Bail Jade.

282
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I meant, uh, what's the first one?

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Cannon story?

284
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah.

285
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Cannon story is over, right?

286
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah.

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Okay.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Uh, come on.

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What the fuck?

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There.

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There we go.

292
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There we go.

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There's only ever been canned story in Bail Jade, I believe.

294
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay.

295
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Apparently Hippo is somehow coming to content Lord of Ghosts and some of the various purposes.

296
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And there's supposed to be some sort of like project around him, but I don't know.

297
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You never, you never know what the Lord of Ghosts, never know what he's up to.

298
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I did hear something a while ago.

299
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I heard whispers of that.

300
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't know anything about what's going on with that.

301
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Um, I know that, uh, I know that the, uh, the Endless Rocks are, uh, connected to Hippo's

302
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
work.

303
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Come on.

304
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is this a secret?

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Uh.

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Is this a secret?

307
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Should I not go into detail about that?

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Uh, right first couple are just known for breaking boundaries and being on the cutting edge of

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
news, of news and publication of all sorts.

310
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The Endless Rocks are, are, are Hippo related and there may be, there may be, it may hint

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
at some kind of connection there.

312
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh listen, all I know about the Endless Rocks is that they're buried deep underground and

313
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
you'd have to be some sort of like, like drill sergeant, a sergeant of the drill you may

314
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
say, to find them.

315
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
To try, to try mining for them?

316
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah.

317
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah.

318
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You would, it would be a mistake and you would pay dearly for it.

319
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I mean, think about, think of all the people who have lost their lives and the slime mines

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
already.

321
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
To, to try, to try and mine for something so elusive, you just, you just place your entire

322
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
day.

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Um, you, you would, you, you would die.

324
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You would die.

325
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Like, you, you're gonna.

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There's no way around it.

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

328
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I want to switch so bad.

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I want to switch right now.

330
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh my god.

331
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It is going to take me forever to get a thousand times.

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But you know what?

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What else do I have, what else do I have going on?

334
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Nothing.

335
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I've decided to go with the egg.

336
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm so happy that the world, and by the world I mean Nintendo, which is the only world that

337
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I care about, has finally accepted that handhelds are objectively superior to home consoles.

338
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Uh, you know, I'm not, I'm not really that into handhelds, honestly.

339
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
They're, they're so portable.

340
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't, I, I, whenever I'm like, oh yeah, I want to play some Smash Bros for fun, then

341
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I, I have to like, walk, get up and like, walk over and turn on my Wii U and wait for

342
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
the Wii U to turn on, then I have to get my gamepad and I have to wait for the gamepad

343
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
to turn on, then I have to turn on my TV and wait for the TV to turn on, and then I have

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
to wait for the insane loading times to get Smash open.

345
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Just a bummer.

346
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It sucks.

347
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Maybe I should uh, maybe I can just kind of grind toads in this level.

348
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Ah shit.

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, is that how you get toads?

350
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Well, well you get toads by when, by finishing levels, but this level has like, toad, toad

351
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
boxes kind of scattered around.

352
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This might be a faster way to get toads than like-

353
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Toadly boxes.

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah.

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
These are, these are outlined, uh, outlawed in Belgium, you know.

356
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
These are outlawed in Belgium, you know.

357
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Did Belgium outlaw loot boxes?

358
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah.

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Good on them.

360
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Good on them.

361
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah, I know.

362
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Does that mean that people can't play Overwatch in Belgium?

363
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I think they can, they just can't.

364
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's like a form of gambling.

365
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah, I mean it is.

366
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah.

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So, uh, I don't know.

368
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I guess they just can't use loot boxes.

369
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I know it's either at Belgium or the Netherlands.

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Two very distinct and culturally distinct regions of Europe.

371
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, I picked up, I picked up all the toad loot boxes in this level.

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Looks like-

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And you've died, and you've died enough times for a toad to have mattered.

374
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Looks like, looks like they're not a renewable resource.

375
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, I mean, dying doesn't cost you any toads.

376
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's just the time.

377
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The time costs you toads.

378
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh.

379
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh God, that guy came out of nowhere.

380
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh my God.

381
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's, that's vehicular toad sliding.

382
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll be alright.

383
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
My name's Billy MC.

384
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I make puns about video games.

385
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why, why watch in horror?

386
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Is there being played right in front of my very eyes?

387
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Sometimes I'll be holding down the mouse button and I'll just kind of like lose momentum.

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's weird.

389
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Ah.

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Jesus Christ.

391
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Ah.

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is brutal.

393
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Hey.

394
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah.

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Let's, let's, let's respond to some, a comment.

396
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I don't know if I would consider it a complaint, but a sentiment expressed by, by some members of our elite, our elite, invite only gamer faction slash white nationalist lobbying party, known as the procrastiners podcast, fellow members.

397
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Uh, both Digi and Jesse don't have any idea what's happening with Riferous Cup players lore wise.

398
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I mean.

399
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And they, and they think it's like insanely hard to get into.

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Do you think that's, do you think it's accurate?

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, I have heard, I have heard that sentiment.

402
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And like, I don't understand it.

403
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's, I don't get it.

404
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Like what's, like what's so complicated about it?

405
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't know.

406
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Maybe should we just, should we just explain it for, for the layman?

407
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sure that a lot of people, I'm sure there are a lot of weird like outliers who are watching this video right now and don't even know about the discord.

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sure, I'm sure that's the case.

409
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah.

410
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Um.

411
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
These views gets like, like, like, like, you know, a couple of thousand views per episode.

412
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And I don't know if there's that many in the, uh, discord server.

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
In the discord server, I think there's like 600 or 700 people, maybe five, 600?

414
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't know.

415
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
How could you even be watching the show if you aren't in the discord?

416
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
How is that even possible?

417
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Well, I mean,

418
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
How did the show exist before the discord?

419
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I mean, before the discord, the show did not have, it just, it just lacked direction.

420
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You know?

421
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Mm-hmm.

422
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Uh, it was,

423
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It lacked vision.

424
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it lacked narrative stakes.

425
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
There was, there was no, there was no central antagonist.

426
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
There is no, you know, narrative.

427
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
No, there weren't.

428
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And it was frankly disgusting.

429
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Um, I look back on it with great shame, as well as terror.

430
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Uh, okay, yeah.

431
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I mean, maybe it's our fault.

432
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Like maybe we, maybe we kind of like sell Rowdyfugger's cop killers in sort of a Namco Dark Souls

433
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
kind of way where we like play up how fucking esoteric and bizarre it is.

434
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Did you say that that's true?

435
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I would say that's true.

436
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I think that's kind of the thought of it from our end.

437
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah, I mean, it's fun.

438
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's fun that there's so much more associated with it.

439
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It all makes internal sense, but we know obviously to the outside world that the slime, that

440
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
the slime economy may not be inherently understandable.

441
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I mean, okay.

442
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

443
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Like the reason why I wanted there to be a slime economy was because like it doesn't make

444
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
any sense.

445
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Okay.

446
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Uh, like it's, like it's bizarre and like it kind of has this air about it that like,

447
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
you know, like the economy, like what's harder to understand than the economy?

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Not, not much.

449
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Um, you know, like you have to be like deep, like you, like you have to be like deep, deep

450
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
involved, but like, I don't know.

451
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What the fuck am I even talking about?

452
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You're talking about how it's, it's cool to exclude people.

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's, I mean, like, I want there to be just like a wealth of like mechanics in the game.

454
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I just want that like all interact with each other and like are not confusing, but are

455
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
like maybe a bit overwhelming, you know, mechanically.

456
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Um, if you're a fool, it will take you an afternoon to understand.

457
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
If you're a genius, it will take you years to understand.

458
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yes, exactly.

459
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Uh, like, like, you know, I want there to be just like a whole wealth of things to do

460
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and mechanics to wrap your head around.

461
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But like, I would also like also want it to be simple enough that like you can ignore

462
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
them if you want, like, you know, you don't have to fuck around with a casino if you

463
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
don't want.

464
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Um, I mean, I didn't want you to have to fuck around with the slime economy, although

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the slime economy was broken and it was the only way to get ahead of the game before.

466
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So that was a bit was not successful in that way, which is why we're revamping it now.

467
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Um, but anyway, yeah, this sentiment that rowdy fuckers cop killers is like hard to get

468
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
into, I get it.

469
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's, it's, it's by design, but also I think it's, I don't think it should be entirely

470
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
like it's by design that it's hard to get into, but it might be too hard to get into

471
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
to the point where it might not be smart.

472
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I think, I think that that is them like buying into our hype, you know, possibly like I think

473
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
they're buying into the hype that we have made because ultimately like understanding

474
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
the setting, understanding the setting of rowdy fuckers is not that difficult.

475
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I don't think you need to be in the discord.

476
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You need a PhD to understand why slime is valuable and why thousands of children around

477
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the world have dedicated their lives to pressing exclamation point M I N E over and over again

478
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
for hours upon hours.

479
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Like if, like if you want to be in the thick of it, right?

480
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Like if you want to be on the cutting edge of like new Los Angeles city culture and like

481
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
being a taste maker and like, like, you know, driving, driving our society forward, then

482
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
you, then you got to be in the discord.

483
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You got to be fucking, you got to be fucking, um, you know, actively involved in it and

484
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
engaged with it.

485
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But to understand like what's happening and what's going on and like the history of it,

486
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
you don't have to.

487
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Completely superfluous.

488
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You don't need to know God damn thing.

489
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You just need to be a cog machine and you fund the economy.

490
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You don't need to know why you're doing it.

491
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Just do it.

492
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah.

493
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah.

494
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Just, uh, just, just consume, just consume slime.

495
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Even though we've done it in a PCP episode, I still feel like we kind of owe it to the

496
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
audience who may be watching this right now, but still out there to the discord to give

497
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
them a little bit of an overview.

498
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
How would you, how would you try and describe the discord and not a Dark Souls way?

499
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Okay.

500
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, I mean, right now, I mean, I assume you mean like when it's active right now, it's

501
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
a normal.

502
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Under normal non society ruining.

503
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Well, it's a, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a community.

504
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's a community.

505
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's about.

506
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You know, like, like we're all, we're all citizens.

507
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We're all citizens of this, of this place.

508
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
We all inhabit this digital space together through the medium of text.

509
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You know, we interact with it via commands, you know, and you know, you can, the different

510
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
teams, you know, you kill each other, but you can.

511
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You're doing a shit job.

512
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You do.

513
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You are not.

514
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You do not know how to sell a video game.

515
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I guess not.

516
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Well, how would you do it then?

517
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Hey, the discord server further average cop killers.

518
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Let's play series is actually not a discord server is in fact a video game that me been

519
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
cracked, mostly been and cracked have created.

520
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It is a functional video game that you can play.

521
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's a text based game.

522
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yes.

523
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But it is, but it is a game.

524
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It is designed and how it has mechanics.

525
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It revolves around players collecting slime in order for not only the obvious intangible

526
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
benefits of slime that we not need to discuss because they're too numerous and obvious to

527
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
stay here.

528
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You collect slime in order to shoot people and order to have more slime.

529
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah.

530
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Those are the two things you want to accomplish.

531
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes.

532
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I mean, when it comes when it comes back online, I was looking at the design document

533
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
crack has, you know, crack has implemented an inventory system.

534
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You know, we're ready for like items to start being a thing.

535
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We just have to make them the PVP.

536
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
The PVP system is getting completely revamped.

537
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
There's just a whole bunch of shit.

538
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
There's like so much.

539
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, there's Pete.

540
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
There's it's so fucking robust.

541
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's so fucking robust and I'm so proud of it every day.

542
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And it's such a shame that it's offline right now, but when it comes back, it'll all be

543
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
worth it.

544
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It might be up by the time this is released.

545
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Maybe I'd like that.

546
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Either way, if you want to know the current state of things, me and Ben are both dead.

547
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We used to be king pens.

548
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Everyone's dead.

549
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We used to be gang leaders and we used to command an army.

550
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I used to control the rallies.

551
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We used to control the killers.

552
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
We will have gang warfare on a near constant basis.

553
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But now a Cthulian, an Orwellian monster by the name of the negative sign was summoned

554
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
by the mayor of slime.

555
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The recently elected mayor of slime city.

556
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Well, well, well, that's not quite true.

557
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It was summoned by the collective spirits of the dead who accumulated a million negative

558
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
slime.

559
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So it was summoned by that, but it was activated by the Lord of Ghosts, recently elected mayor.

560
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Who used two endless rocks to activate its power and bring fucking Armageddon down on

561
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
all our collective asses.

562
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You can watch an animated videotape created by God himself in reality.

563
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Locate on the Gibbon Fortress 2 YouTube channel for some reason.

564
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Godwress in mysterious ways.

565
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's also on the Twitch, on the Rowdy Frickr's Cod Killers Twitch.

566
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The latest video there is a highlighted, the conclusion of the mayor of the election arc.

567
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah, and slime fest too.

568
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
God, slime fest are genius.

569
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yes, the slime fest are genius.

570
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Too bad the economy spiraled out of control and made them, maybe we can bring them back

571
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and they can be a little more rational when the game comes back again.

572
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh God, no!

573
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh God, no!

574
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You fucked up.

575
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Okay, no, we're fine, we're fine.

576
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I didn't know that could happen.

577
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Jesus.

578
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Anyway, it's beautiful.

579
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Click the link in the description now.

580
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And that's all the help you need.

581
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
If you guys don't still understand it, then I'm sorry.

582
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
There's no one that can help you.

583
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah, I think that when Jesse and Digi say that it's completely impossible to wrap your head around,

584
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I think that's them buying into the hype.

585
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Hey, I'm noticing-

586
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And what hype we spread?

587
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah.

588
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The frogs are just stacking themselves.

589
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
They're just dynamically stacking themselves.

590
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
How neat.

591
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Should you wait and see what happens?

592
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, I'll just watch them.

593
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I mean, I guess if I watch long enough, theoretically, it might just become one huge stack.

594
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
We all sit silenced off.

595
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Behold the majesty of nature.

596
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Endless war is literally split in.

597
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It is literally the same thing.

598
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It is almost the same.

599
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The mechanics are a little different, but the goals and the philosophies are the same.

600
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Not even just on the surface level, they both involve obviously beneficial slime,

601
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
but on the deeper, medic and textual level of what I was describing earlier,

602
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
but it has to be so refreshing.

603
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The series has been along for a long time.

604
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Endless war is a relatively new addition.

605
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And it's just instantly become the go-to game for millions upon millions of children to play day in, day out.

606
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's the new world of Warcraft.

607
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I was just saying right now, it's the new world of Warcraft.

608
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:30,000
In this time of tired podcasts and boring rhetoric spread weekly, it's nice.

609
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's refreshing to see something with such utter raw soul.

610
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You know, streamers are streaming themselves playing Endless War on Twitch.

611
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Hundreds of thousands of people collectively watching live footage of Endless War gameplay.

612
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And if you're not in on this gravy train, my friends, then you're missing out.

613
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Society is leaving you behind. That's all I have to say.

614
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You will be left behind if you don't correct your sinful ways soon.

615
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Sooner rather than later.

616
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Los Angeles City, aka New Milwaukee, is the spiritual home of Silicon Valley.

617
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It's like the tech industry of the Silicon Valley.

618
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But instead of tech, it's all the soul.

619
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's the soul and personal divinity and chakras and shit like that.

620
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah, you know. All the usual suspects.

621
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Of righteousness.

622
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yes.

623
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I mean, we have defined righteousness.

624
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Before Endless War, nobody knew what it was. It was all a matter of opinion.

625
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It was a mysterious thing to learn to only in scripture, but now other people know.

626
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yeah, we've laid it out. We've made it clear. We've elaborated the truth.

627
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And that bell can never be unrun. Things won't ever be the same.

628
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We've taken subjective morality and made it an objective universal truth.

629
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Which everyone was begging for.

630
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
How are you supposed to have scruples in a society where morals are subjective?

631
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You can't do it. And it would be embarrassing if you even tried.

632
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We've spared everyone the embarrassment.

633
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I would say we've created the structure for society's rest upon with this video game.

634
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
With this video game for children. I think we finally cracked the code.

635
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
How is a nation supposed to function? Intellectuals all across the world have been pined to find out.

636
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
How is a country supposed to be run? Is absolute monarchy a good idea? Should republics even exist?

637
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
No, none of those should exist. Only Endless War. Only Endless War.

638
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm almost there.

639
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,000
All the time you guys were building libraries, you were building forums, you were building discussions on the internet.

640
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You were building those? No. All you need is one obelisk. That's all you need to construct.

641
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Did you see... Wait, wait, wait. Did I ever post that picture of me and AJ?

642
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Me and AJ shoot at the real life Endless War?

643
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
No, what are you talking about right now?

644
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
We went and we went because I was passing through Washington DC and I hung out with AJ.

645
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh my god, did I forget to fucking post?

646
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah, wait, what? I did not know this.

647
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Me and AJ, we saw the real life Endless War and it was grey as fuck.

648
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I completely forgot. I'm such a retard.

649
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I can't believe this.

650
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah, okay. Well, as soon as this is over, I'm gonna go get that out of my phone.

651
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What did you guys do?

652
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
How embarrassing? What?

653
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What did you guys do?

654
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We just went and hung out in front of the real life Endless War.

655
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Goddamn.

656
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We walked around Washington DC and feared for our lives.

657
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
As you do. Even if you were in the real life Endless War, being in Washington DC should fear for your lives.

658
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We contemplated the meaty theoretical question, the meaty philosophical question of whether we should be more afraid of the gang wars in the streets.

659
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Or the evil lobbyists and fat cats in the Senate.

660
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The jury was out.

661
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The jury was out on that.

662
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Speaking, segway into a conversation that that bores me less, yawn.

663
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Like asterisk, yawn, asterisk.

664
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Speaking of you traveling through Washington DC to arrive at Boston, where you are right now.

665
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,000
There's been like a sort of like sub-plot, a sort of like, like, you know, underlying narrative through line through the past couple of Ready, Focus, Guy Plis.

666
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
That has touched upon and briefed the segments here and there.

667
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Starting in, of course, I think the, yeah, Fraud Fractions 2 Episode 1.

668
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Or we're talking about gay-ass PCP friendship stuff. I don't even care. It's only to serve this in.

669
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
PCP HQ is literally real right now?

670
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Um, well, I mean, okay.

671
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Like, question mark, but stayed as fact because it is.

672
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Well, what do you, how do you define PCP HQ?

673
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,000
There are three PCP members living in one location and I visit that location every three months.

674
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,000
There are, uh, well, hang on, there's me, Digi, Tom, Tom, yeah, um, three.

675
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I think Nate's planning to move here.

676
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You're here a bunch of the year.

677
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah, yeah, PCP HQ is real-ish.

678
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Although, to my great, great dismay, everybody's on the fucking south side of the Charles River, like a bunch of fucking cowards.

679
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I am on, like, the exact opposite.

680
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
We're on, like, exact opposite sides of the city.

681
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Well, Ben, it's because you lack morals.

682
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
No, it's because you're a freak and a degenerate.

683
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's because I possess intellect.

684
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Like, morals and intellect are the exact opposite.

685
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
They are the exact opposite, and the city exists on a spectrum.

686
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,000
At the south are morals, and on the top in the north is intellect, and I chose right.

687
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I made the right choice.

688
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You will be obliterated.

689
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Uh, okay, I have a thousand. I have a thousand.

690
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Oh shit, do one more, I guess?

691
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yeah.

692
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, I'm excited. Oh my god, oh my god.

693
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm excited to see what happens here, but anyway.

694
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I don't think anything happens.

695
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:59,000
In Frog Fractions 2, Episode 1, we were all, like, the discussion in that episode was like, first of all, it was like, the idea of PCP HQ, like, Luke Warm at Best, me, like, I was debating, like, you know, the, the, like, when it would have happened.

696
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
When it would have happened, if it should have happened, stuff like that.

697
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And if it wasn't gonna happen, me and you were both, like, thinking, oh, it's gonna be in Atlanta.

698
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You know, I had just recently flown out to see you. It's gonna be in Atlanta.

699
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah.

700
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And, uh, all this first stuff.

701
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It seemed likely at the time.

702
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And, and, and just in the, in the series of, like, what?

703
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Like, just a couple months, everything, like, changed.

704
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Changed rapidly.

705
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yes.

706
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Like, the, like, the first day that I met with Boss, or met with Digi in, uh, December, I believe it was, for, for the Double 8 times 2 plus 1.

707
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yes.

708
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Uh, I, I, like, like, first night, after that, Digi just was set on Boston.

709
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Like, he just was, like, I, I keep saying this over and over, and, and Digi, whenever I bring it up around, Digi, she's like, it's not that big of a deal.

710
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But it's crazy to me, because I never, never would have expected Digi to actually go with this, with, with this, uh, hope that I had that Boston would be the location.

711
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I had no real reason to suspect that that would be the case at all.

712
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Like, I was pushing for Atlanta for a while there, because I thought that's where I was gonna be.

713
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Um, yeah.

714
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And, like, I couldn't get it to, I couldn't seem to make it, like, stick in anyone's mind.

715
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And I finally was just like, you know what?

716
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I kind of give up, like, whatever, whatever happens is gonna be whatever happens.

717
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And, like, obviously I can't do anything about it.

718
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But the stars just aligned on Boston, and everyone fucking wanted to go here.

719
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And, like, that's fucking cool with me, because that's where I want to be, too.

720
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It's really a, a technical marvel.

721
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's a modern, a modern marvel.

722
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
That, like, like, somehow, not only was it changed to Boston, but just by chance,

723
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
you were kicked out of your house and you had to go to Boston.

724
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I was not kicked out of your house.

725
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I left my house, thank you very much.

726
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Okay, okay, okay.

727
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Uh, anyway, that, that, just, just all that to say, just by chance, not only was it changed,

728
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
but also you were able to, like, you were, you were able to go to the new place where it was.

729
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Um, yeah, well, yeah, it worked out pretty well.

730
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Pretty sick.

731
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Pretty fucking sick, dude.

732
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

733
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Uh, I'm actually happy.

734
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Boston's cool.

735
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Boston's real cool.

736
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't think there's a, I don't think anything else is gonna happen in this game.

737
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah.

738
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What about, uh, rush predatory?

739
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
What's that? It was the second option there.

740
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Okay, no, that just shows you your toads.

741
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Uh, well, maybe that will trigger an event.

742
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The guy will be like, oh, I'll get all these toads.

743
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Uh, I already tried it after getting it.

744
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Okay, the one, the one thing, okay, some of these levels have like a counter on the side,

745
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and I don't know what that counters for.

746
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Um, the one thing I can think of is that maybe I need to, like, get first place in every level,

747
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
which I don't think I have done yet.

748
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You didn't say that.

749
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Also to get a thousand toads.

750
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Yeah.

751
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I mean, it didn't say that anything would happen.

752
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Just said that they need a thousand, but I don't know for what.

753
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
For what purposes?

754
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,000
No, for research of something, of test research of how toads perform in road races.

755
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The results are staggering.

756
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah.

757
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh, shit.

758
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Alright, you just finish this level and then, and then check your toads.

759
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Let's get the hell out of here.

760
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Let me do, uh, let me just circle around to the first level again to make sure that, like,

761
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I don't just have to, like, clear all the levels one last time.

762
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Like, maybe if I get to the point where that initial cutscene was triggered.

763
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Eh.

764
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Maybe.

765
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Maybe, but almost certainly not.

766
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
This level's good looking though, I like it.

767
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It's beautiful.

768
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
When, when, when I eventually do come back to Bosmos, it'd probably be sometime in, like, fall to winter.

769
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Like, like, right first cop killers, unfortunately, like, like the live ones recorded at Radcom 3.

770
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
We're not, we're not up to par.

771
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
The one that was released was the MeMaker one, and the fuckin' WeSports historical and such.

772
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Once, once, once me and you are not on any sort of, like, real time crunch,

773
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and we're just able to, like, be at a house, that, that's, that's when shit's gonna go.

774
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
That's, that's when the real thing's gonna happen.

775
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We're gonna be able to record, like, a Game Grumps-esque session, just release one every month or something.

776
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Um, yeah, we should.

777
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
We should do that, just, just, like, a whole bunch of them.

778
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah.

779
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
How long do you usually come for, when you, when you come?

780
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Uh, it varies a lot.

781
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Any, the minimum, the minimum was five days, and the maximum was a month, so anywhere between there.

782
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Five days is not much.

783
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
But a month is a lot.

784
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yeah.

785
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Uh, alright.

786
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I usually come for, like, the, the average is, like, a week to two weeks.

787
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Uh, okay, you know what, I think I'm done with Road Toads.

788
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay, cool.

789
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Let's move on to the next game.

790
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
What, what is it gonna be called, like, the power hour?

791
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's gonna be multiple hours, though.

792
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
How long have we been, oh man, I played Road Toads for 45 minutes.

793
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Uh, sick.

794
00:44:48,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Uh, this will be called, um, the, the sweet, the sweet house of blues, addition, um, runawayfromsnakes.com.

795
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That's a really good title.

796
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Thanks, man.

797
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah, this is Run Away From Snakes.

798
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Uh, it was programmed by Charlie.

799
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Um, same, same guy.

800
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Same, same guy.

801
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Um, but, uh,

802
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
also, it's based on the character by Hippocrite,

803
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and the model, I believe, was done,

804
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
the model was done by Tom, Polystation 2.

805
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I think he only did the character model.

806
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I guess he didn't do the walls or anything, but I don't know.

807
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The only thing that I'm sure he did was the, the character model.

808
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh fuck.

809
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh my god, this is cool as hell.

810
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Have, have you not seen this?

811
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
No, I've never seen this before in my life.

812
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Uh, yeah, it's awesome.

813
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh, I will, I will do something, and I will, I will show you,

814
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
because I asked Hippo about this before, and the answer was the breathtaking.

815
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I will, I will attack a statue when I see one.

816
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Missed it.

817
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Oh shit.

818
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Great.

819
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It's actually really hard.

820
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Like, it's very, very difficult.

821
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Is, is, does it change every single time?

822
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, it's procedurally generated, so you can't just, like, learn the pattern.

823
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Oh there, you see that green stuff that came out?

824
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yeah.

825
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I think that is slime.

826
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Whoa!

827
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yeah.

828
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh my god.

829
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Whoa.

830
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
How can we get our hands on some statues?

831
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Uh, I mean, they must, okay, serious, serious.

832
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Imagine, imagine a room, imagine a location in, in the discord, in New Los Angeles City,

833
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that's like a statue, and like faction members can go there and use break statues for slime.

834
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Uh, I, I, I, I, I, uh, oh, fuck.

835
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Oh, there has to be, yeah, there has to be a solution point break.

836
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
There has to be, I've never, yeah, of course, of course this has to be here.

837
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah.

838
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You want to make, you want to make, make a state from snakes real, make this cannon?

839
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah, of course.

840
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,100
How, how do we do that?

841
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,000
How do we, where are we, where are we in the fit statues?

842
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Well, okay, so raid bosses are going to be a thing, right?

843
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah.

844
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,560
We could have things, they wouldn't be raid bosses per se, but we could have things that

845
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:29,440
are effectively raid bosses that are just inanimate statues, and maybe people could

846
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,400
break them in the combat zone or something.

847
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:40,320
Maybe, what if instead of them being just things that people fighting, they are items

848
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:47,040
awarded to people in the way that, it's just a cutesy way to hand out slime, so instead

849
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,400
of giving someone slime, you give them a statue which they can then break in the slime.

850
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,120
Oh, kind of like in Dark Souls, you have a soul item, and you break it to get the souls

851
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,120
inside or whatever?

852
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Yes, yes.

853
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:11,960
Yeah, okay, I would be okay with canonizing runawayfromsnakes.com.

854
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,680
Why are they like little spears?

855
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,760
Why are the slime little spears?

856
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,080
Because it was probably easy to model.

857
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,680
Okay, that makes sense.

858
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
Would be my guess.

859
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,840
Is there an int of this game?

860
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,360
Yeah, there is.

861
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,920
Apparently, you can win the game if you run far enough, and then you can unlock endless

862
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,920
mode.

863
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,360
More like endless war mode, am I right?

864
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
Oh no.

865
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
Oh, but yes.

866
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,360
Oh, this game was beautiful.

867
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,360
Oh, it was really fun.

868
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
It's very difficult.

869
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,360
At least I'm finding it very difficult.

870
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:54,360
Also, I just switched positions, I just switched to laying down, and the blood is rushing

871
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,360
in my head, and I feel like I'm going to pass out.

872
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,360
Oh, that's right, you don't have a chair.

873
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,480
Well, you were telling me about this before the show started.

874
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,080
Why do you not have a chair anymore?

875
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:10,780
Well, I couldn't fit, all right, so when I was getting the fuck out of Georgia, I had

876
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:24,840
initially planned to rent a U-Haul to pack all my stuff, but, uh, God, how to fucking

877
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,360
diplomatically explain it.

878
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,720
Well, this is right, I figure it's cop killers.

879
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:36,600
This is known for our record-breaking news and publication of the quote-unquote real

880
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,600
shit.

881
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,840
All right, so the plan was to get a U-Haul.

882
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:49,360
I went back to get my stuff, but I went back, I used Econ's car, and obviously, I could

883
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,280
not fit, you know, there were a couple things that I could not fit in there.

884
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,440
My desk chair, which was pretty big, my squat rack and the weights, which was very upsetting

885
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,280
because that cost me a couple hundred dollars, and the, um, oh, it was the last thing.

886
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,120
Oh, a drawing table, but the drawing table was already missing some parts, so that was

887
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,080
not the huge loss.

888
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:19,160
Um, all right, so I packed these into Econ's car, and I went back to Econ's place, and

889
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:25,840
then I was just looking at the prices, and it was like renting a, renting a U-Haul would

890
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,440
have been like a couple hundred dollars more than just renting a regular car to make the

891
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,960
trip, so, and plus like going back for my other stuff would have been, I didn't, I didn't

892
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,960
want to do it.

893
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,160
It sounded like a fucking, like the worst thing ever.

894
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,720
So I was like, all right, it's, I'll just fucking, I'll eat the loss, I'll eat the

895
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:52,080
loss on the items, I'll make, you know, I'll save a bit on the, on the transportation,

896
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:57,000
hopefully it'll all come out in the wash, and I won't have to deal with a bunch of bullshit

897
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,400
that way.

898
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:07,000
So yes, I left my desk chair and I have yet to get another one, and my sitting, I'm starting

899
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,680
to get, it's starting to, it's starting to wear on my, on my back, the, um, the sitting

900
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,680
situation.

901
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,720
Well, well, what are you doing now, if you, if you, if you don't have a chair, what are

902
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,720
you sitting on right now?

903
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,000
Right, I'm just been like, I've just been like sitting Indian style on my bed, and

904
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,440
I have like a low table next to my bed that my, that my computer is, is on.

905
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,840
Oh my god.

906
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
Yeah.

907
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,600
It's, it's a bit chist.

908
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,600
Yeah, yeah, I can imagine, are you gonna get a new chair?

909
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:46,240
Yeah, man, when I moved in with Digi, we went like hunting around at thrift stores looking

910
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,680
for a desk chair, and we found that one, and it was like a, a big leather, like swivel

911
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:57,320
desk chair, um, for like $15.

912
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,320
It was like so cheap.

913
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Oh my god.

914
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,320
Yeah.

915
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,120
Like, I honestly thought that the tag was missing a zero, um, but it wasn't.

916
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,880
It was actually $15.

917
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,880
So that was a good one.

918
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It probably was cursed.

919
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,500
It had a soul of a dead person though.

920
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,400
I mean, sure, maybe, but, uh, never, never, fuck, never bothered me.

921
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,400
Ah, Jesus.

922
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,600
And then, and then the thing, the thing ended up getting clawed to fucking death by a cat,

923
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,600
um, down there.

924
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:31,600
So that, that sucked, but whatever, it didn't, it didn't affect the usability of it at all.

925
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Uh, but it's you, but you really suck at this game.

926
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,600
Huh?

927
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,280
You really suck at this game.

928
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,280
You think I really suck at this game?

929
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,280
Is that what you're saying?

930
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
Yeah, that is what I'm saying.

931
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,280
Is that what you're saying to me right now?

932
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,600
You keep, you keep dying on the one that's just like you jump.

933
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,160
It's a, it's a, it's a difficult, it's a long jump.

934
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,600
Like it's like most, it takes up a lot of your jump arc to make it.

935
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,320
Well just hold it, just hold it down.

936
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,600
I am holding it down.

937
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,600
You fuck.

938
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,600
You're so mad.

939
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,600
You're so mad.

940
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,600
What are the...?

941
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,600
Jesus.

942
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:18,600
I must be pretty behind on Bill Jade because I do not know why Pump is holding a Keyblade.

943
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,600
Oh, you'll, you'll find out.

944
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Oh, oh, oh, looting.

945
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,600
Oh god, I didn't think I was going to make that one.

946
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,600
Come on.

947
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,040
Is there any reason to not just keep swinging your thing in hopes of just getting a statue?

948
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:41,140
Um, there's that because it would distract me and I really want to focus on making the jumps. Oh, fuck damn it

949
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,800
That one came out of nowhere. You saw that

950
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Of course of course you do

951
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,200
You know you know what I'm fucking talking about

952
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,920
Of course

953
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,960
What are you gonna do about your squat rack is gonna I mean I I mean I guess just it is gone now

954
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,200
But it is it is gone now. It is gone now

955
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And that's okay

956
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,520
You know I actually got it for a pretty good deal much like the chair like I paid like $300 for it

957
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,320
But that was like a steal anyway, that's not important

958
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:25,080
What's important is that it turns out and I did not become aware of this until I had already come back

959
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,720
That this house that I moved into which in case I didn't mention this already

960
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,120
It is the house that I was living in before I moved in with Digi in

961
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,800
2016

962
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,640
They actually have an almost identical rack in the basement

963
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,480
So like it's fine. Yeah, like I didn't even need that thing anyway

964
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,520
And I mean if I ever move somewhere else, yeah, I'll have to replace it, but you know, that's okay for now

965
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,720
I fucking it's all it's all good

966
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:59,600
You know I've even looked at because if you decide to take it you might have like that might have been the straw to make you get a

967
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,720
U-Haul

968
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,600
Wait, what it would have wasted it if you decided that it was indispensable

969
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,240
And then you got on a U-Haul and you just would have to have the same thing anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

970
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,840
I basically would have spent that money for for nothing

971
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:20,320
So it's probably you can find out you can find you get it. I made it. I escaped the snakes. Oh my god, that's beautiful

972
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,160
Yeah, all right, oh

973
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,760
Oh god, whoa. Oh

974
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,080
Yeah, there's a there's a there's a leaderboard

975
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,000
Uh

976
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,280
HIPPO said that HIPPO said the Connor was the leader before but apparently Gwyn has passed in whatever that is

977
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,040
That score looks illegitimate. I

978
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,720
mean, I

979
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,720
Wonder like let's see. Okay. I recognize Connor. I recognize meaty learner

980
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,920
These are all

981
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,880
Yeah, our rats lemon tart. Yeah, that's HIPPO who the fuck is that?

982
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,400
Yeah, dax tier our it's again

983
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:14,120
Ice killer your mom. Yeah, my favorite. There's a bunch of anti-cheats

984
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,960
All right, yeah, all right, so a bunch of bunch of cool dudes playing this fucking

985
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,960
Yeah, if you if you um

986
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,880
This by the way, you can play this on HIPPO's website

987
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,120
Like in browser as like a pay a comic page

988
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,800
Although it takes a while to load

989
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,000
I'm just okay this time. I'm gonna try to hit all the statues

990
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,600
Fuck no, you're not gonna be able to do it. We should move on to the next game

991
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,880
You think I should move on to the next game. Is that what you're saying? Is that what you're saying to me right now?

992
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,640
I think that's what I'm saying. Is that what you're telling me that you think I should move on to the night

993
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,640
Oh, whoa, there's a double animation

994
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,920
Wait like look I swing back and forth. Yeah, okay

995
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,320
All right, the main event this was this was baby shit

996
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,040
This was pushy shit. We were I want to show I want to show what happens if the snakes get you

997
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,280
Whoa, yeah

998
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,360
So, uh, all right, and I guess I have to fucking control all delete out of this one as well

999
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,360
Oh

1000
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,800
Road toads is still running

1001
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:40,000
We're on the main event now. Yeah, the real video game a real one

1002
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:47,560
Instead of I'm gonna make the room right instead of a mere facsimile of a video game an air sats video game

1003
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,760
If you will like what we've what we've had to deal with so far

1004
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,200
Like this

1005
00:57:53,440 --> 00:58:00,600
Aerodynamic school been what what everyone went to aerodynamic school been you you can't use such fancy language

1006
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,460
So thank God I've got some fucking Pepsi zero left

1007
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,640
I I this is a good time to any I have made another vow

1008
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,640
I this this second

1009
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:20,200
Revolution in my life, and I had this is my the second time I have made the vow to give up soda

1010
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:29,600
All or I think more specifically it was all sugary drinks in general. Yeah, yeah, but you can still drink diet soda, right?

1011
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:38,200
Yes, but that's not it's it's all sugary drinks and also soda in general

1012
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:45,480
I mean do what you I don't understand why people have I mean what's wrong with diet soda it well first of all

1013
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,360
It tastes disgusting. No. Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. Everybody says that and I don't fucking get it

1014
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:57,880
I don't fucking get it dude. Wow. It's almost the word taste that everyone argues everyone has different ones and you know

1015
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,040
Is based upon actual real taste with your tongue?

1016
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:10,120
Understand I just cannot understand how people can be like so disgusted by diet soda like yeah

1017
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,560
I can taste that it's different, but it doesn't taste worse like at all to me

1018
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,720
I don't want to say it

1019
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,560
Because I know like oh you're an apologist for diet. So like oh, you know, I don't want to drink my car

1020
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:29,520
It's fucking whatever your own monster. It tastes like ever so slightly different not even in like a worse way

1021
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:34,480
It's just a little different, but that just terrifies you doesn't it you're scared of things that are different

1022
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:41,120
Munchy the only thing I'm scared of is the warts and pimples that I grow on your fucking body

1023
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,600
When you keep drinking a diet soda wait are is getting warts and pimples a diet soda thing

1024
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:52,000
I thought you just got brain cancer. No, well the same thing you get warts on your brain. Oh

1025
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,500
That explains that explains a lot that's been going on with me lately here get in this game right now

1026
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,440
Mr. I'm very upset with you

1027
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,200
Yes, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh here we go

1028
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,160
Here we fucking go. Oh my god, okay nuclear throne

1029
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,320
This is the first game we ever played I'm fucking refuse hyperlase at that point

1030
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:21,840
It was not a let's play show it was like a podcast and we just played it and we did not have

1031
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:30,040
Visuals and DeVue was just charm. Yeah, DeVue was there. Oh my god. Okay. I'm not literally asked DeVue is on right now

1032
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,720
I'm gonna get him in the call. Well, we can't play with him, right?

1033
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:40,120
Like he has the game. Yeah, well, no, but we can't we can't do co-op with multiple more than two people

1034
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,340
Can we yeah, we can wait really? Yeah. Oh shit

1035
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I'm ready

1036
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,640
I'm I'm I'm messing Jim right now. I picked the baby mode character

1037
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,800
All right, I will keep watch of the DeVue situation

1038
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,080
He might be out of the house. You might not be able to be here. Let you know as soon as we know

1039
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,520
What's the steroids wall? Yeah, it's just a split the hideous. So

1040
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,080
Yeah, I know

1041
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,760
Playing steroids is for cowards of which I am one

1042
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,520
The only time you've ever looped is when you were with me correct

1043
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:27,640
I think I might have looped once like later on my own

1044
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,920
But when I was playing with you, we looked twice which was unprecedented. Oh

1045
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,960
You'd look okay. Okay. Oh, wow fucking got wrecked by maggots

1046
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:43,160
All right, let's get rhinoskin probably wait, do we do we share upgrades? Yes

1047
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:53,280
It's cool, yeah, I like it by the way some some fun facts cuz because I'm a I'm a deep lore nuclear-grown nihilist

1048
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,080
Uh

1049
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:03,880
Rami Rami Ishmael one half of the NBA creator of this game was on record that online multiplayer with nuclear-grown was

1050
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:08,640
Literally impossible. It could not be done with the video game

1051
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,160
And then and then and there I was the most requested feature

1052
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,640
Everyone wanted it and everyone was clamoring for it and and he said it was literally impossible

1053
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,000
This is a quote from Rami we can find on the wiki. What a fucking game

1054
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,760
And then and then in comes this hero this unpaid hero

1055
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:34,520
veteran nuclear-grown player just just champion of the people a yellow afterlife who just makes it

1056
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:40,720
Who just make it not only does he make on the list or makes the four player multiplayer?

1057
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,640
Okay, that's fine. Oh, did I fuck up? Oh, you want to get this also? It's fine

1058
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:55,720
Wait, what is firing gives ammo for your other weapon? Yes, it's very good for steroids. It's very very. Oh, is this the one that like depends what character you're playing?

1059
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,040
Yeah, yeah, okay

1060
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,880
Although I actually really like gamma guts a lot. Oh

1061
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,440
I had I have oh

1062
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,560
My god, okay, I have no I have no weapon right now. I

1063
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,960
Have almost no ammo

1064
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,680
Okay, don't worry. Oh, okay

1065
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,960
Shoot shoot you fucking idiot. Yeah, shoot

1066
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,520
Shoot, okay, you know what that's fine. That's fine

1067
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,120
Well, we'll make it we'll make it better

1068
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:37,560
The book the longest I've I say alive. I think it. Oh, yeah, I died on throne two loop three

1069
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,280
So I was just about to get to actual loop three and then I was destroyed

1070
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,600
We're gonna go all the way here. We're gonna go all the fucking way here on the on this show

1071
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:54,680
Yeah, we've done it only my favorite game is literally my favorite. Okay

1072
01:03:54,680 --> 01:04:00,520
I have not played nearly as much nuclear throne as I have binding of Isaac, but I think objectively speaking

1073
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,240
It's probably a better game. Oh, of course. Hey, okay

1074
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,040
The body of Isaac I respect because it's like saying that you don't like cities in Canada

1075
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,400
No one will take you seriously. There's no reason to even voice your opinion on the subject

1076
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,760
But I cannot play by an Isaac at all. Oh, it's

1077
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:25,560
Trigger fingers it makes your reloads shorter if you kill people which is extremely important with YV and steroids

1078
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,160
Okay, I

1079
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,160
Hate the way I

1080
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:40,480
Hate it so I like the way Isaac looks, but I do not like the remake. I think that the remake looks worse than the original I

1081
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,920
Hate it just like looks like new grounds

1082
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,880
It does. I don't really mind that so much. I

1083
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,360
Think it looks gaudy. I think it looks old like they look slain

1084
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,280
But nuclear throne is beautiful and all it looks it just looks like

1085
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,120
Both impact risk and back muscle are I think second stomach

1086
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:11,640
Say something's good for survival if you're pussy. I am a pussy. That's why I played steroids. Okay, that's fine

1087
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,960
Jesus I okay, I've actually been playing this game a lot lately

1088
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,040
You might not be showing right here, but I

1089
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,160
Played this game in well over a year. Oh shit. I'm out of me

1090
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,280
I'm out of it. Oh

1091
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,400
Okay

1092
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:39,480
No, no come what the fuck don't worry. Don't worry. You know click on me again click on me

1093
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,560
You cannot do this. You cannot do this alone. You need me

1094
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,200
But look on me again look on me again, what is going on?

1095
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,560
We're

1096
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:54,720
Okay, we're a beat we're exploiting a mechanic where if one person dies another person gonna revive

1097
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,800
No, that was parted. What was the point of switching it back and forth?

1098
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,200
So, okay

1099
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:07,080
You have a timer with when you when you have when your course you have a timer before you are just

1100
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:14,520
Like dead forever and that timer ticks down. So it's evidence for you just switch. Who's playing who's not over and over again?

1101
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,520
I see I see

1102
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,280
I

1103
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,640
Think it's like right right in a skin

1104
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,240
Okay

1105
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:31,280
Rasky is way better than second time. It's like it's not because I was thinking I was looking at back. Was it back muscle?

1106
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:42,520
Also, we can go to the secret level. Oh, let's do it or whenever you you ready I guess well, we have to wait to three one

1107
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,640
Oh

1108
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,680
It feels good it feels good to play this game again

1109
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:56,880
It's it feels it feels it feels like like like oh my god. He's here. Okay. Don't worry. I got oh

1110
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,680
God what a spot like like I'm like I'm in my youth

1111
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,880
I think I think we're throwing is my third. I'm gonna see how much hours I have in this game

1112
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,280
All right, I have six hundred and thirty nine hours

1113
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,960
Is the other ones he is number one TF to yeah team for king for just do I have two thousand six hundred?

1114
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,640
Oh, we should get blood blood lust, right? Or no, yeah

1115
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:26,640
But both both are extremely good. Um, let's do I keep running out of ammo. Oh, yeah, maybe

1116
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,520
But both are great yeah, I

1117
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,280
Six hundred and I think thirty nine hours

1118
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,720
I used to play it all the time as a kid, but ever since like

1119
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
2013 I've had fallen off of it

1120
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:55,520
Oh fuck shit, I'm still a master we should do that we should definitely play TF 2 on here

1121
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,920
There's a lot of games that I want to play on this show that we just can't

1122
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:05,040
That we just can't do to the fact we're not in person like like I really want to play the subspace atmosphere

1123
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:10,400
That's one of the best little ones. I want to do ever since the show started and we can we like we can't really do that if we're not together

1124
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,640
Yeah, I

1125
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,600
Think there's a way to maybe do it with project him and homebrew and like online play with that

1126
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,560
But it's just not it's not the same as as vanilla bro

1127
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,600
Oh shit, don't worry, it's fun

1128
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,420
There's a lot of bandits right here

1129
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:46,520
Quite a few bandits quite a few bandits riveting commentary right here. I got a fucking topic

1130
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,040
I

1131
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:51,160
Loose it by late spoiler like like like behind the scenes back to do right now

1132
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,800
We're recording this right after the podcast episode of the PCP

1133
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,360
So if you want to watch this in chronological order from our perspective watch that first I

1134
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:06,520
I I mentioned our point that I only briefly touched on but it was one of the first topics they wrote down for this episode

1135
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,680
Here

Please please please. No. No. No, please. Okay

1153
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:22,720
This is this is too stressful situation. Uh, the topic is

1154
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,640
I've I've said the n-word now. I can never be president

1155
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:34,720
I've seen a lot lately about how like like I I I've I've been led down the path of an internet

1156
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:44,320
Okay, click on me. Yeah, you've been you can't you need to click on me as soon as I die because you cannot do this alone

1157
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,880
Fine fine. Yeah, I want to I want to be a different character

1158
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,960
I mean melting is my favorite character. He's the coolest character, but like wait, what the fuck is frog?

1159
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,320
Frog sucks. Don't be frog

1160
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,200
Uh, can do

1161
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,240
Okay, this is fine

1162
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,480
What was I saying? Oh, oh, yeah, uh

1163
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,960
I I I've grown up on the internet and now all of my like gross weird team

1164
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:18,400
perversions in the dinner seat is now just on the internet forever in like with the way back machine

1165
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:24,880
Yeah, yeah, like there's no point in my life where I was not posting art or you know doing weird shit online

1166
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,200
Uh, so now my entire life even like stuff like my real name

1167
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,880
Just easily be found online and there's nothing that I can do to reverse that and do that fact

1168
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,680
I can never hold a single political office

1169
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,040
I just can't do it if I were to you would find my old like forum roleplay is I mean I would be laughed at the white house

1170
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,280
I mean unless like

1171
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,880
I mean, maybe that stuff could be hidden

1172
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,360
With like some serious effort or like money or like funding

1173
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,080
Uh, or unless unless like something seriously shifts with the culture

1174
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,080
What did you pick?

1175
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,080
patience why

1176
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,520
Because we want you to get more better ones first. Okay

1177
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,600
And it's not even like I particularly want

1178
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,640
to be like the president or anything

1179
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,480
But just the feeling of like like knowing that my life is

1180
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,720
like

1181
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,920
I don't damage

1182
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:32,480
I don't say damage, but I'm definitely forced into a life now where where where my entire reputation

1183
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,600
Is laid out for like an easy dual search and now no matter even stuff like

1184
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,480
I'm coming for you

1185
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:47,360
Like like I probably cannot collaborate with like small time more liberal minded content creators

1186
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,160
Like at all they would they would just see what I've said online and think no

1187
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,560
I don't want to participate with this person even though like oh, please bloodlust would be great. Yeah

1188
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,320
Uh, then oh, this would be good for you. I wish you get this

1189
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
Wait, isn't that only for melee attacks?

1190
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,280
No, okay

1191
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:14,640
Even even though I am I am a libtup just because I've said I've said retarded shit online before

1192
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:21,680
Now I'm now I can never I can never undo that. Uh, I don't know. I wouldn't say never. I mean dude

1193
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,320
Okay, hip-hop made this one vlog about how some I don't know if this route would sit away from that

1194
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:31,440
You can damage it some I forget it was some youtuber was on some sort of british tv show

1195
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:39,760
And people from like TV producers just like dug up some tweet that guy had made when he was like 12 ahead

1196
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,760
The inward on it and he was kicked off the show

1197
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,080
Uh, my god

1198
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,840
Well, yeah

1199
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,840
I mean, that's pretty bad. That's pretty bad

1200
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:55,120
Yeah, so I'm like there's nothing I could say to dude. Oh shit. Apologize

1201
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,640
Or do I even truly believe like I should but that just means that there's no there's no life for me

1202
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,400
There's nothing I can do to right these wrongs that I've done

1203
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,720
plutonium

1204
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,640
Both these are good

1205
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,640
up to you

1206
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,800
I like this one more. Yeah

1207
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,000
It's so it's sort of like I think I took about this on long step away. I'm gonna destroy this

1208
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I

1209
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,360
Think that's why I feel this on ready for his cop killers. Yeah, I think so

1210
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,960
Uh, uh, what specifically about how I it's been scary

1211
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,040
Because obviously, you know, I've been around the pcb all my life and you know, just

1212
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:44,880
Generally people have this meant that college is bullshit and a scam which okay, sure and I mean, you know, I still agree with that but

1213
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,960
the like due to that fact when I when I was not so

1214
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:50,960
What's the word?

1215
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,080
Smart and I was just willing to believe with you with you know,

1216
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:59,680
Everyone really was saying online at the moment. You know college is bullshit. You can't on corn food to do

1217
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:07,120
I I I will admit I let that impact the way I thought about the world and the way that I like took school

1218
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:13,360
Seriously, yeah, and so for like a while and like freshman for freshman year of high school

1219
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,480
Like I just didn't give a shit about anything because I was like, oh, you know what?

1220
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,800
I'm to get through high school and it'll be fine because I don't really need to have good grades and have to go to college

1221
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:25,600
I don't need that because that's where I want to come like and even still that's not where you want to take my life

1222
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,360
I don't want to go to college

1223
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:32,480
But knowing that like I did really poorly in freshman year probably know

1224
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,120
Like college will want I probably like will not appease

1225
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,480
Buck up. No, no go off. No, please

1226
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,400
Uh, no one will like wants to take me in. Oh god. So fucking cops are here

1227
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,880
We're we're safe

1228
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,120
And even though oh, yeah, oh this oh

1229
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,640
Look at this look look at what we're doing right now

1230
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,320
Uh, just just the fact that I am closed off from going to college

1231
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,480
Is scary. You're not you're not close. You're not closed off from going to college

1232
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,720
I don't know dude

1233
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:11,120
If it feels and you know what what do you want? I think I mean aren't aren't these like bad

1234
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:17,200
Yeah, all of them are bad besides this one which has some good to it. Let's just do none. I don't want them

1235
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,840
Okay, I don't want it

1236
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,240
I I know I know that I can probably get into some college, but like I don't know like like like what if

1237
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,400
You know like lately I've been thinking our college seems pretty cool

1238
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,040
TBH like it's a lot of money, but like it sounds like it would be a good time

1239
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,720
It sounds like it sounds like it would be a good time. Yeah, it sounds fun and everything

1240
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,440
Yeah, yeah, it does

1241
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,720
Stuff but so

1242
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:53,840
Well, make make maybe I'm not even sure if I would want to but maybe but but maybe I would want to do that in my life

1243
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,160
Maybe that's where I would want to go. I don't even know if that is the case probably not

1244
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:04,080
But think about how I how I decided to go with like, you know, the the choices I've made in my life

1245
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:09,920
I've I haven't gone the best grades. I probably don't have a portfolio. Oh, what the fuck?

1246
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,760
That that would they would impress many art college professors

1247
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:21,040
And and I I I I've taken to putting most of my time into online stuff and if I were to go to college

1248
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,720
I wouldn't be able to put in the time and effort that I would need to make good on

1249
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,400
I mean, but it sounds like no off the side off the side. Please come down

1250
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:33,440
Come down off the side off the side. Please. Please. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die soon. I'm gonna die

1251
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,720
I mean, it sounds like what you're upset about is that you're gonna miss out on a good time

1252
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:46,240
Which I mean, maybe yeah college is pretty help help. No, I I'm sure it has practical benefits as well. Sure

1253
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,800
Oh, fuck

1254
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,240
And it's it's not it's I it's not even just college

1255
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:58,240
It's just the the idea that I've made such choices that are blocking off from other paths in my life

1256
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,560
Such as becoming president or going to college

1257
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Oh, shit. Oh long arms

1258
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:09,840
Long arms. You want this? Okay, sure. What would you want to do? That are gamma guts

1259
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:17,920
You know, that's cool. I have I mean, I like gamma guts because it can prevent you from taking damage from touching things

1260
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,720
That is nice. It's about that

1261
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,240
I am like out of

1262
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,720
Don't worry

1263
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:40,480
I should concentrate very hard. Really and now I'm actually out of ammo like for real

1264
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:49,120
Due to Pluto, I keep killing people and then like stepping away to let you get the ammo, but then I suck it up anyway. Yeah

1265
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,560
I I have 10 bullets for my fucking

1266
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,120
Well, it's because you're you're you're fucking you're meleeing right now. So you're like

1267
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,280
You're right you're right in the thick of it

1268
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,880
Whenever whenever I play co-op. I always like forget what character I am

1269
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,280
So like even though like oh, we don't have ammo right now. I could be spawning my ability

1270
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,400
I could I could be doing that. You know what rebel is meant to do

1271
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,760
Yeah, they could be doing that just be just maybe

1272
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,560
Wow, it's been worked out well

1273
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,320
Again, you stole my ammo. God damn it. Uh

1274
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:31,840
Either this or this either one, uh, let's do uh

1275
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,160
Let's do second stomach. Oh wait, this one is not about Pluto

1276
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,280
Jesus what were we talking about?

1277
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:52,320
Uh, we're talking about how you can't go to how you're closed off from college and being president

1278
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,080
Oh, yeah

1279
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,920
Because I've said I've said I've said the in world like nobody can be president right like to

1280
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,800
Like that's not a thing that most people actually have it. Ah shit. Shit. Shit

1281
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:11,440
That's not a thing that most people have any chance of of doing even under like the best of circumstances sure bin

1282
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,240
It's it's it's it's the principle of the matter. It's it's not the specifics. It's the principle of the matter

1283
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,760
Oh god, oh fuck

1284
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,360
Ah, fuck

1285
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:31,040
And and and what would be the solution that I guess I would just have to change my name but then but then but then I don't know

1286
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,120
Yeah

1287
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,640
Oh, I hope I hope we get bolt marrow. I even autocross bonnet. Oh, so this is where a little hunter spawns

1288
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,080
I'm I'm looking for a shatter right now

1289
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,960
Oh

1290
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:57,040
Hey, if I shoot a rocket and it hits you will that kill you? Yes. Uh, that's really bad. I should get rid of this weapon

1291
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:06,720
I killed killed the little hunter killed them. Ah, I died. That's funny. That's funny to me that's happening

1292
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,960

Oh my god, can he can we can he get in here? Can he get in on this shit?

1294
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:23,040
I'm adding him right now. Oh my god. I am a little worried that he's gonna be a liability

1295
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,400
I mean, I'm I mean, I'm already a liability

1296
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,680
No, no, no, no, no

1297
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:32,880
Wait

1298
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,880
Am I not friends with the devu on discord?

1299
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,680
On discord?

1300
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,080
Yeah, yeah, not friends with the devu on discord. Uh

1301
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,120
Huh

1302
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,360
Hey, I'll be right back. I'm gonna grab another pepsi

1303
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,240
Okay, gross

1304
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:59,280
Hello furious, what do you think? What do you think of my current predicament? What what what do you think am I making am I making something out of nothing?

1305
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,480
Have I just been too reflective?

1306
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:09,400
It is is the path. I'm not I'm on honorable and not something to worry about at all

1307
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,480
Let me know I'm talking about this with DeVoo. I'm sure DeVoo will have some mad thoughts about this

1308
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,720
And now we enter

1309
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,800
Yes, it's a right now thing also, they can't hear us

1310
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,600
Be as good as you need a Pepsi right now

1311
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,960
Well, I'm glad because that would have been a total surprise

1312
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:45,120
Um, okay. Well, give me a minute. Uh, I don't think I have nuclear zone downloaded on my computer at present

1313
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:52,000
Uh, could you get it? I'll have to read download it. Yes, but I don't I mean, you know

1314
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,680
I have only mildly terrible internet right now. So

1315
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,400
Shouldn't be that hard

1316
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,800
You'll also have to download a mod but the mod is like you just export something into a folder

1317
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,600
Is this mod all like required?

1318
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,920
Yes

1319
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,200
Oh, okay. Well, uh, send that my way then I will

1320
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,040
You you have to download it just just click on download

1321
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,680
And then it will like be like do you want to pay money?

1322
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:23,920
And then you will click no and then just download the most recent one. Oh, shit. Oh, it's online. Oh, we're gonna actually do this multiplayer

1323
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,000
Yes, of course

1324
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
good

1325
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
except for the whole

1326
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,360
I

1327
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,520
Oh, jeez. It's almost half a gig

1328
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,840
Uh, no promises. I can do this right now. It might take a while. Oh god, really

1329
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:47,680
Yeah, I have a gig my internet's great. It's like 10 megabits per second. Oh, Ben. Are you here right now? Yeah, I'm back

1330
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,240
Could they hear us during that? Yeah

1331
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,040
Oh, lol, haha

1332
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,480
Don't worry. I'm always on my nuclear toes

1333
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,800
We're all here. This is the original group. This is the original trio

1334
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:07,440
Uh, well, but what's this about what's this about popular and ready fucker. What are you debu?

1335
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,920
People have been calling you the original and the classic separately

1336
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:17,120
Huh, what's your title? I don't know if you know about the gang warfare that is

1337
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,360
Spawned around debu. Do you know anything about the rat what this current state of the rowdy fucker scop killers?

1338
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,760
I know nothing about its current state. Okay. Okay fair enough

1339
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,480
You're living under a fucking rock my friend

1340
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,680
Aren't you guys like in the Grand Canyon?

1341
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,800
Uh, we're on we're on the edge of the Grand Canyon

1342
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:41,440
It used to be the Grand Canyon before it was flooded with a nuclear waste aka slime

1343
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:46,480
Luckily, they download going pretty well. It's estimating in over three minutes. So that should be good

1344
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,240
So are you gonna are you gonna finish up this run? Are you gonna join our fucking co-op?

1345
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:55,840
I've been invited. I was like, oh, we're gonna be on variety fuckers. Sure. When will it be?

1346
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:00,880
I get a call instead of the answer. What I am gonna turn you

1347
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,840
That's how I do things around here because you are a little quieter for me

1348
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:11,360
Oh, god, right. Okay. Am I quiet in general me? I need to turn up my uh, no, no, no, you're good. You're good. It's on my end

1349
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,880
Uh

1350
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,960
It looks like this download nuclear thermo together has like nine different versions

1351
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,480
Do I need to just download the most recent one at the top? Yes. Yes. Gotcha

1352
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,240
I

1353
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:30,880
Do boo you you you are a conserver god. You are an intellectual unparalleled in the sphere in which we operate

1354
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:37,760
Ben we're just going to head to head and an unrivaled debate for the century. Also, Ben, I'm gonna start

1355
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,280
Oh, what a debate you say

1356
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:46,640
Yes, and am I debate? Uh debate. I mean me whining and been listening

1357
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,760
Right

1358
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Non-relate political

1359
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,600
Uh, anyway

1360
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,600
The premise is this

1361
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,920
Wait, wait, wait. Did you start the game? Yes, dude. I'm gonna pause it. I'm not looking

1362
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,640
Okay, okay, great. Uh,

1363
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,480
Don't worry me, dude

1364
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,760
Sad I'm sad aim slash or frightened

1365
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:12,960
That I may not ever be able to be president because I've said the n-word online before

1366
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,960
Oh

1367
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,000
Well, my take on that is that within the next generation

1368
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,040
I'd probably have said this on pcp within the last couple months

1369
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:26,000
But my theory is that when we get to the point that millennials start running for presidents

1370
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:30,320
Uh, all of their dirty laundry will already be known, right?

1371
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,800
Everything will already go up to like peak Lewinsky within like a week of people googling your name

1372
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,920
And so the only way to become a politician then is to either

1373
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:47,200
Be a surile voice out which doesn't exist or if you just still fully own up to everything that people

1374
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,480
Say about you i.e. That's just locker room talk, baby

1375
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,000
Okay, so basically you say it won't manage us

1376
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:02,080
And this is the way that the world's blowing and then it will just it will just be commonplace for people to be

1377
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:07,520
To have all of their secrets aired online if you're getting big shots to me debate for fun

1378
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,920
I mean, yeah

1379
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,400
Culture and the guy is saying I can't believe

1380
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,720
Okay, if you're like if you're running for president someone

1381
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,800
Fuck tv is like chewing you out to your face. All you gotta do is just be like

1382
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,040
Man, you're right. I did say the n-word. This tune's got a point

1383
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Oh god

1384
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:33,520
Oh, hey, baby. I've just been impromptu invited to at least make a cameo appearance on the rally fuckers top killers episode

1385
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,000
So

1386
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:40,320
That's what i'm doing right now. Do you have something to tell me? Do we need to go in the other room to say something?

1387
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,720
No, okay, you're just gonna take it back. Okay. She's invited on. She's invited on too

1388
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,440
This is a communal show. This is this is the show for the people

1389
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,640
Show for the people. Okay

1390
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:58,320
So let's see. Um, almost downloading their throne. I've got the uh, I've got the uh

1391
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,280
extension downloaded

1392
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,520
All right, I don't I don't see how we can accommodate more than two people because like there's only two

1393
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,880
Sides of this like character selection. Ben this goes up to four players. It's not it's not

1394
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:16,240
Hey, what's up?

1395
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,320
Yeah, that's supposed to be frogs you can see

1396
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
You can see what's out. Oh, yeah

1397
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,800
Well, oh no, no

1398
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,400
I've been impromptu invited to a podcast all of a sudden after a minute ago

1399
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:35,680
So today is unfortunately not a great time to be on on calling me. Why are we both toad?

1400
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,520
This is this is the fate we've done. Yeah

1401
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,960
All right. See ya wait, are you leaving?

1402
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,120
Uh, okay

1403
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,040
Oh, um, okay. Bye

1404
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:59,440
I like that. Hey munchie. Did you decide did you decide that you would be pink and I would be purple?

1405
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,120
Was that deliberate?

1406
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,280
No, but it worked out just well. Yeah

1407
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,360
All right, let's see here. So, uh, where do I go to get to

1408
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:14,560
I'm right clicking on nuclear throne on my steam library. Where do I go to like to the file?

1409
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:20,880
All you have to do is right click on your phone then then on top of these

1410
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:26,320
And then it should be in the third tab. I believe uh files

1411
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,200
Yeah, all right. Yes

1412
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,200
all right, so

1413
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:35,840
Of the other my other windows got the nuclear throne 9 9 2 1 nuclear throne together

1414
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,360
I mean do I put the

1415
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:42,400
Folder in there or just some of the files? No, just just extract the entire thing into that folder

1416
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,680
Gotcha

1417
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,520
Gotcha

1418
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,560
All right. I dropped an end. So do I hit plan nuclear throne now?

1419
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,160
No, you actually don't you you sir you what you do is you

1420
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,120
Uh, click on the file run tt

1421
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:04,560
Uh, yeah, yeah, I think it's actually compile tt something that effect where it's it's a it's an application

1422
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:11,200
Uh, that has tt in it and it's it's asking you in tt assemble. Yes a symbol a symbol there you go

1423
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,840
All right, so you run that

1424
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:18,800
So let's say I have install nuclear throne together just just do that option. Yes

1425
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,640
Gotcha

1426
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:24,320
Couldn't find game files with assets. Did you extract the files into the game?

1427
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:31,040
Well, I extracted them and then moved them over. So I guess I have to extract them directly in yes. Yes

1428
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,160
Okay

1429
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:39,760
That's the kind of shit that makes operating systems fucking confusing it is

1430
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,520
All right, this is this is my life also. I hope that the trope of

1431
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:50,560
Another pcp member joins refrigus cop killers only to receive technical advice is an is another running theme of the show

1432
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,800
Because I've already done with it both sign up a minecraft server

1433
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:58,560
It's still saying I extracted it directly into my nuclear throne folder and it's still telling me

1434
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,360
Couldn't find any game files with assets

1435
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,520
I think what's going on here is is a nuclear throne together is a separate folder within my nuclear throne folder

1436
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,400
And it's just all the files have to be scattershot inside the same files

1437
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:17,360
Yes, gotcha. That's what you meant by has to go directly at first. Yeah. Yeah

1438
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,480
What a mess like like someone comes in my room and tells me hey throw the socks all over the place

1439
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,640
Like uh ocd

1440
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,520
You you will never be able to find the original files of that game

1441
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,120
I guarantee you you will never be able to uninstall this whatsoever

1442
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:35,200
You just you just you just need to say that that will never be a part of your life again

1443
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,200
And

1464
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,000

1475
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:07,920
How convenient that is number one best way to persuade guests to come on your podcasts

1476
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,960
Don't ask them to record their own audio

1477
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,920
This is the shanty town operation

1481
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:37,360

Of the monarchy. This is just for the working the working common man

1486
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:01,600
I've never in my fucking life done any of the uh social media options of uh steam

1487
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,960
Because I've never actually like don't anything with any friends in steam

1488
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:08,160
Oh

1489
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:11,520

Operation gay rights obliteration. Here we go. Oh, here we go. Yeah three slots. Uh, fuck. I'll be eyes

1492
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:31,280
Is that because of me? Yeah, probably that's fine though. It's not really

1493
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,240
It's really nice pretty bad lag

1494
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:41,200
Okay, I I'm I'm used to playing on 2b2t where there are only two ticks a second

1495
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:45,200
And it and it feels like you're not even planning him and you're actually just walking inside a slideshow

1496
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:49,360
Of what your actions would have been two minutes ago. This is this is unplanned

1497
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,240
Yeah, no, I don't know. I don't know why

1498
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,640
We're fine. We're fine. Look

1499
01:35:55,280 --> 01:36:00,640
There's like a quarter. It's like a half second delay, bro. I don't know man. This is uh, yeah, this actually sucks

1500
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,320
This actually sucks

1501
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:07,200
I love that how like you're like trying to pretend that it was okay. It lasted like all of 10 seconds

1502
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,160
Yeah

1503
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:14,800
Well, it's it's because I tried to turn a corner and it like took a second before my character to even start to move, right?

1504
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,800
Yeah

1505
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,800
Also, who's a rogue?

1506
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:26,400
Oh, cool. Wait, is this competitive or cooperative cooperative?

1507
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,680
Okay, I've been trying to slow place to shoot at you guys this little time

1508
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,000
Well, it doesn't matter

1509
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,480
This this won't work didn't realize we both had purple or is around us

1510
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,440
Oh, I was hoping you'd have a blue

1511
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:44,800
I'm shocked that I've been able to survive as long as I have

1512
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,280
Don't think it's my fault though because uh probably is

1513
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,320
I don't have the best uh

1514
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,680
The best of king on my internet today

1515
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,640
Yeah, forever. No forever

1516
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:10,080
Well, well, well as foreshadowing you you did say as you're down this oh happy. Goodbye. I don't know if I can be on this episode

1517
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,240
Yeah

1518
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:18,240
I've never had good internet

1519
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,200
God damn it

1520
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:28,000
You may be realizing part part of the reason why I've never done social media shit on steam. I can't play online games

1521
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:31,040
Yeah, I guess so. Oh, oh, Jesus Christ

1522
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:37,120
I've never had good internet. I've never been able to play online games. Fucking ever the only time I had good internet was in

1523
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:40,160
Freckin, Virginia. Why don't why don't you get better internet?

1524
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:45,520
Oh, wow. Yeah, man. Check your fucking band with litch

1525
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:50,160
You can't go out into the store and just get better internet. Oh my god. We're so

1526
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:56,480
Every single time it's limited based on where the fuck you live and I've just always lived in shit places

1527
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,280
It's

1528
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:10,080
No, you can't you fucking can't oh my god, this is like telling someone hey like why don't you just get a job?

1529
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:12,160
You know what I mean like

1530
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,800
I mean, oh, it's true. All right. I could say so

1531
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:20,160
I live in a small town, bro

1532
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:25,360
I live in a small town and like my internet was all right

1533
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,760
No, no, no, I'm sure you're right. I'm sure you're right. It's just I'm surprised

1534
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:41,200
Thank you surprise. It's not like I have been frustrated about this for literally 20 years

1535
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,680
Or anything, you know

1536
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:47,840
It's not like I haven't spent the combined total of thousands of hours

1537
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:54,800
Googling different providers that could provide always just narrowly not being able to access my exact fucking street

1538
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:00,880
And and even when even when you live in a suburb suburb like I am it's always like you're gonna have the best area at all

1539
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:04,640
I I just spend a ton of money to get a good router like I have right now

1540
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:09,280
It all it all depends on if you have enough money to shill over to these fucking people

1541
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:13,600
We're trying to fuck you over every second that they get. Those phones are for buyers and the internet

1542
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:17,360
Suppliers do not care about you at all. They don't care about where you are

1543
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:23,120
All they're looking to do is make a buck and you've been are just privileged to be in a scenario where not only are you in a city

1544
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,800
But you're able you're able to spend your money frivolously

1545
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:32,720
Doing nothing all day in order to get your internet to be where it deserves to be in order to play an online game

1546
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,520
Pity on you to look down on us for just being the common working class people

1547
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:44,880
Yeah, we're trying to make a name for ourselves in the world Ben and here you come looking down as a chip on your shoulder

1548
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,120
Yeah, I'm pretty bougie. I'm pretty bougie

1549
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,960
bougie

1550
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,320
Well, hope you're having fun. Glad it was fucking worth bringing me on

1551
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:59,680
Holy fuck

1552
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,960
Uh, all right, let's stop this

1553
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
No, no

1554
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,960
What do you mean? Why?

1555
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:16,960
Wait, I mean is the game just completely frozen for you. Yes. Yeah, let's let's not do this anymore. I hate it

1556
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,840
Well, I mean

1557
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:26,000
Well, it's compromise. What compromise on the issue. Let's go. Let's let's meet each other. Oh, yeah

1558
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:31,040
Oh, it's running like a dream now. No, let's fucking drop the charade

1559
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,080
Let's drop the charade

1560
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,040
Wait, did you believe

1561
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,720
Wait, are you are you melting? Yeah

1562
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:47,040
Well, maybe it's still kind of it's still kind of like delayed

1563
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:51,280
It's means the game auto said it's like it's like king mss

Okay, that's fine. We're still on the call

1567
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,840

All right, let's sorry I knew again. All right. Well, that was that that that that was the cameo

I'm I'm I'm glad that he was able to rekindle the fiery passion

1574
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:28,800
Yeah on the original uh episode, you know, it was just like old times

1575
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:33,280
Yeah, this is this is real stripped down memory lane. This went exactly how I remembered it last time

1576
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:40,880
I'm pretty sure that the original reference hot players was the first time I was ever on any internet show ever

1577
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,280
That might be the case. No, you were on the pcp before that

Time flies

1593
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:50,000
You overestimate how much of a presence I had an early pcp. I was I was I was but merely a specter in people's periphery

1594
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,960

01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,400
Hold hold your horses

1599
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:11,680
Oh, did you say well hey, you know my internet doesn't die that much

1600
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:15,760
Uh, it's actually the most I actually have the most stable internet I've ever had

1601
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,280
It's only like just crashed randomly about four times the whole time

1602
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:25,840
I've had it. So I think it's just trying to give everyone a vertical slice of all the things that can go wrong with my internet

1603
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,680
Yeah, uh, I guess I should just play this again. No

1604
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,080
No, no

1605
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:34,960
No, I mean would would the results be any different?

1606
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,720
Well, hold on. I'm actually tethering my phone right now

1607
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:44,720
So that might be better. I don't know you want to try. Okay. All right. I'll give it another try. Yeah

1608
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:49,760
Yeah, see if my phone's better. Although it's also going through wi-fi. It's not really tethering. It's just

1609
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:55,280
Turn my phone into a mobile hotspot. I can tell it's not entirely my internet's fault because

1610
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:01,680
This is clearly not well optimized. I'm sure it can't be too optimized and it's simply a mod

1611
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,400
mod for game that is not

1612
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,280
normally

1613
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,880
Don't don't blame the game

1614
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,800
Don't blame the game

1615
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:15,440
Hate the player hate the player not the game as the saying goes

1616
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:23,040
Join what are you doing right now? I joined the game. I joined. Yeah. No. No. Davoo's in here. Ben is not. Oh

1617
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,560
Don't don't you undertail it me young man, uh, all right

1618
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,840
All right late 2015 indie games straight motherfucker

1619
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,160
I'm making a um

1620
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,800
Sorry, I'm I'm shrinking

1621
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,640
a uh

1622
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:49,360
The the collection of art that I did on this on my stream yesterday. I'm shrinking it down

1623
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,360
What we're in the middle. What we're in the middle of a recording. I know

1624
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,600
But you know

1625
01:44:55,600 --> 01:45:01,200
Okay, you know how I go. I forgot. Have you ever have you not smoked weed yet?

1626
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,480
Uh once

1627
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,920
How was it?

1628
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:06,880
It was

1629
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,480
Weedy when

1630
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,560
When was that when was that?

1631
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,560
Uh, well, it was

1632
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:19,120
It was literally right after we recorded the uh totoro cast which uh, that's

1633
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:27,440
Uh, it was just you know, my wife's sister's weed. So it was like sleepy weed. So are you guys married?

1634
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,600
Yeah, we're not yet

1635
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:35,200
But yeah, I'm doing the same thing digi does of like fiance is a weird like posh word that you try to avoid because it sounds

1636
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,200
Takes too many syllables, you know

1637
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:42,640
When the only reason you aren't married yet is because of fucking like health insurance

1638
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:47,600
Then why not just call them a wife? You know, what do you mean? You're not married because of health insurance

1639
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:54,400
Well, because when you marry someone it like, you know, your health insurance all sorts of like fucking red tape shifts around

1640
01:45:54,400 --> 01:46:01,680
You know, but my fucking my fiance is still on her parents her mom's health insurance, right? So like if she gets married

1641
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:04,080
You don't have that wait. That's that's where the

1642
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,640
Insurance if you're married, yeah

1643
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,960
Yeah, yeah

1644
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:13,280
Yeah, man, this is the fucking libertarian wide government marriage

1645
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:20,400
Fucking controls your life, you know, we also moved back that getting married would only increase your options for health insurance

1646
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:24,160
I mean it opens up other doors, but it closes other other doors

1647
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:27,920
This is part of the reason we moved back to oregon is because of health insurance reasons

1648
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:31,280
It's the fucking government taking my guy damn the money

1649
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:35,360
And then giving it back to me under their conditions libertarian

1650
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,920
Funny you should say that. Um

1651
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,040
Now I did not move I

1652
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:45,520
One of the one of the best things about that. I'm back in boston. Okay, um

1653
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:48,160
Georgia is a nightmare hellscape

1654
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:49,600
um

1655
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:55,440
Where I'm gonna let you finish Ben. Yeah, join the video game. Oh fine. Whatever who fucking cares about video games

1656
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,920
We're talking about health insurance. Wait, I didn't get an invite

1657
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,960
Jesus Christ. Oh wait, there it is. Okay

1658
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,400
uh

1659
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:09,040
Georgia is a nightmare hellscape where you can be too poor to qualify for government assisted healthcare

1660
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,160
How the fuck does that work? Yeah, um

1661
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,200
It's literally the worst place in the world

1662
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,320
And I hate it and I and I hope the whole thing burns down

1663
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:23,040
What what's even the point if you if you can be too poor to do the thing that poor people need to do?

1664
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:29,920
It's just run. It's just it's just an evil place. It's just an evil evil. Watch. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. My ping is insane

1665
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:38,000
It's insanely lower insanely high insanely insanely bad like the delay on my input is

1666
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:44,240
Yeah, I still have some pretty bad delay, but clearly this is actually like running at something resembling a framerate

1667
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:48,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like I'm not freezing anymore. It's just the delay is massive

1668
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,360
It's like running smooth but I still have delays

1669
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:59,120
Do you do people get to play online games and the fucking computer does what you want when you fucking push a button? Wow

1670
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,600
No, that must be great, huh?

1671
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,920
It's nice. It's nice

1672
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:09,120
You know, I want you to go on the record that digis internet despite having despite being quote unquote good

1673
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:14,560
It was very unstable. We crash fucking constantly. Well, they're probably like a thousand people using it at the same time

1674
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,080
No, they're really

1675
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,560
You weren't that many people. No, it was just it's just a big

1676
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:22,240
That was just like weirdly wired and shit or you know, whatever

1677
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:28,080
Hey, both of you were in we were in the highly experimental

1678
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:32,480
Digi house and you both and you both have gone on a grand adventure since then

1679
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:40,400
Well, how would you rate? How would you rate the fall of rome to a k a the fall of the house and the years since then?

1680
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:44,720
Like like like who's liking all these buildings the fall? Okay. I was

1681
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,920
I was kind of disappointed when digi house fell apart

1682
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:51,520
Uh, I was sort of confused as to why it was falling apart

1683
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,600
because there seemed like

1684
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:58,560
I don't know like a bunch of things happened in a row that seemed like they could or would

1685
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,640
Spell the end of digi house, but then they didn't

1686
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,360
and then ultimately it was just like

1687
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,520
Digi's parents were just moving back

1688
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:12,480
Or something I did for being I died what became flipper over the course of winter 2018

1689
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:16,640
And was pretty should have been clear if fucking fall 2017

1690
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:21,520
Is that digi wasn't ready to live with a bunch of dudes he needs a fucking girlfriends, right?

1691
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:26,320
Wait, what do you mean ready to live with a bunch of dudes he needed a girlfriend?

1692
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,720
Come put on me someone. Well, what does it mean?

1693
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Let me fucking watch it. Why?

1694
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,600
Uh

1695
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,600
I'll rephrase it as uh

1696
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,600
Digi was really bored and lonely

1697
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,880
Yeah

1698
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,320
Boring moved in and we didn't fix it because we don't have tits

1699
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:48,160
I mean, I was pretty bored and lonely at digi house too. I mean, I like hanging out with you guys, but like, you know

1700
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:49,840
Yeah

1701
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:55,760
You know, well, I was I obviously was too except that my standard for what is boring is is pretty fucking

1702
01:49:56,320 --> 01:50:01,280
Extreme so like it was still like having anyone at all was more than I was used to so I was fine

1703
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:06,880
You know, I don't have like depression problems. So I can like make I can compensate for a lot, right? Yeah

1704
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,440
Uh, did you just couldn't you know?

1705
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:11,520
uh

1706
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,360
I mean, you know, he was

1707
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:18,560
I hadn't been going through a couple of straight years of working in my house all alone like he had at that point

1708
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,640
Right, like like as digi was continuing to lose his mind and not knowing what he wants

1709
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,720
I was on fucking dating websites just

1710
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:29,600
BAM me everyone was fucking messages until someone liked me and then got hooked up, right?

1711
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,400
Yeah, but you got an internet girlfriend

1712
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,480
Yeah, but it was

1713
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:38,400
I mean, I know it is more than that, but like right, okay

1714
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:44,480
Like when I was in boston at first I was on I was on tinder like before I moved and I would and I was getting laid with like

1715
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,280
Not all the time or anything but with like, you know some regularity and it was pretty all right

1716
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,760
I moved into digi's place and

1717
01:50:52,400 --> 01:51:00,320
It's remote and there's nobody and like there's fucking nothing and I after like six months after like several months there

1718
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,160
I was like, oh

1719
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:04,160
I hate this

1720
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:08,240
I was flying there except for the fact that I like did he was fed up

1721
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:11,200
Like did he wasn't was just stressed out all the time and you know

1722
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:14,160
my favorite my favorite is the fact that

1723
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,960
Oh, you know, he's all right

1724
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,280
to put him on low mid-key blast and shit like

1725
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,800
for the several months leading us up to us moving in me and digi were

1726
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:32,640
Constantly talking about how we were going to become a fucking like rlm style like vlog fucking

1727
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:38,400
Super team, right? Yeah, and what happened was right on what I minded goals, right?

1728
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:44,240
I was fucking ready for it. Did you made whole vlogs about like talking about ideas you wanted to give and so like

1729
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,000
What happened then was when I move in the day of rad talk, right?

1730
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:49,440
So

1731
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:54,720
Radcon happened so after radcon is over digi's like burned out, right? I didn't understand us at the time

1732
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:58,720
I've me and digi both have obtained much greater empathy

1733
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,880
Fucking autism treatments thanks to having spouses, right?

1734
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:08,320
But at this time our ability to like get what the other one's vibe was on was pretty minimal

1735
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:15,440
So digi's all burned out after radcon, but I'm just like aching to go. I'm ready to go, right? Like at this time

1736
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:21,840
All of 2016 has been this huge rush of getting everything I wanted, right? Like I finally quit my fucking job

1737
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:26,080
I was finally able to do that and then I became a pcp member and then I like

1738
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:29,760
Save up money and get an all-new computer and then I moved in with digi, right?

1739
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:34,480
So it's like all of 2016 I'm writing this massive high of finally getting everything I wanted

1740
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:38,080
Whereas digi has just been in this big slump for over a year, right?

1741
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:42,000
And he was just really counting on us to get him out of that slump

1742
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:46,800
But it wasn't really right. So day after radcon's over

1743
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:50,400
I fucking go up to him and I'm like, yo, let's make content. Let's do it, you know

1744
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:53,920
He's like no like like giving his like super tired look, you know, like

1745
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,160
Ah, no, well

1746
01:52:56,160 --> 01:53:01,920
So the the next day happened and it's like, all right, dude content. Let's do content. He's like, I don't like content when we do

1747
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:06,480
Right. So like four straight days in a row. I was like the last day. I was like, yeah, digi

1748
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,280
Content, let's do content

1749
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,880
I don't think you're being fair because like you can't just say let's make fun like what does that mean?

1750
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,800
Like you have I guess

1751
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,440
Fair enough, right? But I mean, you know, I mean

1752
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:25,360
Hey, that's fair. I think it was also fair though to assume that like, you know, he's the creative director

1753
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:30,080
He's the one with, you know, leading the charge. He's the one who owns the house, right? But I mean fair enough

1754
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:36,320
I no no no fair enough. No, I totally go to mean I could have been more proactive about it when radcon was over

1755
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:40,400
I'm sorry. When uh, when I moved away, did you like made a couple of videos where he

1756
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:44,400
He kind of made it sound like it was all my fault. Did you was like, yeah, you know

1757
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:48,240
Like the vood like wasn't getting the main videos done fast enough to be been working faster

1758
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,880
I would have done more vlogs with them. I didn't get that five

1759
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:55,760
I didn't really since get the sense that digi ever was like antsy to do videos, but right

1760
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,720
I didn't really like seem like he enjoyed it. You know

1761
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:00,880
uh

1762
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:04,720
People don't like watching things with me because I get too excited and talk over it a lot

1763
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:08,480
You know, I mean literally

1764
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:14,000
If someone just reminds me once a month, like, hey, you stop talking over it. Oh, right. Fuck forgot us on how that works

1765
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:20,480
Right. Gotcha. And I will but digi at least at this time isn't someone who will say things that might sound offensive, right?

1766
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:25,680
Like I know I know I'm not supposed to fucking talk while I say things or while we watch things but uh

1767
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:29,040
I get really fucking into it and I need to be reminded sometimes

1768
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:34,640
Because I mostly watch stuff by myself and I'm thinking out loud of myself so when I'm watching something with people

1769
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:38,240
Whatever the point is digi wasn't having any fun

1770
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:43,120
Doing videos with me, which is why like you could like if you look at like every video featuring digi bro

1771
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,520
and go through a timeline of around

1772
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,360
Oh, when was it? It was like october 2016 through

1773
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:54,000
April 2017 me and digi did like all of four videos together

1774
01:54:54,080 --> 01:55:00,240
We did one let's play series one vlog. That was it. Right steroids. Click on click on her click on her steroids

1775
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,360
Oh died immediately again

1776
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,360
Uh

1777
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:10,000
No, we're not so I didn't get the same decision

1778
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,760
I wanted to do shit with me because again the whole time he didn't seem enthusiastic about it like

1779
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:18,720
Whatever and the reason why I didn't start getting videos until late is because I had been acquired a girlfriend

1780
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:21,280
So, you know, it's been enough time on the shit

1781
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:26,400
You know, but whatever um, I think it was just sort of a feedback loop of like what me and digi wanted

1782
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:30,160
We're in opposition, right? Like I wanted to do more shit with digi and uh

1783
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:35,040
Digi is just emotional energy for that and for me. We're very limited, right?

1784
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:41,280
Um, because I'm very impatient and fucking speedy, you know, like I just like, okay, let's do this now. Let's do this now

1785
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,720
Let's do that, right?

1786
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,920
um

1787
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:47,200
Like I'm like Casey Neistat without any of the hand-eye coordination

1788
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:53,680
Is he renowned for his hand-eye coordination? I don't know but

1789
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,320
Well, like he rides bikes, right? I mean, I got okay, okay

1790
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:02,080
I don't think I could ride a bike in a city. I would immediately hit a car

1791
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,760
And I I don't actually know how to ride a bike. I don't actually know

1792
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,200
Really?

1793
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:13,520
We are a post millennial. Holy shit. Yeah, I thought I was a loser when I when I didn't learn to ride a bike until I was like nine

1794
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,480
I

1795
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,960
Oh, shit

1796
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:23,520
On the subject of being way too personal for literally no reason

1797
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,760
Yeah, true

1798
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:31,600
I remember there was one point in the chat. I don't even I I think I know who said but I'm not gonna say in case I'm wrong

1799
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:35,760
And I don't want to be wrong for no reason. Uh, there was someone in chat who

1800
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:41,360
When when we were talking about some like, you know, like retarded like long forgotten rk

1801
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:49,920
Group drama. I just remember what was uh, there were there was something said on the subject of like like like you guys

1802
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,240
being like

1803
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:53,840
What was the term?

1804
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:58,720
Turned into feeling humans by the hand of your girlfriends. Well, so I'm gonna come and save you

1805
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,400
Who are you talking about Davoo and digi? Yes

1806
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:13,840
Yeah, uh, where I I I think it was you if I was digi, uh, it was like one

1807
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:21,600
One person was like my girlfriend comes up to me. It's like, why can't you guys just talk about it with

1808
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:27,040
Talk about this issue with one another. Why can't you just talk to each other's face and come to an understanding?

1809
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,440
And then and then he was like

1810
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:33,520
What bit like babe? We're guys. We don't talk ha ha

1811
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:42,000
And I remember very true that stuck with me as probably the most retired thing I've ever heard in my entire life

1812
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:45,520
Like like probably the most your your post

1813
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:55,920
It's not it's not a gendered thing to come to practice what how is that not a gender thing?

1814
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:00,560
How is that not a gender thing? The whole thing is you're guys. We don't talk

1815
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:04,720
I know it shouldn't be that way because that's required

1816
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:10,480
Because because that makes no sense in fact, it shouldn't be a guy thing to do that because it's like

1817
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:16,240
Oh, I'm gonna take matters into my own hands. I'm going to solve this. I'm gonna solve this right now

1818
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:18,640
The very simple binary

1819
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:24,560
If you want to act like a good person but without the moral courage required is to either

1820
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:30,800
Uh be way too self-sacrificing to a to an extent that you cannot be right?

1821
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,920
Like tell yourself you're going to be patient with people to an extent that you don't actually have the emotional energy to do

1822
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:44,640
Or then just get so mad at them and so accusatory right that your accusations don't actually have much to do with what's going on

1823
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:52,160
Right, so if you stick between those two binaries of either blaming yourself completely or blaming other people completely, right?

1824
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:56,800
Then you get to be purely offensive and purely defensive without having to actually like

1825
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:00,080
The reality of what is happening and what your problem, right?

1826
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:06,480
Don't know what you're talking about. Yeah. Well, you know big enough. Whatever. I mean my maybe I wasn't paying attention

1827
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:09,280
No, no, I was pretty big

1828
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,280
Okay, shit. Shit. Shit. Ow

1829
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:14,880
I'm using all my people's body shows right now

1830
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,080
well

1831
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:20,800
Anyway, the point of that is that you don't have to be a guy or a woman to

1832
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:26,400
Face your problems in in the eye and you know take the bull by its horns and get things done

1833
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,480
I think that's a pretty you know

1834
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:32,160
Gender-neutral things do you want to solve problems? I will clarify though

1835
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,720
Talking with people is something I'm fine with doing

1836
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:38,720
Being all emotional and shit before I had a girlfriend very much so

1837
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:42,320
Uh, you just want to honestly if it was like an issue with like

1838
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:46,240
Ben maybe or you munchie, you know, I'd be like, okay, let's talk about it

1839
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:51,040
It was with digi who was specifically like making speeches about how it's a good guy thing, right?

1840
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:56,720
I want to specifically remember I say I I don't remember who said this original thing

1841
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:59,360
I just know it was said in in this group and I thought it was

1842
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,360
I feel like I feel like that's a digi thing to say

1843
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:08,240
I feel like I said it but then I don't think you got it. I don't remember saying that so what

1844
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:15,680
I don't remember it. I don't remember but it's just it's just a thing. I I hear it's not like it's just you guys at all

1845
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,040
I mean, you know, it is a common name to be like, oh, we're guys

1846
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,560
It'll work itself out. So to me when it's just

1847
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:29,440
The problem with living it with digi became or not really the problem so much as the inadequacy of living with digi

1848
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,840
became very clear when he moved in

1849
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,600
And he started doing videos with her, right? Yeah, and okay. Yeah

1850
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:40,080
What did you was saying after operation rad con castle?

1851
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:44,000
Collins castle ended what did he suddenly his vlog was talking about it was

1852
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:47,520
Yeah, you know, I realized within one week that me and dibu just have incompatible

1853
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:49,600
stage presences, right?

1854
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:55,680
And also sort of like work presences like I you know, like my type of work energy is different from his

1855
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,160
So I guess it just makes him feel unwelcomed or

1856
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:05,280
Um awkward working with me, right? He says that he likes working with jesse because jesse works the same speed as him, right?

1857
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:08,400
Yeah, whereas I like I just I'm just too spastic and fast

1858
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:11,280
again like without the hand-eye coordination so

1859
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:17,920
So all that happens and digi mentioned like that was why we ended up not doing vlogs partly because like we just have all these very different energies

1860
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:20,480
and I just want to say like

1861
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:27,600
The original plan was to go to rad con and just do it as a trial run before deciding that we were gonna move in

1862
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:32,000
But then digi's parents sort of like sped things along with the plans of moving out

1863
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:35,200
And so I had to be sort of bite that bullet and take that risk, you know

1864
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,760
That's what I was going to do on that record, right?

1865
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,920
Why can't I not do it?

1866
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,320
Why could I not do it? I was like clicking

1867
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:49,920
And then what happened was once he moved in with may, uh

1868
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:56,000
Immediately he started doing videos with her and people very correctly point out that uh

1869
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:02,320
Their uh, that may just wasn't good at being on screen, right? May had this very different energy the slow energy

1870
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,800
Just awkward in this tour, right?

1871
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:10,320
And then did you was like, oh, don't worry she'll get better, you know, we'll work on it

1872
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:15,600
And I'm like, ah, there we fucking go, right like with me. Did you just decided that we are

1873
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:22,240
Personality's weren't compatible within one week. He gave up. He gave up the goose in five days

1874
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:26,720
But with may he's willing to uh fucking spend months nurturing

1875
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,040
Wow, I wonder why that could be

1876
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:31,920
Right. Yeah. No, I get it though. I'm not like

1877
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:35,360
Like I get it though. Yeah, he needs a fucking girlfriend not a dude

1878
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:40,720
He doesn't want to like spend all day watching anime doing vlogs being in a sweaty room with another guy

1879
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:44,800
He needed a fucking girl. I get it. No, it's totally fair, you know

1880
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:50,240
I I might out myself as a faggot of unbelievable proportions, right?

1881
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:53,520
But may I just say for the record for my own self?

1882
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:57,920
I I I know that I am the outlier in this belief and way of thought

1883
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:01,680
But I don't really feel that different talking to women

1884
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,760
And I don't mean that as in like a like

1885
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:06,400
Like somehow like I've caught you being sexist in a way

1886
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:10,480
But I just I it's it's hard for me to relate to people who have different

1887
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,040
Who feel like there are different airs talking to women

1888
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:20,080
I don't know if it was different. I don't know if it was a gender thing. I don't know if it was like because you guys are guys

1889
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:22,240
And she's a girl

1890
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:27,520
But I definitely felt different talking to my ex-girlfriend than to you in the sense that talking to her

1891
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:29,920
Was horrible and made me miserable

1892
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,400
Talking to you guys was fun and I like

1893
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:37,680
Well, I don't yeah, I don't know if that's a gender thing. It might not be a gender thing might not be a gender thing

1894
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:43,920
Right now, uh, I definitely the distinction between talking to many women is definitely different now that you know

1895
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,600
I have a girl person

1896
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:50,160
So it's not like as much of a I don't feel as awkward about it because it's like all right

1897
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:54,560
I don't have to like think about them and I and I can be pretty confident that they are going to like

1898
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,360
Be suspicious of me because I have a fucking partner, right?

1899
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,920
So that just makes me why would they be suspicious?

1900
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:02,400
You know because you know like

1901
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:08,880
You know if if you know a guy is taken then you know the odds of him like being lustful of you have produced

1902
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:12,960
Not gone to the hell but just gone down percentage wise, right? Sure

1903
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:15,840
Right

1904
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:20,320
That just means I can feel more relaxed around women now, right? I get that. I totally get that

1905
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:28,880
Especially with my girlfriend look at my fiance with my wife with my partner with my life partner lgbt is there with me

1906
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,360
Just run down the mall also provide

1907
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,960
My guys took all the

1908
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:41,760
So yeah, Ben, uh, how

1909
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:48,320
abreast of uh, Jackie's situation is the general public like like how much I've not said her name yet, so

1910
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:53,200
That should

1911
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,520
Wait what really? I mean

1912
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
I was avoiding it. Yeah

1913
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,920
Oh, well shit. Okay. Cool. Don't worry avoid. I mean it doesn't matter

1914
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:06,400
It probably doesn't really oh, I will probably edit it out. But who cares?

1915
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:10,160
Worry not. This is the rfck. So yeah

1916
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,800
Wait aren't people sticking to this live?

1917
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:15,360
How have how abreast our people? Uh

1918
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:18,480
Not very I'm gonna die

1919
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:23,360
Probably I mean, okay. I'm sorry if I'm gonna edit out here, but I'm just too curious. What is uh

1920
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:30,800
People know that you went through a breakup, right? Uh, I think so. I mean, that's that's not exactly a secret

1921
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:35,840
Okay, and people know who it was that you were with up to this point, right?

1922
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:38,960
Yeah, that's why I don't think it's a big deal

1923
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:43,280
To say, right? Oh, I don't want to go. I look. I don't want to go fucking saying her name

1924
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:48,320
You know what? No, I am gonna edit it out. I would rather I would rather not talk about specific people

1925
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:54,720
I shall not bring it up at all. I will be only reactionary about anything you want to say. No, I mean

1926
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,000
I mean

1927
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
man, it's tough because I like

1928
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:06,480
Obviously, obviously I have a lot of feelings about it, right? Obviously I have like thoughts about the situation

1929
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:12,160
Obviously you want to talk about it, but you're very much very probably very rightly afraid of your own desire to talk about it

1930
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:14,720
I am like fuck that. I am

1931
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:22,240
I don't know, you know, they say they say if you don't have if you don't have anything nice to say about someone

1932
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:25,920
And I have nothing I have nothing nice to say

1933
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:31,600
And I want and I want to speak and I want to say a lot of things out of anger and frustration

1934
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:35,440
But I don't I also think that doing that

1935
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:38,880
I also think that doing that is a bad look and I don't want to be that guy

1936
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:45,040
I don't want to I don't want to be the guy who's going around shit talking his ex and making that a thing

1937
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:47,840
So, you know, whatever

1938
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,320
Yeah, definitely

1939
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:56,400
Absolutely, it would be easier to talk about if it's a relationship where like both people are at fault or no one's at fault

1940
02:06:56,400 --> 02:07:00,800
You know, but when it's like when the only way to say what you're feeling would make you feel like a huge dick

1941
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:03,200
And it's like well your hands are tied. Yeah

1942
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,680
Pretty much pretty much

1943
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:11,760
Nuclear phones too easy. I'm glad they added a five second delay to all movement. I think that's really increased the difficulty of this game

1944
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:17,760
And I think that it's a little increased longevity. You're welcome. You're fucking welcome. By the way, debut

1945
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,880
This is going back to what I was talking about earlier. I'm very happy to went on this big long digi house rant

1946
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:27,680
Uh, and I and I thank you for it. But also that wasn't what I was talking about

1947
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:32,800
Well, I well, hopefully it can be informative now that I've explained like where it ended, right? Sure

1948
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:38,720
My maybe I just want to talk about is is just how like like you and ben have both come out of the same experience

1949
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:42,240
And now you both are kind of in opposite scenarios

1950
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:47,520
I would say kind of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, well, I mean, what do you mean? What do you mean much?

1951
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:49,760
What do you mean by an opposite scenario?

1952
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:55,440
You round up exactly where you were right before you went to the house and debu is now is married and inordinate

1953
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:59,680
Well, oh, oh, that's right. That's right. I was thinking you were still in

1954
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:05,520
Fucking right, please. Don't worry. Don't worry about not keeping track. I've been very I've been very like

1955
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:08,400
Minimalistic you're working. Hold on. I'm a little confused though

1956
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:13,760
Does that mean that like you just moved from someplace where there was no good internet available to another place?

1957
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:17,680
So there's no good internet. That's how I fucking like this, bro. I mean

1958
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:26,720
You you were proven to be a villain earlier. Why must you continue to fight on this hill of being as happy with that?

1959
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:29,280
Why would you do that?

1960
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:32,880
Decide how much I want to talk about this. I might have to

1961
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:37,280
I'm gonna I'm gonna clear it with cold first to see like how much detail I get into

1962
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:40,640
Uh, I'm listening to going close the corner here. You're right back

1963
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,600
This is fun debu's cool. Uh, I'm I'm enjoying him

1964
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:54,880
I'll be enjoying him. We'll see how well he does. Oh, yeah, we'll see if he passes the next trial

1965
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:57,440
I'll be enjoying him. I'll be enjoying him

1966
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
All night long

1967
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:02,880
Please click on me. You will die if you don't revive

1968
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:06,320
There are you fucking happy?

1969
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:10,480
No, nothing will ever satisfy me. Oh shit. I'm dead

1970
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:13,200
Help

1971
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:15,440
Help. All right. I'm back

1972
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:18,240
Oh, yes

1973
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:20,960
Just the man I wanted to see

1974
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:24,320
Shit. Oh, well, it's over. It's only if you've been in a circus prison

1975
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:27,200
Glad to be going right now

1976
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,360
What was what's the word?

1977
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:33,680
She gave me part as she had before she gave me carte blanche carte blanche to say whatever

1978
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:38,320
But I want to be because like like, you know, she hasn't been internet famous yet

1979
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,240
But like I've been you know

1980
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:44,560
The thing is you feel like you're famous as soon as people are pissing you off because like they don't really know you

1981
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:48,800
But they think they know you know what I mean, like that's the fucking definition of celebrity. It thinks the internet

1982
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:53,040
It happens just news. You got five thousand subscribers, right? The word famous has become

1983
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,160
You know, it used to be a giant loaded shit show now. It's a tiny microscopic shit show

1984
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:00,720
uh

1985
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:03,680
I don't like talking about myself that much

1986
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:09,600
Because people will then come in and like talk really invasively about you like they're your fucking friend

1987
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:14,960
And I hate them even if their advice is good, especially if their advice is good, you know, yeah

1988
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:16,640
so

1989
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:18,160
You know

1990
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:21,120
Especially if you avoid anything specific then people won't know what to do with you

1991
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:23,680
Here's what's going on. Oh, no, sorry

1992
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:29,120
So once it was clear that we needed that we're like we need to get out of digi's house, right?

1993
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:32,160
We need to like move on because digi needs to explore the world at this time

1994
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:34,240
digi was talking about buying a fucking rv

1995
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,400
So he could just like

1996
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:39,600
There's so many

1997
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:43,760
By the way, in case any of you think this talk behind his back. I know did you listen to this right now?

1998
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,800
So I I'm speaking. I have so little space right before about the

1999
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:49,360
In time I don't

2000
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:53,600
Of course

2001
02:10:56,560 --> 02:11:02,080
No, I'm saying nothing about that, but all I'm saying is that there are numerous numerous ideas that you can come stuff with

2002
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:04,960
Like becoming a mo been working on

2003
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:10,880
Uh lately becoming a hentai manga artist in a month. Yeah, that's that only grow

2004
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:13,760
Roman the world in an rv

2005
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:16,240
Roman the world in an rv was not

2006
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:19,280
I actually thought it might happen for a bit there, right?

2007
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:21,520
No, I was speaking

2008
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:26,560
This was a plan that never should have been uh talked about digi may not talk about this to you

2009
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:32,080
But munchi digi was contemplating like bringing you on his rv adventure. Oh, I never heard that

2010
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:36,720
Yeah, he was like yeah, munchi's a genius. I should bring him in on as my protege in my rv

2011
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:39,280
I had never heard that

2012
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:43,040
I never heard that you never wanted to be released. I don't know. Maybe those would be his plans

2013
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:47,920
Maybe him and maybe him and may will kidnap you at some point and they'll adopt you as their child

2014
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:50,480
I think I was aware of some sort of kidnapping though. I didn't know

2015
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:57,600
This is actually a weird sort of thing with digi

2016
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:03,280
What is that was his last girlfriend did the same thing right like talked about you like like you were just

2017
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:08,400
Oh, oh, well, that's entirely other weird thing by digi. I don't I don't think many I don't think may as indeed do that

2018
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:11,520
Uh, the weird thing about digi is that he likes me a lot

2019
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:16,800
Yeah, which is very flattering and I'm very happy and occasionally to like say like munchi's a genius

2020
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:20,160
I'm like, I mean wow. I think we all like you a lot. I didn't feel that way about

2021
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:24,240
No, what what do you mean? I can't even give anyone a good

2022
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:30,320
Well, I'm sure like I get the impression that like, you know people like like me

2023
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:34,960
And so I think you're the one holding the pcp together more than anyone else right now

2024
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,360
What what what does I do?

2025
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:40,560
You're the only one other than Nate who's like willing to like really like

2026
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:44,880
Put a lot of effort into the group and like do a lot of things help organize shit

2027
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:49,840
And like put in a lot of energy for it whereas like most of everyone else is half-assing it me especially

2028
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:52,240
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no

2029
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:58,560
Well, because I think it's cool. Exactly. Uh, I mean, thank you everyone

2030
02:12:58,720 --> 02:12:59,760
I

2031
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:05,120
This is all like that one on the pcp where Nate was like we all like like where where Nate said something nice about me

2032
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:09,680
And I thought that he was he was building into a joke about how I wasn't cool at all and he just stopped there

2033
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:14,640
I'm like, wait, did they just compliment me with no with no hint of insincerity

2034
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:22,400
Did Nate just do anything sincerely? Yeah, uh, this is nice. Anyway, I was just gonna say about digi

2035
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:24,720
Uh, like he's like

2036
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:31,200
Of the way that digi is now the way that the life is it like I won't ever see him

2037
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:34,160
For like a long time, uh, which is getting better now

2038
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:37,360
But I usually don't see him for like, you know a while at a time and then we'll just come back

2039
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:43,760
And I'll just get some whiff about how he's called me a genius in some podcast and I don't know how to respond to that

2040
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:49,280
I don't mean to imply that like I'm like, I'm too sheepish to be like, thank you digi

2041
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:55,840
But I don't know how to like should I like message him and be like, thank you for thinking that I'm nice because because I sure

2042
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:58,160
You're nice

2043
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,640
So hard

2044
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:02,480
So weird and difficult

2045
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:06,880
What the fuck does he want from people, you know, I I watch some some

2046
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:11,920
Off off, you know one off a thing that he and may did

2047
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:17,360
On the krupping your tit channel, which I did not watch at all. Basically, but I got I got with this

2048
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:22,720
Shout out to in in obi noby in the rck chat. He told me on to this

2049
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:31,200
Uh, it was it was one where he like talks about like how I made that burky stupid like funny thing at red con 3

2050
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:38,160
That was like, you know, like like rating all of uh, my like like our our our like stat progressions

2051
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:43,200
And and and he was like sad that like he was not that he was not higher up on my friends list

2052
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:48,320
I didn't realize the digi felt that way and I'm really sorry

2053
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:53,280
I didn't mean I didn't I like I didn't know that you

2054
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:56,720
Like wanted to be friends that bad, I guess

2055
02:14:57,680 --> 02:15:04,560
Oh, it's kind of it's kind of weird to say I like I I never really like I like I knew digi like respected me for a while

2056
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:12,240
But like more and more he's like acting like I'm real cool and stuff, which is really humbling and also like

2057
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:16,080
I don't want to say the word weird. I don't why I don't want out digi

2058
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:18,720
I don't want to make you feel like like weird at all

2059
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:21,680
It's it's it's more just like

2060
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I'm stunned before ever

2061
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:27,360
You were really like knowing anything about you or even seeing that much of your heart

2062
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:34,160
Uh, digi had already built up you in my mind is like this like fucking like emergence god of like fuck fuck fuck help

2063
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:37,040
21st century digital

2064
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:39,600
died

2065
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:45,360
Uh, well, I'm happy. I I I really did not mean for that to turn into a dick sucking moment of any kind

2066
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:49,280
I just I just wanted to shout out my home dog real quick

2067
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:54,160
Because because I see you I see you out in videos sometimes dropping my name

2068
02:15:54,720 --> 02:16:01,200
And it's increasingly like more and more like you did that in a recent gecko estate and whenever that happens

2069
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:03,840
I'm always caught off guard and and and for all honestly

2070
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:09,520
I'm surprised that you're not that cognizant of like digi's value of you like to me

2071
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,160
It's a very known thing to my knowledge

2072
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:17,600
I think it's because I'm I think it's because I'm a little like like low-key retarded. Yeah, and and like

2073
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:25,040
And and and and like with with with the pcp inherently do the fact that I was a fan first

2074
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:28,720
I I I always feel like like like I'm an ancient spot

2075
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,640
In Greece

2076
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:35,040
Like like I'm an ancient sparta in Greece and like I've invaded someone's homeland

2077
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:38,240
And I will always be seen as an outsider to myself even though no one sees me

2078
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:42,400
See, I hated it when did you call me the ascended fan boy?

2079
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:48,480
I'm like, dude, like we all started liking each other's videos and then we started talking and then did you was like

2080
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:52,800
Oh, well, you see before I ever before hip we ever watched my videos

2081
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:58,400
I saw his kid up for me compilation videos and I first saw you debut as a commenter

2082
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:03,520
So therefore you're the ascended fan boy. I'm like, yeah, I don't I don't like the sense of hierarchy that you established with that

2083
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:05,520
you know, like we all like

2084
02:17:06,640 --> 02:17:11,520
Like it's it's not the same thing as like game grumps where you have like a couple of like serious celebrities

2085
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:19,120
Or in this case just one serious celebrity who other people then latch on like we are all our own entities first and foremost, you know

2086
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:23,680
So I don't have to say something that may seem woe is me in faggity

2087
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:27,920
But I don't mean this in any drudgery term or to imply that I am disney's franchise at all

2088
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:32,160
But I kind of don't feel like PCP mirror is kind of like a feel like a piece of key intern

2089
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:34,720
Or like someone who's just kind of like

2090
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:39,680
I think you're the number one PCP member other than maybe Nate

2091
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:41,600
Really?

2092
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:44,240
Yeah, I mean you're the most fucking no participative

2093
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:50,160
I I think it's because I joined in the same update the same patch that mumky was added

2094
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:56,880
It would have been just kind of feels like further reinforced that if you weren't a brony then you will not be a PCP member

2095
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:58,880
We tried adding non-bronies

2096
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:04,320
And it's brownies only we just like malaria. It never goes away. It never leaves your system

2097
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:09,040
We just didn't share the history with the other people like I think that's why it was a mistake

2098
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:12,160
Like that's why we should have known involved like like yet

2099
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:17,360
So even though me and munchie were brought on like later, we were there like watching it happen since the beginning

2100
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:22,240
Oh, yeah, it really was like the fucking the forging of the fires was 2013 and 14

2101
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:27,280
Period and they'll never be more members. I don't think other than maybe some seven-year-old, you know

2102
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:30,080
Who was watching back then who becomes like ascendant?

2103
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:37,920
No, no, this is it. This is it. This is it. You know what would be great is if like like that fucking character from the last

2104
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,120
Bit of bakuman shows up but for us like someone who was a kid

2105
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:46,240
Watched our pony videos and now tried to create like a fucking sub industry of video makers to compete with us

2106
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:48,320
I would kill him

2107
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:50,400
and take his fans

2108
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:52,240
Yeah

2109
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:57,520
Well, in any case, thank you guys for being alive. I guess I don't know it feels gay

2110
02:18:58,240 --> 02:19:04,000
And yeah, I've gone full circle from having uh for for having sincere beliefs

2111
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:08,880
So like for like for like the the jub now not wanting to express

2112
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:15,200
How you feel about people and not wanting to express your beliefs in any way to the i'm going to express myself

2113
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:19,440
And and and give love and happiness to everyone I meet and I wrap back around to

2114
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,960
What what what what have you people done to earn my my love? I will give you love. I see this

2115
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:29,280
Yeah, I'm just not used to people liking me still

2116
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:34,080
Let me really start happening until the pcp. I didn't even really say a little bit

2117
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:40,720
Right because I didn't have any human work until around 2013. You know, I there was no reason to like me

2118
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:43,200
So then when I find out that people like ben like

2119
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:49,120
What when I found out that ben wanted me to go visit atlanto with him and digi

2120
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:54,960
I was like what the fuck someone wants me to go to a place with them. What the fuck people like me

2121
02:19:55,520 --> 02:20:00,800
To boot that is such hashtag just teen things to me. That is that that is so fucking relatable

2122
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:04,880
Why do you why do you use the hashtag just teen things in place of hashtag related?

2123
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:10,320
Because that's what is in instead of relatable. But nowadays it's hashtag just teen things

2124
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:13,040
That's too specific

2125
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:18,720
Have you have you seen the tumblr post that are just like an image of some teen looking up the sky and it has a lot of

2126
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:24,240
Like filters over it and they'll be like when you do your homework and your teacher gives you an a plus

2127
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:27,040
Because you did your homework just tag just teen things

2128
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:31,680
I'm getting a instagram account called it just a dean at things

2129
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:36,560
Oh, and it'll be like like a dean of a college. Yeah, it's like oh well your students

2130
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:43,840
When you're when your students don't riot and demand like better better pronouns or something hashtag just teen things

2131
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:48,640
How does one deal with insomnia slash extreme paranoia hashtag just teen things?

2132
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:52,720
I am 13 which means not only my old enough to use twitter, but I can use the hashtag just teen things

2133
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,800
Which is very important to me

2134
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:57,200
Hey, I think it's a snow plow today just teen things

2135
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:03,520
I did a daydream most of the time at school just hashtag just teen things and then hashtag

2136
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:08,960
Yeah

2137
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:13,760
I have now done my market research. I shall now make the hip trendy

2138
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:16,240
Uh character design

2139
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:19,760
Hey, by the way

2140
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:23,440
Since we're on this whole retarded shit that everyone hates uh divu

2141
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:28,640
I actually really like your illustrations. Like I really like i'm glad. Uh, yeah

2142
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,200
You you're I hope

2143
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:34,960
I can be like as I said in the art podcast

2144
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:36,800
I can be like zoom a terrible artist

2145
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:40,960
But with like an aesthetic sense that people then like and then make fan art of that's actually good

2146
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:45,280
Yeah, the best part in in like, you know, all the gg was up. Yes for it

2147
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:50,320
Do it now. I said old david gg videos. I'm getting so fucking mad at this game

2148
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:56,640
When did you will have some sort of argument where he impersonates another person and then you'll draw you'll draw a little guy

2149
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:58,560
I love it. I love it

2150
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:02,640
And I only ever do that when I'm like completely out of other things to use for illustrations

2151
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:05,760
Which I struggled with much more back in like 2015 and 16 now like

2152
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:11,680
That's that's why I get very triggered anytime I see a video where obviously the person or the team making the video

2153
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:13,680
Like didn't know what the show is like

2154
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,680
Really stupid the show, you know

2155
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:17,680
Oh, you mean like extra credits for a little duel of pun

2156
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:22,080
And uh, yeah, well, it gets so much worse than that like I mean, I would say, uh,

2157
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:26,240
Getting things there is much worse of puns, you know, but like there's this one like, uh

2158
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:30,240
Sort of like a buzzfeed type of channel, but not buzzfeed and like they would like

2159
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:36,160
Like because like Cole was watching like a video like speculating on like it was like a wreck it roll two theories video

2160
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:38,240
And I was just watching over

2161
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:40,640
Out yet. Yeah, it was like theory

2162
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:47,040
This channel what they do is when they don't know what to show for a couple of seconds

2163
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:52,960
They have like a series of like reaction clips of like people in their studio like doing a face

2164
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:58,320
Sort of frames similar to those like 22 questions black people have for asian people type videos

2165
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:02,160
But instead of them saying anything it's just been doing a shrug or doing a chuckle

2166
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:06,000
And it'll just cut to them like one of these like, you know, one of these prist up like

2167
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:12,000
You know dolled up like fucking tech company workers in front of a nice biffy little background

2168
02:23:12,320 --> 02:23:19,120
Making a face for five seconds as filler in between other visual imagery and I'm like kill this video. I wouldn't dead

2169
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:21,440
That's

2170
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:22,480
Weird

2171
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:23,440
Yeah

2172
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:25,040
Absolutely bizarre

2173
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:30,560
If I was if I hadn't if I was just a youtuber still and wasn't trying to do other mediums at this point

2174
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:34,960
I would probably have a series called your editing sucks episode one of one

2175
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:38,960
Fucking I hate everything. What other mediums are you doing?

2176
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:45,280
I'm just so confused. I'm still working on a video game still and I don't want to where's the video game

2177
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:51,840
I'm still fucking working on it. I guess talk about why it's taking a long time. You know, it's only like it's a video game

2178
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:53,920
It takes a long time. No

2179
02:23:54,320 --> 02:23:56,320
No video games are very stupid

2180
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:58,400
It's very

2181
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:03,200
Well, it's very you know, it doesn't have much uh interactivity. It's not got any action

2182
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,920
You just win you just

2183
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:12,240
You did not want to wait the one second of the fire. I didn't I don't give a shit

2184
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:15,200
um

2185
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:22,240
Well, so I guess okay, basically to talk about stuff. Yeah, is anyone at all still interested in the whole fucking uh

2186
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:26,560
What happened after digi thing? Oh, yeah, sir. Sure. Yeah

2187
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:29,680
So basically the idea was we need to go somewhere else now

2188
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:34,400
The idea was let's get to atlanta, right now. I still had a decent amount of you know

2189
02:24:34,400 --> 02:24:37,600
I had like, you know a couple hundred dollars in savings. I can use to get somewhere, right

2190
02:24:38,480 --> 02:24:41,840
Sometimes I can't believe how little money people

2191
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:47,200
Yeah, yeah, well, so like if I hadn't had a girlfriend at this point

2192
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:52,000
I'd been single still I'd have gone to atlanta like I'd have like gotten an apartment in atlanta

2193
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:58,000
And that's what would have happened then right? So that would have been a very fucking different story, obviously

2194
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:02,240
Oh, but wait, wait, just ask her is to come back to later. I'm gonna let you finish

2195
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:07,040
Uh, uh, let's come back to how do you feel about PCPHB being in boss?

2196
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:14,320
Sounds good. It does sound good. And so whether or not I'm even gonna be in the PCPHB at all like

2197
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:16,720
I don't know

2198
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:20,480
Well, I still need to keep answering this question, right? So

2199
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,880
Uh, so the since because I had a girlfriend instead the plan is let's move in with her, right?

2200
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:27,360
Which means since we're gonna be you know, I mean

2201
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Don't do it

2202
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Just don't do it

2203
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:38,480
Bad idea. You're too late too late, dude. Well, I'm doing right now those fucking cynical guys who says oh

2204
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,680
What David didn't hear any of that are you gonna be one of those guys now who's like, oh

2205
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:49,680
Bad, don't you with women? You mean a mig towel? Do you mean a mig towel?

2206
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:52,480
Yeah, no

2207
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:54,480
No, no

2208
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,280
Need to wipe off your shit Lord sweat with a mig towel

2209
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:04,880
I'm just I was just I was just thinking about I was just thinking about the dissolution of digi house and the

2210
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:08,640
Circumstances surrounding me moving in with what's her name?

2211
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:14,240
Uh, yeah, and how much of a terrible terrible mistake it was. I think that makes it worse

2212
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:16,320
I think what's the name what's her name makes it worse?

2213
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:20,480
Yeah, that's kind of um, that's kind of a literally who ish

2214
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:23,520
Yeah, okay. Well

2215
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Yeah, so like

2216
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:27,920
I'm only speaking

2217
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:30,960
This is where I get to the part where I don't want people I don't want people giving me fucking advice

2218
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:34,320
I want people giving me your sympathies, right? I'm an adult

2219
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,560
Very broadly speaking

2220
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:39,520
Cole has severe depression and anxiety, right?

2221
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:45,280
So who gives you advice on the fact of whether or not she has depression?

2222
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:50,320
She's I don't like when people are like, oh, hey, here's a like look up this article to help you or you know

2223
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:53,360
Yeah, you know

2224
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:58,960
I'm sure you're on top. I'm sure I'm sure you you've got a handle on it. Oh, yeah. So

2225
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:03,920
So again, so she's fucking miserable in her house with her family, right?

2226
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,160
So she wants to move out asap, right?

2227
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:11,360
And so I'm planning on getting my own place or something. So the thought is well, what we should do then is uh

2228
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:15,840
Focus on cheapness. Oh, you know, if we're gonna have a place for two people

2229
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:18,240
We need to have like, you know, live in a cheaper area, right?

2230
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:20,560
So I thought well instead of living in Atlanta, right?

2231
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:25,040
I can just move back to Missouri where my family is and I can have my parents be sort of my safety net

2232
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:29,760
They can like guide me through the very scary process of figuring out how to get a fucking apartment, right?

2233
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:32,640
um

2234
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:34,880
And also like, you know, be a fucking

2235
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:38,880
If I can safety net in case I run out of money or some shit, I could raid their fridge, right?

2236
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:40,560
That might help

2237
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:46,160
So the idea is we'll go back to Missouri. So she leaves Oregon. She leaves her house in Oregon and I I leave Virginia

2238
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:49,120
I leave both of Missouri. So the so the idea is

2239
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:50,720
uh

2240
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:52,560
like

2241
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:54,320
We get a place there, right?

2242
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:59,360
So I'm living with my family for a little bit and the idea is well, I'm just living with my family

2243
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:01,840
Rent free for now just staying in a tiny room

2244
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:06,320
A room it's not the same room that I wasn't before it's the small room that used to be my sisters

2245
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:10,720
And my sister's now living up in the room where I live in so like I'm not having any expenses right now

2246
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:15,120
My parents just covering it, right? They're just glad to have me back. So like they're okay. Just like getting me through shit

2247
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:19,040
Something okay, cool. So it'll be just me with my family for a couple of months

2248
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:21,120
I can save up and get an apartment this way

2249
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:26,880
But here's what happened the same time I moved to Missouri at the same time digi starts traveling the fucking world

2250
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:29,360
country western coast

2251
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:33,360
And he doesn't give me any fucking videos, right? He doesn't give me any work through this whole time

2252
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:35,680
He probably would have jammed out something if I needed the money

2253
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:38,800
But the fact that he knew I didn't need the money means he didn't give me fucking videos

2254
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:43,280
So he gave me very few videos. So I remained just above water

2255
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:45,840
Uh with my fucking money, right?

2256
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:47,360
I didn't make any money now

2257
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:52,080
I wasn't complaining because this is when I got a lot of work done on like my video game projects and other projects

2258
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:55,040
And read all the home stuff. So I just had a good time

2259
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:58,240
Yeah, like there's no way I would have gotten through rack six without that

2260
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:03,120
Without having just 15 straight days to do it, right? It would have taken forever otherwise

2261
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:05,920
I mean, I would have gotten through it. I just wouldn't have been able to do it all at once

2262
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:10,400
So I wasn't complaining but financially it was a bit of a tough thing because she eventually moves in because she's like

2263
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:12,640
She's desperate to get out fucking desperate to move out

2264
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:18,320
And this is when I start to learn that people's depression can't be fixed by me just showing up, right?

2265
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:20,480
It already happened with digi

2266
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:22,640
When I showed that I had

2267
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:28,000
Me and my infinite fucking hubris my stanley hubris thought that digi was gonna be like great and have

2268
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:33,680
Goal under the press because I am there and I don't fucking such a charismatic likable person

2269
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:35,680
I guess people actually right?

2270
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:37,920
I get I get what you're talking about

2271
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:40,880
And yet I still didn't learn my fucking lesson my thought is oh, yeah

2272
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:46,880
Coldest person with like serious crippling has been to a vandal fucking hospital over superior depression anxiety

2273
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:50,800
She's gonna be just fucking fine when she moves in, right?

2274
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,000
Yeah

2275
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:58,320
No, no, so like the reason why I wasn't getting a lot of work done in virginia because it's because I was just talking

2276
02:29:58,320 --> 02:30:01,040
With her a lot and she was like, you know very emotionally dependent and like

2277
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:04,960
Not able to like schedule things. I can't do something like you know me

2278
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:08,080
I'm very like I want to always have a schedule even though. I'm not that good at doing it

2279
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:13,760
But basically is I want my life to run very for stanley, but I'm very easily distracted, right?

2280
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:17,680
So like I would say stuff like oh, hey, let's just talk over this over skype for two hours

2281
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:19,040
And then we'll be done for the day

2282
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:23,600
But having a timer overhead gives her more anxiety, you know, it's like oh, I don't want to like have a

2283
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:25,840
Blooming clock, right?

2284
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:29,760
So because she's like tough to like help out emotionally

2285
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:32,400
And I'm so easily distracted

2286
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:35,120
Sounds like a fucking drag

2287
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:39,040
Yes, it's pretty fucking bad. You know, it's not easy

2288
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:45,200
Right and if she wasn't a person who I thought like kick ass I would have left her within like two weeks

2289
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:48,240
I would stop talking with her, right? But I guess, you know, I guess

2290
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:52,880
The thing is, you know with okay to make a comparison to what's her name

2291
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:57,760
You've told me that basically you were just like on a moment-to-moment basis talking with her, right?

2292
02:30:58,320 --> 02:31:00,880
Uh wait on a moment-to-moment basis talking with her

2293
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:03,600
Being with her was miserable, right?

2294
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:07,920
Uh for a large for large part for large large swaths of it. Yeah

2295
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:12,000
For me it's like actually being with Cole is never bad

2296
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:15,600
Always good. I mean look where you got, right? What a what a concept

2297
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:20,480
Just the default status quo us being together is good

2298
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:25,760
It's just that in the broader context of my life where I have a job and other things I want to

2299
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:29,920
So it's a drag on other things, but it is in itself good. You see

2300
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:32,640
Yeah, sounds sounds nice

2301
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:39,680
With nearly as well, right never even remotely have I been as comfortable with someone as her

2302
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:46,160
So ultimately I found it worth it. But the point is so she's still being really emotionally dependent and I'm still like kind of

2303
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,240
I don't know what to do with myself, right?

2304
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:50,640
And I've had to learn much greater patience than I ever have

2305
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:52,480
convenience, right?

2306
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:55,360
And ultimately what makes this kind of cool

2307
02:31:55,840 --> 02:32:00,160
Is that you know, we both as you people who remember the pct episode about fetishes remembers

2308
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:02,800
We sort of met up over a fetish that kind of is a

2309
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:06,960
That's sort of themed after the idea of being someone's parents

2310
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:10,160
Even though they're a fucking adult and you're the same age as them, right?

2311
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:17,520
So it's sort of like the reason she's into the fetish is partly because of this sort sort of like psychosexual emotional dependency, right?

2312
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,280
Psycho

2313
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:21,280
Whoa

2314
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
I mean, yeah

2315
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:27,520
It makes sense to me

2316
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:30,720
Yeah, so ultimately it does sort of play into

2317
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:34,640
Yeah, you know, like even though it's fucked up. I feel like

2318
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:37,280
We're kind of made for each other, you know

2319
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:39,520
Yeah fair enough

2320
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:41,520
Learn how to deal with

2321
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:47,920
Being a productive worker whilst also having real life issues. I never really had, you know, fucking problems before

2322
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:49,920
Before that

2323
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:52,560
But you know, that wasn't difficult to fix

2324
02:32:53,920 --> 02:33:00,080
Um, I hate the problem is that she was still like I still wasn't I still haven't started my lesson though

2325
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:04,080
That people aren't gonna are still gonna be lonely even if I'm there, right?

2326
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:08,160
Like yeah, Ben. I knew Ben was lonely in in virginia. I knew did you was only in virginia?

2327
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:10,400
But I'm like, well, I'm not lonely. I have did you in bed, right?

2328
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:17,680
You know, well, I mean, I wasn't I wasn't lonely like I mean, I let I really did like living with you guys

2329
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:23,120
Right, you know, I just too, you know, I just I just didn't get laid for a long time and it made me really angry

2330
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:28,800
Yeah, like like people need more than more than like two people in their lives. It's just for me having been home school

2331
02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:34,800
Very just very like isolated like I'm just mentally adjusted to living in like an almost absolute bubble

2332
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:41,680
Right, but then like almost like memory levels and then it's seen it seemed great getting out of there and moving in with so and so

2333
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:47,040
Um, only to find out that I was basically trading only two people for like one

2334
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:49,520
And like nothing outside of that

2335
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:55,200
And what happened with Cole was that like, okay cool. Now she can live with me great. She I'm her favorite person

2336
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:58,640
But I'm not her only person now. She doesn't have access to her family anymore

2337
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:01,120
It doesn't have access to her mom who she loves and her friends, right?

2338
02:34:01,360 --> 02:34:06,000
Yeah, and basically the whole relationship with me basically like isolated her from her friends, right?

2339
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:11,680
Because I'm a crazy weirdo all of all of her friends were like, why the fuck are you with this guy, right?

2340
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:14,720
Like, you know, I'm literally you're you're you're unlikable

2341
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:17,440
What did you say your relationship isolated her from her friends?

2342
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:22,160
Yeah, because she so she became so dependent on me that she didn't hang out with her friends as much and they

2343
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:24,480
Popped her right and that's pretty that's pretty bad

2344
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:29,840
And all of her friends are and here's the more fundamental problem her friends are like post high school friends

2345
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:35,440
You know, like people get met in high school and stay in touch with but that's do you know, like 99 times out of 100

2346
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:39,760
You're gonna drift off because you only were friends because you were in the exact same situation

2347
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:42,000
But once you become adults, that's no longer the case, right? Sure

2348
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:49,600
The the the internet has really spoiled me with like friendships because why would like like it was hard for me to become friends

2349
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:50,800
with people in school

2350
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:52,400
Yeah, because it was just like well

2351
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:57,600
The only reason that I am talking to you is because we are in this school and we are together

2352
02:35:00,240 --> 02:35:03,760
Same thing happened with digi actually like when I first like when I got into digi

2353
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,040
Oh my team he was always talking about how his friends would always be around

2354
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:11,520
Right like digi apparently digi's house pre us moving in

2355
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:18,240
Was like all about fucking. Um, how do you how do you activate your secondary weapon? Can you your right right click, right?

2356
02:35:19,360 --> 02:35:22,560
Well, no, no, you're you're setting your weapon. You have to press spacebar to make your primary. Oh, yeah

2357
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:25,200
You gotta switch unless your steroids. You gotta switch weapons

2358
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:27,840
Gotcha, so, um

2359
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:30,880
Um, did you was always talking about how he has like this group of like nine or ten friends?

2360
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:32,480
They're always at his

2361
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:35,520
His house is like this bustling fucking. It's almost like a door, right?

2362
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:39,760
Yeah, that's how apparently his house was for 2013 and 14 and he said like yeah, man

2363
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:44,560
Like you know other people make oh apparently actually Nate made fun of digi for still being friends with his high school friends, right?

2364
02:35:45,440 --> 02:35:47,440
Um

2365
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:53,120
Friends I can oh, you know, Nate Nate, you know, he's Nate boobity boobity. Nate's an asshole boobity boob

2366
02:35:55,440 --> 02:36:01,360
Anyway, so like digi had like put in my mind this idea of his house being like a fucking college form or some shit

2367
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:05,440
But it's pretty conveniently over the course of 2015 and 16

2368
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:12,560
All those people started tapering away as digi became a guy with like a very specific lifestyle that none of them were similar to you know

2369
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:17,760
They were all like guys with like, you know, some artistic ambitions we be nerdy interests

2370
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,880
But eventually they all had to like either get jobs or yeah

2371
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:24,720
They sort of like got normal jobs and just played fucking street fighter all day

2372
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:31,120
Digi was the only one who sort of ascended the the christ consciousness plane to become an internet being right?

2373
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:38,640
Yeah, and disconnected with them as such and like literally right as soon as we moved in those people like officially stopped showing up

2374
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:45,200
Right, like yeah, like they did one of the people the three people I wanted to meet the most in the digi extended universe with digi's dad

2375
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:47,600
Uh, brin, brin and tolentino

2376
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:50,720
I mean, I did I did meet all those people

2377
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:54,480
You never met donks on did you wait? No, maybe

2378
02:36:55,680 --> 02:37:00,240
Yeah, I might have met him like once very briefly, but maybe not. Yeah, I met I don't think so

2379
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:03,120
I don't I don't so like digi's dad was around digi's dad was cool

2380
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:07,520
brin and tolentino like digi sort of like brin and tolentino was like pretty cool

2381
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:15,200
I just like him in podcasts, right? Yeah, but donks on like but never show up the entire time that we were there

2382
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:21,840
I believe digi has not once seen donks on since us moving in so it's been years now, right? I'm gonna be wrong, but

2383
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:27,760
Which is a shame because digi always built him up as being like this cool person, you know with infinite knowledge and stuff

2384
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:32,800
So, yeah, um

2385
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:36,720
Uh, I I I

2386
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:39,520
The funny story about brin and tolentino and josh specifically

2387
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:44,240
I I love brin and tolentino and josh and I actually got to meet them at rad con too

2388
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:45,600
Before the thing actually started

2389
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:47,760
I was the first person to show up and they were just at his house

2390
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:50,560
I think like took a victor or something or to do something

2391
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:56,800
Anyway, I met them and like I was like, oh man, josh brin and tolentino

2392
02:37:57,040 --> 02:37:59,040
They're like, um

2393
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:02,640
I'm like, oh wait. These are just normal people

2394
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:08,400
It's really weird if I were to come up to them and like say that I know stuff about them. Yeah

2395
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:10,160
That would be bizarre

2396
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:15,360
Yeah, and and and the one part was before I consciously realized that I made a oh

2397
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:19,040
This is so retired and like obviously stupid in retrospect right in the end at the time

2398
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:23,200
I made a reference to what they had said in an episode

2399
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:28,080
And yeah, I know I know I know and I and I laughed and they're like

2400
02:38:28,480 --> 02:38:29,440
What?

2401
02:38:29,440 --> 02:38:31,440
Who are you?

2402
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:33,680
No one don't worry about me

2403
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:36,400
Nothing to see here folks. Yeah

2404
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:41,520
Amazing. Uh, that's um, remember when you came to Atlanta

2405
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:46,240
And we went to that shitty halloween party and I introduced you to people as munchie

2406
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:52,480
Yeah, I did not even consider that that would not be what you that that was not what you were expecting me to do

2407
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:58,720
Well, yeah, I like you do that like two people and then like you did it over and I'm like, it's Anthony

2408
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:06,640
I was I was honestly shocked because I was like, I only call you munchie. So like why wouldn't I introduce you as

2409
02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:11,840
It wasn't for the fact that Cole, you know just started calling anybody my real name because you wanted to do that

2410
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,640
But I would have lost my identity entirely man

2411
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:20,000
Yeah, a little bit same though though. I talk to my family pretty regularly who obviously don't call me much

2412
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:22,160
Yeah

2413
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:28,480
But yeah, yeah, but but but the geofront has helped my real name thrive again in in memory. Yeah

2414
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:33,120
Oh, yeah, so like so because Cole was still kind of miserable. We spent a lot of money like

2415
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:36,560
Room upstairs. We reclaimed the room upstairs and finally remade it

2416
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:43,120
You reclaimed it in a battle of wits with your parents. No, just my sister was okay with moving back downstairs

2417
02:39:43,440 --> 02:39:47,600
Um, mother fucker fuck right like Cole was still really miserable

2418
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:50,400
She didn't have access to her like her you know her life back in Oregon

2419
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:54,320
So she eventually just kind of cracked like she was just like I can't deal with this anymore

2420
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:58,480
So she had to like sort of emergency move back to Oregon because she was like

2421
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:05,040
If you know what the reason is because her mom her mom is like a nurse like an experience like high level nurse

2422
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:10,240
Right like nurses. I didn't know us nurses aren't just people who like like, you know, like wipe your face and your ass

2423
02:40:10,320 --> 02:40:12,960
There are also people who like do shit in the hospital and like know everything

2424
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:17,360
Mom's nurse her mom's really good if you have like medical issues, you know

2425
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:22,080
She's an invite level nurse who's invited to e-sports tournaments across the nation. She's invite love

2426
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:24,800
She's a leading the level nurse you see in the last dungeon

2427
02:40:25,280 --> 02:40:29,440
Um, and also because it's Oregon she has better healthcare set up there and like, you know

2428
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:32,320
She can get her like pharmaceuticals refills like overall

2429
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:38,000
It was just she needs to go back there now, right? So she moved back there and the idea was okay cool

2430
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:42,800
So then I'll stay here in Missouri for a few more months and make a bunch of videos and save a month

2431
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:46,000
Right same fucking thing happened this last time

2432
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,600
But in a new unique way this time instead of digi not sending me any videos

2433
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:53,120
Digi sent me the video calls. We have accepted me to gokarty

2434
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:58,160
Which was a video that was so big and so long. It took me literally the whole

2435
02:40:58,400 --> 02:41:01,200
No, I had to myself to make that one video

2436
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:06,160
The idea was I was gonna make tons of fucking videos in that time and make a bunch of money

2437
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:09,920
But because I was given literally the biggest video of all time

2438
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:13,120
It took me like two whole months just to do it and that was it

2439
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:16,640
Good thing did you paid me did he paid me like a whole lot of money for it?

2440
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:20,560
But so so we just the reason why we got another house

2441
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:26,160
We got an apartment with shit internet is because we had no other choice because even though coal has her Oregon life back

2442
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:29,360
She no longer has me and she's desperate without me, right?

2443
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:35,680
Um, because I'm like the only person in the world who almost has enough patience for her, right? Like I'm like

2444
02:41:36,480 --> 02:41:39,360
I'm not gonna give myself that much credit sometimes. I'm like, what the fuck

2445
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:46,800
Be a normal person don't have a mental disability. Come the fuck on, right? Yeah, very good. Good. I mean it makes sense

2446
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:52,240
I'm not gonna fucking I ain't gonna like hit myself as a white knight without some black streaks

2447
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:56,720
Wait, oh, well, you don't you're a zebra knight. You're a zebra

2448
02:41:57,920 --> 02:41:59,920
Yeah

2449
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:01,360
um

2450
02:42:01,360 --> 02:42:02,880
so

2451
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:05,760
I guess a zebra knight is the kind of person who comes in and goes

2452
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:10,160
You know, this guy's being really racist against me. I'm a black person and a zebra knight comes in and goes

2453
02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:12,160
This tune's got a point

2454
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Oh, no

2455
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:22,400
So we basically just have to get an apartment here as soon as possible because unlike my family's house

2456
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:25,360
Which is huge and there's plenty of room for some of the extra adults

2457
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:26,640
um

2458
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:32,640
My my girlfriend and my wife's fucking her family's house is like small so like we have to get our own place, right?

2459
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:39,440
So we be like it was a miracle. We got this place that we did and now we have a one-year lease on it. So, yeah

2460
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:43,920
Yeah, no, no, no. Oh god

2461
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:48,400
All that all that in mind with all that like regarded like I think things are going

2462
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:52,640
Good things are going better now. Like, you know, her fucking meds are doing her much better now

2463
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:58,800
And we're just slowly building her up, you know, and it's like fuck man. I never felt like I was how to help

2464
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:02,240
Like helped real people, you know

2465
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:04,880
Like I helped her a little bit

2466
02:43:04,880 --> 02:43:10,720
I like actually like need to be alive for reasons other than making art and I feel like it's made me a more well-rounded person, you know

2467
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:14,160
Um, yeah

2468
02:43:14,960 --> 02:43:21,200
I I think I I think I don't know. Okay. This will sound super asshole. We probably

2469
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:24,640
But I think I think I think I've come this is not related to you

2470
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:27,120
simply at all, uh

2471
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:29,120
Yeah, uh, this

2472
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:34,560
I have realized why a lot of guys will be like, you know, having a girlfriend like changed me and made me more empathetic

2473
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:37,360
Is that maybe they've just been friends

2474
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,160
like guys who just like

2475
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:47,840
Are assholes and like they've never had to like maintain a human relationship with people who like, you know

2476
02:43:48,560 --> 02:43:51,680
Like they care about in the sense that they don't want to make upset

2477
02:43:52,000 --> 02:44:00,240
Like they've never had like the personal responsibility of having a girlfriend in order to like, you know, not to have their life fall apart

2478
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:03,200
I guess maybe that's what people have

2479
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:05,760
Oh, yeah, last bit of update to say is that

2480
02:44:06,480 --> 02:44:12,400
I think I've said this before but specifically I'm living in Oregon. Yeah. Nice. Cool. But it's east, Oregon

2481
02:44:12,480 --> 02:44:15,600
It's it's so east, Oregon that it's basically

2482
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:21,520
Idaho like on the border of Idaho and like 50 percent of all the license plates are going to be Idaho

2483
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:26,160
It's so fucking east that there aren't any dispensaries here

2484
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:32,560
Well, like they're on the wild west, dude. There's a wild east. Yeah, actually. No, this is a part of uh

2485
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:37,280
This region I'm in is honestly like more in the middle of nowhere than I was in Missouri

2486
02:44:38,320 --> 02:44:40,320
You're in the erratic east, dude

2487
02:44:40,800 --> 02:44:43,920
The erratic east. Yeah. Well, I'm I'm on the east of the west, you know

2488
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:50,960
But yes, like this is a part of Oregon that's so like rural that basically it's nothing like what Oregon we think of Oregon, right?

2489
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:56,240
Like they don't like the fucking weed there. They have a lot of problem with it. They don't allow dispensaries here, you know, so

2490
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:04,240
Yeah, uh, that's why I've only spoken once right so far. Uh, I don't even like weed. You're not missing out

2491
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:09,840
Well, I want to try at least a few different cuts. I didn't okay. The weed I tried was fun

2492
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:14,720
But I don't need it like like like it was it was from Cole's older sister who's like even more

2493
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:18,960
Guys like a lot of pain and like me sleep. So like it was very sneaky, right?

2494
02:45:19,360 --> 02:45:24,320
So it was really fun. It felt like, you know, traveling through time. It felt like like you come one time

2495
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:28,080
Oh, you know, just traveling three times. All right. It was cool

2496
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:33,840
It was interesting because like, you know, alcohol I feel changes my personality for his weed at least that particular strain

2497
02:45:34,320 --> 02:45:37,920
I feel like I was the same person that when you get drunk. It's a it's it's

2498
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:41,120
It's an experience

2499
02:45:41,280 --> 02:45:43,280
Every I don't I don't understand

2500
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:48,400
Davoo being drunk is like not different from just the cartoon interpretation of someone doing drugs

2501
02:45:48,400 --> 02:45:52,320
So I was not caught guard. Well, exactly. It's exactly that's exactly it

2502
02:45:53,440 --> 02:45:54,880
well

2503
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:58,320
Davoo was like one of the first people I've ever seen drunk in my life

2504
02:45:58,640 --> 02:46:03,200
Like well like like in person. I mean, so it wasn't like that weird. I just assumed. Oh, yeah

2505
02:46:03,360 --> 02:46:08,720
When you're drunk, you just act like you don't have any bodily function. Well, let's be careful that

2506
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:15,200
Uh, fucking mad bowl 34 was like hyping us all including me way the fuck more than the variation would by the fall

2507
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:17,760
Okay

2508
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:21,120
I'll I'll have to say I I had no problem with drunk blue. I had

2509
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:23,920
Not

2510
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:29,200
My way to try and not be a problem then it seems to work

2511
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:31,200
But I remember like on like a

2512
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:34,640
New year's only uh when 2016 turned over to 17

2513
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:38,400
I was being very careful to like restrain myself as much as I could because he was like, hey

2514
02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:41,280
You're not like fucking ruining everyone's lives, right?

2515
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:47,840
Oh, no, we didn't say that. He said no, we're being fine. That's what he said. Okay. That's just my interpretation of life

2516
02:46:49,360 --> 02:46:52,560
Uh, I said some jokes and they were good, but you know

2517
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:58,720
I mean I tried listening to like some of the alcohol pct cast the bonus episode

2518
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:02,080
Because I remember everyone like praising me and about being funny on it

2519
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:06,080
But like it was of course funny to all of them because they were also drunk and listening back to it

2520
02:47:06,880 --> 02:47:11,440
But you know like like you judge drunk standards based on whether or not the other people who are with you

2521
02:47:11,440 --> 02:47:14,480
Like you not based on whether you sound good on the recording afterwards, right?

2522
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:19,760
Anyway, so weed a sleepy weed. I had I was like I tried watching some anime

2523
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:23,520
I watched like weeks ago moe on it while being a mistake under any circumstance

2524
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:27,600
Oh, dude, it was amazing because it was like it had twice as much colors as usual

2525
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:34,960
It was like colors are all twice as intense and also it felt like it was 3d. It felt like it was 3d. I don't know how that works, right?

2526
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:39,200
Um, it felt like the world was 3d. However, that whatever sense that makes

2527
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:43,200
But I was like everything that has plots is too intense for me. I can't focus

2528
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:47,440
I need something like I need something with bright and poppy, but I need something very simple and easy

2529
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:51,040
So I watched a I watched a long play of we golf

2530
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:53,760
I watched a long play of we golf

2531
02:47:54,160 --> 02:47:58,400
I want to guys. I want to fucking scream. I want to fucking scream. I'm so angry at this game

2532
02:47:58,400 --> 02:48:01,520
Just get better. Just get better. I mean, this is the way I always played

2533
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:06,400
Back today just run in and don't even think about but it's worse because of the lag

2534
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:09,120
Like we've been to the sewers like what 50 times like

2535
02:48:10,160 --> 02:48:13,360
It's fucking garbage. This is fucking garbage. Why why?

2536
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
I am so mad. I'm

2537
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:21,040
It's it's the delay and the fact that no one's coordinated and that we're trying to do a show on top of it. Yeah

2538
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:23,760
Yeah, nice

2539
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:28,560
Yeah, so I don't think I would do that kind of weed again unless I was like going to take like a week off or something because like

2540
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:29,840
It like spoke with my brain

2541
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:34,160
I didn't I feel like I was still picking my brain up off the floor two days later and it's just it just disorganized me

2542
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:40,240
But I do want to try the fucking kind of weed that makes you more creative and stuff. No, that's fake. That's not real

2543
02:48:40,960 --> 02:48:46,960
I you know what seeing did you do it? I am no don't fucking listen to digi. Okay. Like just don't listen to it

2544
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:50,560
That's what he's saying. That's what he's saying. Yeah, I I I do think that like

2545
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:54,240
Digi might give weed a little bit too much credit. No fucking kidding

2546
02:48:56,480 --> 02:48:59,040
Because like, you know, like

2547
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:05,760
I just think that digi probably he's been talking about how he's been like working constantly

2548
02:49:06,160 --> 02:49:10,960
He's gone weed like he was just all day working on everything. It's like the speed at which he gets things out

2549
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:13,280
I'm not sure if I'm convinced

2550
02:49:13,280 --> 02:49:17,760
I think what it is is he feels like he's working constantly because weed fucks with your perception of time

2551
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:23,600
Yeah, right, right and it makes you like it makes you think that everything is happening super fast when it's fucking isn't

2552
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:28,080
Now, of course, but he says to people who make that criticism is oh, well, I'm working on all this shit in background

2553
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:34,720
You don't see well, I'm pretty other than they I'm the closest to being on the inside looking out with digi's productions

2554
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:36,720
and

2555
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:42,240
You don't you don't see it. You just you just don't see like I was okay. I'm fine. You only like like specific docs

2556
02:49:42,320 --> 02:49:44,960
I'll fucking make they're not really docs just insider fucking

2557
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:47,920
Uh smuggling of information

2558
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:49,440
Is uh

2559
02:49:49,440 --> 02:49:55,280
I was asking digi. Can you please give me a list of like things of shows that would become topics of how they market the episodes

2560
02:49:55,280 --> 02:49:58,400
Like what what is a list of how they market the episodes that you're planning on doing right?

2561
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:02,400
And it took him like three weeks to get me the list and he's like, yeah

2562
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:05,200
I've been putting it off because I don't know which notebook I wrote it in

2563
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:09,600
Uh digi

2564
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:13,920
Fuck you god you right now like like modern digi. Go watch who's listening to this

2565
02:50:14,320 --> 02:50:19,280
Can I stay at your house for like a week? I just want to stay at your house. I just want to see what it's like

2566
02:50:19,360 --> 02:50:21,360
I just want to I just want to say

2567
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:23,360
You don't you don't have to talk to me. Don't worry

2568
02:50:24,480 --> 02:50:25,520
Yeah

2569
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:29,680
I just I just want to be around and then see other I want I want I want to see how the magic's made

2570
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,640
I want to see how he worked it did

2571
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:38,960
And I do want to say like did you definitely get some things about anime straight up wrong because he's hot, right?

2572
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:41,040
Like in the totoro cast

2573
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:44,640
Digi was describing a scene. He's like, yeah, you know the little girl

2574
02:50:45,280 --> 02:50:46,480
May is like

2575
02:50:46,480 --> 02:50:51,520
May's walking over here and she sees a bunch of like creatures pop out and I'm like digi. I'm looking I'm on vlc

2576
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:56,160
I'm looking at the scene right now. There's no creatures. He's like, oh, I guess it was the acid, right?

2577
02:50:56,960 --> 02:50:58,240
um

2578
02:50:58,240 --> 02:51:02,560
Now I know granted digi always gets some things wrong about about stuff that he's talking about like this

2579
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:06,080
Commenters who always like point out things to get wrong like they don't understand

2580
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:08,720
They didn't have to make a video right like making videos is hard

2581
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:11,680
It's hard to like like backcheck everything you do, right?

2582
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:13,680
um

2583
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:16,400
This is the most he's ever been talked about this entire show, but

2584
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:21,600
Will you bring me on, you know, so yeah, like why don't you talk about yourself?

2585
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:24,320
Like

2586
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:26,400
Has my internet died again?

2587
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:28,400
No, you're fine

2588
02:51:28,880 --> 02:51:35,360
I think yeah, why are we talking about digi who cares? Oh, am I be like have we have we lagged up completely are we dead? Yes

2589
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:42,080
Yes, I I can hear you. Oh, oh the game. You sure the game. Oh, jeez the game has come to us trying to come back

2590
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:49,840

2591
02:51:52,720 --> 02:51:57,280
Oh, there we go. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait taboo

2592
02:51:59,280 --> 02:52:02,400

2593
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:04,400
I'm still working

2594
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:07,200
Yeah, it's pretty laggy, but it seems to be working somewhat

2595
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:17,280
All right, are you in the game right now taboo? Are you in the game? Uh, why is my internet failing again? This is my

2596
02:52:21,680 --> 02:52:27,200
Ben you can hear me, right? Uh-huh. Yeah, I can hear you. Okay. Okay. Oh, okay. All right. All right. This is want to make sure it's not me

2597

Okay, well then you just want to do like a round where like we try hard and it's just you and me so our internet doesn't suck

2598
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:38,320
Yeah, I mean can taboo like stay on the call

2599
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:40,960
Of course. Yeah. Yeah

2600
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:44,800
All right, let's actually just play the game and I'll try and I'll I'll sweat really hard

2601
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:47,920
Okay. Yeah, I'm getting very frustrated

2602
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,520
Well

2603
02:52:52,480 --> 02:52:57,520
Well, I we even heard we never heard much of your side of the situation though, I

2604
02:52:58,240 --> 02:53:00,240
Oh, oh, do who says that's the end of that

2605
02:53:00,720 --> 02:53:02,240
um

2606
02:53:02,240 --> 02:53:05,600
You mean about the digi thing like digi house. Yes

2607
02:53:06,400 --> 02:53:11,360
Oh god. Well, I mean, yeah, I was gonna I was gonna springboard off of what taboo was saying

2608
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:13,120
um

2609
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:19,120
Did you call he says I see you so goodbye. No, that's why I'm trying to get the fuck back here you idiot

2610
02:53:19,440 --> 02:53:22,480
I'm mad. I'm mad that he would just leave

02:53:23,360 --> 02:53:26,320
What but he his internet just was destroyed

2612
02:53:27,920 --> 02:53:30,800
What no, what does that mean? What does that mean it was destroyed?

2613
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:33,600
It doesn't work anymore. It crashed or something

2614
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:37,440
Fine great

2615
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:44,720
Just just just join just join send me a invite or something. I just did. I just did. Oh, I see it. I see it

2616
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:47,040
Oh

2617
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:51,120
By the way, you're gonna feel like you're playing like an f zero game right now

2618
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:56,160
You're gonna feel like you're playing the fastest game on fucking earth. Yeah after all that after that. Yeah. Yeah

02:53:56,800 --> 02:53:59,200
Uh, just play your main just play your main

I'm gonna be fish. Okay

2622
02:54:10,160 --> 02:54:12,160
Fun fact, uh

2623
02:54:13,040 --> 02:54:19,600
I'm gay me too. Uh, so this okay, so I don't know what was to do saying about the whole digi house breakup thing

2624
02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:20,800
Well, okay, okay

2625
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:25,840
Do we were talking about like the entire history of like what happened like his relationship and stuff like that the original

2626
02:54:25,840 --> 02:54:27,840
Well, what I was talking about was

2627
02:54:28,080 --> 02:54:30,720
All I want to know was like how how has it been?

2628
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:36,320
So did you house like like did you expect that you would wind up here? How like got that was that was the question

2629
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:41,680
Yeah, I was just like like like like like what's it like being like like did you house was like

2630
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:46,400
Because you there's you're like me and him are in like opposite situations. Yeah, that's yeah

2631
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:49,680
Ah balls um

2632
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:55,840
I mean, okay, well since all right, so I moved in I moved in with

2633
02:54:56,400 --> 02:55:00,080
Over the right. I'm fainted. I need to wait. Are you dead? Where the wait? Oh shit

2634
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:02,640
All right

2635
02:55:02,640 --> 02:55:06,400
Yeah, so I moved in with somebody and that was fine for a while

2636
02:55:06,960 --> 02:55:13,040
But I mean it just it's neat. It's just neatly half so happened that that whole thing fell apart. Um

2637
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:20,480
Like basically just pretty close to when like, you know did he was moving to boston and and like pcphq was

2638
02:55:21,360 --> 02:55:28,160
Seeming like it was coming. I mean I mean what we have now is not actually pcphq, but it is definitely like the beginnings of it

2639
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:31,040
Oh, well, yeah

2640
02:55:31,360 --> 02:55:37,280
I would say it's pcphq. I mean, I don't know. It's not pcphq until we start like doing something with it, right?

2641
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:42,480
Oh, well, okay. Sure. I guess also I just kill him and then and then

2642
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:49,680
Uh, Jesus christ. I walk right in. I'm sorry. I'm stuck with shit. Yeah, that's fine

2643
02:55:50,640 --> 02:55:55,520
I the guy's gonna hit you from up. I'm dead again. I'm up here. Oh my god. Why? Why are you so bad?

2644
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:58,800
I'm sorry for your start

2645
02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:00,960
uh

2646
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:07,920
Oh, yeah, nothing's been made yet, but like ever as the game crashed. No, it's it's lagging, but uh

2647
02:56:10,080 --> 02:56:12,080
There I think

2648
02:56:12,800 --> 02:56:19,520
Everyone's like in the place right now everyone. I consider pcphq to just be like like when the place has been erected

2649
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:24,800
And and everyone's in one place which is everyone's not in one place like three people are in one place

2650
02:56:26,320 --> 02:56:28,320
Well, yeah, but but I visit often so it

2651
02:56:28,640 --> 02:56:33,760
It's basically like like like sure. I guess and and who else is going to move here

2652
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:37,440
Nate Nate will move here. And then who else? I mean, there's I mean, look

2653
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:44,880
I mean, there's hippo. There's mage. Um, mage will not move mage will not move hippo hippo might at some point

2654
02:56:45,680 --> 02:56:50,880
Yeah, but he's on the other side of the country. So it's not like that's gonna be anytime soon. You mean he's on the other side of the world

2655
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:53,920
Well, yeah

2656
02:56:53,920 --> 02:56:57,360
Um, so so the only people I could see debu moving

2657
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:02,320
Well, he just said he's not going to because he's with his wife and why don't they both move

2658
02:57:03,280 --> 02:57:08,880
Well, we're not listening to the entire story because she no, I was not listening to most of that story to be perfectly honest

2659
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:10,320
Okay, cool

2660
02:57:10,320 --> 02:57:13,920
Um, yeah, he's not moving and then you know, just he's obviously not moving

2661
02:57:14,320 --> 02:57:17,440
So so the only two people who will feasibly be at that

2662
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:19,440
each ph here

2663
02:57:19,440 --> 02:57:24,880
Like in any sort of foreseeable future are me and Nate and I already go there. I mean so

2664
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:30,320
Okay, was was there was there some reason why debu and his wife can't just move?

2665
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:33,680
Yes, it's because she needs to be in argument is where her family are

2666
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:37,280
Why

2667
02:57:37,280 --> 02:57:40,800
Because she's depressed a lot, I guess and she needs them for support

2668
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,920
dumb

2669
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:48,720
Well, well, okay, but that's that those are the facts as I see them

2670
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:50,880
Uh, fine

2671
02:57:51,120 --> 02:57:54,400
Well, okay, I guess debu won't come and that's and that's

2672
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:57,600
Yes, that does so

2673
02:57:57,600 --> 02:57:59,040
um

2674
02:57:59,040 --> 02:58:01,040
I mean, okay, did you see here?

2675
02:58:01,520 --> 02:58:03,440
Neonates coming

2676
02:58:03,440 --> 02:58:05,440
mage is not coming

2677
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:08,240
Uh, whoa

2678
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:14,960
The only the only two people I think will come besides me are hippo and I think I think jesse debu and mage are

2679
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:17,760
We just need to count on I mean, why would jesse know?

2680
02:58:18,160 --> 02:58:21,760
Jesse has been talking about how much he hates living in his basement forever

2681
02:58:22,640 --> 02:58:24,240
and like

2682
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:26,240
He just won't but he won't stop

2683
02:58:27,920 --> 02:58:33,120
Well, I don't know he just won't reasons and and I'm sure and he's gonna move in with his girlfriend or whatever

2684
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:38,400
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what he's gonna do. I don't think he's he hasn't he hasn't said anything about moving to

2685
02:58:38,400 --> 02:58:41,040
Boston, so I just know he didn't like to believe he would yeah

2686
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:46,800
I mean, I I don't see him. I don't see him moving even if he could or felt that he could

2687
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:48,960
Yeah, I don't I don't see that

2688
02:58:49,360 --> 02:58:50,640
um

2689
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:52,240
So whatever

2690
02:58:52,240 --> 02:58:57,520
Yeah, okay. I mean, I guess pcphq is is is pretty cute up, you know, yeah

2691
02:58:58,160 --> 02:59:00,160
relatively speaking

2692
02:59:00,320 --> 02:59:02,320
Well, what are we talking about?

2693
02:59:04,240 --> 02:59:08,720
All we're talking about is is is is like like how it's been like

2694
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:15,120
With the fallout of digi house and do you feel like it's funny? Well, it's funny that it's funny that the fallout of digi house

2695
02:59:15,680 --> 02:59:23,920
Uh, the period between the fallout of digi house to um, you know, the the the the re the reformation

2696
02:59:24,480 --> 02:59:26,720
The boston reformation of pcphq

2697
02:59:28,400 --> 02:59:35,840
Not not but to to a certain extent pretty neatly coincided with the rise and fall of a whole sordid and

2698
02:59:36,560 --> 02:59:38,560
terrible chapter of my life

2699
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:40,560
um

2700
02:59:40,560 --> 02:59:46,640
And I mean, I don't know. There's no point. I'm not making any point with that. It's just an observation

2701
02:59:47,600 --> 02:59:49,600
Well, how about that?

2702
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:52,960
Uh, yeah

2703
02:59:53,440 --> 02:59:54,640
Jesus

2704
02:59:54,640 --> 02:59:58,640
Well, that that that sure that sure was a topic. Yeah

2705
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:03,280
I hope I hope you're all proud of me viewers

2706
03:00:04,480 --> 03:00:06,400
Uh, this is gonna be the run by the way

2707
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:08,960
What this is gonna be the run by the way

2708
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:11,520

Oh, wait, I should not have a fucking rocket launcher

2725
03:01:27,440 --> 03:01:29,440
I will take literally any any gun besides

2726

This is just like the first reverence cop killers us trying really hard and the show suffers because of it. Oh, yeah

2730
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:57,760
It's just absolute trash

2731
03:01:58,000 --> 03:01:59,600
Mm-hmm

2732
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:02,880
This is the top level play that they come for though. Which one which one do we want here?

2733
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:07,760
Up to you. I think laser brain or I mean, I could use laser brain

I keep seeing your minions and thinking that it's cops. No, there are no cops here. Don't worry

2738
03:02:36,720 --> 03:02:40,880
This is the lift there's a double flame shotgun up here, by the way, uh, do I want that?

2751
03:03:55,280 --> 03:03:57,280
Weird I don't know

2752
03:03:57,440 --> 03:04:00,480
Little hunter will be here soon. I don't know where he'll be. He's there

2753
03:04:05,360 --> 03:04:09,520
I hate little hunter so much. Oh, I'm down here. I'm down here. Are you dead?

2754
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:19,120
Oh god, he's so bad. He's so bad and scary. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh

You know what it's okay. We made it to little hunter. We're finally making progress

2757
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:30,240
Now that we've dumped the dead weight that is taboo

2758
03:04:32,160 --> 03:04:37,280
I'm feeling it. Oh, no, I did not want to be him. I did not want to be that guy. It's fine. It's fine. Uh,

2759
03:04:39,040 --> 03:04:41,040
Yeah, it's fine to worry

2760
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:46,960
Yeah, uh, wait was I fished before? Yes

2761
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:52,160
No, what were you saying?

2762
03:04:53,120 --> 03:04:58,400
I don't I don't even remember I was I was there was some point buddy, but I don't even care anymore. I'm just

2763
03:05:02,400 --> 03:05:04,400
I know I just want to win

2764
03:05:04,640 --> 03:05:08,560
That's all about cops. I'm glad that this game gives the opportunity to kill cops, you know

2765
03:05:08,880 --> 03:05:12,720
I'm gonna make us get a little quick. Hold on. What are you doing? Yeah

2766
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:18,960
Uh, my my guys drop radiation on kill. So we were just about to get a level but we didn't make it

2767
03:05:18,960 --> 03:05:21,600
So I just spawned a guy and I wasn't know what I got the actual level

2768
03:05:24,240 --> 03:05:27,360
The rebel you absolutely need strong spirit like there's no other way to play the game

2769
03:05:27,680 --> 03:05:31,360
Strong spirit is the uh, the one that like if you die, you don't die

2770
03:05:32,160 --> 03:05:34,160
Yeah

2771
03:05:36,720 --> 03:05:39,120
Oh my god, okay, it's happening

2772
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:51,840
Oh

2773
03:05:52,960 --> 03:05:54,960
There he is

2774
03:05:56,080 --> 03:05:58,080
Hey fun fact by the way, I actually

2775
03:05:58,320 --> 03:06:00,640
Like for the nuclear throne official trailer

2776
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:06,160
They ask the community to send in clips and my uh clip of rebel is actually in the final

2777
03:06:06,560 --> 03:06:11,200
Trailer like the game official game trailer. Wait, what do you mean your clip of rebel?

2778
03:06:12,320 --> 03:06:16,160
Like like like they they asked to send a gameplay clips to have like as you know

2779
03:06:16,800 --> 03:06:20,480
Show up the gameplay of nuclear throne in the trailer and I sent in stuff and they got

2780
03:06:22,160 --> 03:06:26,080
Yeah, it's actually under my real name, which is why I don't mention it more

2781
03:06:26,480 --> 03:06:28,480
But I don't care so uh me

2782
03:06:29,760 --> 03:06:31,920
Yeah, that's that's fucking neat as hell

2783
03:06:32,560 --> 03:06:39,280
Yeah, it's it's in the gameplay declared not the cinematic trailer. Uh, it's it's it's the one even press me in the end

2784
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:41,200
uh

2785
03:06:41,200 --> 03:06:46,960
It's it's the one where where rebel responds a bunch of big gannets and it shoots up the boy

2786
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
I'm quite proud of it

2787
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:54,560
Was it was it was it epic was it an epic gamer? Oh

2788
03:06:56,400 --> 03:06:59,040
Ben you know me I I do nothing that's not epic

2789
03:06:59,680 --> 03:07:04,400
That's true. Oh, Jesus christ. What do I I don't want any of these the one that gives more ammo

2790
03:07:06,320 --> 03:07:07,680
Yeah, okay

2791
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:09,680
That was not it, but all right

2792
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:15,840
No, the recycle gland only gives more ammo for bullet weapons. Oh, oh, that's

2793
03:07:19,280 --> 03:07:21,280
Oh, shit, I died

2794
03:07:22,240 --> 03:07:24,740
Don't worry. You're fine. You're fine. Be careful of that fire

2795
03:07:40,640 --> 03:07:42,640
Hey

2796
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:51,680
Wow, now now now they're finally playing the game

2797
03:07:51,680 --> 03:07:56,720
Well, like like like now that devoo's gone we can play the game now, but also we can't have a good show

2798
03:07:56,960 --> 03:07:59,040
So that's a really good payoff. It's it's ruined

2799
03:08:00,160 --> 03:08:03,840
Did the people care? I think I think people might like this. I think people might like a stride

2800
03:08:04,720 --> 03:08:06,720
Maybe a bit

2801
03:08:07,120 --> 03:08:11,360
But but that a little wear thing. Oh, shit. No, no, no, I'm down

2802
03:08:16,960 --> 03:08:18,960
Don't worry, we're fine. We're fine

2803
03:08:30,240 --> 03:08:33,280
I can never be like an esports commentator of any kind

2804
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:38,000
Also, I just I just ate shit. Oh shit. It's a fucking mimic. Oh, oh

2805
03:09:03,280 --> 03:09:05,280
Oh

2806
03:09:09,920 --> 03:09:13,200
All we need is blood lust and we're trying to get just get away from that

2807
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:18,960
Get away from from what the explosion that was just there

2808
03:09:22,640 --> 03:09:24,640
I haven't been spying my guys nearly enough

2809
03:09:26,480 --> 03:09:28,480
Well get good

2810
03:09:28,960 --> 03:09:30,960
Thank you

2811
03:09:30,960 --> 03:09:38,000
Thank you. I I I come to you in a moment of vulnerability. You do this to me. I got you you fucking loser

2812
03:09:41,360 --> 03:09:43,520
Also, I'm I'm I'm out of ammo right now

2813
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:54,560
Sit got the flame shotgun is fucking awesome

2814
03:09:55,040 --> 03:09:57,040
Oh

2815
03:09:58,960 --> 03:10:05,040
I want that me bloodless. Oh my god six six six six six six six

2816
03:10:08,080 --> 03:10:11,200
Oh, you got the minigun fuck you unit

2817
03:10:12,560 --> 03:10:14,560
I got the assault rifles

2818
03:10:15,360 --> 03:10:17,360
It'll do in a pinch

2819
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:19,520
Oh

2820
03:10:23,680 --> 03:10:28,240
Oh, I I'm I'm over here. Oh, there are a bunch of snowbots, so so be careful be careful

2821
03:10:37,680 --> 03:10:44,640
I thought for sure that was the end of the run by the way never the run never ends. I hope so

2822
03:10:47,360 --> 03:10:51,600
I need strong spirit. Oh, actually I have a ramp. I'm gonna spawn as many people as physically can

2823
03:11:12,720 --> 03:11:15,680
I can't wait till I have an ultra mutation and I can spawn double allies

2824
03:11:18,320 --> 03:11:26,000
Yeah, I always think your dudes are cops and I shoot at them. They don't they don't they don't look like cops

2825
03:11:26,160 --> 03:11:28,160
It's just because they're blue. I don't know

2826
03:11:34,160 --> 03:11:39,760
Oh trip machine gun. Oh, dude. This is actually my favorite weapon in tagging. Oh shit. They're actually cops now. Yeah, I know

2827
03:11:42,160 --> 03:11:45,840
Oh my god, this is really good. What a act. Uh, this this is the line

2828
03:11:48,080 --> 03:11:50,080
I

2829
03:11:54,320 --> 03:11:56,320
Fuck it's that man

2830
03:11:59,840 --> 03:12:02,160
Wait, I'm dead. Fuck me god christ

2831
03:12:05,600 --> 03:12:09,760
Oh, fuck what? Oh, no, I'm you're in such a bad. I'm done. I'm done. Hey, I'm done here

2832
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:11,920
Oh

2833
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:15,440
Fuck fuck

2834
03:12:16,320 --> 03:12:20,080
God little hunter's the worst we keep we keep being terrible spawns for little hunter

2835
03:12:24,800 --> 03:12:26,800
We'll get them we'll get them

2836
03:12:28,880 --> 03:12:31,840
Never despair. Well, it's too late for that

2837
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:37,200
Spares never whoa, whoa, why is oh, okay. I was hitting the wrong button

2838
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:41,520
Dude we should just play video games like

2839
03:12:42,320 --> 03:12:47,760
For fun sometimes. I like don't play many video games. I don't either

2840
03:12:48,400 --> 03:12:50,400
But that can change

2841
03:12:50,720 --> 03:12:52,720
I guess it could yeah

2842
03:12:53,360 --> 03:12:55,840
But but why don't I play video games?

2843
03:12:57,360 --> 03:12:59,360
It's I mean, I mean

2844
03:12:59,600 --> 03:13:04,720
I don't know just I I never find myself thinking like boy. I'd really like to play a video game right now

2845
03:13:05,440 --> 03:13:07,440
It's a social experience. Yeah

2846
03:13:08,400 --> 03:13:10,400
it is

2847
03:13:12,800 --> 03:13:15,920
You you you were you were real lonely a lot of time in

2848
03:13:16,560 --> 03:13:22,160
Atlanta and I always wondered why you didn't just come to chat like like like you always talked about how you were so lonely

2849
03:13:22,400 --> 03:13:27,680
Yeah, but you never came into chat. So I felt like that would probably could easily be fixed. I

2850
03:13:30,480 --> 03:13:32,480
I uh

2851
03:13:35,600 --> 03:13:40,960
What if you don't want to what a fucking miserable time what you don't have to say anything if you don't want you

2852
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:42,960
I don't know if you were

2853
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:44,560
I

2854
03:13:44,560 --> 03:13:50,640
Mike I felt I felt like my time was very restricted. I I you know

2855
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:54,720
I

2856
03:13:54,880 --> 03:13:58,720
I think I would have spent more time like in the chat talking to you guys

2857
03:13:58,800 --> 03:14:03,360
I just never felt like I could I somehow I was never able to find especially like

2858
03:14:04,320 --> 03:14:11,360
Like during the day I was always like, I don't know like at night. I never felt like I could I could get away and do that

2859
03:14:13,200 --> 03:14:15,200
Move away. You're yeah, yeah

2860
03:14:21,280 --> 03:14:23,280
Be steroids or someone

2861
03:14:23,920 --> 03:14:27,040
Why you know do whatever you want do whatever you want. Why not be fish?

2862
03:14:28,240 --> 03:14:30,480
You can be fish. He's fine. You know, I'll be crystal

2863
03:14:31,360 --> 03:14:33,360
Okay

2864
03:14:40,880 --> 03:14:41,760
I think

2865
03:14:41,760 --> 03:14:48,480
I'm pretty sure the pcp is the only group of friends that our relationship is not founded upon video games

2866
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:51,280
where all all like like

2867
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:54,640
All of the like several friend groups I've been a part of in my entire life

2868
03:14:54,960 --> 03:15:00,080
Have all basically been battered on the fact that we both like video games either we play them together

2869
03:15:00,160 --> 03:15:03,440
Or we just have a mutual appreciation of them like like how I met my

2870
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:10,800
My like the irl like high school group of friends was just that I saw some guy with like a tf2 t-shirt on one time

2871
03:15:12,880 --> 03:15:15,920
Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I think that's

2872
03:15:16,880 --> 03:15:19,680
I mean, what else is there? What else is there these days?

2873
03:15:20,720 --> 03:15:22,720
true

2874
03:15:23,280 --> 03:15:27,920
Those people make what do people become friends based on before me serious questions

2875
03:15:29,280 --> 03:15:32,400
Uh mutual appreciation for fine arts

2876
03:15:33,280 --> 03:15:37,840
I mean, no mutual mutual appreciation for farming

2877
03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:44,160
You chuckle to yourself having pwned the opposition

2878
03:15:46,320 --> 03:15:48,320
I mean, well, I mean, you know

2879
03:15:48,400 --> 03:15:55,120
Books, you know, you probably like you know mutual mutual admiration for the same books or or movies. Yeah tv

2880
03:15:55,200 --> 03:15:57,200
You know, yeah, yeah, I mean there was lots of shit

2881
03:15:57,200 --> 03:16:01,120
There was lots of art to appreciate even before video games hard as it is to believe

2882
03:16:01,840 --> 03:16:07,760
Hardest to admit. Yeah, even even to the the sole video game audience grab your all all of these are shit

2883
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:10,000
I guess this one

2884
03:16:11,920 --> 03:16:15,600
I think if we have a scarier face game with us, but you can actually kill rats just by touching them

2885
03:16:16,240 --> 03:16:18,240
Yes, this case

2886
03:16:18,480 --> 03:16:24,800
Wait, so we don't have to we don't have to waste any ammo here. Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's why I like fucking um

2887
03:16:25,520 --> 03:16:27,520
whatever it's called

2888
03:16:27,680 --> 03:16:31,200
Is this because we have a combination of scary face and uh, yes

2889
03:16:31,920 --> 03:16:34,640
Yeah, okay. Scary face and uh gamma guts

2890
03:16:35,360 --> 03:16:37,840
Yeah, so it doesn't just work with regular gamma guts, right?

2891
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:41,840
No, you can only kill like maggots look like that. Yeah

2892
03:16:42,800 --> 03:16:44,960
I thought for sure that was gonna be a mimic

2893
03:16:45,920 --> 03:16:50,480
Nah, those are super rare. Oh my okay. This is this is going bad

2894
03:16:54,480 --> 03:16:58,960
This game is significantly harder to call up and I don't know why because on its face it would seem way easier

2895
03:16:59,200 --> 03:17:01,200
Yeah, just revive each other

2896
03:17:05,040 --> 03:17:07,520
I think because like ammo becomes such a problem

2897
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:13,040
It it really does and like one I I feel like I'm the kind of player who trails behind

2898
03:17:13,600 --> 03:17:18,240
I I'm like constantly running out of ammo because other people are like running ahead and picking it up

2899
03:17:19,440 --> 03:17:21,440
Before I can get my greedy little pause on it

2900
03:17:22,240 --> 03:17:24,240
You gotta be confident in this game

2901
03:17:24,400 --> 03:17:26,000
well

2902
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:28,560
Just like in life. Well, you know

2903
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:32,080
Tell me that

2904
03:17:32,080 --> 03:17:36,960
Go back to to young young ben and tell him that he could he could use he could use it

2905
03:17:37,600 --> 03:17:39,600
Nothing could save him. Yeah

2906
03:17:45,200 --> 03:17:51,040
You chuggle yourself having been pwned. Yes. I mean as long as someone gets pwned, I'm happy

2907
03:17:52,160 --> 03:17:54,480
As long as they're pwned there's pwned in here

2908
03:17:55,520 --> 03:17:57,520
Who it's towards is largely

2909
03:17:58,080 --> 03:18:00,080
It's incidental incidental

2910
03:18:02,240 --> 03:18:04,240
Oh god, oh it's the dog

2911
03:18:04,800 --> 03:18:07,280
And I'm like out of ammo speaking of

2912
03:18:10,400 --> 03:18:15,680
Oh god, oh god, I'm gonna die. Oh, it's so bad. Oh, I got blame. I got blamed by fire

2913
03:18:16,880 --> 03:18:21,040
No, I got you. Thank you. Oh, please help me. Please help me. Please help me. Please help me

2914
03:18:21,840 --> 03:18:28,160
Nah, I don't really feel like it. Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

2915
03:18:28,480 --> 03:18:30,480
You're tagging tagging. All right

2916
03:18:31,040 --> 03:18:33,040
Uh, do I need to help? Wait, are you dead? No

2917
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:36,000
No, I'm alive

2918
03:18:36,080 --> 03:18:38,400
I don't want sticky launcher. That would be suicide

2919
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:46,000
That would be okay. This is scary. This is this is a little bit what we would call scary and in the business

2920
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,000
This is what we refer to as a scary moment

2921
03:18:49,520 --> 03:18:55,680
I don't know if you laymen know but but here in the podcast industry, we have these things called scary moments where we don't complete control of our body

2922
03:19:03,840 --> 03:19:09,680
We lost some ammo there. Yeah

2923
03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:18,640
Okay

2924
03:19:19,440 --> 03:19:24,000
Oh my god, whoo-hoo-hoo Gatling slugger. That's a really good weapon

2925
03:19:27,200 --> 03:19:32,880
Okay, okay, sit. All right, we're gonna make it. Not that okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

2926
03:19:33,200 --> 03:19:35,200
We're fine. We're gonna make it after all

2927
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:40,880
All I have to do is just I just have to get in front of your bed. I want to add

2928
03:19:41,440 --> 03:19:44,480
I want to add uh mutations to endless war so much

2929
03:19:45,280 --> 03:19:47,440
Do you I thought I thought you didn't care about that. Oh, no, no

2930
03:19:47,520 --> 03:19:52,800
I mean it wasn't like the the the thing I wanted to work on right then, but I do really want to do it

2931
03:19:53,440 --> 03:19:58,960
Okay, and I'm not sure how I want to do it like whether I want it to be a thing that you gain passively upon leveling up

2932
03:19:59,360 --> 03:20:02,160
Or a thing that you have to like invest slime in you know

2933
03:20:03,120 --> 03:20:05,200
The jury's out and I mean we can always change it

2934
03:20:06,240 --> 03:20:09,360
We can always try it one way and then decide that we don't like it do the other

2935
03:20:10,080 --> 03:20:14,560
Would would you consider endless war into being a state of alpha and when it relaunches this can be in beta?

2936
03:20:14,720 --> 03:20:16,720
Is that how you would phrase things?

2937
03:20:16,960 --> 03:20:19,600
Uh, maybe the only thing is that like

2938
03:20:21,280 --> 03:20:26,400
Isn't it like a game starts in alpha and then goes into beta and then is its final release

2939
03:20:26,960 --> 03:20:31,760
Yeah, well, okay, then the only thing that I would hesitate. Do I want the blood hammer?

2940
03:20:32,560 --> 03:20:33,760
No, okay

2941
03:20:33,760 --> 03:20:37,840
The only thing that I would hesitate to say about that then is that it's not like I think that

2942
03:20:38,240 --> 03:20:44,960
It's in its semifinal form like it could change any number of times between now and forever

2943
03:20:48,480 --> 03:20:51,760
So I guess I would just say that it's in its phase two of its alpha

2944
03:20:52,960 --> 03:20:55,920
Okay, I mean, I don't know. Do you want to just continue develop?

2945
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:58,880
Do you want to just continue developing it like in perpetuity?

2946
03:20:58,880 --> 03:21:02,800
Or do you think that it will eventually reach a point where like it's done and it's good

2947
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:07,200
And we I think I I think we'll reach a point where it's done and it's good

2948
03:21:07,440 --> 03:21:11,840
I would say that we should probably call that like it's it's it's it's a little under coming by the way

2949
03:21:12,080 --> 03:21:14,480
Oh god, this is this is really bad

2950
03:21:15,280 --> 03:21:20,400
We should we should call that some sort of like of like a final release

2951
03:21:20,560 --> 03:21:24,240
But I don't think it will be the last time we ever updated at all. I think it would just be like a sort of

2952
03:21:25,200 --> 03:21:28,880
Honorific oh god. Oh my god. This is so terrible

2953
03:21:31,200 --> 03:21:34,560
Little owners over. Oh, I don't know. I don't know what you're doing. I'm just fucking

2954
03:21:35,360 --> 03:21:37,360
awash with monsters

2955
03:21:37,360 --> 03:21:42,240
And I'm also out of ammo. God damn it. Okay. I I kill blue hunter. Oh, thank god

2956
03:21:42,400 --> 03:21:47,040
I'm okay. Clearly the clearly though the way to do it was just to let you handle it. Yeah

2957
03:21:49,280 --> 03:21:51,280
All right

2958
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:56,080
Don't worry. We're good. We're also we we're also doing the sewers which is extremely easy if you're rebel

2959
03:21:56,800 --> 03:21:58,800
Wait, the sewers. Yeah

2960
03:21:59,680 --> 03:22:01,680
I'm sorry the left. Yeah

2961
03:22:04,720 --> 03:22:08,560
All right, I'll run. Oh, okay. This is this is great. This is great

2962
03:22:11,280 --> 03:22:13,280
Is this the run

2963
03:22:13,520 --> 03:22:18,880
This might in fact be the run. This is I mean I mean killing little hunter is an achievement little hunter is the worst

2964
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:24,000
Yeah

2965
03:22:24,880 --> 03:22:30,160
What do I want the heavy crossbow? Yes, I think it takes a lot to reload that dude

2966
03:22:32,880 --> 03:22:34,880
Well, never again

2967
03:22:38,080 --> 03:22:40,080
I I definitely want my final mutation

2968
03:22:47,920 --> 03:22:50,800
Ow, no, I got you I got you doing

2969
03:22:51,680 --> 03:22:53,680
I'm fucking out of bullets

2970
03:22:55,680 --> 03:22:57,680
Okay

2971
03:23:02,240 --> 03:23:04,240
What the fuck is that a

2972
03:23:04,240 --> 03:23:06,960
That's a super bazooka. Do I want to avoid that?

2973
03:23:07,920 --> 03:23:12,240
You probably want to avoid that. I imagine that will probably kill you. It's really dangerous

2974
03:23:14,320 --> 03:23:17,040
It's so it's so much on me. Oh my god, that was really scary

2975
03:23:17,040 --> 03:23:19,040
Okay

2976
03:23:20,880 --> 03:23:22,880
You're getting really good mutations right now

2977
03:23:26,320 --> 03:23:32,400
Be be wary of that guy. What guy that guy right there the cop don't shoot it. Don't shoot him. There we go

2978
03:23:36,800 --> 03:23:38,800
Ah

2979
03:23:42,320 --> 03:23:44,320
Oh

2980
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:50,000
Oh

2981
03:24:09,840 --> 03:24:16,480
Okay, hold on. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. We okay. Okay, Ben you have your sound on right?

2982
03:24:17,280 --> 03:24:20,080
Uh, yeah, I mean it's kind of quiet

2983
03:24:21,280 --> 03:24:24,400
I'm gonna turn my sound on right now. Hold on. What are you doing? All right

2984
03:24:25,200 --> 03:24:31,120
I I have to explain to you the strap for the throne. Okay, so come up here. Don't don't hit the throne do not activate him

2985
03:24:31,120 --> 03:24:34,880
I'm gonna explain to you what we're gonna do. Just walk up here. Please follow my lead

2986
03:24:36,160 --> 03:24:40,000
The throne doesn't attack where it charges up at the base here and it shoots down the middle

2987
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:43,280
This red carpet right here is where it is. Yeah, don't don't don't touch it

2988
03:24:43,680 --> 03:24:46,560
And we'll do a sound that will wind up and we'll do the animation up here

2989
03:24:46,720 --> 03:24:49,840
I have just looked to is the real and when it does the real

2990
03:24:50,240 --> 03:24:53,440
Then just get out of the red carpet. So we're gonna do is we're going to bait that attack

2991
03:24:53,440 --> 03:24:56,400
We're gonna stand the carpet and then when I move away you move away as well

2992
03:24:56,720 --> 03:25:00,320
So focus on the it's a focus on the you're not here these little generators down here

2993
03:25:00,320 --> 03:25:05,120
Just focus on these yeah and go in here and just make them stall. So we're gonna go up here or into attack them

2994
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:09,920
What on the red carpet do not stand the red carpet right now. He will do that attack right out there

2995
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:12,400
So do not stand there. Just do as I do

2996
03:25:13,200 --> 03:25:15,200
uh

2997
03:25:15,200 --> 03:25:17,200

Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, just just try these

2999
03:25:29,360 --> 03:25:31,360
Do not stand the middle

3000
03:25:35,680 --> 03:25:38,640
Hey, he's shooting things now. Yeah, I see that

3001
03:25:40,640 --> 03:25:44,880
All right, all right, the throne now now has no generators. So do we kill it?

3002
03:25:46,080 --> 03:25:49,360
So so so so we can loop so should I kill the throne or what?

3003
03:25:51,360 --> 03:25:57,760
Do I attack the throne or not? Yeah, yeah, yeah, you do you do. Yes, I'm dead. I I I I didn't hear you

3004
03:26:01,920 --> 03:26:05,040

3005
03:26:05,840 --> 03:26:11,440

03:27:05,120 --> 03:27:07,920
All right, we're probably gonna get our old communication

3015
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:11,840
After this level

3016
03:27:12,160 --> 03:27:18,640
Which I'm so excited for that will make things so much easier. Remember the the van is here. So be wary of the van

3017
03:27:22,880 --> 03:27:25,040
Oh, oh my god, I hate that fucking guy

No, okay. I want the dragon

3030
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:11,120

Okay, I'm ready. You know what we have to do by the way. No

3045
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:18,960
It's not a true nuclear phone run unless we go for crown of blood

3046
03:29:19,680 --> 03:29:23,680
It's not a true one if you don't go for crown of blood crown of blood that that spawns more enemies

3047
03:29:25,040 --> 03:29:27,040
Uh, okay

3048

3049
03:29:31,520 --> 03:29:33,520
Is it gonna be a score run?

3050
03:29:35,680 --> 03:29:37,680
I I have no weapons

3051
03:29:37,920 --> 03:29:39,920

3052
03:29:42,160 --> 03:29:45,200
It's not there's some shit over here. There's some shit over here

3053
03:30:00,800 --> 03:30:02,800
Well, well

3054
03:30:03,520 --> 03:30:07,920
Uh, that was pretty good. Uh, I'm gonna kill myself

3055
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:13,360
Well, we looped we made it we won we won the video game

3056
03:30:14,720 --> 03:30:16,720
We

3057
03:30:18,080 --> 03:30:24,640
Just stop let's just stop it. You want you want you want to call it here? It's over. We've been going for three and a half hours

3058
03:30:25,920 --> 03:30:27,920
Okay

3059
03:30:28,160 --> 03:30:33,760
I hope you enjoyed. Yeah, I hope you enjoyed our I mean I I I have fun

3060
03:30:34,720 --> 03:30:39,920
I I had fun too. We had devoo. We had the classic. Yeah, we've covered a lot of ground here

3061
03:30:41,520 --> 03:30:46,640
Uh, we we talked a lot of shit about a lot of people near and dear to us and also not near and dear to us

3062
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:51,520
That's right. That's very very true. There were a lot of stones cast in in flipper

3063
03:30:52,480 --> 03:30:58,320
That manners, uh-huh, uh-huh with little rhino reason and and and nothing to gain on our part

3064
03:30:59,280 --> 03:31:00,800
No

3065
03:31:00,800 --> 03:31:02,800
It was it was just nothing to say

3066
03:31:04,080 --> 03:31:10,080
It was it was just mere it was merely it was merely viciousness for viciousness sake. Yeah. Yeah, my my favorite

3067
03:31:10,800 --> 03:31:12,560
Yeah, um

3068
03:31:12,560 --> 03:31:14,880
And frankly, I think it's time for it

3069
03:31:15,840 --> 03:31:22,080
I think it's time time for us it's time for us to put down our video game controllers and head on down to the local police station

3070
03:31:22,160 --> 03:31:24,160
And submit ourselves for execution

3071
03:31:24,960 --> 03:31:26,960
Um, I'm ready to do that. Yeah

3072
03:31:27,280 --> 03:31:29,200
When I you know

3073
03:31:29,200 --> 03:31:34,640
It's been so long since endless war has been, you know, all the color was like that slime city. I wonder how that's gonna go

3074
03:31:35,760 --> 03:31:37,760
Where are all that's gonna come back?

3075
03:31:37,840 --> 03:31:41,840
Stay tuned citizens. It I was looking at the design document today

3076
03:31:42,480 --> 03:31:44,480
And no, no, no don't

3077
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:49,840
Close it's it's it's mysterious. It's a mistake. Oh, oh, right. We'll cut out what I just said

3078
03:31:50,960 --> 03:31:52,960
um

3079
03:31:52,960 --> 03:31:54,960
Wait, I'm confused

3080
03:31:55,440 --> 03:32:01,600
No, I guess why I just wanted to allude to the fact that like there's stuff happening in the game

3081
03:32:01,920 --> 03:32:08,000
And you should join the server and they will and and you should experience it for yourself

3082
03:32:08,160 --> 03:32:10,160
Okay, I will cut all this out. Um

3083
03:32:12,400 --> 03:32:14,400
Yes, he is

3084
03:32:15,200 --> 03:32:17,200
Shit. No, you do it

3085
03:32:18,560 --> 03:32:20,560
