00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello, and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
We are back to talk about your favorite things one more time.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm the best guy ever, Guy, and I'm here with my internet dudes.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First up, Ben Saint.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
SaintComics.com

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Baby

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Endless Jess

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yabba

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Dabba too

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Uh, Lethal Aurora Mage

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm here, hi

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And The Davoo

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hi

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And uh, you'll probably notice if you've been watching that we've got a slightly different composition today of people

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we specifically requested Mage be here and Ben too

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Uh, because our topic for the day is fan art

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I have been derelict

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He has

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I've been derelict in my Pro Crastinators duties

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Not as much as Mage though

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Though that was because I gave Mage some shit

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But regardless

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You sure did

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But regardless, all is well in PCP land

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And we're gonna talk about this shit

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, so right, fan art

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So what we want to talk about, or what I was planning on bringing up

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Was um, not really instructions on how to do it

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But things that you should never ever do without my permission

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Um

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, okay, okay, that's one thing

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The impetus for this was simply that

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If you go, the links in our description will bring it to the PCP Reddit

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In the bottom of the video

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you go there

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
A nice fellow did a couple of PCP art pieces

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A couple of fan art pieces

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That just got us thinking about fan art in general

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And so we thought we'd take some time

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Just break down what we like about, what we don't

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And uh, you know, that kind of stuff

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Alright, alright, guy, guy

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So there's many aspects of fan art that we can talk about here

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There's the aspect that a bunch of us do

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Which is actually doing it

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And then there's the aspect of getting it

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Which is a whole different

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Which is my exclusive side of that equation

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So, right

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And first of all, the first thing I have to say

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Is that it is downright disgraceful people

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That best guy ever has gotten exactly one piece of fan art

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
From Hippocrite

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
From Give and Take

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And nobody else

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So anyone watching this, stop right now

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're not allowed to watch any further

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Unless you go draw me something

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Send to me on Twitter

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Do whatever you gotta do

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And that's the end of it

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Someone, someone did make a meme out of you though

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That, that's true

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That was um, a hyper bit hero actually

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's arguably fan art

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Of a, of a kind

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You know, actually two people have done that sort of thing

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I guess that counts

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But I want the drawly people

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The drawly people

71
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And, and uh, of course Cotton Candy did my banner

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But that was a commission

73
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So that doesn't count

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But it's true

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In any case

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We drawly, we drawly people are just more valuable than the rest of you

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, no, whatever

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's a sad truth of life

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What about the draw I did for your video

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
For free

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You mean um, oh for, for TBAP

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well of course that was wonderful

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But I just wouldn't count that as fan art

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Because I asked you for it

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's true

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Mage is a coin

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's start with you Mage

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're asking people, you're asking people right now for fan art

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, I'm demanding

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm putting a, putting a ultimatum

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Do it or I'll, or I'll never do another video again

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Uh, a guy

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I believe that your icon and banner and, and well

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Like, you know, the face that you use

98
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I mean, I did that for you

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Unprompted I think

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So I think that could just be fan art

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hmm, I, I suppose that would count

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You could call that ascended fan art

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was just fan art to begin with

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But then it, although, you know, I guess I kind of had the idea

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That you might use it for an icon when I made it so

106
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But it doesn't really count if you're related

107
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So it's fan art

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can't remember

109
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You probably did, you probably did actually

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm, I'm, I'm a fan of guy kind of

111
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
True

112
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Very critical and, and, and

113
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's true, you're probably my most critical fan

114
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think you're the most critical fan I have

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you do in fact count

117
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Which is, which is a good thing to have

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Um, but, but regardless of that

119
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I, I want to ask you and Mage, I guess

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Or specifically Mage

121
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I, I brought, I made sure Mage was here

122
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because she is by far the most prolific producer of fan art

123
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That

124
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Among our entire view

125
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I would say she's the most prolific producer of art period

126
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You think so?

127
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Uh, close to it

128
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, I mean, you're probably right

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And so she's got the expertise that we need

130
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
To really crack this nut, you know

131
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, uh

132
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No pressure or anything

133
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, yeah

134
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
To crack this nut we call

135
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The real America

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, so, so Mage

137
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You, you're into, you're doing a lot of undertale art

138
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you still, still doing that?

139
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is that, are you still doing that?

140
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, I haven't heard, I haven't heard from you in a while, so

141
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I, I, I've been busy playing a game

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But yeah, I am gonna do some more

143
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Uh, there, uh, a secret project that's coming up

144
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's might be in a video

145
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ooh, a secret project

146
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That sounds, that sounds sexy

147
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So

148
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Would that be on your channel?

149
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yep

150
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Lethal Romage, cool

151
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, so what drives you, Mage

152
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What's that core fire that burns in you

153
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That compels you to produce?

154
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Uh, specifically undertale or

155
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Or, you know, whatever you're currently into

156
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, I am currently into undertale stuff

157
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I, I mean that in the grander sense

158
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The thing at the time that you draw

159
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That you are currently interested in

160
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Uh, gosh, inspiration

161
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I mean, I know that's such a go-to answer

162
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But like, there are some moments in the day

163
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When I just sit down and I was like

164
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I feel like drawing today

165
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I don't stop until that feeling goes away

166
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But I have to exploit that feeling

167
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Because it's sometimes very rare

168
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And it's just like

169
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
When you feel it, you have to do it

170
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Because it'll, it'll, it's very fleeting

171
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What everybody thinks

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sure, I know what you mean

173
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Um, but your art is, is very good

174
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So I imagine it takes you a very long time

175
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
To produce

176
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Uh, I mean, does that like

177
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Go away? Do you lose drive

178
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
As you're going along?

179
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Um, most art

180
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Just kinda like, it takes a few hours

181
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Uh, I rarely like

182
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Uh, put a piece of art down

183
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And then come back to it the next day

184
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Rarely

185
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, really?

186
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sometimes it does happen

187
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, but usually I just kinda get in the zone

188
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So it's good and good

189
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You gotta do it

190
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You gotta do it in one shot

191
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Or else you might never come back to it

192
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly

193
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Um, my favorite thing that you've done

194
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was just gonna say

195
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
My favorite thing that you've done recently

196
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Is, is your Muffet picture

197
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's totally awesome

198
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's not that recent

199
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That was like three months ago

200
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, it's, it feels recent

201
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't know

202
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It was like her first Undertale art that I saw

203
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Uh, I was just wondering how long that took you to do

204
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Uh, probably a few hours

205
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Uh, no, wait, actually

206
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If, if, um, now I lost my place

207
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How long Muffet took you

208
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, yeah, okay

209
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If you're counting the sketch that didn't happen

210
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Then it probably took me a few days

211
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because the original sketch was like

212
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A bit too complicated

213
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And then it had like a perspective

214
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That was really hard to do

215
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I tried to change it

216
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But then I just scrapped the sketch altogether

217
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then I made a new one

218
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And there we go

219
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay, cool

220
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can weigh in on this subject

221
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes, please

222
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Ben is definitely our second highest fan art guy

223
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm a very slow, I'm a very slow artist

224
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And very often it takes me, like

225
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay, a big piece that's complicated

226
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I spend, I sometimes have to spend days on it

227
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because I'm just not fast enough

228
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Or just not motivated enough in general

229
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
To do it all in one go

230
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But, but, if the thing is coming out well

231
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Then that gives you more motivation to it

232
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Like if you do something and it looks good

233
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're like, yes, that's great

234
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And that like restores some of your energy

235
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And you can like, you can keep going a little longer

236
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know what's cool

237
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Like your little successes build each other

238
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But if it starts to look bad

239
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Then it's like, oh god, forget it

240
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Like if something goes wrong

241
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't want to do it anymore

242
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sure, that's understandable

243
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I was just going to say

244
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's interesting that you guys work in sort of

245
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Like, I mean like

246
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A piece of art is like one image

247
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That you're just working on

248
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And like crafting to make as good as it can be

249
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And just the way that you were saying that

250
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Like when I'm making a video

251
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know, like Digi I don't think really does this

252
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
His impetus is to get the video done as fast as possible

253
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But when I get to like a complex moment

254
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In a video, I'm sure Davoo can relate to this

255
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And Jesse too actually

256
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's like, I try to frame

257
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
To make that as good as it can be

258
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And like do all the little things I need to

259
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Like a good moment for this is my

260
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In the Gurren login video

261
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
When I did the like, what was it?

262
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Like the alternate version

263
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Or like an interpretive version of the spiral nemesis

264
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Where I did like guts with all the waifus

265
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like I made that part really good

266
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And just like you, I felt a strong desire to keep going

267
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But then I finished it

268
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then it was on to the next one

269
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I didn't care anymore

270
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And it was like, well, now that fire is gone

271
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Just my jealousy of the 2D media

272
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's completely unrelated to this

273
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Anyway

274
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh shit, there's Wolf's Rain

275
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Stray, stray

276
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wolf's Rain fucking rules

277
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It does

278
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's got wolves, dude

279
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know

280
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You guys want to talk anymore about that

281
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Or should we shift into what we think about

282
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I want to say

283
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That when I make fan art

284
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't do that much of it

285
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But sometimes when something really fucking gets me

286
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
On a deep level

287
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And when I really love a piece of work

288
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I want to like

289
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I want to participate in its splendor

290
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
In some way

291
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And I want to like feel close to it

292
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In some way

293
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So you fuck it is what you're saying

294
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, I want to fuck it

295
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, I make videos

296
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's how I do that

297
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Honestly, it's not that different

298
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
From like, oh you like someone

299
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You want to fuck them

300
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, I like this thing

301
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I want to draw it

302
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sure

303
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's intimate

304
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It gets me intimately knowledgeable

305
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
With the inner workings of a thing

306
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And once I've done it

307
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I feel much closer to it

308
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Of their bodies

309
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Sure, I feel ya

310
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Like I loved Lisa so much

311
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I was like, oh my god

312
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This story is so

313
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You know

314
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Good

315
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Touching or whatever

316
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The story is so emotionally resonant

317
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I was like, I have to create

318
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I have to depict the final epic scene

319
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Or you know, in Undertale

320
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The fight against Toriel

321
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I was like, oh my god

322
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That moment is so beautiful

323
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have to capture it

324
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have to participate in it

325
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
In some way

326
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I have to depict it in my own way

327
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ah yes, good

328
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, that's cool

329
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's almost like

330
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Right, okay

331
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Now tell me

332
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Alright, if you really like something

333
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't be the only one

334
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That if I really like something

335
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can get caught up

336
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Just like thinking about it

337
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Over and over again

338
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's how fandoms start I think

339
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Just like mentally dwelling

340
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
On this thing and how much I like it

341
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh yeah, all the time

342
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's when I make a video

343
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So I can tell people what I think

344
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then I can

345
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Gradually go to other things

346
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Same, same

347
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, I mean when you draw something

348
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You gotta think really hard about it

349
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Right?

350
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So to draw a thing

351
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
To draw a fan of a thing

352
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's both an excuse to

353
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Just sit there and dwell

354
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
On how much you love something

355
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And just think it really hard

356
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Like this thing, this thing, this thing

357
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But it's also an amplifier for it

358
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Because it gives you

359
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You have to focus on like

360
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh my god, this face

361
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
She's making this face

362
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The tears are running down Toriel's face

363
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
As the hot fire burns around

364
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But it doesn't hurt the fallen child

365
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Because she's merciful

366
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's pretty heavy stuff dude

367
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And that's what it's like

368
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's what fan art is like

369
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And that's why I do it

370
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What a good description

371
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
With fan material in general

372
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm much more drawn to works

373
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That expand on the context

374
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Of the original or create new scenarios

375
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Within the thing that are plausible

376
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But aren't shown or don't happen

377
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When seeing Undertale stuff

378
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Where someone makes a comic strip

379
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Out of a scene that happens in the game

380
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm like, uh, okay, fine

381
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're like, okay, I already saw this in the game

382
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh man, fuck you

383
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay, I see what you're saying

384
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But I personally am a much bigger fan

385
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Of what Ben was saying

386
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
As a viewer of people dramatically

387
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I fucking love all these

388
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Incredibly dramatic depictions

389
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Of fights in Undertale from the non

390
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Because Undertale's fights are so abstract

391
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
To see them rendered in any other form

392
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's even slightly realistic

393
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's so cool

394
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Like how epic was the fighting frisk

395
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
In Sans actually

396
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
All the fan art I've seen of it

397
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Makes me love that fight more

398
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Because I'm like, holy shit

399
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is so fucking rad

400
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
See, good

401
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Who are you agreeing with?

402
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
In this case, she's agreeing with me

403
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
All the scenes in Undertale

404
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Were obviously written around the fact

405
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That they were going to be very minimalist

406
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The more tools you have

407
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The more detail you have

408
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The different you're gonna write it

409
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And when it gets all drawn up

410
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's not as funny or as interesting to me

411
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
When it gets all detailed and stuff

412
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I know it's not as good as the fight

413
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Of course, but it's a cool thing

414
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's a cool supplement

415
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Like, again, it's kind of fanarty

416
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Because these things did not happen

417
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
They just floated around in a heart box

418
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
For a while and died

419
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Cool supplements are not interesting to me

420
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, fuck you

421
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I mean, as an artist

422
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's that feeling that I just described

423
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Is what I get when I'm depicting something

424
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's in the game, actually

425
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
As a viewer, I'd probably be more interested

426
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
In something that isn't in the game

427
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Like D'Vu was saying

428
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Some kind of expansion of the lore

429
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But that really comes with the risk

430
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Like Sans' dating Toriel

431
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's gonna happen, guys

432
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Shut up, man

433
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But that really comes with the risk

434
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Of someone overextending themselves

435
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And interpreting it in some...

436
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Going overboard in how far it's being interpreted

437
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
On this earth

438
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Which can be really annoying sometimes

439
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
There is nothing on this earth

440
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I hate more than unrealistic

441
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Fan interpretations of situations

442
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It makes me want to wipe out the entire human race

443
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But did you guys play Undertale Red?

444
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, but I saw it on YouTube

445
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why is this?

446
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I have not heard of this

447
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, you should play

448
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's kind of cool

449
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's really cool

450
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And it's exactly what you were talking about, D'Vu

451
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What it is is a single fight

452
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's like a single theoretical fight

453
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
From Undertale that takes place

454
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Some time around

455
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Like the time you're in Waterfall

456
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's a game, you play it

457
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's a game that you...

458
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah, yeah, but it...

459
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, it's a game

460
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But it's just one Undertale fight

461
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But it's got alternate paths

462
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
For if you're a good guy or a bad guy

463
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Or a genocide or whatever

464
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And the fight can play out in different ways

465
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I mean, it's a little like...

466
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, it's cool

467
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And it's a little dumb that the character in it

468
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Ends up having a kind of a relationship

469
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
With one of the main characters

470
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Who talks about her a little bit

471
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Like she knew her

472
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's a little cheesy

473
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's so really great

474
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I have no problem with it

475
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But then again though

476
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
In Undertale, all characters

477
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A lot of characters seem to know each other a lot

478
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Like they seem to have a close-knit community

479
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's true

480
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's a balancing act

481
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's a small community

482
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You just have to balance how plausible it is

483
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
With how cheesy it is

484
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
With how cool it is

485
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And if those things are right

486
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And it's acceptable

487
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then it's great

488
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Then there's no problem

489
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If she was the chosen one

490
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And she's like

491
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm the actual true God of Undertale

492
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You have to beat me for the real deal

493
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Because I was hiding in the shadows the whole time

494
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And if it was that, that'd be more annoying

495
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What I'm into is ambiguity

496
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And subtlety in fan material

497
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Stuff that isn't

498
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is where everything feels bad

499
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
In this fan art that I'm making

500
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because Undertale itself isn't always

501
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Things feel bad right now

502
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Things feel happy right now

503
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well I always look for

504
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The first thing that I look for in fan art

505
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is an interpretation of the work that is

506
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Porn

507
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh yeah

508
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah

509
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's entirely true

510
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's what I'm saying

511
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm way into pornography

512
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Speaking of those sorts of things

513
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You know what I think

514
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Is a pretty good sort of fan art

515
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The show Teen Titans Go

516
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I love that porn

517
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's not porn

518
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It really is a kind of fan art

519
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
For the original Teen Titans

520
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And I think like fan art

521
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It can be polarizing sometimes

522
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Like what fan art can do which is cool

523
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Is expand like DeVue was saying

524
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I think expand on little things

525
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That the fans are all aware of

526
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That maybe the community is aware of

527
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But the show itself doesn't really address

528
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Like for example

529
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
My favorite episode

530
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Hang on, hang on

531
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
My favorite thing

532
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You know I don't think it's fan art's place

533
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
To really expand on the original work

534
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Like the episode of Teen Titans Go

535
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Where it's just an episode

536
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
About how awesome Raven's legs are

537
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's the entire thesis of the entire episode

538
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And like people who hate Teen Titans Go

539
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Which there are amazingly

540
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Those people exist

541
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't get it

542
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And they see themselves as the vast majority by the way

543
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I know they're

544
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I hate them all

545
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I wish they were all dead

546
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They are scum

547
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
To make like a big

548
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
To big lampshade hang that thing

549
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And make a big episode

550
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's a big funny take on it

551
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Is cool

552
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I really like that sort of thing

553
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That is not an expansion upon

554
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The original Teen Titans

555
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That is a parody of the original Teen Titans

556
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Right there

557
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It blurs the line

558
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I mean it is a show

559
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's a sequel

560
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But it's not really

561
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't like read fan art

562
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And stuff

563
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And then go back to the original

564
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And go

565
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh well all those pictures I saw

566
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Are now a part of this

567
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It doesn't

568
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But they are

569
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They are in your mind

570
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
My mind

571
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Almost none of that

572
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Really changes my perspective

573
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Of the original thing

574
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Look look

575
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm not asking

576
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm not saying that it's good

577
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
To change your perspective

578
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm saying it's cool when fan art

579
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Can just make you think

580
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
At the time of viewing

581
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That fan art

582
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's an interesting thing

583
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah definitely

584
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And that's kind of what I'm saying

585
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The Teen Titans Go

586
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Though fan art has like

587
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The ability to make you

588
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like make certain characters

589
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
More endearing

590
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
For instance like an undertale

591
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Grilby like

592
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He's just a bartender

593
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And he's like a flying man

594
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Like I have seen like

595
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
A lot of Grilby fan art

596
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And just like

597
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The fan depictions of him

598
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Has just made me

599
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Like a huge fan

600
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Of the character

601
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Even though like

602
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He literally says nothing

603
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I agree

604
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And especially when the fan art

605
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Doesn't do anything to like

606
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Depict him in a different way

607
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It just kind of

608
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Puts a spotlight on him

609
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And it's like

610
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Look at this guy

611
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
He's a fire guy

612
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
He hangs out at the bar all day

613
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He listens to everybody's problems

614
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He's probably a chill dude

615
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And we're depicting him as such

616
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So then when you play the game

617
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Again you'll see him

618
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And you'll be like

619
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This guy

620
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This guy's pretty cool

621
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And like you know that flames

622
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That flames school girl

623
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Who's like the glue fire girl

624
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
She's probably

625
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Grilby's best friend

626
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Or wife or daughter

627
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You know

628
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm just making up things

629
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But I like him

630
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You think all

631
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Hey you think all flame heads

632
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Are related?

633
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes because I'm racist

634
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You know I can

635
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I can see that

636
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I can understand

637
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
How like that kind of

638
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Fan interpretation

639
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If you like it

640
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And choose to embrace it

641
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh listen to Ben

642
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Condescend on everybody

643
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Shut up

644
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can give

645
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It can give someone more

646
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Like depth in your mind

647
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If you want it to

648
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Personally I feel much more

649
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Comfortable keeping fan

650
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Like interpretation

651
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Like that separate

652
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And I don't like to

653
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't know

654
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't like to think about them

655
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't think it's

656
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't think it's really fair

657
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
To like combine them

658
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
With the original work

659
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I really think they

660
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't know

661
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Should be kept separate

662
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Well but I mean

663
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
How do you do that

664
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You can't stop people from

665
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Making art

666
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And I think as soon as you

667
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Look at them

668
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I just don't think about it

669
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Like I never thought about

670
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Like I never thought about

671
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Vinyl and Octavia dating

672
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
When I watched

673
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
My little pony

674
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And

675
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I think what's important is

676
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
To like draw a line

677
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Between your head canon

678
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And what's canon

679
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So like you can like

680
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Head canon has about a lot

681
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Of stuff and have fun with it

682
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But when you're watching

683
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The show or playing the game

684
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Sure

685
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You realize that

686
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Like what you like

687
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Is probably not true

688
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But you can still

689
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You know

690
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Sure but these

691
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You know more dramatic

692
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Depictions of Grillby

693
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Or like the sans fight

694
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
None of those are like

695
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Deviating from canon really

696
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They're just

697
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
People who are

698
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Who are dumb

699
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Who see fan art

700
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And they go

701
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Well this is canon now

702
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes

703
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Actually believe it

704
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh yeah

705
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's a whole other angle

706
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
True

707
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Don't understand

708
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Those people at all

709
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You know this

710
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Maybe this can transition

711
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Into what I consider

712
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
To be the big problem

713
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Of fan art is

714
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The self perpetuating cultures

715
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Where people

716
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Continue to go

717
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
To make the fan art

718
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Not necessarily

719
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Because of their

720
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Original enjoyment

721
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Of the work

722
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But by the

723
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Amount of attention

724
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And friendship

725
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
They can get

726
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
From continuing to create

727
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Fan works

728
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Causing people

729
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
To continue to dwell

730
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Too much

731
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And get a little bit

732
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Tired of it

733
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Well I mean

734
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's an issue

735
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's an issue

736
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And I think that

737
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Definitely sort of happened

738
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
With Undertale to the point

739
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Where I got sick of it

740
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I was on board with most of

741
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That point

742
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But then I got confused

743
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
At the end

744
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah

745
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm 100% on board

746
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
With that point

747
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Davo

748
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But isn't that just

749
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Like what if

750
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What if people made

751
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No fan art

752
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But just talked about it

753
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Too much

754
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Just posted

755
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You know pictures

756
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's like the same thing

757
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's not like a fan art

758
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Problem

759
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And a thing

760
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Explodes in fan works

761
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And the whole community

762
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Comes around it

763
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The fan art perpetuates itself

764
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Like Davo said

765
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
In a way where

766
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It turns into memes

767
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And the memes turn into

768
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Dreams

769
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Like people

770
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Hopes and dreams

771
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes that's right

772
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

773
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Okay sorry

774
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's the best song

775
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
In Undertale by the way

776
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Hopes and dreams

777
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I disagree but whatever

778
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But anyways

779
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What I'm saying is that

780
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's memes that spring up in the fan art

781
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And that turns into

782
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
People's interpretation of canon

783
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So you have stuff like

784
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There's like 50,000 different comics

785
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Of Sans crying

786
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Like a fucking baby

787
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah

788
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And he's such a nihilist

789
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And he's so depressed about it

790
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And people live

791
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
At some point

792
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That kind of waned on

793
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
On our Undertale

794
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
At least back when I was

795
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Still looking at it

796
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Eventually people realized

797
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I think as soon as people

798
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Realized that crying

799
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Sans was like a common thread

800
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
People got a little embarrassed

801
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
About it

802
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's good

803
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Because it's self-awareness

804
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah

805
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's the whole

806
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You know

807
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's like

808
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's like a huge

809
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That would be a huge moment

810
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Well let's just say

811
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Hypothetically there is

812
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
A part in Undertale

813
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Where Toby decided

814
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
To actually make that happen

815
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
For some reason

816
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
There was a lot of build up to it

817
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That would be like

818
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
A huge payoff

819
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And that'd be like

820
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The equivalent of a character death

821
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And in fan art

822
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You could go all the way

823
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You could make the ultimate thing

824
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Happen

825
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But then everyone would do it

826
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And everyone gets sick of it

827
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah

828
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
On the subject of fan art

829
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Perpetuating itself

830
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
By its popularity

831
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm with you on that

832
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And like for me

833
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I even the things that I love

834
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Like Undertale's like

835
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
My favorite game of 2015

836
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And one of my favorite games ever

837
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I did like one fan art of it

838
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And then I wanted to do

839
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
A second one

840
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But it turned out

841
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It was turning out bad

842
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So I was like well I give up

843
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What was the one you were doing?

844
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I was gonna do undying

845
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The undying

846
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I was like I did exactly

847
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
One Undertale fan art

848
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That was pretty okay

849
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And then I made another one

850
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That was deliberately bad looking

851
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And that was

852
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't know about you

853
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I make everything I do

854
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Deliberately bad looking

855
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So I can hide behind that

856
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Like a coward

857
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Exactly

858
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's my life

859
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Exactly

860
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's my life

861
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I actually do pretty pride

862
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
In my shitty art

863
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But anyway go on Ben

864
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Anyway

865
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I guess all I'm saying

866
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Is I don't feel the

867
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't usually feel the

868
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Needs to do any more than that

869
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But if someone was like

870
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I mean I did get a bunch of views

871
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I got

872
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I've gotten more comments

873
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
On my Toriel picture

874
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Than I have on anything else

875
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
In my DeviantArt

876
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Of course

877
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I've gotten more likes

878
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
On my Alisa fan art

879
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Than I have on anything else

880
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
On Twitter

881
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Fan art's a good way

882
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
To get popular

883
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Just to do

884
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
If those things were

885
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Like super motivating to me

886
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I would be tempted

887
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
To do more of them

888
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But I don't know how many

889
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
More I could do

890
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Before I started

891
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
To be like

892
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah

893
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah

894
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What you gotta do

895
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is hop from fandom

896
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
To fandom

897
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
To do your fan art

898
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Get that sweet subscriber money

899
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I mean

900
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah I mean that

901
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That's my natural inclination

902
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Is to find something

903
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I like

904
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Do like one cool picture

905
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Of it and then move on

906
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Well good

907
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That should work out then

908
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Let me explain why

909
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The whole fan perpetuation

910
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Thing is

911
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is something that I find

912
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
To be

913
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Not something

914
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Something that I have to go out

915
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Of my way to avoid

916
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
In regards to Undertale

917
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Whereas

918
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
With my little pony

919
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's not as much of an issue

920
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
At least not for nearly as

921
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It takes a lot longer

922
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
To become an issue

923
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Is that Undertale is one game

924
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In a hypothetical world

925
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Where Undertale didn't get popular

926
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But I still played it

927
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I would have had a great time

928
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I would have spent

929
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You know a day

930
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Looking at fan art

931
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Then

932
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I would have forgotten about it

933
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Come back to it a year or later

934
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And had an amazing time

935
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But if

936
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You let yourself get stuck

937
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Sucked into the big community

938
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You think about it day in day out

939
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Every day every week

940
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And so then you can't have that cool

941
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Come back to it in a year

942
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Experience

943
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You never have to get about it

944
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You know

945
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't know

946
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I rewatch pony episodes sometimes

947
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And I found them

948
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I like living in Undertale hell

949
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yeah

950
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Well that's good

951
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I can

952
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I understand what you mean

953
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Under hell

954
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And I

955
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I

956
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You know I guess I would

957
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hypothetically have like to like

958
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Forget about Undertale

959
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And then play it

960
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
In a year

961
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There's still time

962
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's gonna happen

963
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But I never actually do that

964
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I never actually go back and re-read

965
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Or re-play things

966
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Even if I really like them

967
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Which is too bad

968
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And I should probably do that sometimes

969
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's a healthy part of the experience

970
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You know

971
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's like stuff like My Little Pony

972
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Is you know half

973
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's mostly a situational TV show

974
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Where things happen

975
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There's new episodes coming out

976
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There's a continuity

977
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So it's something that can remain

978
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
In your subconscious all the time

979
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Or it's something that you can always have

980
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
On the mind

981
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Like ooh what's the character

982
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Is doing this week right

983
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That kind of sitcom

984
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah

985
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Romcom

986
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You know

987
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Soap opera type stuff

988
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Undertale is a single

989
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
One

990
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's a somewhat linear start

991
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Begin

992
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
End

993
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Story

994
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So you have a problem with the fact

995
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
That people keep bringing it up

996
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Even though it's done

997
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's not something that should be

998
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I mean

999
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm not following

1000
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I think ideally

1001
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah

1002
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
In terms of your ability to enjoy the game

1003
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's not something that you think about

1004
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Consciously

1005
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Often

1006
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
For like a whole year

1007
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah

1008
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Now me avoiding

1009
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Me taking it

1010
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Well it hasn't been a year

1011
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Coming down

1012
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Well I'm

1013
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Well I'm just saying it's still

1014
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Probably going to be

1015
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Pretty around

1016
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
A year from now

1017
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Because of the

1018
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Fan popularity

1019
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Perpetuation thing

1020
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Maybe

1021
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Maybe

1022
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Anyway

1023
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm not really agreeing with that

1024
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Personally though

1025
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I like seeing a lot of fan art

1026
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Of Undertale

1027
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Like for me

1028
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Me too

1029
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What I like about Undertale

1030
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Is like the characters

1031
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And I like seeing people's interpretations

1032
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Of like possible dialogues

1033
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And in between characters

1034
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Possible

1035
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Outcomes

1036
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Like what's going to happen

1037
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
After the end

1038
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Or what happened before this

1039
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Or like

1040
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah

1041
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Just sort of like all these

1042
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Things that are around the characters

1043
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I think

1044
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I love seeing that

1045
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I love that scene

1046
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I think that happened

1047
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
After the end of the game

1048
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I think is the perfect place

1049
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
To make fan art of

1050
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Because

1051
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Like all that is speculation

1052
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It's all

1053
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
What makes the game interesting

1054
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Is like oh man

1055
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What's going to

1056
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
They have a happy ending

1057
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But like what does that mean

1058
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's fun to think about those things

1059
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That are really supposed to get answers

1060
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Within the work

1061
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But you know

1062
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Everyone's got their own interpretation

1063
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Of what that could be

1064
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And there is no answer

1065
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Well I

1066
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So it seems logical to

1067
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You know to pick whatever you want

1068
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I can totally say

1069
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That Undertale

1070
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Like that wrestling match

1071
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Like that wrestling video

1072
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Is the exact thing

1073
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
That I would like to happen

1074
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
After Undertale ends

1075
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You know

1076
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I forget what it's called

1077
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Metaton

1078
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Entertainment

1079
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Or whatever

1080
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You know

1081
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That's good stuff right

1082
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's good fan work

1083
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I really like

1084
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I do really like seeing

1085
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Different interpretations

1086
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Of characters

1087
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Sometimes

1088
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Everything

1089
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Everyone has like a different

1090
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Idea

1091
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Of what she actually looks like

1092
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Because it's really vague

1093
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah

1094
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Because it's in black and white

1095
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And like

1096
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I don't know

1097
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Like the hearts

1098
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Are the hearts red

1099
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Or are they white

1100
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Is like

1101
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You know

1102
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What color is the weird spear beam

1103
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Shooting out of her eye

1104
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You know

1105
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Like what color is

1106
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And like

1107
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You know

1108
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
What's she doing

1109
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't know

1110
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Everyone's drawing of her

1111
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Looks really different

1112
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And some of them

1113
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I think are amazing

1114
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And some of them

1115
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I think are really stupid

1116
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I have this policy

1117
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
For myself

1118
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Is

1119
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I absolutely know

1120
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
That Undertale is good enough

1121
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
To be a thing

1122
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
That you can

1123
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Dwell on

1124
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
All the time

1125
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Indefinitely

1126
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I just think

1127
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
There are other things

1128
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
To get to

1129
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Nothing's good enough

1130
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
To draw on indefinitely

1131
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That all

1132
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Well until further notice

1133
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I guess

1134
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But I'm just saying

1135
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
There are so many other things

1136
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That also deserve your time

1137
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
For the first couple of months

1138
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I would have said

1139
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That Undertale was not

1140
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Overrated

1141
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It was

1142
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Correctly rated

1143
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And just there's

1144
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
A million other things

1145
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That are underrated

1146
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Is my opinion

1147
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Um

1148
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I don't know

1149
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Um

1150
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Maybe

1151
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I don't know

1152
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah probably

1153
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm not bothered by that

1154
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
People can make art

1155
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Of whatever they want

1156
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Uh

1157
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You know

1158
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I am annoyed

1159
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But when communities

1160
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Obsess about things

1161
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
That I'm no longer interested in

1162
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But I would never begrudge

1163
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Someone for the art

1164
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That they're making

1165
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I am off

1166
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Sensation and burnout

1167
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Are problems

1168
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah

1169
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah

1170
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I am often

1171
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Perterrived by the thought

1172
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That there's probably

1173
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Lots of really great

1174
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Emotionally affecting media

1175
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Out there

1176
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That I'll never find

1177
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Sure

1178
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That I haven't found yet

1179
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And I never will

1180
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And that's very troubling to me

1181
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Um

1182
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
That brings me to another

1183
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Thing about fan art

1184
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Which is

1185
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Um

1186
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That it kind of brings

1187
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Attention to a thing

1188
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah

1189
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Like the way

1190
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That I found out about

1191
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Homestuck

1192
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Was through

1193
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You know art of the trolls

1194
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Or not

1195
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Actually it was mostly

1196
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Screenshots of the trolls

1197
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That I would see

1198
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
As people's avatars

1199
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And stuff

1200
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But whatever

1201
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And like

1202
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Rainbow Dash presents

1203
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The

1204
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The biker gorilla

1205
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Named episode

1206
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Rainbow Dash presents

1207
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Her pussy

1208
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
To be cummed inside

1209
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Am I right?

1210
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Anyway

1211
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah

1212
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And I

1213
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
A friend of mine

1214
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Made me watch that

1215
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The one with the

1216
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Rainbow Factory

1217
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Made you watch

1218
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Rainbow Dash get cummed inside

1219
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Okay

1220
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Before

1221
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Making me watch an episode

1222
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Gave you the opportunity

1223
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He said it

1224
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Instead of

1225
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Making me watch an episode

1226
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
My friend

1227
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Made me watch

1228
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The Rainbow Dash presents

1229
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The rainbow factory thing

1230
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And that

1231
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Made me

1232
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
More interested

1233
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
In the show

1234
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Is the rainbow factory

1235
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
What she calls her pussy?

1236
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Then the consecutive episodes

1237
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That I watched

1238
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Of my little pony afterwards

1239
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Because of the fact

1240
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That it was this

1241
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
20 minute

1242
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Production

1243
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Or is it her bottle?

1244
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
This 20 minutes

1245
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Why don't I fucking kill you?

1246
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Holy fucking shit

1247
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Slide show story

1248
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
About all this meta stuff

1249
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I wasn't able to follow

1250
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And I was like

1251
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Man

1252
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
If it's able to inspire

1253
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
In people

1254
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
This much effort

1255
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
For something they're not

1256
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Gonna make any money off of

1257
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It must be good

1258
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So it wasn't just advertising

1259
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It really sold me

1260
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
On the passion

1261
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That people had

1262
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You know what's interesting though

1263
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah

1264
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That's Sam's

1265
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Stronger than you parody

1266
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Last time I checked

1267
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Over 5 million views

1268
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And that's like

1269
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Only one of the variations

1270
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I think that's like

1271
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The animated one

1272
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I mean

1273
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
There's no way

1274
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
5 million people have played

1275
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Undertale right

1276
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
There's an entire subgenre

1277
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Of stronger than you

1278
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Mashup parodies

1279
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
With Undertale specifically

1280
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah

1281
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But like

1282
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The fan work

1283
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Has eclipsed the game

1284
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
At this point

1285
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Clearly

1286
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
There's no way 5 million people

1287
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Bought that game and played it

1288
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You are probably right

1289
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah

1290
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
A lot of them could be

1291
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Just rewatches as well

1292
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay true

1293
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
True

1294
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But I doubt even

1295
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
1 million people played

1296
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Wouldn't that be like

1297
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Crazy successful

1298
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I mean

1299
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Guy

1300
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah

1301
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I will agree with you

1302
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That there is probably

1303
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
A contingent

1304
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I don't know how large

1305
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm not complaining

1306
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
By the way

1307
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm just pointing it out

1308
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That do

1309
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Or at least

1310
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
That do

1311
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And or enjoy

1312
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Undertale fan shit

1313
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And haven't actually

1314
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Played Undertale

1315
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah

1316
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
There's probably

1317
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Quite a few

1318
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Just like there were people

1319
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
That did homestuck

1320
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Fan shit

1321
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And they never read

1322
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Homestuck

1323
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
True

1324
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I know

1325
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Those people have a

1326
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Slightly better excuse

1327
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Though

1328
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
No

1329
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
They should be

1330
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
In hell

1331
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Well okay

1332
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You can say they're

1333
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Equally bad

1334
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Sure

1335
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
On days like that

1336
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Guy

1337
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Kids like them

1338
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Should be burning

1339
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I think I've ever heard

1340
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So well done

1341
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Well done

1342
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Everyone else never

1343
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Say it again

1344
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's really annoying

1345
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So I mean

1346
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
We could now

1347
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Shift into

1348
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We've talked about that

1349
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
For a while

1350
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
How about we now complain

1351
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
About the other side

1352
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Receiving fan art

1353
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And how everyone's

1354
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Doing it wrong

1355
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Or not doing it enough

1356
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Let me tell you

1357
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Assholes

1358
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah

1359
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And I think

1360
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Mage can relate to this

1361
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
A story

1362
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I like

1363
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Doing fan art

1364
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And giving it to people

1365
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I have given a couple

1366
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Of favorite artists of mine

1367
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
On Twitter

1368
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Some fan art

1369
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh yes

1370
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And I have gotten

1371
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Like retweeted from them

1372
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And like

1373
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You know they've said

1374
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
They liked it and stuff

1375
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Which was very nice

1376
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Did the Lisa guy retweet

1377
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Your thing

1378
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yes

1379
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The guy who made

1380
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Lisa retweeted

1381
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
My picture

1382
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Who by the way

1383
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Is a Nordic god

1384
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
He's the most beautiful

1385
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Man in the world

1386
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And a karate master

1387
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That's right

1388
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But

1389
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah he retweeted it

1390
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And as well he should

1391
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Because that piece was

1392
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Fucking awesome

1393
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And it got like

1394
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Very good

1395
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Because I did one of her

1396
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Characters

1397
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I did one from

1398
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Katie Rice

1399
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I drew her characters

1400
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Camp we don't want you

1401
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Camp we don't want you

1402
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah

1403
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
From Katie

1404
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And

1405
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's

1406
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Nice

1407
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because being an artist

1408
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Myself

1409
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I know

1410
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That fan art

1411
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Of my own characters

1412
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Is the most precious thing

1413
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yeah

1414
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's the most valuable commodity

1415
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Other than money

1416
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And it's even pretty close

1417
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
To that

1418
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Because like

1419
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
That's how you know

1420
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
A thing is popular

1421
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That's the fan art of it

1422
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It inspires people

1423
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah

1424
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So if fan art of your stuff

1425
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Exists

1426
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And is being made

1427
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You need to fucking

1428
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Foster that

1429
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You need to like

1430
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You need to like

1431
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You know try and kindle that

1432
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Because that's

1433
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That's how

1434
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That's one of the ways

1435
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
By which you

1436
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Propagate

1437
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So

1438
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes

1439
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I made some

1440
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And gave it to people

1441
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Because I knew they would

1442
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Like it

1443
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Because I would

1444
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Like it

1445
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And it was true

1446
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Remember the time

1447
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Way back in the day

1448
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Ben

1449
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The first ever piece

1450
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Of fan art

1451
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That I put into that

1452
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Big intro

1453
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Celebrating it

1454
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's

1455
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's

1456
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That was a great

1457
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
A more innocent time

1458
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That was a great day

1459
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It was a great day

1460
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And then given of course

1461
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Put us into a video

1462
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I think shortly after that

1463
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Which was

1464
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That was probably a while later

1465
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Man

1466
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Man it feels good

1467
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
To be a

1468
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
YouTube gangster

1469
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Anyway David

1470
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What were you saying

1471
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Oh

1472
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I think that

1473
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
If the apocalypse happens

1474
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
If the apocalypse happens

1475
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
What if fan artists

1476
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Are

1477
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Fan arts like the

1478
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Like the most valued

1479
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Commodity

1480
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You can draw

1481
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Like a bottle caps and fallout

1482
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Or something

1483
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
DeVoo

1484
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah

1485
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
DeVoo have you played Lisa

1486
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Is that what happens in Lisa

1487
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
That happens in Lisa

1488
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
What

1489
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
There's

1490
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Because it's the post

1491
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Apocalypse

1492
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And all the women are dead

1493
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So porn

1494
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Becomes the most

1495
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Precious commodity

1496
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like porn

1497
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Is money

1498
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
In Lisa

1499
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Whoa it's awesome

1500
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yeah your money

1501
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Your money is mags

1502
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
As in nudie magazines

1503
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And you have to trade for them

1504
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah

1505
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But like

1506
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
One of your party members

1507
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Is this

1508
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
He's an artist

1509
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And just like

1510
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
He like

1511
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Draws porn

1512
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And that's

1513
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Oh man

1514
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
He's drawing money

1515
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Making it good living

1516
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah he prints money

1517
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Awesome

1518
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But he's actually a really shitty party member

1519
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And his design is really shitty

1520
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And Mary Sue

1521
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Well

1522
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Because he was a fan

1523
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
He was like a kickstarter reward

1524
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh really

1525
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Okay

1526
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Well that's

1527
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Oh that's a whole other subject

1528
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
We should probably get into

1529
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But anyway

1530
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah

1531
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We could do that

1532
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But what's that DeVoo

1533
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Kickstarter rewards

1534
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But the artist

1535
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Putting a fan made thing

1536
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Into the real thing

1537
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Okay man

1538
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I was watching this one

1539
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Undertale video

1540
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Wait

1541
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Muffet

1542
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Muffet's great

1543
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Wait are you saying Muffet

1544
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Was introduced outside

1545
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
By a

1546
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Well she's the objectively best character

1547
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
In this series

1548
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So obviously that redeems

1549
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The whole thing

1550
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Right guys shut up

1551
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Everyone

1552
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Explain what you mean

1553
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
What do you mean about Muffet

1554
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Well she was a

1555
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Kickstarter

1556
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Thing

1557
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Right it was like

1558
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
There'll be one

1559
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Kickstarter character

1560
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Made by a fan

1561
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Who can design her

1562
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Or it

1563
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
233

1564
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What no

1565
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
What a great

1566
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That was so sorry

1567
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
There was so sorry

1568
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What's his face in the

1569
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Flying thing

1570
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Oh yeah

1571
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And Muffet

1572
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Muffet was the best

1573
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The flying thing

1574
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Are you talking about

1575
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Sunderplane

1576
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
No no no

1577
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What flying thing

1578
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The other one

1579
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I forgot its name

1580
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Is he a boss

1581
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Like he's kinda hard to find

1582
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Sort of like

1583
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Is he a whale

1584
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah he's kinda like

1585
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
A flying whale thing

1586
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And he's like

1587
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I see

1588
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What

1589
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
He's pretending to be

1590
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Cool or whatever

1591
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't remember

1592
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Like Glide

1593
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I think

1594
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Geez I never found this guy

1595
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah he's

1596
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I've seen pictures of him

1597
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
He's encountered

1598
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Before Papyrus's battle

1599
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
In that

1600
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Area where

1601
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It was a locked door

1602
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah

1603
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
If you run around

1604
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
For a million years

1605
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You'll fight him

1606
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Which is what happened to me

1607
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Because I was trying to

1608
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Open that door

1609
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah and he's

1610
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Really hard as well

1611
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Holy shit

1612
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I've never seen this guy

1613
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Just looked him up

1614
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What the fuck

1615
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So Glide so sorry

1616
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And Muffet

1617
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Are rewards

1618
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And Muffet

1619
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I know for sure

1620
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That she was definitely a reward

1621
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Because she was

1622
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Designed by the artist

1623
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Who is making a comic

1624
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Called Avis Demon

1625
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm a fan of that comic as well

1626
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
She's a brilliant artist

1627
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Like her art

1628
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Is just wow

1629
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And how

1630
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Toby utilized

1631
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
What a mind blow

1632
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
The Muffet's design

1633
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Was pretty great

1634
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Because he

1635
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah with the whole

1636
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Spiders thing

1637
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
He created this whole

1638
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Subculture

1639
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Within the world

1640
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Which made it feel

1641
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Realistic man

1642
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That really makes me wonder

1643
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Whether she was

1644
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Designed before the demo

1645
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Because even in the demo

1646
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
There were the

1647
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Spiders in the bake sale

1648
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I see

1649
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So maybe she was

1650
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Trying to extrapolate

1651
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Off of that

1652
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
She was like

1653
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Ooh I'll make a spider

1654
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And then Toby realized

1655
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Ooh I could have a payoff

1656
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
To this whole spider situation

1657
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Maybe they work together

1658
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
That's a genius

1659
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Like I always thought

1660
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It was kind of funny

1661
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That I mean

1662
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Muffet really kind of

1663
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Comes out of nowhere

1664
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
She's in the middle of

1665
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Hotland

1666
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Like right in between

1667
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Like the mediton sections

1668
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Not only there for like

1669
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
A brief time

1670
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And that's like

1671
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
One of my favorite parts

1672
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
In the whole game

1673
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But man

1674
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Like all the work

1675
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
He put into that

1676
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Jesus Christ

1677
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Did this person pay

1678
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
For like a boss fight

1679
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And a character

1680
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Like and

1681
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Ties to the story

1682
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Jesus that's

1683
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That's a lot of shit

1684
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And anyway

1685
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It doesn't matter

1686
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Well I mean so sorry

1687
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Has a boss fight

1688
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Right

1689
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And his own little

1690
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Area

1691
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And his own little like

1692
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I don't know

1693
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Coated into the game

1694
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But he's like

1695
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Hidden away

1696
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah

1697
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So

1698
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Okay so of those

1699
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Glyde looks cool

1700
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Muffet is the best character

1701
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And so sorry

1702
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Is the worst thing

1703
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That's ever happened

1704
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh each shit

1705
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Each shit guy

1706
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So sorry he's fine

1707
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
He's fine

1708
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I mean look at

1709
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
He's like the butter dragon

1710
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You ever go look at this guy's art

1711
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah so fucking what

1712
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So he's ugly

1713
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And whatever

1714
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
He's a nightmare

1715
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
He looks like

1716
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Like a rejected Barney character

1717
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
He's a fucking comedy

1718
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Character you piece of shit

1719
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Well

1720
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm laughing

1721
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Guys

1722
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Guys

1723
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Design aside

1724
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I actually found his battle

1725
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Sort of annoying

1726
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Like his personality

1727
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Or attitude

1728
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Or whatever you call it

1729
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I mean yeah

1730
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's a little annoying

1731
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah I mean he's a dick

1732
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Whatever

1733
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I like him

1734
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Like a fucking chud

1735
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm not even

1736
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I agree with you Ben

1737
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Like I think he's a good addition

1738
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
To the game

1739
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I thought he was funny

1740
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And I enjoy you know

1741
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Treating him like the garbage

1742
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That he is

1743
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And I absolutely love

1744
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That you can murder him

1745
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And Sam says

1746
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You didn't kill anyone important

1747
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
That's not true

1748
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And you can still get true pacimist

1749
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's not true

1750
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
What?

1751
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Yes it is

1752
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
No you didn't

1753
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't believe you

1754
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't believe you

1755
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
How do you know

1756
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Okay well I've just

1757
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I just

1758
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You've heard it?

1759
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I was reading on Reddit

1760
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Someone tested it and said it wasn't true

1761
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm gonna go look this up

1762
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That would be really stupid

1763
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
If that was true

1764
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
No it would be hilarious

1765
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I would love it

1766
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It would really

1767
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
There's more homework for you

1768
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
For Undertale

1769
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Find Glide

1770
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And then test this thing

1771
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I will

1772
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I will

1773
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
General Toby's done a good job

1774
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Handling fan stuff

1775
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
By like sanctioning official albums

1776
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Like Live at Grillby's

1777
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And the other metal one

1778
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You know

1779
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah that's cool

1780
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
If you can like review and be like

1781
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's what I would do

1782
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
If I had created a thing

1783
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That had like a huge fandom around it

1784
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
A lot of like

1785
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You know fan theories

1786
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And fan cannons

1787
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I would just go around

1788
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
With my cannon stamp

1789
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And I would find the things I like

1790
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And go yeah

1791
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
That's cannon

1792
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
That's cannon

1793
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That sucks

1794
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
That's cannon

1795
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
If that happened to you Jesse

1796
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
If you had

1797
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
If you were in that position

1798
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Well no one's in a position

1799
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
To do that to Jesse's shit

1800
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Okay okay listen

1801
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That is the game space funeral

1802
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
By the catamites

1803
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That guy actually kind of did that

1804
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But it's hard to take seriously

1805
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Because someone made a space funeral too

1806
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And it wasn't that great

1807
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But I mean it was a thing

1808
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And just in an interview

1809
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Someone asked him like

1810
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Do you know about space funeral too

1811
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And he was like

1812
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Oh yeah sure

1813
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It was alright

1814
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's cannon

1815
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Ah Jesus

1816
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
What a hero

1817
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And so now it's technically cannon

1818
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Because he said so one time

1819
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yeah it's like what

1820
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
With the DBZ guy

1821
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
A curatorium

1822
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's like what he's doing with DBZ now

1823
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Like for a while he was just like

1824
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah all these things are cannon

1825
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And like what he's doing now

1826
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
With Dragon Ball Super whatever

1827
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
He made like

1828
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
He made like the strongest person

1829
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
In the universe

1830
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Like this weird little dude

1831
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
With like these giant nipples

1832
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
He is like canonically

1833
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
The strongest man

1834
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
In I think every universe

1835
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That exists

1836
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And it's like

1837
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
How seriously are we going to take

1838
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
What a curatorium has said at this point

1839
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's been like 30 years

1840
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Another cannon

1841
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
See still

1842
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah

1843
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Another cannon that's very big

1844
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Very pervasive

1845
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Pockabell's cannon

1846
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Indeed

1847
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That's in all these different songs

1848
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That's true

1849
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And that guy

1850
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I gotta say the fandom around that

1851
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Is really out of control

1852
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And it's time for a change

1853
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah

1854
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah

1855
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
We've just been rehashing

1856
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And rehashing it

1857
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Since like 1640 whatever

1858
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Should we get back to the topic

1859
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Of receiving fan art?

1860
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Yes please

1861
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Sure whatever

1862
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Way off for a minute there

1863
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's fine

1864
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Maze you've gotten fan art right?

1865
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
11 pages on DeviantArt

1866
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Yes

1867
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Of your characters

1868
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah

1869
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
In my

1870
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Favorites folder

1871
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What do you think make

1872
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I was going to say

1873
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
What makes good fan art

1874
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
To you

1875
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
To receive versus bad

1876
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I appreciate all fan art honestly

1877
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Like

1878
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Whatever the quality

1879
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You might think it is

1880
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's okay

1881
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You can tell them their shit

1882
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
No

1883
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
People take time

1884
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Out of their day

1885
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
To draw something

1886
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Specifically for me

1887
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So I'm going to take time

1888
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Out of my day

1889
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
To favorite and leave a comment

1890
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Whenever I can

1891
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Maze you're a big person

1892
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
They're little people

1893
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
They don't matter

1894
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Oh that's not nice

1895
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Okay

1896
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Okay

1897
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Well I will say

1898
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
One thing

1899
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah I mean I agree

1900
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That I appreciate all fan art

1901
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Because it is a person

1902
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Taking time

1903
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
To show appreciation

1904
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
For what you do

1905
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And that's great

1906
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
But

1907
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I don't care

1908
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
For the ones

1909
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
That are just trying

1910
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
To look like the original

1911
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Dude

1912
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The t-bap fan art

1913
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That tried to copy your style

1914
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
A lot of the t-bap fan art

1915
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Looked as though

1916
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It was traced

1917
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Like right off the screen

1918
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And it's like

1919
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah okay

1920
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Thanks for the fan art

1921
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
But you haven't really

1922
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Added anything

1923
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Or given like

1924
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Your own interpretation

1925
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Of it

1926
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Even if you can't draw

1927
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
At all

1928
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I would still rather see

1929
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You just like

1930
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Try to draw

1931
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Fucking my characters

1932
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Or whatever

1933
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Just however you would draw

1934
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Like

1935
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Why did it take

1936
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Why did it take like

1937
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Three years

1938
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
For someone to like

1939
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Draw

1940
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Like someone made a keg

1941
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Standard

1942
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Like normal

1943
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Like he looked like

1944
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
He was in the show

1945
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And I still haven't seen

1946
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
A phantom horn one

1947
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Anywhere

1948
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Like if it was me

1949
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'd think that'd be

1950
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Like the first thing

1951
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That I'd want to do

1952
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Like he's a pony man

1953
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
He's in the

1954
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Whatever

1955
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Just draw him that way

1956
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You know

1957
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's like

1958
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Why is everybody

1959
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Drawn

1960
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
They always draw us

1961
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
In groups

1962
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Like with our

1963
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I agree

1964
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah

1965
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I agree

1966
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
If you're going to draw ponies

1967
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
With big sparkly pony eyes

1968
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Just give them all

1969
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Fucking big sparkly pony eyes

1970
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
If you want to draw them

1971
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
With tiny little

1972
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Gross beady teabap eyes

1973
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Give everyone like that

1974
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You know who I blame for this problem

1975
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Just draw all eyes

1976
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The way you draw eyes

1977
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I blame Dr. Wolfe for this problem

1978
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Because he's got his

1979
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Bizarre weird OC

1980
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
That doesn't even make sense

1981
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And everyone's like

1982
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Oh we have to

1983
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
We have to just use

1984
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The style of the art

1985
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And put it in there

1986
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Dr. Wolfe can go to hell

1987
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And don't ever mention his name

1988
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I don't ever

1989
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Fucking say that name

1990
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Or any name

1991
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Don't ever say any name

1992
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
In my presence again

1993
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Okay

1994
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Okay

1995
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Coming back to what Ben

1996
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Originally said

1997
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Yes

1998
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
About you know

1999
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Tracing art and trying to

2000
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Make it look like original

2001
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah I agree with you

2002
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I have seen people just

2003
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Sort of like

2004
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Or take my original images

2005
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And just sort of like

2006
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Doodle on them

2007
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Or add some text or whatever

2008
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Make them into like

2009
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
A collage or something

2010
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah

2011
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It's not

2012
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I mean

2013
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay you wanted to do

2014
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Something and you're

2015
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Very good at art

2016
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And okay I appreciate the effort

2017
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But at the same time

2018
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I prefer whatever you can do

2019
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
To love to you

2020
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Right

2021
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Copy pasting my work

2022
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah

2023
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's kind of like

2024
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
The illustration equivalent

2025
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Of like

2026
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Like a knock off YouTuber

2027
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Like the angry video game

2028
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Nerd knock offs

2029
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Being like the waging

2030
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I don't know

2031
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Whatever

2032
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Because I've seen guys

2033
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
On YouTube

2034
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
A couple guys actually

2035
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Who you know

2036
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Are like

2037
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Openly proudly inspired

2038
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
By me

2039
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And I watch their videos

2040
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But it's like

2041
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
At the point where

2042
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
They're just like

2043
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Stealing my jokes verbatim

2044
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah

2045
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And it's like

2046
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I saw that one guy

2047
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
You showed me

2048
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
That was just

2049
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Your video

2050
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's cool that you're

2051
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Inspired by me

2052
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But this is literally

2053
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
A worse version of my video

2054
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yeah

2055
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I'll kill you

2056
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
The inspiration and

2057
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Stealing work

2058
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Is two different things

2059
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Hey

2060
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I mean

2061
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
If it's for fan art

2062
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Then I would never call

2063
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It stealing

2064
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
No matter how boldly

2065
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
They've

2066
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You know

2067
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You know

2068
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You mentioned

2069
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
James Rawl

2070
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You mentioned the angry nerd

2071
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And

2072
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
He blinded me back

2073
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
When I was first

2074
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Getting into the nerd

2075
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Way back then

2076
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I looked at the fan art

2077
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
What bothered me

2078
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Is that almost

2079
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
None of the fan art

2080
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Looks like his face

2081
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Almost none of the

2082
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The eyes

2083
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Or the noses

2084
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Or the mouths

2085
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Really looks like

2086
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
An abstraction

2087
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Of what James Rawl

2088
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Had

2089
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
There was a guy

2090
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Who did

2091
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You know

2092
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
As we mentioned

2093
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Fan art of all of us

2094
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And you know

2095
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It was cool looking

2096
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But almost none of it

2097
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Really like

2098
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Captured our facial features

2099
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
All that much

2100
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I don't understand

2101
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Picture perfect

2102
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Or even

2103
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Almost unrealistic

2104
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I think when it's

2105
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
A real life person

2106
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And you're going for

2107
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
A somewhat

2108
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Depending on how

2109
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Realistic you are

2110
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Just look at your icon

2111
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Right now

2112
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm looking at it

2113
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Right now

2114
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It doesn't look

2115
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Anything like you

2116
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And I appreciate it

2117
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I agree

2118
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I'm not saying

2119
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
This is like

2120
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
A required thing

2121
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I just wish

2122
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It would happen

2123
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Sometimes

2124
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Or

2125
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Let me put it this way

2126
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
If you're going to make

2127
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Like

2128
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
A more abstract

2129
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
All of those little

2130
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Squiggly details he has

2131
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Will be some sort of representation

2132
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Of our facial features

2133
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You know

2134
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I guess

2135
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Look at Maze

2136
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Maze doesn't look like her thing

2137
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
She's got like an established

2138
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Character now

2139
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
That like is her face

2140
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And it's you know

2141
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yes it's me

2142
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That's draw me

2143
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
As a purple anime girl

2144
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Nothing else

2145
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah

2146
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And you know

2147
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
This reminds me real quick

2148
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Speaking of fan art

2149
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And the angry video game nerd

2150
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Did you guys ever see

2151
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That

2152
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I forget what anime it was

2153
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But like in a real anime

2154
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Some background extras

2155
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Were with the video game nerd

2156
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And the nostalgia critic were

2157
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
In an anime

2158
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Like in some big show

2159
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah

2160
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
They were actually

2161
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Acting in the background

2162
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Drawn in some show

2163
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And in James Rolton

2164
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
John Walker

2165
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Made a fan

2166
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Recreation of that

2167
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
They did a fan recreation

2168
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Of that by

2169
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Re-staging it

2170
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Which is just like what we did

2171
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
When or most

2172
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Some of us here

2173
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
When someone did that fan art

2174
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Of give and take

2175
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Never give up

2176
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And we recreated that

2177
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
At BronyCon last year

2178
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Which was

2179
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Never give up

2180
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Never give up

2181
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
That's right

2182
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Good times

2183
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The best

2184
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Um

2185
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I

2186
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Okay

2187
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Those

2188
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
No those fan arts

2189
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Someone did of the procrastinators

2190
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yeah

2191
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Mine looked like absolute ass

2192
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And I hated it

2193
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Sure

2194
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
My face was the most

2195
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Like it was totally

2196
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Like warped and disgusting

2197
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Get it together

2198
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Whoever you are

2199
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yeah

2200
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Let's talk about

2201
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Crappy fan art

2202
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Of us

2203
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And how much it

2204
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Anchors you

2205
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
No I was wearing glasses

2206
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And I had a little heart

2207
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Tattoo on my neck

2208
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah

2209
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Which was cool

2210
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That was cool

2211
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But you can find it

2212
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
On the procrastinators

2213
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah

2214
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
The reddit

2215
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The subreddit

2216
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
We'll show you

2217
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
We'll show you

2218
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You can go there

2219
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
God damn it

2220
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Click in the link in the description

2221
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Shut up guy

2222
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Fuck's sake

2223
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Alright

2224
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah Jesse

2225
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Let's talk about

2226
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Shit fan art

2227
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I love getting fan art

2228
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Of all kinds

2229
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I think it's the best thing

2230
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's the thing from the fans

2231
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That I respect the most

2232
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I respect it infinitely

2233
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
More than some

2234
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Shitty, worthless

2235
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Pissant

2236
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
YouTube comment

2237
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
That took you half a second

2238
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
To fucking crap out of

2239
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Your shitty brain

2240
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah

2241
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
If someone actually takes a time

2242
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
To draw something

2243
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Or make something

2244
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
That makes me feel good

2245
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And a lot of it's really good

2246
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But what I don't like

2247
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Is the ones

2248
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
The guys who like

2249
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Make it crappy on purpose

2250
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Just be like

2251
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Hey you crappy fan art

2252
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That's not fun for anyone

2253
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Jesse

2254
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Get out of here

2255
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
You're one to fucking talk

2256
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Look at your fucking

2257
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
YouTube thumbnails

2258
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
What are you talking about

2259
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Look at your fucking

2260
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Horse cast

2261
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
YouTube thumbnails

2262
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
That's the very definition

2263
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Of crappy on purpose

2264
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Whoa whoa whoa

2265
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Whoa

2266
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
My

2267
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
MS Paint

2268
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Masterpieces

2269
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Thumbnail drawings

2270
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Are goddamn masterpieces

2271
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
They're 10 out of 10s

2272
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
How dare you

2273
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Insinuate that they're anything

2274
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Less than perfect

2275
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
That they're flawed in any way

2276
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
They capture our spirit

2277
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
They capture our essence

2278
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yeah

2279
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I don't know man

2280
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I think they're just trying to go for

2281
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I think they're

2282
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Maybe they're just trying to go

2283
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
For that same sort of appeal

2284
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You know

2285
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I can guarantee you

2286
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I can guarantee you

2287
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That I am legitimately

2288
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Putting my all

2289
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And giving the maximum amount

2290
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Of effort when I draw those

2291
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Well if it's all the same

2292
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
To the person seeing it

2293
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
On the other end

2294
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Whether you put your all

2295
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Or not right

2296
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yeah

2297
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It's great

2298
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
10 out of 10

2299
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And you guy

2300
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Let's not even talk about

2301
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Your art

2302
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'm proud to be the worst

2303
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Artist that I know

2304
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I wear it on my sleeve

2305
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
As armor

2306
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So that it can never be used

2307
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
To hurt me

2308
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah that's right

2309
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
You piece of shit

2310
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It depends on the context

2311
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
As you go

2312
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And I have no interest

2313
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
In getting any better ever

2314
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Now that I've discovered

2315
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
That I can pay people

2316
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
To draw things for me

2317
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I have no incentive

2318
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
To get better

2319
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It's the best possible timeline

2320
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Oh yeah

2321
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Well there's a commission

2322
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
In my armor

2323
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Because Ben has hurt me

2324
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Let's talk about commissions

2325
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yes

2326
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yes

2327
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Podcast successful

2328
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
If I get into being

2329
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
A person with a lot of money

2330
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I would just be commissioning people

2331
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
To make fan stuff

2332
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That I want to see

2333
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
All the time

2334
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
No dude

2335
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
No dude

2336
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Listen

2337
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I could never pay someone

2338
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
To do art for me

2339
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Because it wouldn't look

2340
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
The way it did in my head

2341
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Sure

2342
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I have to do it

2343
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
My way

2344
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I know what you mean

2345
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah well I can't

2346
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I can't do drawing

2347
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So I can compromise on this

2348
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Wait mate you do agree with me

2349
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Or you don't

2350
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I agree with you

2351
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Like I cannot

2352
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Like pay people to do

2353
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Like commissions for

2354
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Like I cannot

2355
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Commission people

2356
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
To do art for me

2357
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Because like for me

2358
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I have this horrible thing

2359
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
About like

2360
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
If it can be drawn

2361
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I might as well draw it myself

2362
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Well of course you guys

2363
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Can draw

2364
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You guys have that ability

2365
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
No shut up Davoo

2366
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm gonna kill you for saying that

2367
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And here's why

2368
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Because all of my drawings

2369
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Look like shit when I start them

2370
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And I just fucking

2371
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Keep changing them

2372
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Until they look good

2373
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So all anyone

2374
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
In the whole world

2375
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Has to do

2376
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Is just draw a shitty drawing

2377
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And then just keep redoing them

2378
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Until

2379
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Okay that's all I do

2380
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm sick and tired

2381
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Anyone can do it themselves

2382
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm sick and tired

2383
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Of this professional illustrator

2384
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Elitism

2385
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Fucking looking down

2386
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
On people this pompous attitude of

2387
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Oh shut up

2388
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
You can learn to draw

2389
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Anyone can learn to

2390
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Fuck you

2391
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I've tried motherfucker

2392
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I can't

2393
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It's impossible

2394
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Ben is absolutely right

2395
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Quit kind of sending to me

2396
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Anyone can learn to draw

2397
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Anyone can do it

2398
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
The thing is

2399
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I don't want to

2400
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I don't want to take five years

2401
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
To learn how to draw

2402
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Because I need a picture

2403
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
For my video next week

2404
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Here's the thing

2405
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yeah Ben I totally agree

2406
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I totally agree

2407
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I don't have time for that shit

2408
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I could just pay someone

2409
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
You just redo it

2410
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Over and over again

2411
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And eventually it becomes good

2412
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I do not have the technical know how

2413
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Listen

2414
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I can't do that

2415
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But it will take me

2416
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Ten times as long

2417
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
As it will take you

2418
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And you'll be glad

2419
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And you'll be glad

2420
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
For the experience

2421
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
No I'd be glad to

2422
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Pay money to save myself the time

2423
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So I can be working on my video

2424
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And editing it

2425
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Guys

2426
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Do the things

2427
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
That you are better at

2428
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And pay for

2429
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Davoose

2430
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Alright Davoose

2431
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Enough

2432
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Okay

2433
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Paying for commissions is fine

2434
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Like guys

2435
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I am going to open commissions soon

2436
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So yes please do pay me for commissions

2437
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Everybody pay me

2438
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oh shit

2439
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
She's got skin in the game

2440
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
She's got skin in the game

2441
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It's an important thing

2442
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I'm going to do that too

2443
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So forget everything I just said

2444
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
But the thing is

2445
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Like you can learn how to draw

2446
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Like there's a certain amount of hours

2447
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You have to

2448
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Have been drawing

2449
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
In your life

2450
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I think there's

2451
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
There's some sort of rule

2452
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Somewhere this is

2453
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Like oh

2454
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
If you had drawn

2455
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
This many thousand hours in your life

2456
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And you should be okay at art

2457
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Guess what

2458
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
We only have so many hours

2459
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Into something new

2460
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
We only have so many hours

2461
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
In our life

2462
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Before we potentially die

2463
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
We have to choose

2464
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
What's true

2465
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
To go for

2466
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I don't understand

2467
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
So like

2468
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You know

2469
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
It's never too late

2470
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
To learn to draw

2471
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But you have to

2472
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's too late to care

2473
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
If you're a high school kid

2474
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And you just

2475
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You're not doing anything

2476
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Particularly important with your life

2477
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And you want to learn to draw

2478
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Then you should absolutely do it

2479
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
But

2480
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
You know

2481
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Our video creators first and foremost

2482
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And that's what we focus our time on

2483
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And that's what we have interest in

2484
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Perfectly

2485
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Like I was a terrible video editor

2486
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
What three years ago when I started

2487
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But I've just done it

2488
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
For millions of hours now

2489
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And I'm decent

2490
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm okay

2491
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So I assume it's the same with art

2492
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The whole point of society

2493
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Is that you pay

2494
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And how all you genius illustrators

2495
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Are with your art

2496
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
How you said

2497
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
That you

2498
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Are saying it was such a scorn

2499
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
You genius illustrators

2500
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
How you said that

2501
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Like you can't commission

2502
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Someone to draw something

2503
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
That's how I am with editing

2504
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I can't commission someone to edit

2505
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
For me

2506
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That's exactly right

2507
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
My videos could never be made

2508
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'll commission a guy to draw for me any day

2509
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Because

2510
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Fucking make it look pretty

2511
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Make me look pretty

2512
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
The whole point of paying people money

2513
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
For anything ever

2514
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Is that they can do it better than you can

2515
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You could grow and cultivate

2516
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
All your own food

2517
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
But it's a lot easier

2518
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
To just pay for it

2519
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
To be off a shelf

2520
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Right

2521
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Specialization is the nature of capitalism

2522
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Right

2523
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I can respect that

2524
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
But whatever

2525
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Like if you were making like

2526
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
If you were the angry video game nerd

2527
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And you had like a million subscribers

2528
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And you're like

2529
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Okay, time to make a new video

2530
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I'm gonna do every single piece of it

2531
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It's not feasible

2532
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's not smart

2533
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You gotta break that shit up

2534
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I feel like I had something else to say

2535
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
On the subject of

2536
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I don't know

2537
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Drawing

2538
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Or

2539
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Commissioning

2540
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Or

2541
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Fan art

2542
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Or whatever it is we're talking about here

2543
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
On the Procast Nudist podcast

2544
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Every weekend or so

2545
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah, I don't know

2546
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But really honestly

2547
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
The worst sin

2548
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
A fan artist

2549
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
At all

2550
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Can commit

2551
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Is not

2552
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Drawing

2553
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Best guy ever

2554
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Fan art

2555
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Get out there people

2556
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Get out there on your tablets

2557
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And your gay little notebooks

2558
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Do whatever you gotta do

2559
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
To draw fan art of me

2560
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And my cool waifus

2561
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I'll have it a great time

2562
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Because if you don't make it real

2563
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It will never be real

2564
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So live your dreams

2565
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And live my dreams

2566
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Okay, while I can respect the attitude

2567
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Of like

2568
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh, it's easier to just pay someone to draw it

2569
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I can understand that

2570
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And that attitude is what keeps me

2571
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Alive

2572
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And in business

2573
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Kind of

2574
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So that's fine

2575
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
But

2576
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
On the other hand

2577
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I kind of hate that attitude

2578
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Because

2579
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I really like it

2580
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
When people that don't know how to draw

2581
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And are bad at drawing

2582
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Nevertheless

2583
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Like put forth a sincere effort

2584
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And produce an image

2585
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
That just to get across

2586
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Their idea

2587
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Like

2588
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I think

2589
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Like I was reading this comic

2590
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
The other day

2591
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Called Skuzzy

2592
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And it was about like

2593
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Some kids that wake up as zombies

2594
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And it sounds stupid, right?

2595
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But it's

2596
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Drawn

2597
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
In this really like

2598
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Child-like way

2599
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Everything's all like

2600
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Real simple

2601
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Like blocky shapes

2602
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And like

2603
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Everything's all colored

2604
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And like

2605
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Flat colors

2606
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Like the characters are just purple

2607
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And their teachers are yellow

2608
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yeah?

2609
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Have you all seen

2610
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
The original One Punch Man

2611
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Webcom?

2612
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Yes

2613
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Ah, that's a good example

2614
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I guess of what you're saying

2615
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Yes, I have

2616
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah, it's got really

2617
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Really basic shitty art

2618
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah, so

2619
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It's really rough

2620
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Look at the brick into that

2621
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And even

2622
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Attack on Titan

2623
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
At the beginning

2624
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Kind of is shitty

2625
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It's still a shitty

2626
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
It's too shitty

2627
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
To be published

2628
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
As it was

2629
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I don't know how it got through

2630
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Their approval process

2631
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But it did somehow

2632
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
And it was popular

2633
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Okay, okay

2634
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Forget about

2635
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
The actual

2636
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Attack on Titan manga

2637
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah

2638
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
If you ever saw

2639
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Like

2640
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
The manga

2641
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
That he did before

2642
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Attack on Titan

2643
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
That he submitted to some

2644
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Like shitty little

2645
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Rinky Dink contest

2646
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It is so bad

2647
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Every bit

2648
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Of that like

2649
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Proto

2650
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Attack on Titan manga

2651
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yeah

2652
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Is worse

2653
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Than the worst panel

2654
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Of the original

2655
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
One Punch manga

2656
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And there's some pretty bad ones

2657
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It is like

2658
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Fucking a child's scribbling

2659
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
How the fuck did he win?

2660
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I don't know if he won

2661
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I'd like that he just lost

2662
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Or maybe it was just

2663
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
A really bad contest

2664
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't know

2665
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Well, that's fascinating

2666
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Maybe they lack the idea

2667
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Of the story

2668
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And not just the art

2669
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Okay, but you're making

2670
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
A comic for Christ's sake

2671
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
You're not making

2672
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
A book

2673
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Although the story

2674
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Was way more basic

2675
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Than Attack on Titan

2676
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
It's just like

2677
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
A guy comes to town

2678
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And there's like

2679
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
A monster

2680
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It was a genetically

2681
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Engineered monster

2682
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Luckily I too

2683
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Am a genetically

2684
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Engineered monster

2685
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And he gets big

2686
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And fights it

2687
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And that's it

2688
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
That's the whole story

2689
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yeah

2690
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That's the end

2691
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Of really shitty comics

2692
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Becoming popular

2693
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
One Punch Man is

2694
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Legitimately great

2695
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And deserves it

2696
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
They're not shitty

2697
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Just because they have

2698
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Rough art

2699
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
They're really like

2700
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Scuzzy

2701
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I really like

2702
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
The original

2703
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
One Punch Man

2704
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I really like

2705
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Just fucking

2706
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Garbage made by

2707
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Assholes

2708
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
But when you compare that

2709
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
To like

2710
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
The new version of

2711
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
One Punch Man

2712
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's pretty much

2713
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Better in every way

2714
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I don't care

2715
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I like

2716
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
The original

2717
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Remakes should all

2718
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Burn

2719
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I mean

2720
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I agree

2721
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I've been watching the show

2722
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And I keep thinking

2723
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
The whole

2724
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Part of the integral

2725
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
To the joke

2726
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
To the reason it's funny

2727
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And amusing

2728
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Is that it looks amazing

2729
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
But it's

2730
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Silly what's happening

2731
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
But it looks amazing

2732
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Similarly to

2733
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
That is true

2734
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
That is a unique joke

2735
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
How weird Al

2736
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
His entire comedy

2737
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Requires

2738
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
His incredible production

2739
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Value

2740
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That's true

2741
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Because

2742
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It becomes

2743
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
As valid

2744
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
As the original

2745
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Song that was made

2746
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
If not even

2747
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Better produced

2748
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
As it is sometimes

2749
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
That is integral

2750
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
To why it's funny

2751
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You know

2752
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
My favorite image

2753
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
That proves that point

2754
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I think

2755
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Is when you see

2756
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
King

2757
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Like there's a couple

2758
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Panels

2759
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
That are these

2760
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Massive close-ups

2761
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Of King's face

2762
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And King's whole deal

2763
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Is that he has just

2764
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Intimidated people

2765
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
With his scary face

2766
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And everyone thinks

2767
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
That he's super strong

2768
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And you know

2769
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
As it turns out

2770
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
That's not the case

2771
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And like

2772
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
The super good

2773
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Detailed like

2774
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Intimidating glare

2775
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Is what like

2776
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
The people in the story

2777
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Are experiencing

2778
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And with shitty art

2779
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
That would not be conveyed

2780
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Anywhere nearly as well

2781
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And makes the joke so much funnier

2782
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
When you find out

2783
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Oh

2784
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It's fucking

2785
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's fucking not true

2786
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
It's fucking baloney

2787
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Yeah

2788
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So that's a unique thing

2789
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
To the

2790
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Enhanced version

2791
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I want

2792
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I just really want

2793
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
To reiterate

2794
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
That I think that

2795
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
People

2796
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
That can't draw at all

2797
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Honestly

2798
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Sometimes I think

2799
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
That makes their art

2800
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
More interesting

2801
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Like if you put forth

2802
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Like a sincere effort

2803
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Like the guy who

2804
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Poo-pooed on my

2805
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
M.S. paint drawings

2806
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
No

2807
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I was just about to say

2808
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Now I see

2809
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Your true

2810
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Hypocritical colors

2811
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Where's my

2812
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Hypocritical colors?

2813
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I was just about to say

2814
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
That if someone like

2815
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I mean

2816
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I would say like

2817
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Davoo

2818
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You have like

2819
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You're not a great artist

2820
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Or anything

2821
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
But you do have like

2822
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
A very like

2823
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Kind of

2824
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Unique aesthetic

2825
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And everything

2826
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
That you do draw

2827
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And the same is kind

2828
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Of true of Digi

2829
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Digi has this weird

2830
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Like scratchy

2831
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I would really like

2832
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
To see more art

2833
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
By people like that

2834
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah

2835
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Like my art

2836
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I do make sure

2837
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Whatever I

2838
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Because I always draw

2839
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Something for the purpose

2840
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Of something else

2841
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
That needs to like

2842
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Convey something visually

2843
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Or I'm making it

2844
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
For a thumbnail

2845
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So I always have a clear idea

2846
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And I'm usually

2847
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Able to square it in on

2848
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
At least accomplishing

2849
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
The goal that

2850
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It was intended for

2851
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Even if it otherwise

2852
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Sucks

2853
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But what about

2854
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Like you drew that little face

2855
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That little face

2856
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
With just like this

2857
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Gross little thumbs up

2858
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Just kind of sticking

2859
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Out of the side

2860
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Like

2861
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I almost made that

2862
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
My thumbnail

2863
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And I love how

2864
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Polarizing it was

2865
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Like people either thought

2866
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
That was amazing

2867
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Or horrifying

2868
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And they never wanted to see it

2869
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I know you were torn up

2870
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
About whether

2871
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
To use it or not

2872
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah

2873
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Until eventually someone

2874
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Came around with one

2875
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
That I thought was basically

2876
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Perfect which is what

2877
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I'm using now

2878
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
So Ben are you saying

2879
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
That guys like me and Jesse

2880
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
On further down

2881
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
On the artistically competent

2882
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Spectrum if you will

2883
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
On the artistism spectrum

2884
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah that's right

2885
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Our shitty art has value

2886
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Because it's shitty

2887
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It's an artistic representation

2888
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Of ourselves

2889
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Someone just drawing

2890
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Like what's in their mind

2891
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Even if they have

2892
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Without any technique at all

2893
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Can sometimes convey something

2894
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That you wouldn't get

2895
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
From like a very practiced

2896
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And like skilled artists

2897
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Like on this very podcast

2898
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
On the Steven Universe episode

2899
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Episode three I think

2900
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
My Mexican cherry opal

2901
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I think was his name

2902
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yeah Mexican cherry opal

2903
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That's true

2904
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
He was a masterpiece

2905
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
That's no doubt

2906
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And you know

2907
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Talking about Digi

2908
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Because way back in his

2909
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Some of his earliest pony videos

2910
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
He drew this character

2911
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
This really weird looking

2912
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Terribly drawn character

2913
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
The gray thing with the white hair

2914
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah and then recently

2915
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
In one of his asterisk videos

2916
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
He makes a reference

2917
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I saw you put it in there

2918
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
He makes a reference

2919
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
When he said who am I

2920
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
To complain about characters

2921
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Design

2922
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah what would I know

2923
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
About character design

2924
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And I decided to draw

2925
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
A fan art of that character

2926
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
That would be making

2927
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
A specific pose

2928
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
That would fit

2929
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And so in the process

2930
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Of drawing that

2931
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I realized

2932
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Whoa this is actually

2933
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
An interesting design

2934
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's just terribly drawn

2935
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
But it's a kind of

2936
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Interesting character

2937
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
That I've never seen before

2938
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Especially the color palette

2939
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
So yeah

2940
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Yeah that's true

2941
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
When he does draw things

2942
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
They end up looking really weird

2943
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
But in a way that I kind of like

2944
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah like when we did

2945
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
The comic jam

2946
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I remember thinking

2947
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The art was very interesting

2948
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
It was one of the most interesting

2949
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Along with like

2950
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah like there's

2951
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
One of like

2952
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Just like a close up

2953
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Picture of a pony

2954
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Like screaming

2955
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Yeah that's right

2956
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And it's really

2957
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Spooky looking

2958
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I think Digi in general

2959
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Is a guy who is

2960
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Who is able to

2961
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Really really really

2962
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Think about

2963
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
What he likes aesthetically

2964
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Like he has very specific

2965
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And detailed ideas

2966
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Of what looks good

2967
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Yeah

2968
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
But not a whole lot

2969
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Of skill in explaining it

2970
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
All the time

2971
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And obviously almost

2972
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
No skill in recreating it

2973
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
See that's my problem

2974
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm not

2975
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I'm a shitty artist

2976
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Because I can't visualize

2977
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
What I want something to be

2978
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And then convey it

2979
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
In my pen

2980
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And a lot of the times

2981
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I'll have ideas

2982
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Of what I want to do

2983
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And it just

2984
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It won't come out

2985
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
It will not come out

2986
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Anywhere close to

2987
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
How I'm envisioning it

2988
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
What

2989
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
What can you do about that

2990
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
What can be done

2991
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Because when I was drawing

2992
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
That fan art of that character

2993
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Of his

2994
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I was really looking at it

2995
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
More closely

2996
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And I was imitating

2997
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Some of the

2998
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Crappy drawing

2999
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Like

3000
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Like inking methods

3001
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
That he was using

3002
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Where he would

3003
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Draw some of the hair

3004
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And then use the erase tool

3005
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
To make different threads

3006
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Of the hair

3007
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I was like whoa

3008
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So

3009
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
His lack of skill

3010
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Created like a unique

3011
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Look

3012
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
That's kind of how I did the hair

3013
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
On my latest picture

3014
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
On my Twitter

3015
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's also ugly

3016
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Everyone go follow me

3017
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Well I mean

3018
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
He would use a pretty

3019
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Thick erase tool

3020
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
But

3021
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah

3022
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Um

3023
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So yeah

3024
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
The lack of skill

3025
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Can create a unique aesthetic

3026
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So what you're advocating here

3027
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Ben

3028
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Is to not assume

3029
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That even if you are

3030
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
The shittiest artist in the world

3031
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Don't assume

3032
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
That you don't have

3033
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Any ability to produce

3034
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Your own work

3035
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You gotta

3036
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
You gotta take it

3037
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Sometimes you just gotta

3038
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Do it

3039
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And see how it comes out

3040
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Because even your shittiness

3041
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Can give it its own personality

3042
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Well clearly

3043
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
With one punch man

3044
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
That was great

3045
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I was able to make it

3046
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
To prove that it was

3047
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Worth existing

3048
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And then was able to

3049
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Get it drawn well

3050
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I'll give you that

3051
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I'll give you that

3052
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
However I gotta say

3053
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
That guys in the position

3054
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
For example of me and Davoo

3055
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Who are focused on other things

3056
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And are just trying to

3057
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Manage their time to get shitt done

3058
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
For example right now

3059
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Right now in this very moment

3060
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I'm commissioning a guy

3061
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
To make this pixel art thing for me

3062
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And I don't know

3063
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Fucking shit about making pixel art

3064
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
What am I gonna do

3065
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Gonna learn how to do pixel art

3066
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
He's talking about all these

3067
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Mathematical equations

3068
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
That he's applying to like

3069
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Animate pixels moving and stuff

3070
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
To replicate like

3071
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Different effects in the sky and stuff

3072
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Like am I gonna learn

3073
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
All that shit

3074
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
No of course not

3075
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
That's why I'm commissioning a guy

3076
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And it's the same thing with

3077
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Whatever

3078
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Yeah it just works smart

3079
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Like I made an RPG once

3080
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And I'm not a very good pixel artist

3081
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But I did most of it myself

3082
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Because I had to

3083
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
You know

3084
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And that I had to

3085
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
So that I could make a game

3086
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And even Toby Fox

3087
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Is not a very good artist

3088
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You know

3089
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
That's true

3090
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Look at the beginning

3091
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
The frisk who looks like shit

3092
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And then the whole beginning area

3093
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
The ruins looks like garbage

3094
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Compared to the rest of the game

3095
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Which looks much better

3096
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Right

3097
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
The guy who made Lisa

3098
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Is not a great artist

3099
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Yeah

3100
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
But he

3101
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
In his figures look really weird

3102
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But in that kind of like

3103
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Strangely comedic game

3104
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It works really well

3105
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
They give personality

3106
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And he's not a great artist

3107
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It's true

3108
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
You know

3109
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
You made a fair point there Ben

3110
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It works smart

3111
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Because

3112
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Like Trey Park and Matt Stone

3113
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
They made the South Park characters

3114
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Even though they can't do good art

3115
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And those designs

3116
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
They're iconic now

3117
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Yeah they're iconic

3118
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
They're fucking fully cool

3119
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
That makes them cool

3120
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And

3121
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
And

3122
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Yahtzee

3123
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Making his air punctuation art style

3124
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
You know he hasn't ever had

3125
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
To update that

3126
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And he can't really do art

3127
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Otherwise

3128
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And again it's working smart

3129
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It's knowing your limitations

3130
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Down to the wire

3131
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Yes working around

3132
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Your own limitations

3133
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yes

3134
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
That's where art comes from

3135
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And it's related to fan art

3136
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
To bring it home

3137
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
That's true

3138
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Anyone can do fan art

3139
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Doesn't matter about your level of skill

3140
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But get creative

3141
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Do what you

3142
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
You know have an idea

3143
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Have a vision

3144
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Get creative and put forth a sincere effort

3145
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And your vision

3146
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Will shine through your lack of skill

3147
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I absolutely love

3148
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Our shitty first ever T-Bap fan art

3149
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It felt like there was heart

3150
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
It was all fucked up

3151
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And I loved it

3152
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Yes it was drawn in their own style

3153
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It wasn't just like

3154
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Traced from our thumbnail

3155
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
It was its own thing

3156
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And I'd like everyone to do likewise

3157
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Yes

3158
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Alright anybody got any last words to say

3159
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I'm gonna throw in another

3160
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
You know one of those

3161
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Jesse

3162
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I should have killed myself years ago

3163
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah

3164
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Because of your lack of art skills

3165
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Yes

3166
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yeah

3167
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
That would have been better

3168
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I think we got a lot done today everyone

3169
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I think we've really made progress

3170
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I think we've all come to understand things a little bit better

3171
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Our

3172
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Well good

3173
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Okay

3174
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Everybody draw fan art

3175
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Mostly me

3176
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And also these guys too

3177
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Everybody should do it more

3178
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Go to the subreddit

3179
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
There's a link in the description

3180
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Go to the subreddit

3181
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Give us PCP fan art

3182
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
At the very least of the five of us

3183
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Who are here today

3184
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I demand it of you

3185
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I want fan art

3186
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I want fan fiction

3187
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I want fan games

3188
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I want everything you can possibly do

3189
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Whatever you gotta do

3190
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And by the way if you make a fan game

3191
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Make it something other than an 8-bit platformer

3192
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That's a rule

3193
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
But I like those so you can do it

3194
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Don't listen to different

3195
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I like 8-bit platformers

3196
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Any game starring me is a fucking 10 out of 10 game

3197
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Which Jesse has had two games made about him

3198
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
At this point by the way

3199
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Two

3200
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Yeah

3201
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Two?

3202
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Other than quest for donut?

3203
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Yeah somebody made a game where I'm beating up

3204
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
The cinemasins guys

3205
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah

3206
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Me

3207
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I made that

3208
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Oh that's right

3209
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Oh yeah I still haven't seen that one

3210
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I sort of like a really stupid Atari 2600 game

3211
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
In terms of depth

3212
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I like it

3213
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I wanted you to make like

3214
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Like more of those

3215
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Yeah

3216
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Of me beating up different YouTubers

3217
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
With different settings

3218
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And I wanted to like compile them

3219
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Into like a Mega Man

3220
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Where you pick the stage and stuff

3221
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Oh that's a cool idea

3222
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I'd commission that from DeVoo

3223
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
That's worth it

3224
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Because you wanted me to do a Final Fantasy 7 edition

3225
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Where you can beat up everyone who thinks

3226
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Final Fantasy 7 is overrated

3227
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
What a great idea

3228
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Dude commission that for when the remake comes out

3229
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And have that at like the beginning of the video or something

3230
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
That'd be great

3231
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Okay good thoughts

3232
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Alright let's end it right here everybody

3233
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Thanks for watching folks

3234
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
We'll be back next week talking about something else

3235
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Leave whatever you've got suggestions

3236
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Leave in the description

3237
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
We've actually done like many of the suggestions

3238
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
People have left

3239
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
They've been better than stuff we could fucking think of

3240
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
So shoot that shit in that box

3241
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Give us a like

3242
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And shoot it right into my rainbow factory

3243
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Yes

3244
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Alright everybody

3245
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Say goodbye

3246
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Bye

3247
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Yeah

3248
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
We did it

3249
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
We did it we're all done

3250
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Woo
