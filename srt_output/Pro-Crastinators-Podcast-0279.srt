1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP, listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream, I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I've got CeCe, the Tails gets trolled, Brand Manager, and Tectonic Improv, YouTube, boy.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's right, hello, I'm back, finally. All the negative is over, I've returned.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, I'm just looking at your channel right now because I've never seen it.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh yeah, you should check out the lecture on The Linkara, or by the top of the 4th wall is worth checking out. Other stuff too.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Play Donkey Kong 94, yeah, I agree with that.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, it's a great game.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Man, those other games that came out after, like the Mario vs Donkey Kong shit, that shit sucks.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I know that the first Mario vs Donkey Kong is a lot more like Donkey Kong 94, but I know they do like the mini, they like spun it off into its own like other gameplay style, like the mini stuff.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I only played one of those, I didn't hate it, but yeah, it's a, it's a cry.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Even when the first one, like the whole aesthetic is like messed up, like the music is like really bad, it's like MIDI, it sounds like a 1994 MIDI.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That was a coincidence, I picked a random year and it just happened to be 1994. That wasn't intentional.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I believe it.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I just mean like a Windows 95, Windows 3.0 MIDI.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What about Windows, what about Windows 3.11 for work groups?

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, what?

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Windows ME?

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Nobody knows about Windows 3.11 for work groups, that was what my computer had on it as a kid.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Rare, it was a rare Windows.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Actually, the first Windows my family had was Windows 3.1.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, mine was better by exactly .01 for work groups.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, those are the days.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Before we get, before we get into anything else, I want to make an announcement about the RADCON, the Road to RADCON books.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I put out the message like a week or two ago that we need, that we're sending this apple, we need people who have changed their address to update their addresses.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm making a deadline this weekend, the weekend that this episode comes out is going to be the deadline.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If you have not updated your address on the Kickstarter by sending us a Kickstarter message about your new address, I'm just going to send it to the old address.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So just, just don't fucking wait on that if you still got to do it.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Any other good news is those will be going out in the mail hopefully next week.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So that'll be, that'll be fun and get those fucking, get those sent out.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But speaking of physically released books and media, CC, I asked you if you wanted to be on this episode to talk about how you, in collaboration with Laserbot, just released the, the, the, I think the first volume of the official Tales Gets Trolled print edition, right?

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's big news this week.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, speaking of, I'm just, I'm going to continue talking about Tiktok improv right now and then I'll talk about that.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, I'm a side Laserbot. Okay, there's a new hotness in town. CC's going to be my brand manager from now on.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We're going to get all of my videos published on Amazon.com featuring Kindle variants.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, we'll, we'll put them on Blu-ray. But anyway, apparently I was already subscribed to you, which is perfect.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, I guess I watched, I watched some of your videos before, though I don't remember which ones.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There's a couple videos that got kind of big that could have, that could have conceivably, you could have found me.

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Very funny how we were talking about, we were talking about the duck universe that one week and then like, like that, like that very week you put out that the fuck, what's the character?

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No, no, it, I, I didn't put that.

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I was older than that?

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, it was like over a year old. I just, when you guys were talking about Maui Mallard and like couldn't figure out his name, I was like at work being like, these simpletons, they don't even know about Maui Mallard in cold shadow?

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Nobody, nobody knows about Maui Mallard.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Uh, yeah, kinda. But they should.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Does he, does he even, does he even exist in like other duck stuff?

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't think he does. I think they were like trying to set something up with that sort of character.

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Like, cause like, um, cause you know, Donald Duck has like a lot, they, they always like give him like different identities.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah.

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I guess Maui Mallard was this one that never really stuck, cause it's only the game.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And in um, well is it, in like other regions it's called Donald in Maui Mallard, which makes it even more confusing.

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Cause he's like, it's Donald like playing the character of like an action star in a movie that is Maui Mallard.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, cause, cause like Disney would, Disney would do that stuff all the time back in the day.

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Like it would be like, well, cause they've done like stuff like the Mouse Keteers and stuff, right?

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So it's Mickey Mouse playing a character.

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I guess it's not that crazy.

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, like um, the old uh, the old um, Disney shorts where like they had Jack and the Beanstalk with like Mickey Mouse and shit.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, it's exactly like that.

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Although it's a little, it's a little weird because there's more layers to it because it's Donald Duck playing a guy, a duck called Maui Mallard,

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
who disguises himself as a character called Cold Shadow.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So it's like, it's two, it's, it's layers upon layers of this.

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So I can see why people would be confused, including myself back in the day.

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I guess probably like cartoon, like animation studios like Disney or whatever,

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
they would make shorts where they put their characters in these like, you know, public domain, iconic roles, Jack and the Beanstalk or whatever.

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And then probably at some point someone had this very meta idea of be like,

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
hey, what if we like kind of break the fourth wall and call attention to it and sort of establish that like, yeah, these characters are like,

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
they are performers that work for Disney that like they, they are, they kind of do acting sort of like they're, they're consciously acting these roles in these things.

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then that's probably why like the Muppets are like that too.

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There's sort of like a parody of that kind of thing.

70
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't know.

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I believe, oh sorry.

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The first time they made Mickey Mouse be Jack and the Beanstalk, they probably didn't even think at all about it.

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But then by the time in the modern era, I think they were like, we have to, we, I don't know, there was like,

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I remember when I was a kid, there was something called House of Mouse,

75
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
which was sort of like a Muppets style thing where it's like all the Disney characters hanging out at like a club and they're like,

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
oh, we're putting on a show or whatever.

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So meta.

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I remember that, yeah.

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What I like, well, first of all, like the game, watch my review everyone.

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But the game is like kind of clunky, but overall, I think it's really, it has, it has a lot of charm, like the graphics are really good.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And the music is like excellent.

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And it's by a, what was it, Michael Chiquino did the soundtrack to the game and he like went on to do the fucking Lost soundtrack.

84
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
All like a lot of Pixar films.

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Lost like the show?

86
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Like the TV show Lost.

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Mali Mallard was one of his like first things that he ever did, which is really weird.

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So he moved on to bigger and better things because we all know video games are for children.

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He seems like kind of still, there's not a lot of like interviews talking about him about the game.

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But you know, I think there's one where he like kind of brings it up and he seems like he's pretty proud of it.

93
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So that's cool.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

95
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But please enough about me.

96
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I want to hear about Tails gets trolled physical.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
For I want, I want, I have a quick question.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You see, he wants to talk about anything other than the tails gets trolled.

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is going really.

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, that's right.

101
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's kind of like how you, how when you're like eating dinner, you kind of want to save like the main course for later.

102
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sure.

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, it's partly that, but also like people know me as the tails gets troll guy.

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But you know, I'm kind of tired of talking about tails gets trolled.

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, sure.

106
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Sure.

107
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah.

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I could see, you know, getting kind of pigeonhole.

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Well, I mean, I still, I still like tails gets trolled, but you know,

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
um, but it's, it's, this is a really quick question though.

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But you guys were, you guys were talking about a Mali mallard on like the podcast where he had like six people, right?

112
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think so.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It was like Cybershell, Gamers Tavern, Tom and because I actually remember that I didn't listen to the whole thing.

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Just part of it.

115
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I remember when you said duck stuff, it kind of sounded like you said butt stuff.

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I didn't.

119
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But yeah, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's a, that's the bonus episode.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's the bonus.

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah.

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was going to, I was going to say something else, but I don't remember what it was.

124
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So speaking, speaking of bonus episodes, speaking of bonus episodes, the, oh yeah, the other, the other news item is I finally got around to releasing the bonus episode, the two behind the scenes episodes and then the one other behind the scenes episode, the post show

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
goss talk, the one where I have been, have been talking about for like a month and a half where I ran at Cybershell for like hours.

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That was, that was an epic episode.

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
About Trixie.

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It was, it was, it's finally out.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And also I updated the Patreon, the model.

130
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's no, the people, people just had the playlist.

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Like nobody needed to subscribe to get the playlist.

132
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It was, it was just out there floating around.

133
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So I killed the playlist.

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The playlist is dead.

135
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Now the way to get the bonus episodes is you have to be a patron.

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You have to look at the Patreon page.

137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You have a master post that lists all links to all the bonus episodes are there.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's the only way.

139
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So I don't know whether it was one thing like that I released this bonus episode that I had hyped up, the, the, the goss one.

140
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Or that I had, or that I finally got around to updating the, you know, the, the distribution model or whatever.

141
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But these two things in combination, our Patreon like exploded a little bit.

142
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
When I, it jumped up like $160 or something in like, in like three days.

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Which is like, that's pretty, that's pretty good.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's pretty good.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh yeah, I get a couple of bucks.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So I'm excited about that.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I guess I wanted to.

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So, so become a patreon.com slash the procrastinators if you want to get that stuff, like everyone does.

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's the hot new thing on the market.

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's pretty good.

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They, they, they talk hot goss on it.

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There is, there is hot goss.

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Although it's not, I remember it as the episode where I did like four hours of just Trixie talk.

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's actually, we kind of like move back and forth.

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's probably maybe half, maybe half an hour.

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I think it was longer than the actual episode.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's close because it's, it's long.

158
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's long.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was actually there and I didn't really have, I didn't really have much to say because I don't know anything about Trixie besides before she, you know,

160
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
before she, like I, like I watched her videos before she like went, did the stuff.

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Went.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You know, you know what I mean.

163
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Sure.

164
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes.

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Sure.

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So I didn't really have much to contribute, but I think part of the reason you got so much money from the patreon after you announced that is,

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it kind of reminded me of how like Kiwi Farms only pays attention to you because like you're associated with Trixie,

168
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
which is kind of, kind of weird.

169
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Right.

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
She's got a thread.

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah.

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Because she's got a thread and so, she's got a thread and she doesn't like do anything anymore.

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
She's like almost completely retreated like from posting almost anywhere.

174
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So they've like, there's like so starved for things to talk about that's like, they just, they talk about the PCP sometimes.

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Because, because what else are they going to say?

177
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They're going to talk about how Jews are going to kill all the white people.

178
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
In a different thread.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In a different thread.

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's the, does Ethan Ralph have his own thread?

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He must.

183
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Ethan, Ethan Ralph not only has his own thread, he's got his whole like subforum.

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He's like the biggest fucking thing on there right now.

185
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah.

187
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's, I don't really get it.

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But like, yeah, his thread got so big that they made, they made an entire subforum for like mini threat.

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't know why he's so big.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He's just like some podcaster, but.

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Well, he's a very large man.

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So I guess he does.

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I guess he is a pretty large.

194
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They like, they like drama and I'm guessing Ethan has a lot of drama.

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't know.

196
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I mean, he was like, I guess there's drama guy.

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And he's also like, so we're like a thousand other people.

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't see.

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't see what's so uniquely interesting about him, but you could say that about like

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
like everyone they obsess over.

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Like I never even, I was never even like a big Chris Chan follower.

203
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Hmm.

204
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Right.

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But I'm proud.

206
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This is one of a kind.

207
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, I'm a minority in that, obviously.

208
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Hmm.

209
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Hmm.

210
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But anyway, I guess we can talk about the tails gets told now.

211
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, I'm just curious, like, how did that, how did, how did getting it made go and how

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
has the response been?

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, I think we talk link in the description, by the way, link in the description, Amazon

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
link to where you can buy the book.

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Can you like it right now?

216
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Actually, I haven't gotten around to buying one.

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll do that right now.

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Live.

219
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I actually also have not bought one, but I am going to.

220
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah.

221
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Give us the link.

222
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah.

223
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It sold way more than I thought it would.

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, that's great.

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let me let me check.

226
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let me check how many right now.

227
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hold on.

228
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It was, it was over a hundred last I checked.

229
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's pretty good.

230
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah.

231
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's pretty good.

232
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And people have been like sending me pictures of their copy and stuff.

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I saw one, I saw one person posting theirs.

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's, that's good shit.

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah.

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's good for the hype train.

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah.

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And me and laser bought are getting the money, which is good because we both have like really

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
shitty jobs.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

241
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah.

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So we need it.

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I mean, I mean the thing that the nice thing about that is that like, I mean, I imagine

244
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
it will have a bunch of sales right at the beginning, but it will like, it will continue

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
to be around and hopefully it will continue like people will continue to, to buy it and

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
like it will maybe continue to like, you know, generate some sales as going on.

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Like it's not like, it's not like one and done, you know, it's like people in the future

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
can will be able to find it and be like, Oh yeah.

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah.

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Now I've discovered tales get trolled.

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Guess I should buy the book and buy the book.

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Maybe.

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah.

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And more, more volumes are coming out.

255
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know when, but laser bought already do the covers for them.

256
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah.

257
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He, he, he, he's really excited.

258
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Eleazar show the cover.

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Eleazar show the cover of the first episode, the first volume on the, on the screen there.

260
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Even though laser.

261
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
There it is.

262
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Even though laser bought left tails gets told he was really excited about the physical

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
edition.

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Cool.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You got that.

267
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
From what I remember from the interview, he seemed kind of a, he seemed pretty excited

268
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
about it.

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah.

270
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, I changed, I changed the title on the, I think it was in, in like after an episode

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
we were just talking and cyber shell said that he thought that the title of the episode

272
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
was kind of bad.

273
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Like for getting clicks and also the thumbnail is kind of like, the thumbnail is really busy

274
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and it's hard to read.

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I changed the title.

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I think I called it like laser bought speaks, but I think I changed it to like interview

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
with tails gets trolled creator laser bought because, because more people will know what

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
that means.

279
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah.

280
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm probably going to change the thumbnail to be like, it's like a crowd shot, but it's

281
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
kind of hard to tell what it is.

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm probably just, I'm probably just going to put the fucking tails face on it.

283
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You know, that's what people want.

284
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah.

285
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
People are crazy about that tails face.

286
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's what, that's what you said.

287
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I mean, that's what you did for the first one where you talked about tails gets told coming

288
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
back.

289
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I did.

290
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And I was like, oh, I can't do it again.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But like, no, I can totally just do it again.

292
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, you mean the first one was CC because that's the, no, the first one was a cyber

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
show.

294
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah.

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I just use it again.

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
PCP fans will know.

298
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Fuck it.

300
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
PCP.

301
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
PCP fans are the dumbest rubes.

302
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
They're the biggest suckers on the internet.

303
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No name.

304
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Watch.

305
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah.

306
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah.

307
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Of course.

308
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah.

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah.

310
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah.

311
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I like it, but I don't know if it really works as a, as a YouTube thumbnail.

312
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And it's such a shame at low resolution.

313
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

314
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah.

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Classic tails gets told are, you know, this is kind of tangentially related, but I, I

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
love the extra artworks that laser bot did for the comic that weren't like actual pages,

317
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
but they were like just stuff that was related to tails gets told that he drew.

318
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Let me try to find an example.

319
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
There's a bunch of them like right here.

320
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Are you, are you saying, are you saying that there's like, there's like exclusive bonus

321
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
content in the book?

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh, not, not in the book.

323
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's on the website.

324
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh, okay.

325
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay.

326
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah.

327
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Well, there is like one or there's like one or two bonuses in the book, but that's not

328
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
what I'm talking about here.

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm talking about like these pictures like he drew, um, this one, this is one of my favorites.

330
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Let me paste it in real quick.

331
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,400
The best challenge for a troll is troll another.

332
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,400
What the f...

333
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:45,400
It's a remember Kermit's backstory where he tells tales about him in the Muppets destroyed

334
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
each other by trolling each other.

335
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
I completely forgot about that, but thank you.

336
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Now I, now I get it.

337
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Now I understand what I'm looking at.

338
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Yeah.

339
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,400
That's what the, uh, it was, they, they fell into a troll spiral.

340
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Yeah.

341
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
A troll, a troll battle.

342
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Never, never got out.

343
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Never got out.

344
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Many such cases.

345
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Yeah.

346
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Sad.

347
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Oh, there it is.

348
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
There it is.

349
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Uh, I'm glad to hear, I'm glad to hear that it's, uh, that's moving.

350
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
That's moving copies.

351
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Oh yeah.

352
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
There is a, that's pretty good.

353
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Um, 32 have been, uh, shipped so far.

354
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Oh, that's almost 200.

355
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
So then more or less than the vapors.

356
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Um, ooh, wait, uh, vapors, one Kickstarter.

357
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
How many pledges was that?

358
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:50,400
That was, first one was, fuckin' 212 backers, but not all of them, not all of them bought

359
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,460
Some of them were like five dollar backers second Vapors two was three hundred and twenty nine

360
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,740
But I mean the price the price point of that was fifteen dollars

361
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,620
Whereas this is like what twenty twenty six dollars twenty nine dollars. Yeah, then twenty nine

362
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,060
So you so you know you you got a you got a you got to account for that

363
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,020
You got to account for for for total volume you got to multiply the rate at which money

364
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,580
They've exchanged his hands to do the total the total size of the economy

365
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,340
You know that's that's DOS capital right there. It's a velocity

366
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,500
It's all about that money velocity and soon money will be worthless. So you might as well spend it right now

367
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,220
Oh, I saw a great video from the Gravel Institute about how Bitcoin is a scam

368
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:39,020
Oh, I was I was gravel like Mike Gravel. I believe it's I believe it's pronounced Gravel

369
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,380
Yeah, it is. I think he's Mike Mike Gravel. Yeah, it is Gravel, but gravel sounds cooler and

370
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,580
He also knew a kid. I knew a kid in my like elementary school

371
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,980
I went to school through high school with a kid who was named Mike Gravel

372
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
Not not Gravel but Gravel

373
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Wow, he's a he's

374
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:06,180
He's obsolete. Well, that's a politician. Isn't that we're like, yeah, Mike Mike Gravel was the Mike Gravel was a

375
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
I think he was a senator from Alaska

376
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,980
Yeah, he was like he was extremely base. Sorry if that sounds like Bernie brochure

377
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,940
But yeah, he was extremely, but he like just died like this year. Oh, yeah

378
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:19,980
That's right

379
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,660
I was gonna mention Mike Gravel or Mike Gravel also sounds better for him because he made that um

380
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,660
He made that ad where he like throws a rock in the water. I

381
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,780
Haven't seen that one. Oh that one is so fucking good. Let me try to find it

382
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,500
That's that haven't it just seems like he such a

383
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:50,020
Such a what Alaskan ad. I don't know something about I think this is it. This is one ad. Oh

384
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,860
Throw it Mike Gravel. Mike Gravel rock

385
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,460
I'm sure I'm I can't find the oh here we go. I found it. Okay. What is that? What is the point?

386
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
He's just staring at the camera. Yeah

387
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,460
What is the point? I don't know

388
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,660
It's a

389
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,100
It's a avant-garde it's postmodern shit post it sure is I'm gonna go back. Yeah, but I go for him

390
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,740
But he was like he was like the um the most left

391
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,420
Presidential candidate in 2008

392
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,020
Yeah, he he he ran as um

393
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,660
The thing they say always he ran as a gadfly to just like

394
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:37,980
Be there to like put pressure on the other like centrist candidates to be like, hey, how come you suck on all these issues?

395
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,860
Yeah, how come you how come you're bad and you don't want to do good things. Yeah, and of course, of course

396
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,860
I never heard of him two years later

397
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,460
Yeah

398
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,980
The media he really did it again in in 20s in 2020 20, right? He was there for a bit

399
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,220
Yeah, but he didn't he didn't get into any of the debates

400
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,540
Like like he did with the first time didn't he get in the one I think I think he was in no

401
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:07,500
I'm pretty sure he was in like one of the early dem dem primary only only in 2008

402
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,100
No, I remember like in 2020. I followed that very closely

403
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:21,340
Unfortunately, maybe wait, maybe I am thinking of old clips that I just saw this year or last year. Yeah, yeah

404
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:27,380
He was shedding he shouldn't he shed on Biden in that one too because Biden ran for president 2008

405
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,780
But Obama and Hillary were also there. Oh

406
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,500
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm thinking of like he was he was gonna run this year

407
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,860
But like you could because like they changed the debate rules and like he was one of the people that like didn't get to like

408
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,420
Be on stage or whatever. Yeah, boo

409
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:51,100
But yeah, the Grevelling since you just put out a video about how Bitcoin is a scam and that just reminds me I

410
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
sold I sold my Bitcoin

411
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:00,260
Like a like like a week or two ago and I was thinking like and then it went up a bunch and I was like damn

412
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,100
I missed out

413
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,300
I could have made I could have made a little bit of money and then like a week ago

414
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:10,780
The like the president of El Salvador declares Bitcoin like an official currency of El Salvador

415
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:17,860
He buys like 500 Bitcoin and then and for some reason that makes the price tank by like 15%

416
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,460
And and now it's down. I mean, it's it's up a little bit from there, but it's still down from where I bought it

417
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,460
So I guess I won

418
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,140
I guess I won in the end. Yeah, unless it goes to a hundred and then I'll lose

419
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,660
It's kind of a scam, but it's also like mostly just like gambling

420
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,900
It's it's both. It's both. Yeah, it's both of those things. Scambling. You will scam scambling

421
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,140
Well, I know it's a scam. Well, but it's but some people can make money on it

422
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,300
Oh, yeah, Crip as so crypto mining and stupid motherfucker bullshit, whatever

423
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Yeah, it's um

424
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,740
You know, it's basically a Ponzi scheme where like a few a few people get rich early on and then everyone is like

425
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,820
Oh, I can get rich doing this and then they all jump in and then they're they're the ones that are left

426
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,180
Holding the bag as they say when it never actually goes anywhere. Yeah

427
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,100
That's that's how they try to get you. That's how they try to

428
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,340
Mm-hmm, and they do and it works sometimes. Yeah

429
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,140
Oh

430
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,740
You know, I was probably thinking of oh

431
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:31,860
You're gonna love this. I was thinking of fucking Tom Steyer. I was thinking of Tom Steyer and it's Steyer buyers. I'm a Steyer buyer

432
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,300
Yeah, the billionaire guy. I think I was thinking of him not Mike gravel

433
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,700
That I think was what they were trying to raise money. So Mike gravel could be in a yes

434
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,980
In a yeah, and that's why they had all the they had all these weird like they had all these viral tweets

435
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,540
Cuz his campaign was being run by a bunch of like

436
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:58,620
Yes, yeah, that was it and I think the zoomers helped found the Gravel Institute also

437
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,340
Yeah, yeah, I saw them like in an interview or something about it. They just like

438
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,180
It's Gravel Institute is awesome. It's so cool. I wish it were bigger

439
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,060
But I mean, you know, it'll maybe you'll get there one of their one of their videos with them

440
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:21,540
Where they talk about how America's shit that got over a million views, but that's I think that's the only that's the only one that

441
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,940
Got a lot of traction. I I have more views than the than the Gravel

442
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,300
I mean, they've got like 300k subscribers, which is like a fairly new channel. I mean, they're still growing. I hope

443
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:38,880
You know, they want to be like the leftist answer to the Prager you which you know is it is a tall order

444
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,180
But you know, they're they're they're making progress

445
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,140
Top that channel even yeah, sure

446
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,980
Can I say something really quick? And I'm sorry if this sounds like a bunch of like liberal cock bullshit

447
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:56,840
But okay, like even like ignoring like political views like I don't understand how anyone can take Prager you seriously

448
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,340
like

449
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,740
It's just it's it's literally it's literally just that like people

450
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,220
They people that already agree with them just like like like to hear it repeated

451
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,140
It doesn't it doesn't matter if the charts don't make any sense or that the experts are all like have like fake degrees and whatever

452
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,500
It's like it's it's that's that's irrelevant

453
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,220
And also it's just Prager or people say people say thing I agree with

454
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,340
Dennis Dennis Prager is also like a old-ass

455
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,740
like

456
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,020
Conserve oil Baron or something. No, he's like an old-ass. Well, he's funded by old oil Barons

457
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
But he's like an old-ass

458
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,140
conservative talk old-ass conservative talk radio guy from like the like the 90s and

459
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,500
It's like he just has all the partisan Republican

460
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,100
Like

461
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,620
Opinions like I don't know. It's just stupid

462
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,340
This this town is run by

463
00:27:53,780 --> 00:28:00,740
Spendocrat Diamond Joe Quimby and all his hippie friends who would rather would rather play hecky sack

464
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:07,180
Lock up the homeless. That's another funny thing like oh Joe Biden is a fucking communist like oh, okay

465
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:14,300
Well, he is yeah, he's he's he's forcing vaccine mandates. He's gonna force feminizes

466
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,940
Any anything to the left of Ronald Reagan is a communist

467
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,500
Yeah, even Reagan cow pushing it. Yeah, even Reagan was a little bit

468
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,260
Yeah, he wanted to give I'm trying to give it. He wanted to give amnesty to illegal immigrants

469
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,660
That's like some fucking open borders communist shit. That's pushing it. Yeah

470
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,780
Obama also said he was like a

471
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:47,200
Ronald Reagan, which I agree with and of course Obama was a socialist that makes Ronald Reagan a socialist, you know, I

472
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,140
Guess I guess that yeah sound logic. I can't argue with it

473
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,820
So for a while, I thought I thought Dennis Prager was dead. Is he not dead? I

474
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,420
Think I wish

475
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,700
No, I think his brother died or something or no, there was um, they know who were like the fracking coke brothers

476
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,900
The coke brothers one of the yeah, one of the one of the coke brothers died

477
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,180
And I think I was confused for a while that like

478
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,460
The Prager that like Prager was one of the coke brothers, but he's not

479
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:24,580
I mean his middle name is it's his full name Dennis coke Prager. I can understand you might be confused

480
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,180
Wait, is that true?

481
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,540
Okay, it's one of those one of those lies I tell it's like

482
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Patented tectonic improv

483
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,340
It's like how in the Super Mario Brothers movie their names were Mario Mario and Luigi Mario

484
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,860
Right Dennis Prager Luigi Prager Dennis

485
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,500
Coke Coke and Pepsi Prager Dennis Dennis Coke Prager and

486
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,460
whatever the

487
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,460
Coke brothers names were I forgot?

488
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:57,620
Did you know that did you know that the coke brothers ran as libertarians in the 80s? I thought that was interesting

489
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,660
That sounds about right. Yeah, I can't say that shocks me too much

490
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,380
But I don't even know anything about those. I don't know what they look like or whatever. I just know that they're bad

491
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:17,140
Yeah, bad and I don't like P one of them is dead and that's and that's funny people always said that um

492
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:24,180
The coke brothers are like the leftist boo boogeyman kind of like George source source is like a boogeyman for good service

493
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:32,220
But like I was I was looking the other day and I heard that um George source was really concerned about the profits of black rock

494
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,420
You know that company that was like buying like real estate and shit. I

495
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,420
Don't know if you

496
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:46,320
He sounds familiar sounds familiar. Yeah, and like if he's if he is black rock not like a private military contractor

497
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
No, that's black water. Oh

498
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Okay, okay

499
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:58,280
PMC black rock is like a real estate and they're like responsible for like driving up like real estate prices and shit and

500
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,240
Apparently George George source was like really concerned about their profits, and I'm like that doesn't really sound like a leftist

501
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:11,000
But you know, well, he's a billionaire after I mean all has been said and done. Yeah

502
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,160
Exactly I'm saying what they say. Yeah, he's also Jewish. So I mean every I mean I

503
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,720
Mean everyone who makes everyone who has a lot of money is really concerned with who else is making a lot of money

504
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,120
I know it seems it seems all how is it even relevant? It seems obvious to me

505
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:34,160
But all the conservators of like oh George source is trying to he's trying to make us all like

506
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Cucks and shit. I don't know

507
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Sure. Well, obviously

508
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,760
That's what I would do if I was probably probably cuz he's so he's probably just socially liberal and

509
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,520
That that's what that's the only thing they care about because of it's a stupid culture. Well shit

510
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,560
I really hate politics. I'm gonna stop talking about it. The socially liberal financially conservative person

511
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,880
I was thinking about that term the other day and how I'd never hear I always hear I hear that a lot

512
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,240
I never hear the the financially liberal socially conservative. What would that look like?

513
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Yeah, I

514
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,220
Nobody does it if that would be if that would be if you're like

515
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:20,720
If you're just like believing like traditional values, you know, you know who that would be that would be like Caleb Moppin. I

516
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Don't know who that is

517
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,120
If he's like a he's sort of like a tanky guy. He's like a he's like a communist. He's fucking on Twitter

518
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Did you look him up?

519
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,120
He's like a he's like a communist, but he's all

520
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,640
Him and like Peter Coffin are sort of friends and they are they have this stick going where they're like

521
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:52,120
They're appealing to like traditional American values the like the the the the what he called the new the nuclear family

522
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
you know

523
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,840
You know, they're doing this like appeal to like traditional values and their argument is like, yeah

524
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,920
Capitalism has like, you know has eroded our values

525
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,200
Capitalism is what has destroyed our culture, you know, which are returned to traditional values is possible, you know

526
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:16,520
Through to it through the adoption of socialism, right? I like I think that's what it looks like to be socially conservative and and

527
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:26,080
Ufiscally liberal. That's that's a unique people. That's a unique perspective because most people who are like pro capitalism are like dumbass boomers who just

528
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:33,000
Like had Cold War propaganda when they were like five years old. So they're all like, oh communist communism is evil

529
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,680
And I mean to know the to be fair a calming like

530
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,240
USSR and China and shit is like stupid. I don't like tank. He's either but yeah

531
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,480
This guy is so funny. He wrote like a bunch of a

532
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,720
Bunch of like a punch a bunch of people who one might consider bread tubers like all

533
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,080
Made fun of him. So he wrote he wrote it

534
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,560
So he wrote a whole book called bread tube serves imperialism

535
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,720
And he and he published it and it's basically just a rundown of like people in bread tube

536
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,760
Who he doesn't like and like why they suck?

537
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Yeah

538
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:23,000
He wanted he wrote there were a couple bits he wrote that like Vosh has many skeletons in his closet including a lack of charisma

539
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,840
Um

540
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:34,120
He implied that thought slime has probably led trans kids to suicide by like having them like question their gender too much or something

541
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,840
Yeah, it's pretty bad. That's weird. That's weird that you like

542
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,960
Yeah, I spend time writing a book publishing it about you do internet people. He doesn't like

543
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,960
This is all in line with like the whole when Peter Coffin had their like public freak out and like banned everyone that they considered

544
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,280
To be bread to be including like Jenny Nicholson

545
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,120
This is like just totally a political people

546
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,320
Has Jenny Nicholson ever said anything about politics?

547
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:08,840
No, she's she's she's occasionally alluded to like some maybe vaguely culturally progressive things

548
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,960
But she's not like political, you know, I think she she thinks that like racism is bad

549
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,440
You know like if that's if that's that sounds like some global homo Jewish shit

550
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
True true true

551
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Um, anyway, oh

552
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,680
Speaking of which did you hear about the controversy? Well, it's not really controversy except for 4chan dumbasses

553
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:40,080
The game no more heroes 3. There's a you can get a sweatshirt that says fuck fuck racism

554
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,400
Yes, and no people on 4chan got really we can't have that shit

555
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:52,160
Yeah, we can't have that shit in a video game, you know cuz really cuz really it says fuck racism

556
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Yeah, okay, and you know

557
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
anti-racism is the code word for anti-white

558
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,720
This this is I see this is um, this is just like when when the quartering was like

559
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,200
What did he someone said like fuck Hitler?

560
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,000
He was like hey, and the good you want to know the quarter was like. Oh, it was like some it was Michael Chiquino

561
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:20,120
You're shitting. I'm not joking. It was Michael. You're shitting me. I'm not joking. He's here. I'm not joking

562
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:26,520
I don't know who that is. It's that's the guy who did the Maui Mallard. It's Maui Mallard guy. Oh my god

563
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,360
That can't be true. Oh my god, 100% true 100% true

564
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,720
Holy fun the tweet shit find the tweet

565
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:41,040
Yeah, when someone was like Hitler was bad and and the quartering was like, oh really this is there and this now

566
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Yeah, there we have it. I mean to play devil's advocate. This is this is the Chiquino cast

567
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,440
This is the Chiquino cast. I mean to play to play devil's advocate. Maybe

568
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,920
quartering meant why no, he didn't really mean this but

569
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,880
Maybe yikes, maybe he meant like oh you're saying Hitler is bad

570
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,160
Well, obviously like Hitler is bad. You're just virtual signaling or something

571
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:12,320
But I was a big fan of his music, but I yikes didn't realize he wasn't he didn't like Hitler. Sorry about that everyone

572
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,160
No, I know I know I know what he means. I know he's like

573
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,280
This is just virtue signaling, but like that's fucking stupid all on its own, right? Yeah, that's an it's an idiot opinion for idiots

574
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:31,640
Yeah, sure Michael Chiquino's Jewish also also if uh if Michael said like fuck Stalin or something the quartering would be like

575
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,960
Oh my god, based a hundred Gorillian dead

576
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,360
it

577
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,960
true the

578
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,840
It's that that meme of the the soy face that is like

579
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,120
place

580
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,960
Unimpressed place Japan soy face. Oh

581
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,240
You know, yeah that one he gets excited. Yeah, it would be that meme

582
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,640
Oh, never mind. Hey guys. I got a great idea. Oh, by the way, let's draw the quartering as a soy face

583
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,620
Let's draw him as soy by the way that I'll show that place. Japan meme is unironically me

584
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
I'm not a shame to admit it

585
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,080
Yeah, yeah, that's why it came in yeah it is

586
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,800
True this there was a nugget of truth in there and it spoke to people

587
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,480
They saw themselves in it like a mirror. Yeah

588
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:25,800
That's why I resonate. Is that how you is that how you say this name Chiquino Chiquino. Yeah, ju-ju-ju-ju-quino

589
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,480
I guess that makes sense. Yeah, I'm I'm pretty sure that's how you say it

590
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,320
I remember looking it up. Is he is he really Jewish because that sounds Italian or something? No, he's not he's not Jewish

591
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,920
He's telling okay. I was gonna say I mean, I guess I guess you could be both. Yeah

592
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,080
There are there are black Jews and

593
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:51,520
European Jews and I know that there are black Jews because I've seen because I've seen the the rabbi's cat and

594
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,240
And I know all that move that in it in that movie

595
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,760
They go to they travel into the deepest part of Africa to find the share home of the shared

596
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:08,920
Homeland of all blacks and Jews and the people that live there are like 12 feet tall and they're like so dark that they're like blue

597
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,320
And there's these judge these these black giants that just have you know, what's the word a bar mitzvahs and stuff and

598
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,000
The cat tries to get bar mitzvah to become a

599
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,240
Real boy, but they won't do it

600
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,680
Because the talking cat is is is some witchcraft or something

601
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,880
Are you talking about are you talking about an avatar because you mentioned like tall blue people

602
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,540
No, I'm talking about the rabbi's cat. It's like a Belgian movie

603
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Is it like live I think live action

604
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:46,620
No, it's animated. Yeah, I think I think YMS recommended it in one of his like like best of some year

605
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:51,260
Ronda, I think then talked about on the body only the only it has like a weird. I probably did

606
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:57,140
Huh, doesn't it have like a really weird ending? Yeah, it's what I just said they go to the shared

607
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:05,260
Homeland of all blacks and Jews and they find they get chased out by these giants who are like no no fucking no fucking foreigners allowed get out

608
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,980
Yeah, I always imagine this looked like the thief in the collar, but I actually don't know a little bit

609
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,980
Kind of rest

610
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:20,580
Rest in peace. It has that it has that it has that Lynn Claire like sort of tin tin. Yeah, like a

611
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,460
sort of

612
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:29,940
What's that like a Le Lascar kind of like French? Oh my god look about it. I never knew this is from 2012

613
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,940
I thought this was like from the 80s

614
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,340
Hmm

615
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:41,060
No, it's I mean it if it was one of YMS's yearly picks so it couldn't have been that yeah

616
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:48,820
Yeah, he's only done those as far back as like 2007. Okay. Yeah, I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad people are still making true art in the

617
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,240
in the medium of animation I

618
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,540
Wish I was something once in a while. I wish animation was more respected

619
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,340
I

620
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:08,260
Think it's a little too respected. Yeah, I think I think the pendulum has swung too hard in the other direction

621
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,780
Yeah, well depending on the

622
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,180
Depending on the target I'm kind of a centrist about animation

623
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,740
I'm kind of a centrist about animation

624
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:22,060
I kind of think both sides are bad the people that think it's a valid art form and the people that think it don't I think we should compromise

625
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,060
Yeah, you're right

626
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,380
You've yeah, you've convinced me

627
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,260
True

628
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:38,060
What were we talking about tails get strolled the Mike Jews Mike Shiano being Jewish, okay

629
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,820
What did I say Geano, I think Mike Geano sure

630
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,340
What's so what else is up I should have I

631
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,820
No, I would have talked last time about how I moved into my new apartment and how it sucks and my landlies sucks

632
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,380
And I hate this fucking place and I've been ripped off. I've been fucking I've been fucking scammed

633
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:08,660
Oh, no for this place. It's dog shit. Yeah, it's fucking dog shit first months rent and last month's rent and a full month's security

634
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:15,820
Rent security deposit and a $200 like application fee just to get in here and the place is fucking dog shit

635
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,740
Yeah kitchen is foul

636
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,540
Kitchen is gross. There's the cabinet just has like a boiler in it

637
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,980
The cabinet is just a boiler. They can't even put shit in there

638
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,940
Floor is dirty crack paints peeling windows are fucking shit

639
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:36,180
There's like iron bars over my windows that I had to get like them the product that the property manager to take off

640
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,100
So that I could put my my air conditioner in the window

641
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,660
Oh, I guess I'm not gonna need that for much longer because it's September now. It's fine

642
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,580
Conditioner out today fucking

643
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:52,100
Rats in the parking lot. I hear I hear rats squeaking out in the parking lot right out my window all the time

644
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:57,500
I mean, I guess that's not the worst thing, but it's just emblematic. It's just emblematic of the kind

645
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:04,020
I usually have a location. Oh, sorry the location amazing the location amazing everything else about the place dog shit

646
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,580
Maybe and I'm maybe yearly and large to get a real job

647
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,580
I

648
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:17,140
Want to fucking I want to say hey, I'm gonna leave and I'm gonna like hey give me my fight

649
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,300
I'll never get my security deposit back. I'm down like a fat

650
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,300
I've down like a thousand dollars because I'm definitely losing that security deposit

651
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:30,100
And I'm definitely losing that and that $200 that fucking it was just desperate

652
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,980
It was because I left my house hundreds for the last minute and I was desperate and I was like well

653
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,540
I need something so I took the deal. I was like fine $200 the application fee

654
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,140
I guess I got to pay it here. You go and now I've paid it and it's all gone and

655
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,460
And what I'm when what do I have left?

656
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,020
nothing

657
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,020
I'm ruined

658
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,760
I'm truly sorry. Yeah, I

659
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,060
Hate it. I hate it. Are you living but I mean

660
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Well, I mean it's a unit with other rooms that other people live in okay

661
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,760
So I mean technically no, but like I don't I don't like interact with them that much. Yeah

662
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:11,580
Yeah, so, you know, I got my own room. I usually I usually have cats in my

663
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,300
Parking lot rather than rats. Oh

664
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,140
I would try I'd like to trade please and it's like it doesn't even matter where I lived

665
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,800
I lived in both California and Arizona and there was always cats in the

666
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,580
parking lot for some reason

667
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,180
No, just just rats just rats

668
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,500
Yeah, maybe you can give then one of the cats and leave it outside and the rat problem

669
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:44,260
Yeah, kind of take care of itself. All we need is one cat and it'll catch two mice and then it will multiply into two cats

670
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,660
Yeah, and then

671
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,540
That's that's how ecology works. Yeah

672
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,780
Uh

673
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:57,700
Fucking some fucking like frat house like right across right across the parking lot behind me

674
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,380
They're they're blast in there. They're blast in their tunes

675
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:08,900
Oh, you not even just on week not even just on weekends. Just whenever they feel like you should go and hang you should go and hang out with them. I

676
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,560
They'll never they'd never accept me. I'm too square. Yeah, I

677
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,820
Am much too square for that. I feel like I can't relate to the zoomers

678
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,580
They weren't even alive. They weren't even alive when 9-11 happened. Oh, by the way, happy 9-11

679
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:32,820
Happy 9-11. Yeah as of yesterday. Yeah, the last episode was late because we wanted to delay to release on 9-11

680
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,220
by the way to commemorate and we like brave

681
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Mujahideen fighters

682
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,020
I didn't say that

683
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,620
We could get into a whole thing about 9-11. I have so many thoughts about it

684
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,780
Um

685
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,260
About I'm not gonna I'm not I'm not gonna go into it. I'll just go into the short version, which is

686
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,140
You know, everything has gotten worse since then

687
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,340
And uh, the world is going to shit and we're all gonna be fucked

688
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,220
That's all I'm gonna say about it

689
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,020
Sure

690
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,100
Thank you

691
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:16,500
What was I talking about um my fucking all these fucking kids these fucking kids in my in my parking lot with their rap music

692
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:23,140
And they're and they're and do a dance in the cha-cha or whatever sick. There should be a law against it

693
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:29,140
Uh, you need to show you need to show fans of rap music real music like anime openings

694
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:35,140
Yeah, video game music. Yeah, they have these. Yeah, they have these like giant parties and they're in their fenced off backyard

695
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,780
It sounds like there's like a hundred people back there just like yelling

696
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:44,980
Don't knock knock. Excuse me neighbors. I couldn't help but notice you were listening to uh some quite deplorable tunes

697
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,180
Perhaps you'd like to listen to the delta room chapter one soundtrack

698
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,180
I wonder I wonder if I went over there and I was just like, hey, let me come in

699
00:46:54,260 --> 00:47:00,020
I wonder if they'd be like, okay, or if they'd be like, no, or if it'd be like, yeah pay like $15 you can come in

700
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,820
Describe like a six pack and then fill you in. Yeah, maybe you know, I don't know

701
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,860
There was a back before covid um

702
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:13,300
Someone in my work parking lot after work was blasting um megalovania from their car

703
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:21,700
Oh, I played I was playing I was playing dance not actually dance sense revolution, but a knockoff dance sense revolution

704
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,860
I went to cracks house

705
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,660
Yesterday and we played dance dance revolution

706
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:32,340
And he had a pack that had megalovania in it, but we didn't play it. I didn't play because it was too embarrassing

707
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,100
It might have been step mania. I don't even remember it's funny

708
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:41,220
I went to I went to a store yesterday and they actually had one of those like metal ddr mats for sale

709
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,660
Like I think it was like a hundred bucks or something. It was used

710
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,020
I was like pretty good. I don't know who brought that in and you know, that would be cool and all

711
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,060
But I I don't have the room for that and I don't play the game

712
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,420
So I just ignored it crack just had crack had the soft pad

713
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,020
But he had it like he had it like screwed into like a piece of plywood

714
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,540
And then he he had like holds in his floor for screwing the plywood to the floor like bolt it down

715
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,020
He sounds like a really dedicated ddr fan

716
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:15,220
And yet he rolled by one of those metal mats with the with the handle that you hold on to

717
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,500
Yeah, I guess why not why not just go all the way?

718
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,580
He's a little DIY. I guess they're heavy. You might as well buy a whole ass arcade machine

719
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,780
If you're gonna go that far

720
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,460
Yeah, true

721
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:34,020
No, I went to his uh, I went to the house that he's been uh renovating and posting the twitter thread about place is crazy

722
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,780
Place is awesome. The house rules. He had we had him on a few weeks ago to talk about home ownership

723
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,900
Crack's house is fucking sick. It's like one of the coolest houses. I've ever been in. I've seen the pictures

724
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,780
Crack is uh

725
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,500

Yeah, I think I think I've known I think I've known at least one other person who did who had quality assurance with some

742
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,580
Some software company

00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:06,340
Former member friend of the show. I'm sorry. Who's that? I I I remember him from the uh

00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,340
Tgt lecture. Sure. What would you would you say tech? Who's that?

He was doing art school. He was going to art school, but he's shifted gears and he's doing a computer science this year

751
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,580
He switched schools switched majors and now he's doing computer science

752
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,500
That's crazy

753
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,260
Kind of surprising

754
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:37,620
Good luck to him. Yeah, good luck to him. Yeah, I heard he I heard he left the internet to focus on that

755
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:44,980
He left the internet something else and as and as we all know you can't you can't go to school and be on the internet

756
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:53,700
Well, he he left the fandom of the internet and uh, yeah, who knows who knows if uh, if the fandom the internet will ever go back, you know

757
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:00,340
He he would have to he would have to beg forgiveness at this point. He would have to grovel

758
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,540
You know, you have to mic grovel

759
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,100
And it it might be harder nowadays, but I've actually known people who have left the internet

760
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,940
It might be yeah, it might be harder. Like I said these days

761
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,300
Go off the grid. I mean, I guess you can do it

762
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:22,260
I guess you you can it's probably easier if you just never uh join the internet to begin with like, uh

763
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,580
Like bill water. Yeah, you have to whatever

764
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,780
You have to go through the initiation process to join the internet

765
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:35,780
Uh, I mean the internet is like it's where you get fucking it's where information is. I don't know. I mean

766
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:43,460
You you if you if you're okay with just being like completely disconnected with from society then sure you can do it anything you want

767
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:49,300
You can just completely unplug and not read newspapers and not talk to anyone and then sure. Yeah

768
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,620
No problem, but like

769
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:57,620
Sucks. I don't know who wants to do that. I love I love when the internet was like first coming out or whatever

770
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,540
um

771
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,580
They

772
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:06,820
Had all those like videos explaining it that were like really corny and they called it like the information super highway and shit like that

773
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:14,980
I love the information super highway. That's such a good name and remember remember when commercials had aol keywords in them

774
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,900
I remember um, yeah, I was never clear on what those did

775
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,900
me neither

776
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,860
But they they would they would say the url and they would also say the aol keyword. I'm like, what the fuck is that?

777
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:31,300
I remember the no nobody even knows what aol is anymore for like Netscape and net zero

778
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,460
But this wasn't like when they were brand new

779
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,940
This was when they were trying to rebrand and be cool

780
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:41,620
Because you know, I'm I was born in 97. So I don't have I don't I don't know a lot of 90 shit

781
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,700
I know like early 2000s crap. I remember

782
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:49,140
Like I just like one of these ads for I think it was net zero where there's like a bunch of these cool

783
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:53,460
yuppies just hanging out on their uh in their new york apartment

784
00:52:54,020 --> 00:53:00,100
Like uh and like a skyscraper just talking about how fucking sick net zero is and how they're like drinking champagne

785
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,180
It's like you need to be a part of this

786
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,660
and uh

787
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,220
Yeah, you know, what's really sad

788
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,220
What's that?

789
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,340
I don't even think like when like I used to think of people born in like the late 90s as little kids

790
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:23,620
But I don't even think that anymore in 24 because we've already we've already got the generation alpha generation alpha is already being born

791
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,740
Yeah, exactly, but also because most

792
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:34,260
Most people online that I come across are like born in like 2002 and like that's really like little kid shit. Yeah

793
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,300
is that like in the in

794
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:42,980
I mean like I mean, I guess probably most of the people that I see on twitter are like, you know

795
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,420
They're people that follow the pcp. So maybe they're probably like mid

796
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,980
Mid 20s at the oldest to down to like, you know late teens

797
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,860
At the youngest mostly wasn't there someone who called a few weeks ago that was like 14

798
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:04,020
Yeah, yeah, I was talking to I was talking to kazzie about it and they were like they were like

799
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:10,580
14 or something when they started watching like uh, uh, the the horse the horse cast or whatever

800
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,260
Oh, that's weird. So they're

801
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:18,180
Yeah, at least at least maybe 16. I don't know at least they were in the target audience for my little pony

802
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,220
The target demographic. Yeah, I guess so well

803
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,820
Even even like 14 to 16 would be a little too old

804
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,860
But I mean, of course, there's the whole brony thing. So

805
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,220
That's like an exception

806
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,060
One time uh

807
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:37,060
The only my little pony I know about is like the one my sister watched when she was a kid

808
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,500
I like the eight from like the 80s. So I said the

809
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,700
Oh, sorry go ahead. No, no, I you can finish. I have an unrelated point

810
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:53,860
Oh, so, um one time in your discord. I said the original my little pony is better than friendship is magic and it was really controversial

811
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:00,020
um, okay, I got a comment on my

812
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,500
uh, the the the

813
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:10,660
It was one of the two lectures the other day the the the chris chan lectures and someone was like, uh, you said that chris wasn't into

814
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,940
Uh, uh, my little pony and that chris got into my little pony late

815
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:22,740
But actually chris was drawing my little pony even back in the pre sonichu era in the pre timeskik era

816
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,900
Because megan, you know, I actually remember that I actually remember that I wrote okay

817
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,260
I remember it too

818
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:34,660
But I hate this person because they're deliberately misunderstanding me because I was specifically talking about the brony fandom

819
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:39,220
Which is not pre gen four mlp old mlp fans are not bronies

820
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,780
It's a gen four fandom is the and chris was like really late to get into brony

821
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,420
Yes, she liked the old my little pony for a bit because megan liked it, but that doesn't count

822
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,580
That wasn't what I was talking about. I was furious. I'm gonna be furious of this individual

823
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,340
I'm gonna side with you on this one because I get a lot of comments that are uh

824
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:02,180
Where people will people will say things that I obviously know about if you've seen the video

825
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,500
Maybe I don't say them outright

826
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:10,820
But just like the way I talk about something should at least imply that yes, I know don't worry ever

827
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,340
I know

828
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,500
Yeah, you don't have to tell me I know the first the first sonichu lecture

829
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:20,980
The thing that everyone wanted to correct me on was that I said chris worked at burger king when in fact

830
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,380
Everyone knows everybody knows she worked at wendy's and she got fired from wendy's

831
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,700
For doing a donald duck impression

832
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,460
Yeah, well, that's funny. That's pretty that's pretty awesome

833
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,580
Everyone comments to tell me i'm wrong about that and fair enough

834
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:38,900
So I corrected that one in the first the first few minutes of this of the second one

835
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,540
But then in this one the one that I got wrong that everyone tells me is that I was not aware

836
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:49,460
That the reason chris threw that chapter about rosa chu getting fat was because like some girl that chris was talking to

837
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,900
Had like a fat fetish and so she wrote this like this fat

838
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,260
Plotline in to like please that girlfriend

839
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:01,620
I I I had heard about that, but I had completely forgotten about it. So like that one's true

840
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:05,140
That's like, yeah fair criticism. I didn't mention that one

841
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,060
But other than that other than that, I think I was pretty good and I definitely

842
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,180
Was not wrong about the brony thing

843
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:16,500
She was not drawing. She was not like drawing pony stuff until like

844
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,660
After the peak

845
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,660
Until after t-bap was already over

846
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,380
What's t-bap?

847
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,820
How does one explain how does one even begin to explain t-bap?

848
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:47,300
Uh fencing and best guy ever used to have a pony show where they reviewed uh episodes of my little pony together among other things

849
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,780
t-bap

850
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,100
t-bap is more to the point t-bap

851
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:58,500
Half of t-bap is the protagonist of the up-and-coming video game masterpiece

852
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,300
uh phantoms revenge

853
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:07,540
Now now ben is uh, is phantoms revenge being done with zero crunch by its uh, its employees working on it?

854
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,820
I it is it is doing done with 100% crunch

855
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,460
What I am only crunching

856
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:18,340
Uh, uh, uh, man, I was uh, I picked out music

857
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,340
I picked out I picked out music for the game. I'm stealing music from front mission

858
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:27,060
Front mission gun hazard. I'm going with the soundtrack to that because it has like a sci-fi

859
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:32,580
I think it's pretty cool sort of aesthetic too. That's I never is that is that the one for for snes or

860
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,460
Yes, was it one of the later ones? I played no, it's it's an snes one

861
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:43,540
I played front mission three on the playstation when I was young. Uh, I'd never played the front mission gun hazard

862
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,980
It was on this nest

863
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:48,260
It could play for the gun hazard like a little bit on an emulator

864
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,780
The first few didn't come out in the us from what I remember. Yeah. Yeah

865
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:58,420
I mean, it's not a game that I like hear anyone talk about so I'm kind of like

866
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:04,500
Oh, people aren't even going to recognize these these these tracks. Is it um, you know, is it is front mission gun hazard?

867
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,860
It's like a side scrolling game

868
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:10,100
You're like you control a mech and you can like level up its stats and stuff to to be honest

869
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,660
I don't even know what kind of game it is. I haven't seen any gameplay front mission three is a like

870
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,660
Tactical rpg like a grid-based tactics game. Yeah, I think I played this most

871
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,420
Yeah, most of most of the ones in the series are like that

872
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:27,060
Yeah, which was my favorite kind of game when I was in like high school

873
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,900
I played like every single one like get my hands on like find

874
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,460
Final fantasy tactics

875
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,740
Like final fantasy tactics of van van van garden

876
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,860
Was it me vandal hearts? No vandal hearts is the one I'm thinking of uh, uh

877
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:50,020
Oh van van and vanguard bandits another one about piloting a mech. Um, the tactics ogre

878
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,460
Let us clean together

879
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:59,220
Huh tactics ogre let us clean together. I think that's what the subtitle is for that one

880
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:06,260
You know, I never I didn't actually play tactics ogre. I just know it's another part of that of that genre genre

881
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,220
genre

882
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,820
What was I talking about? Um, oh fandoms revenge

883
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:16,980
Oh, I've been I've been putting I've been putting a lot of finishing touches on it lately

884
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,100
I've been making a lot of like I've been trying. I've been beautifying it

885
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:26,100
I've been making lots of like fancy game objects that have like little effects that have like bubbling effects and little little motion effects

886
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,660
And I've been making like background details to make

887
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,380
Every room in the game look like a little different and distinct and stuff and I'm and I'm just kind of

888
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,300
Uh, uh, I've been I've been working. I've been going really hard lately

889
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,700
Like it feels like I'm in the final stretch and now I'm like

890
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:48,660
I'm focused. I'm laser focusing in on it. It's it's coming together. It's already a masterpiece

891
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,980
It's not even done, but it's already a masterpiece even if it's current state by the time it's finished

892
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,780
It'll be the greatest thing ever made by a human

893
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,820
Uh, I'm I'm very proud of you my son. It's so cool

894
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,500
I you can I can play I can basically play through

895
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,940
most of the game currently it just needs like

896
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,860
It just needs it needs it needs bug squashed and it needs um, and it needs like, you know

897
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,700
Polish and it needs like backgrounds fixed and like and a little more variety

898
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,740
In in the environments and and and the final boss needs to be finished

899
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,020
How how long how long is it going to be?

900
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,980
I think uh

901
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:33,540
Well as you're uh as as one of your um as one of your

902
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:39,700
Uh benefactors you will release this game. Uh before quarter four earnings are uh

903
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,420
Are up so

904
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:47,380
Make sure to get that out before then uh do whatever you need to do time to crunch time to crunch time

905
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,140
Time to crunch. We got it. We got to hit our we got to hit our quarterly goals

906
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:55,300
Uh, uh, just make sure make sure you don't get a job at Activision

907
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,300
A playthrough

908
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,340
I think

909
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:04,260
I think my goal will be that you can probably beat it in maybe like a couple hours

910
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,980
Of like trial and error and like oh, maybe like two hours of like

911
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,580
Of trial and error figuring it out. I mean

912
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,300
The the

913
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,940
Like if you know if you know exactly what you're doing, I think you could probably beat it in like five minutes

914
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:25,140
um, but you know the the real game is like figuring out how to

915
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,100
survive and and win I mean the

916
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:31,540
The first game I made when I was like 16 was kind of like that

917
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,700
The alpha version that I put out on patreon a few months ago was

918
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:40,340
Very very hard. I think it was too hard only like six people beat it

919
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:46,740
And those people took like five hours to beat it or or longer because it was just so much like trial and error

920
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:52,740
They had to find like the exact right combination of of of moves that like would not would result in in not death

921
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,940
And they were like there was like zero room for error at all

922
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:04,580
So I've I've made it a little I've added some more like commands and some more like options that make it a little less punishing and a little more like

923
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,620
You can you have you have ways to like sort of

924
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:16,260
You have moments in the game where you can kind of like take a breather and sort of set yourself up for what you want to do next

925
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,460
It's not like

926
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,140
The in the alpha version you would beat a level and it would immediately put you into the next level

927
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:25,780
And if you weren't like set up if you haven't like planned on exactly what state you wanted your game to be in

928
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:29,380
You would get there and you'd be like it's already too late. I've already fucked up

929
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:36,500
It's like uh like those old sierra adventure games where you can make like yeah, I was I was good. I was I was gonna fuck you six hours in

930
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:41,780
Yeah, I was gonna I was gonna mention those. It's like you need to know the exact thing to do

931
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:48,180
Like in those old adventure games. Yeah, the the alpha version is you you literally to the way that you

932
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,220
Could beat it is first you had to figure out like okay

933
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:56,820
What do I need to do to survive and then you would eventually figure out? Ah, okay

934
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:02,340
This is the goal and then you'd be like, okay, but to actually accomplish that goal

935
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:06,020
Okay, I I have to basically I just have to like

936
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:12,020
Trial and error over and over again and just try like slightly different strategies until I happen to find the one

937
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:16,900
That works and and means and and you have to and you have to execute it perfectly

938
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,340
And if you miss click any button at any point your strategy will be thrown off

939
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:24,340
You'll take damage that you can't afford to have taken and you'll be like well, there's no way I can win now

940
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,780
I gotta start over

941
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:31,540
Uh, very funny. I played another I played another game like that recently a few months ago

942
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,660
It's a wonder boy in monster lands

943
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,740
There is uh, no, I'm thinking of a boy in his blob

944
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,380
Yeah, this is okay. What's that?

945
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,940
This is like a this is like an arcade game

946
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:48,580
But they tried to do like rpg elements in it, but it's also like level level based

947
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:53,140
So like if you miss an upgrade like for example, I missed a sword upgrade

948
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:57,700
So once I got to a certain level it was like real impossible to beat the boss

949
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:03,140
So it's like I well by fucked up. So I guess I have to start the game over and get the sword

950
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,100
I'm adding I added a

951
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,660
okay because um

952
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,340
I added a command to phantom's revenge called scout

953
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:17,700
Which lets you look before you go to the next room you can use the scout command and it will tell you

954
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:22,900
How many enemies are at are like are going to be waiting for you in the next room

955
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:27,380
So like if you know what you're doing you can use that information and be like, oh, okay

956
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,380
Then I should I should I should set up like this

957
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:34,820
I should I should make sure that like this thing is is doing this thing before I go otherwise. I'll I'll die

958
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,420
uh

959
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,100
And that's me being very generous. I'm a generous developer

960
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:46,500
Uh, I'm I'm making dark souls here. You can beat it on your first try. You just have to pay attention to your environment

961
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:50,340
You know you just have to you just have to be aware of your surroundings

962
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,220
And you never have to take any damage. That's not true

963
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,940
Yeah, uh

964
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,380
the

965
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,500
Okay

966
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Enough of me gushing about my own video game

967
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,380
Uh

968
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:09,380
It's gonna be it's gonna be great though. It's gonna be so get excited everyone. Yeah, it's so fucking good. It's so fucking hype

969
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:15,460
Are you gonna release on like itch and steam or whatever? I will put it on. Well, I don't think I'm gonna put it on steam

970
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,580
Okay, I wasn't I don't even know if you can put it on steam

971
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:23,220
I wasn't planning to sell it for money. I was just gonna put it on. I mean I'm gonna put it on my website

972
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,980
I'm gonna put it on itch. I guess I'll probably put it on new grounds because why not

973
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,700
Yeah, I've never had pretty well on new grounds

974
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:35,300
What can you Tom's game? Oh, yeah, Tom's yeah, I I've never uploaded anything to new grounds

975
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:38,900
So I don't even know how it works, but uh, yeah, I guess can you actually like

976
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,500
Export like a game maker games to html

977
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,620
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what you do. Oh, wow

978
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:52,180
I made I made one before I made a much simpler one for the champion my other comic a few years ago

979
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,660
And yeah, it's just it's an html

980
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,380
It's just goes it's just embedded in my in a page of my website

981
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:04,900
Man, I was uh, I was more active on new grounds in the old days when all you had was flash

982
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,020
Yeah, you could you could only make flash games

983
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,420
I saw

984
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,380
I was

985
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,900
That's just oh, I think

986
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:18,420
I mentioned this because this was you told me about this the interview the the the thing where laser bot was on the

987
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:24,740
Was on the the panel and he barely fucking got in at all until the very end. I was so

988
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:31,700
The fact that it was it was the clock gang the clock gang from like the old new grounds days

989
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:36,420
It's like I can't I can't believe the clock gang is still a thing even at the time

990
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:41,780
I remember when it was contemporary. I remember like being like baffled like what is the deal with this clock?

991
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:46,260
Like what is the point? What are these people thinking? Why are they doing this?

992
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:51,460
I think I I think it started with strawberry clock. He made a movie called B

993
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:57,780
And it was just a red B on a white background and like people like ironically liked it

994
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,780
I see

995
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,460
and

996
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:05,460
I don't know like the whole history of it, but it started, you know, I guess I guess I'm jealous

997
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:09,300
I guess I'm jealous that they were a bunch of like internet content creators

998
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,860
Who formed who formed a tight-knit click?

999
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,540
And then they fucking they web they weathered the storm together

1000
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,260
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, they didn't they didn't crack under pressure

1001
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,740
And I'll and I'll turn on one another

1002
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,820
And I'll quit and I'll rage quit the podcast and become and become bitter enemies

1003
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:33,620
Yeah, like like kermit and the muppets didn't like it. Yes, like that's who I was thinking of. Yes, like kermit and the muppets

1004
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,500
Nobody else

1005
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,500
No just kermit and the muppets

1006
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:45,460
The the the the great tragedy of the hubris everything that's ever happened in real life is also applicable

1007
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:47,540
details gets trolled so

1008
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,740
That's how it goes

1009
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,420
That is how it goes

1010
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,940
I would I would have to agree. I would have to agree with you on that

1011
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,980
Uh

1012
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,380
I gotta say, um

1013
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,580
I'm I'm really impressed with what gibb did because

1014
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:09,700
She actually had to like print out the books herself and like send them out manually

1015
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:14,500
Which is probably yeah, you did that too and I did that too

1016
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:18,100
Yeah, you did that too. Hey, I'm right. Hey, praise me

1017
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:25,620
No, no, I just I you're impressed with me. I've done that like three times. I'm way better. I'm way better than that

1018
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,340
No, okay. No, you're not. Anyway, um

1019
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:36,100
Uh, I just I just mentioned gibb because we were talking about the Kickstarter earlier. Yeah, but um

1020
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,380
Yeah, it's a lot harder than what I did

1021
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:44,340
Basically, all you have to do is just upload the um pdf and they like print it out

1022
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,980
for you

1023
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,420
Yeah, I've never done a um, I've never done a uh an amazon

1024
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:55,220
The the the the downside is that they take like part of the money

1025
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,940
Obviously, of course

1026
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:02,660
Well, I guess you would have to do if you printed it yourself too, you'd have to pay for a printing cost

1027
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:09,940
I'm yeah, I I'm sure I'm sure that it's cheaper and more efficient to like to print yourself in like large batches

1028
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,300
Because you know

1029
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,980
Amazon they're they're print on demand. So they don't they don't have like

1030
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:22,580
Backlog, right? You don't have to pay upfront to have to have like, you know, 500 copies produced to be sold later

1031
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:28,180
But you know with that with that I'm sure it comes an increase like, you know percentage that they take

1032
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:34,340
Yeah for that serve for that service, right, which is which is part of the reason it's 30 dollars because uh,

1033
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,100
sure

1034
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,620
um

1035
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:41,700
We wanted to make a profit from it. So we had to increase the price

1036
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,820
Yeah, I mean absolutely

1037
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,940
um, and if you combine the shipping costs and the um

1038
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:55,300
If you combine the shipping cost and the amount that amazon takes we couldn't sell it for like cheaper than like 20 dollars

1039
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,220
That's like that's like the the profit line

1040
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,940
Yeah, that's like the minimum we could sell it for

1041
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,260
Oh, yeah

1042
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:09,220
Yeah, and they wanted me to use like the like I wanted to make the book as big as possible

1043
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:13,220
But they if you do that they also like make you like use the more expensive paper

1044
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,340
Which also increased the price. So, yeah

1045
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,860
I see I see. Yeah, it's

1046
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,260
I mean, I'm sure amazon is

1047
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,980
a bitch and uh, you know

1048
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:29,300
It's set up to extract as much surplus value as they possibly can

1049
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:33,380
Yeah, thanks. Jeff. Thanks. Jeff Bezos, but uh, thanks

1050
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:37,540
Some some people some people complained about the price, but I made a poll asking

1051
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:44,820
Would you rather have a a smaller book with worse quality that's cheaper or a more expensive book that's better quality

1052
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:49,780
And most people said the latter. So I was like, oh, okay, whatever. Yeah, I think I would agree with that

1053
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,100
What are the dimensions of the book?

1054
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,500
Yeah

1055
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,980
Like, uh, what's the how big is it?

1056
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:02,340
Hang on. Let me see if it says it's it says on the amazon. It's like

1057
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,460
Going from memory. It's like, oh

1058
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:10,180
Eight eight eight eight and a half by about like 11 and a half. That's pretty big

1059
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:14,420
Yeah, that is pretty big. That's bigger. I was picturing like a

1060
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:21,380
Like a digest like a paper bag. Yeah. Yeah, I was I was picturing like digest size. Okay. That's pretty that's bigger than I thought then

1061
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,700
Yeah

1062
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:27,220
That's the biggest I could make it and if if I made it smaller

1063
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:29,700
I'd have to like cut up the panels and like rearrange them

1064
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,140
Oh, yeah

1065
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:35,780
Because because they're like because the original tales gets told pages are like vertically long

1066
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,660
Sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah

1067
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:42,660
I um, I was thinking, um, wait

1068
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,820
Fuck uh, fuck. Oh, no. What was I thinking?

1069
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,860
What were we just talking about? Oh, no

1070
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,860
No, uh

1071
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:54,740
Book sizes book sizes book sizes

1072

money

1077
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,060
Amazon it's gone. It's gone

1078
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,220
What a shame

1079
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,460
It was gonna be really good

1080
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,540
Oh, yeah, and people are gonna criticize or

1081
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,020
probably nobody

1082
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:27,540
Oh, what what is it? I I remembered I remembered I was I was gonna say that like no matter what price point you price that

1083
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:34,100
Somebody's gonna complain about like, oh, it's too expensive. But oh, yeah. Well, I don't I don't care about that

1084
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:39,940
You got you got it, you know, you got to price it how you got to price it and like it's largely not up to you

1085
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:44,100
How much it costs to get something made, right? Like it is what it is

1086
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:48,020
I know that's all I was gonna say. I was also gonna say if like, uh

1087
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:53,700
Uh, right wing people would probably say to me. Oh, you're you're like you're like on the left

1088
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,900
But like you use amazon. Isn't that like hypocritical?

1089
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,220
And they're right. Yeah, it is but I don't care

1090
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:07,540
I have to I have to make a deal with the devil to make tales get told become a reality

1091
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:11,140
That's what I have. No, but if you do that, then you won't get angel deals later in the run

1092
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,380
I don't care

1093
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:20,020
Yeah, you die now. Why are you doing it's a it's a it's a trap. It's a trap angel deals better

1094
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:24,340
You want those soul hearts the angel deals are better now ever since uh repentance or whatever

1095
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:29,540
Angel deals were good even back in the day. They were good, but they weren't good enough, you know

1096
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:34,020
Like it's it's better because devil deal items were just so good

1097
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,980
Yeah

1098
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:40,660
I think I just liked them better. I just I like I thought they were cooler

1099
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:44,100
I I think they're cooler too because you know, you got to wait a little longer for them and

1100
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:50,580
A lot of like the higher tier items like godhead and sacred heart are just they're just cooler to me than brimstone and like

1101
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:58,340
Yeah, it might just be that I'm more more familiar with the devil items. So I'm coming up brimstone. Ah, I get it

1102
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,620
It's like I get I think I get what this item's all about

1103
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,420
Oh

1104
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:07,780
Yeah, I I totally agree with whatever you said

1105
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:14,260
We're talking about binding of isaac. Yeah. Oh, I I think I figured it was something like that

1106
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,820
I think I I

1107
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:20,580
I figured you were referencing some like that was the only like video game

1108
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:25,620
I could think of would like heaven and hell shit. So I was like, yeah, they're probably well. What about uh guilty gear

1109
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,460
Heaven or hell let's rock. Yeah

1110
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,420
Yeah, but but you don't buy items in that

1111
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:36,340
That's true. You buy the one thing. It's missing characters

1112
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,220
for dlc

1113
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:41,460
Do you I don't know. No

1114
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:46,420
I hope not. I know there's a season pass. There's always a season pass is the fighting game

1115
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,140
I don't even know what that means

1116
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:54,740
You know, it's like post launch like the game comes out and they add new characters and you paid for them

1117
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:59,460
Oh and season pass is like you get whatever they release for the season. Yeah. Yeah

1118
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:05,700
Okay, yeah, we uh life is hell

1119
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:11,140
Uh, yeah, it's the common. It's the common state of games these days. Whatever

1120
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,380
It's what it is

1121
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:19,380
Well, well darn, so uh, what will what post launch content will uh will phantoms revenge have been?

1122
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,860
Uh

1123
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:26,740
Fucking hell. I'll add a I'll add a you should give them a Santa hat wait

1124
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:33,140
Wait, what if I added what what if I added skins where you could where you could swap phantoms is different ponies like you could play as keg

1125
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:36,900
Ooh, like you could play as that should be like honestly. This would be like honestly

1126
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:38,260
It wouldn't even be that hard

1127
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:43,940
I could I could probably add that in like a day if I wanted to like care. Yeah, like a hard mode character select

1128
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,020
Yeah keg mode

1129
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,460
You know what?

1130
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:50,180
It wouldn't even be hard. It wouldn't even be hard

1131
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,180
There you go. Oh, you heard your first books

1132
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,180
Is this is this a brony game? It is no

1133
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:03,700
It's it's a brony game. That's why it's that's why it's not a brony game grounds people are gonna get mad at him

1134
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:07,620
tbap is like tbap is like a pony show for anti-bronies

1135
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:15,300
What's an anti-brony I'm like a fallen brony like I'm like I took the devil deal. I'm like a black

1136
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,900
Yes, I'm like a blaggard. I'm like I'm like I'm like a I'm like a a blaggard to the bronies paladin

1137
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:29,540
Yeah, well, you that's how you say yeah, it is actually I only found out recently that you're supposed to pronounce black

1138
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:34,580
When I know that like the actual english word is pronounced blaggard

1139
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:39,620
But the I'm not sure if the d&d class is meant to be pronounced like the word or if it's

1140
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:44,340
If it's distinct enough as its own thing that you're just supposed to say black guard

1141
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:49,460
I think you can do either or but I know that in fifth edition are technically isn't a black guard or a blaggard

1142
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:52,020
They're actually called like the uh the oath breaker

1143
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:57,060
And I mean tomato tomorrow. Yeah, it's it's all the same difference

1144
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:01,620
It's technically not even supposed to be a player class because it's in the dmg, but you know people still play it

1145
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:04,100
I mean same with same with third edition. Yeah

1146
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,980
Yeah, they still want people playing dark knights or whatever you want to call them. No

1147
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,860
No, we can't have that

1148
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,740
Yeah, we can't we can't have that

1149
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:19,860
That sounds like a very bad idea. What are we talking about? Um, oh

1150
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,140
Kegmo

1151
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:29,300
Honestly the the the the like all my assets are like

1152
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,580
Like swapping out sprites is like the easiest part

1153
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:38,340
Making making sprites and swapping them out is the easiest part of development. It's not hard. What's hard

1154
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:44,740
Is just fucking is just having a bug and hunting for it for like six hours. I yeah

1155
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,940
That's that's the the part that's difficult. Everything else is cake

1156
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:52,340
That's that's always that always seems like something that isn't very hard to implement in the game

1157
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,660
but it's still like nice to have like uh

1158
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:57,140
Well as a cave story has a mode

1159
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:01,620
And like the re-releases where you can play as curly brace and all it does is change like

1160
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:05,380
Just changes the character spray and like she talks sometimes and that's it

1161
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:08,100
But it's fun because you know, I would like curly brace

1162
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:15,140
I would simply I would simply have to create a a palette swapped set of sprites

1163
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,500
and then just add like a little a little script into

1164
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:24,020
The the the game object that is because phantom horn is is an is an

1165
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,620
He's his own object in the game that has his own like behaviors

1166
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:34,660
so I would simply have to like and he has a set of of of um sprites sort of built into him that are like

1167
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:38,260
This is his normal sprite. This is his running sprite. This is guarding attacking

1168
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,140
all these various

1169
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:46,580
Things I would just have to add like another like a flag to be like if keg mode true

1170
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:52,500
Then use this set of sprites instead of these set of sprites. Yeah, and that would be it. It would that would just do it

1171
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,500
um

1172
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,500
Lamal

1173
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,700
Well, fuck. Hey, don't uh fucking ellias are cut all that

1174
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,980
Cut all that uh because I don't want anyone to know

1175
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:08,260
That should be a secret that feels like a secret that I just spoiled before I even thought to do it

1176
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:13,780
Now and now I don't know if I can even resist the temptation. Hey mom's the word. I won't say anything. I won't say nothing

1177
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:17,380
But I can't do it. I just want to credit him until

1178
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,660
Okay, okay

1179
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:24,340
But I can't but I can't do it. Okay. Here's the thing. I might tonic improv

1180
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,660
Here's what I'm gonna do. I might do it

1181
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:29,700
But I I won't let myself do it until the game is done

1182
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:36,100
There you go. And then once once it's done then maybe as a treat. Maybe I will be like, okay. I guess I can add keg mode

1183
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,940
Uh

1184
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:43,540
Perfect, it's one obviously it's once you beat it. You have to unlock it

1185
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,900
Uh

1186
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,100
Anyway

1187
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:52,500
What forget forget everyone forget everyone forget I said all that don't tell anyone about that

1188
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:56,100
That's the secret. No problem listener. That's just between that's just between you and me

1189
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,780
Mwah

1190
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:02,580
You mentioning cave story, which is one of my favorite games. It made me think like how much of the um

1191
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,300
content from

1192
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:09,380
The um later versions was actually made by uh, uh

1193
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:11,300
uh

1194
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,780
So I actually know quite a bit about this

1195
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:15,780
because uh

1196
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,780
because of reasons but um

1197
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:23,540
I know a lot of the uh the side like the extra content that nicholas added in the ports

1198
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:28,980
Isn't made by him, but a surprising amount is like a the wind fortress level

1199
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:34,180
Yeah, that's the one I knew about he made that that was just like a cut level from the game. Um,

1200
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,820
I know he did

1201
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:41,700
Uh, I he did the redrawn sprites that like, you know, they're higher res

1202
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,260
I think he if he didn't do them personally

1203
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,620
I know he supervised them or was like he gave the go ahead on them

1204
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:52,180
But uh, yeah, that's that's what that's one of the few things I like from the newer versions because they're they're

1205
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:56,900
They're in the same style and everything just I like them higher resolution. Yeah, I like them

1206
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,940
but I also think the original sprites have their own charm, but um

1207
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:06,500
Yeah, uh, all the other challenge modes all the other challenge maps are actually all fan fan creations

1208
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:11,620
That uh that nicholas like yes, uh offered to put into the game people accepted like uh

1209
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:17,300
And some of them I believe like some of the creators of the challenge maps actually got jobs at nicholas for some time

1210
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:23,460
Uh through through that, but yeah, most of the most of the side stuff. Uh, it wasn't made by pixel

1211
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,540
Well, I was I was wondering about the um

1212
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:33,620
The curly brace mode because I doubt he wrote the dialogue for that, but I'm not sure. No, I'm actually yeah

1213
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:37,220
I'm not sure either. He doesn't she doesn't really say anything too substantial

1214
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:44,180
But yeah, well, I remember it because I played it for like 10 minutes. Yeah, and I know she I know she does say stuff, but

1215
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:50,980
It's uh, it's cool nonetheless. Like I said, it's just a small little thing. They added that's like, uh, that's cool

1216
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:52,980
I'll play I'll play curly this time instead of uh

1217
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,620
step quote

1218
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,620
on honestly, I would uh

1219
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:02,020
Maybe I could give cave story a replay. I've played it before I've I've beaten

1220
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:08,740
I've beaten it all the way through even the secret ending which I beat. Yeah, I've beaten the secret ending which version

1221
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:14,900
On the pc the old old pc release. Okay, like the original freeware one

1222
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:17,780
Yeah, yes. Yeah

1223
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:19,300
um

1224
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:25,540
But it's it's so good. I could I could I could it's been long enough that I could maybe give it another you could definitely beat it in a day

1225
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:29,540
Yeah, it wouldn't be that hard. You could probably even do like a stream of it

1226
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:36,420
Oh, it's a good ass video game. It's really good. It's one of my favorites as well

1227
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,300
Yeah

1228
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:42,820
Man, I I know it's like really controversial, but I just

1229
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,740
The nicolas thing just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Yeah

1230
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:53,620
It's it's definitely. Oh, wait, you made a video about I did. Yeah, I made a video about it last year

1231
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:57,220
So because that was um, there was yeah, I watched there was a lot of

1232
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:00,260
Have you seen that cc?

1233
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,740
Um, if I have I don't remember it

1234
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:06,740
But that's one reason why I brought cave story up because I wanted to talk about that. Yeah

1235
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:12,500
Yeah, sure go ahead go be my guest, but uh, yeah, I made a video talking about like the whole nicolas

1236
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,340
uh

1237
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,820
Thing in relation to cave story because there's a lot

1238
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:19,780
nicolas is obviously not a very good company

1239
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:27,380
Uh, since that was a since jason shrier like uploaded that upload he published that expose on kotaku a while ago

1240
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:32,020
It's like tyrone order again that shitty ceo and all that jazz like the word culture sucks

1241
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,980
Uh, and that that is bad. Yes, it sucks

1242
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,820
But but uh alongside that just like it became more popular

1243
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:44,500
To to say that nicolas stole cave story from pixel when there's really nothing

1244
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,300
That proves that that even that

1245
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:50,020
happened at all

1246
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:55,700
It's yeah, I've I've I don't I don't remember if I watched your video enough or not

1247
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:59,540
But I've done a lot of research on it myself and yeah, I came to the same conclusion like

1248
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:04,260
It's not really clear like what the status is on that

1249
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:11,140
It but I can understand why people think that because nicolas acts like they made cave story when they actually didn't

1250
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,780
yeah, and you know, they're

1251
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:17,460
They're within their right to you know, like talk about the game

1252
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:22,420
And it too and they did do cave story plus that was all them

1253
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:28,020
For the most part, you know with with like oversight by pixel obviously, but yeah, it's it

1254
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,500
It just it's really

1255
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,460
It's really hard to to say they didn't

1256
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:40,900
Uh steel cave story when there's evidence of like other companies having terrible work relations with nicolas

1257
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,900
but like

1258
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:45,060
We we know you know that

1259
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:51,780
Uh, tyrone and pixel they still follow each other on twitter. So they're obviously on good terms. There's

1260
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:58,500
Pixel will always like talk about the game whenever whenever it's brought up by nicolas

1261
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,420
there's

1262
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,420
Really nothing

1263
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:08,100
Nothing to really go on a lot of people like to point to the um, have you ever played carol blaster either of you? Yes?

1264
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,740
Yes, I have

1265
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,260
It's a I have also played carol blaster is actually a really good game

1266
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:20,980
I I held off on playing it for a long time because I didn't because uh because I thought it wouldn't really like live up to cave story

1267
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:26,660
And it's not I mean not it it is no cave story. It's it's a it's yeah, it's it's going for a different thing

1268
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,740
It's not like yeah

1269
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:35,060
It's not in the same vein of cave story and like the this it's it's it's a it's a side scrolling like action shooter

1270
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:40,340
It's not like a a a metroidvania like yeah, it's exploration like story game, but uh

1271
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:47,860
Uh, it is a really good game and I like it a lot and a lot of people will point to like the plot of carol blaster being about like

1272
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:51,460
There's just like one tweet by this guy who's like if you ever

1273
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:56,580
I know exactly what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, or basically like he he just

1274
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:06,660
He equated the plot of carol blaster to real life experiences that may have happened between pixel and tyrone rodriguez the the CEO of uh

1275
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:15,460
But it's just but it really is just speculation and and it it's interesting how people come up with their own conspiracy theories like

1276
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:21,540
Oh, uh pixel put tyrone in the in the credits as special things, but he was being sarcastic

1277
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:25,700
Yeah, yeah, and he actually and he actually hates him. It's or whatever

1278
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:30,980
It's really strange because I feel because he's only he's only they're only following each other on platter

1279
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:37,060
So he's only following him on twitter to be polite or whatever. I that's another I really I really don't know what the make of

1280
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,540
everything because like

1281
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:42,100
Because like before I played carol blaster

1282
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:45,380
I just uh and like before I looked into the whole cave story stuff

1283
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:49,700
I really just did assume that they probably did take cave story because it's a really easy thing to believe but

1284
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:53,460
You know when I saw that he was thanked when tyrone was thanked in the

1285
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:59,060
In the game itself that kind of made me like raise an eyebrow a bit and kind of want to research it and um

1286
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:06,020
Well, I there's this um, there's this guy his name super something zero who can who really did a lot of the research

1287
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:09,540
And we wait super what zero super something zero

1288
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:12,020
Yeah, but what oh very funny so funny

1289
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,980
Yeah, he he's really the one responsible for a lot of the research for that video

1290
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:23,460
Uh, he has like a he has like a master thread. He posted on twitter like a little while ago that um

1291
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:30,900
That kind of chronicles like all the evidence for and against the the whole cave story nicolas thing and it

1292
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:37,700
It really just reads to me that that uh, I don't think I don't think uh pixel

1293
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:41,380
I don't think pixel got the game stolen from him

1294
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:48,100
Uh, maybe maybe nicolas has some sort of like rights agreement to exclusively publish it

1295
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:50,660
but um

1296
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:55,700
But that's not really the same thing as it being as the ip it's wholesale being stolen from the man

1297
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:58,260
I don't know. It's it's this whole snafu

1298
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:03,700
And not that said I don't think that like I don't think nicolas is a good company. I think they I think they suck

1299
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:11,460
But yeah, they they do suck and you should probably just buy carol blaster instead of getting like cave story plus or whatever on steam

1300
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:15,860
Yeah, you if you play cave story get the a free version

1301
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:20,340
Yeah, because there's a lot of mods you can find for the free version that that kind of spruced it up a bit

1302
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:24,420
If you if you're interested in that but if you want like the uh

1303
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:29,620
Original experience. It's always it's always still there. It's always on the the fan site

1304
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:37,060
Hmm. Uh, I did I did talk to someone on twitter who uh, I don't remember if it was super something zero, but um

1305
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:42,820
I did talk to someone who emailed a pixel and they said something like

1306
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,300
Caves uh nicolas um got the

1307
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,420
they have like the um

1308
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:56,100
Similar to what used to like the publishing rights or something like they um have uh

1309
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:03,700
Uh, they're like allowed to use the characters. I know that because they uh because they show up in a bunch of nicolas's other games

1310
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,380
Yeah, I'm trying to find exactly what he said

1311
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:15,220
But uh, they're allowed to use what what quote and curly yeah quote curly brace the doctor ballos, whatever

1312
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:24,820
Whoever whoever really they like the the characters from the games. They're ballos. Is that the that's the that's the secret villain of the game spoilers everyone

1313
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:31,460
Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, I thought I thought you were talking about ball rock. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, they're definitely not allowed to use ball

1314
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:34,820
He's the only one they didn't get in the in the divorce

1315
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:40,100
Wait, okay. Yeah, you're telling you're telling you're telling one of those patented lies again

1316
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:43,780
One of those patented tectonic problem. I can't help myself

1317
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:47,380
I'm just so unaccustomed such trickery

1318
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:53,860
I thought you were serious at first. No, no, I think I think ball rock even is in someone like this

1319
01:30:55,300 --> 01:31:00,340
Uh, like spinoff games that they made like the good listen. I'll give you I'll trade you

1320
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:07,060
I'll trade you all the other characters. Just give me ball rock. No deal. I can never have ball rock in the um

1321
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:14,580
In the physical version of cave story plus they released on switch like years ago. They came with uh, they came with like a bunch of goodies

1322
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:19,300
Uh, one of them was like a keychain that would be it would be uh, it was either

1323
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:24,340
Quote curly brace or bow rock and I got a little bow rock keychain. I still have it

1324
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:28,820
I wanted the curly brace one. That's pretty good. But uh, bow rocks pretty cool, too

1325
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:35,540
Yeah, I agreed. Did you play the original v version of cave story because I was like really bad

1326
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:40,660
That's how uh, that's how I first ever played the game. And yeah, I like released in a pretty rough state

1327
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,900
But I think they fixed it up in some way

1328
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:45,940
Yeah, a little bit

1329
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:47,860
actually

1330
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:51,540
That's sort of what happened to me. I heard the I heard the we version was coming out and

1331
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,340
I was like, oh, I should play the original first

1332
01:31:55,460 --> 01:32:00,180
I so I I I played it at the same time as the we version, but I didn't play the we version

1333
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:02,740
I think I thought but I did I did later and it sucked

1334
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:06,420
I think I've played every every version of cave story

1335
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:12,100
Uh, that's that's been released in some regard like I played the free war one. I played the we were one

1336
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:14,180
I played the the steam port

1337
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:16,900
Uh, I did you play it? Did you play the one on psp?

1338
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:20,660
Yeah, no, because that was that was that was a fan one, right?

1339
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:23,540
I know there's yeah, there's a fan one on the psp

1340
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:28,420
And I want which version I really want to play is the fucking someone ported it to the Sega Genesis

1341
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,500
So I really want to play that one

1342
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:32,820
Oh, I played I played some of that actually

1343
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:38,500
That's that's really cool. I'd love I love it if someone could port it could port it to the the SNES

1344
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:42,580
Yeah, I actually played it on my uh, Genesis mini

1345
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:47,620
I have I have a SNES now my old roommate gave me his his super nintendo. I just gave you one

1346
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:52,100
He just yeah, he just didn't want it anymore or he he he was trying to pack light

1347
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:55,540
And he was just like anyone want my super nintendo. He only had like three games for a thing

1348
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:58,820
He had like super mario kart. Not bad, which I don't like

1349
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,540
It's definitely the first mario kart

1350
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:06,020
Kirby Kirby superstar, which is a plus. Oh, that's that's an amazing game

1351
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:09,940
Yeah, yeah, so that's a winner and actually I think it might have just been those two

1352
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:14,020
So I was a little I was you know, pretty disappointing, but I mean he had one good game. So, you know, all right

1353
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:16,660
Yeah, I'll take all all for free. That's a pretty good deal

1354
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:22,900
My friend my my friend did that with his dream cast. He just sent me his dream cast because he doesn't play it anymore

1355
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:26,740
Well, one of my friends was offloading his like Genesis games

1356
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:33,780
And he gave me like all three sonic games like a spider-man game and like a quack shot the donald duck game actually and uh

1357
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,260
And some other like playing game. It was like

1358
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:41,060
It's like, oh, oh, wow. Thanks. And they're all in like the cases. He's like, it's like how much you want for him

1359
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:43,380
He's like, oh 20 books

1360
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:50,260
It's like, oh word. Thanks. I still have those line around somewhere. Make it 19. Make it 19. All right

1361
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:53,780
You drive a hard bargain there. Yeah, pretty cool

1362
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:58,020
Yeah, I still have my uh, super nintendo from when I was a kid

1363
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:02,420
I I have it. I have it packed away. I bought a um, I bought a super nt

1364
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,460
like a few years ago, which is basically just like a

1365
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:11,220
It's it's like a console that emulates the hardware to like a very fine level

1366
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:18,260
That uh, that like upscales at the 1080p. It's very it plays like original cards. It's really cool. It's a really cool piece of tech

1367
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:23,300
And uh, yeah, I've and I got a I got a flash cart a little while ago too

1368
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,300
So I really don't have a need for my old

1369
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:26,500
SNES carts

1370
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:30,100
But you know, I like to keep them around because a lot of them I've had for a really long time

1371
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,100
I

1372
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,100
So I fucking I

1373
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,100
I think I sold my I know I sold my NES

1374
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:39,860
Yeah, which was really fucking stew. I sold the fucking game stop

1375
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,300
Yeah, I was

1376
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,300
I wasn't idiot stop

1377
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:49,540
I wanted to buy like PlayStation games or something. So I sold my NES and a bunch of my

1378
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:56,020
Old cartridges. I even I sold Kid Icarus, which was a kind of rare game. I think they gave me like eight dollars for it

1379
01:34:56,980 --> 01:35:03,060
So that was stupid. Yeah, they gave me like bullshit for that. I might have sold my super my old super nintendo 2

1380
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:06,820
Uh, I don't even remember. I don't think I have it anymore

1381
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:11,460
Uh, I didn't have that many games. Anyway, I have like mario rpg

1382
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:17,780
Sue secretive mana. Those are probably not that rare. It's not rare, but they're definitely expensive

1383
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:21,060
Yeah, fuck

1384
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:28,420
You're uh, wait, if you if you don't mind biting the bullet, you could definitely look into getting like a secretive mana and mario rpg

1385
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:35,140
Looking into getting away. Look into getting like a flash cart or something

1386
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:39,620
They uh, oh man secretive mana on the super nintendo

1387
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:46,820
50 60 bucks 60 bucks for one of those. Yeah, a lot of the the square games are pretty expensive

1388
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:49,540
Um

1389
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:55,220
Or everyone knows how expensive earthbound mario rpg is a hundred is over a hundred. It's like a hundred to a hundred fifty

1390
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:58,820
I think chrono triggers around that same price too. It might be even more. Yeah

1391
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:01,860
No

1392
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:06,020
It's a mix of nostalgia and covet covet spiked a lot of game prices

1393
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:14,420
Well, it's um, have you seen have you seen the I think carl yobbs just put out a video about like the like the

1394
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:20,180
The the the bubble right then that company from wada. Yeah. Yeah, I was um, I watch uh

1395
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:26,580
Pathy nes punks like podcast say does with uh with his friend ian and they've been talking about this stuff for years

1396
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:31,780
But it seems like it's finally getting mainstream, which is uh, which is good because it is a it's a racket

1397
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:35,780
For those unaware watch the video. It's a great vid

1398
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:42,260
Yeah, I was I was pissed off because there were so many articles about oh this copy of super mario

1399
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:46,420
Told for two billion dollars and i'm like, okay, I don't fucking yeah

1400
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:51,140
It's just the it's just the same three people like buying and selling it back to each other to try and like

1401
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:56,660
Create a market that didn't exist. It's the same thing that happened to like comic books and stuff. They're just finally moving on to games

1402
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:01,380
Yeah, it's it's uh, it's nuts. I wish it wouldn't um

1403
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:05,780
Because you know, they're sealed games and uh

1404
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:12,180
And most people don't have like sealed box copies of mario 64, but that's not gonna think that's not gonna

1405
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:14,420
Stop people from thinking that they're sitting on gold

1406
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:17,540
On their like nhl 95 or whatever

1407
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:24,980
Yeah, yeah, my my normie my normie six. Oh, sorry my normie sister texted me and was like

1408
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:30,260
Oh, this guy sold super mario 64 for a billion dollars. We still have that game and i'm like, yeah, but

1409
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,980
It's like not sealed and

1410
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:38,740
That shit soup and also the scam thing which I didn't know about but I was still like suspicious

1411
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:48,180
Wow, yeah a SNES a SNES sells for like 200 bucks. So pretty good for pretty good pickup on that. Yeah, that what's if

1412
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,900
You can really like go

1413
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:57,780
Like super nerd into it because there's like different types of super nintendo's like like uh on the inside

1414
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:00,260
there's ones there's ones that um

1415
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:04,100
There's ones that like really hardcore

1416
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:12,100
Retro people really are out looking for it's called like a one chip SNES, which basically it

1417
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:15,540
Outputs the the colors a little better. I think

1418
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:21,220
Uh, yeah, it was like a later model, but it's still like the fat SNES

1419
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:26,740
And then there's the uh the smaller like more compact version. I don't know which one you have but uh

1420
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,860
I don't know either

1421
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:32,740
What did I miss

1422
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,740
Hey, give Gibbs here

1423
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:38,340
The old the old the old one is more angular and square

1424
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,980
And the new one is like rounded

1425
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:43,300
Yeah, we've just having a jet button

1426
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:49,540
And like in the middle you pushing it lets the game pop up if if so that was mine

1427
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:52,500
That was mine in in when I was a kid that had the middle. Yeah

1428
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:56,820
We've talked about any things

1429
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,820
All right, I'll get it out of the box. Go find it right now

1430
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:07,620
What is this button from uh, it says super nintendo or uh, uh

1431
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:14,020
I almost called it. I was like as as the brits would know what a super famicom by the voice is called in the super nintendo over there

1432
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:20,500
Yeah, wait, I think the only difference is the the controller has color. Yes buttons

1433
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:26,420
Yeah, you guys got the colorful you got the colored buttons, which I never had a super nintendo

1434
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,500
But a friend of mine did and I was like, oh

1435
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:31,620
That's not like the angry video game nerve. The fuck is that?

1436
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:38,580
It a lot of people really prefer the colored buttons on the uh on the super nintendo looks really nice here

1437
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:42,820
I I like the colors a lot, but I really I really like the lavender

1438
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:49,780
Colors they went with on the uh on the american version and I like that half of the color half of the buttons are concave

1439
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:55,220
This this button. Yeah, this one does have this one does have the centrally jack button

1440
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:00,020
Yeah, so is that good or bad that that means it's it's like a model one

1441
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:05,940
It could be a one chip. I highly doubt it is one because they're like a later version or whatever

1442
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:11,300
I don't know. I don't know if mine is a one shipper not, but it's the old uh box model

1443
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,900
And yeah, I do think the concave buttons are better

1444
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:17,700
Hmm true

1445
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:22,100
Yeah, you'd have to you'd have to like open your you'd have to open the super nintendo to

1446
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:24,660
To even like know if you had a one chip

1447
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:28,580
It's it's really this is stuff that like really doesn't matter because you know

1448
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:33,700
You're gonna be you're gonna be hooking up your super nintendo through like composite through like a crt. So it's not really gonna

1449
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:36,580
It's not really gonna

1450
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:46,340
I actually have a s video cable for my super nintendo, which is better than yeah, but not as good as

1451
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:51,780
Uh rgb. Yeah, I think uh out of the box s video is probably the best

1452
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:56,100
I think it's the best the super nintendo can do without like modding now. We're getting really heady

1453
01:40:56,820 --> 01:41:02,020
And I I think I think some models of the super nintendo have rgb built in

1454
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:04,740
Maybe some of the later ones don't

1455
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:11,380
Maybe yeah, maybe I don't know and uh back back to cave story. I was looking for the um

1456
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:16,180
The guy I talked on twitter with and he posted this email because he emailed pixel

1457
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:21,060
Yeah, I I still distribute if you were cave stories from my site. This is a con

1458
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,940
This is a continuation with the special permission of nicholas

1459
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:26,820
Yeah, it

1460
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:29,940
Like like I remember this because this was um

1461
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:37,620
This I think this uh this got passed around when uh when nicholas did like a cease and desist on some sort of like fan

1462
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:45,460
Uh like decompiler mod for cave story, which sucks that they see indeed that's like it's shitty and they suck

1463
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:50,580
But it doesn't like it doesn't prove they stole cave story or anything

1464
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:54,580
I don't know. Yeah, who stole it. I know carol blaster

1465
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:58,980
Uh cool the guy who made carol blaster also made cave story, right?

1466
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,860
Have you played carol blaster kid but not cave story?

1467
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:04,420
No, but I have seen

1468
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:06,820
An analysis video about it

1469
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:09,460
Oh, that small youtuber

1470
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:12,340
And it was really looked pretty cool tectonic improv

1471
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:17,380
Did you watch the matthew metosis video on carol blaster? I think that also

1472
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:24,260
My favorite my favorite matthew metosis video is when he uh did a video on

1473
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:28,020
The sonic james collection. Oh my god. That's such a great video

1474
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:32,820
And he uh, he he talks one part is where he talks about

1475
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:37,220
The character come character is coming out of rouge the bat bats vagina

1476
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:41,380
But he says he says like no nonchalant. Yes that it's like hilarious

1477
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:45,860
Or when he's talking about tails taking a stinky poo poo in his diaper. It's

1478
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:49,940
It's probably it's it's it's it's as funny as video

1479
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:52,740
By far

1480
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:56,900
Yeah, uh, I should give it a rewatch. I haven't seen it. You should oh, there's uh

1481
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:59,780
Has he made anything recently?

1482
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:04,820
You mean the the last one he made was eight months ago. So no, I think I've have you heard what's going on with him

1483
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:10,260
No, no. Oh, uh, yeah that well after he released the meta micro videos

1484
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:12,180
video

1485
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:16,980
He he announced on his like patreon that he's gonna he he's gonna like stop making videos

1486
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:20,020
To uh, why he's making a game

1487
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:23,140
Okay, I've seen some of those streams

1488
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:26,020
I didn't really click on I clicked on one of them and he was like

1489
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:31,780
Working with like a castlevania thing and he was talking through his process of figuring out movement

1490
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:36,660
Yeah, he he wants to focus. He wants to focus on like game dev for a bit

1491
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:42,660
And like uh, like maybe I'll go back to making videos at some point, but I'm not interested right now one of those like

1492
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:46,100
It's probably a long time

1493
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:48,260
Yeah

1494
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:54,100
Yeah, I I always got the feeling like the fact that his videos were so slow. I got the feeling that he was maybe like

1495
01:43:55,060 --> 01:44:00,740
Thinking about others and he's he's talked in some videos about how he wanted to like write for video games before

1496
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:03,220
And I was like, maybe he's

1497
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:07,220
I guess I wondered like if he would ever like try to do like dev stuff

1498
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:12,820
So I guess that's not a huge surprise. Yeah, good for him. Yeah, I'm excited to see what the sort of thing because like

1499
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:14,580
Uh

1500
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:19,860
If anyone is behind the design of a video game someone like him

1501
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:27,220
You know presuming, you know, the game is the sort of game I would like it would be very well made it would be very considered

1502
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:35,140
I disagree you disagree critics critic critics good critics don't make good artists all the time

1503
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:39,940
Sometimes sometimes it just doesn't that's the that's the fear. Uh, maybe

1504
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:46,660
Maybe I would I would think that his his approach is very thoughtful like he wants everything to have a purpose

1505
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:52,980
I'm it could I'm not saying that he definitely won't make a good game, but I'm not

1506
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:56,180
I don't I mean, oh, there's others just have to see

1507
01:44:56,980 --> 01:45:02,980
It's not I don't know many other like examples of critics making games. I know yatsi did but I haven't

1508
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:09,540
I haven't really looked at that. Yeah, that that's that's actually the first thing I thought of when you mentioned that

1509
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:12,180
about critics making their own games

1510
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,500
Uh

1511
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:21,140
I've only played the one yatsi game and it was really good. He's definitely aware of the uh of of that idea ben

1512
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:23,940
When he's like when he's like, I'm didn't say

1513
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:28,980
He wasn't I'm not saying I'm not saying you weren't not aware, but okay

1514
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:32,260
I'm not saying that you weren't saying that I was saying

1515
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:38,340
That he doesn't know I'm not saying anything about that. I'm on a podcast. Okay. Well, I mean well me either Ben

1516
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:40,980
You've like critiqued certain things before

1517
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:44,020
And then you're making a game

1518
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:48,900
Really, and you know tom is also making a game and he critiqued my little pony. I've never

1519
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:52,660
I've never criticized anything. I've never criticized anything

1520
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:57,860
In plus I have only ever been criticized anything

1521
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:04,580
Uh, remember in the that was the whole thing with my little pony was that I only said it was good

1522
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:08,180
And I never said it was bad because that's what everyone wanted to hear

1523
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:11,300
Uh, and and if you said that it was yeah

1524
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:15,140
If you said that all you got to do is make a little pony ose and have her say this episode

1525
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:18,500
Is really good and here are some things I liked about it and everyone goes yay

1526
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:24,180
Eleazar Eleazar go back go back show is real go back Eleazar watch the entirety of t-bap

1527
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:27,860
Clip out like a clip show of every time ben said yeah, I don't like it

1528
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:31,940
Or excuse me every time phantom horn said I didn't like it

1529
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:37,620
If you don't do that Eleazar it will just prove that I never said that damn it if you don't include

1530
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:41,700
If you don't include any clips like that it will just mean that there were none

1531
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:44,420
I don't like my little pony because it's for children

1532
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:50,340
I don't like you because you're for children. I don't really like the process. What does that be podcast because it's you know

1533
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:54,740
It's for children. It's not really. I don't I don't I don't I don't really like myself either

1534
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:04,100
Oh, I want to say one I want to all want to see the fuck. I can't talk. I want to say one last thing about cave story

1535
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:08,820
Okay, is that regardless of whether Nicholas stole it from him or not is

1536
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:14,100
It's still like a way worse deal that he got for that than caro blaster because

1537
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:19,940
For caro blaster. I think play is unpublished it. But like like, um

1538
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:23,140
He still like owns all the rights to it

1539
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:26,980
And gets money from it. Where whereas with Nicholas, it's like

1540
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:29,460
people think like

1541
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:33,860
Like tyrone tricked him or something into signing a bad contract. I don't know if that's true, but

1542
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:37,140
it might be because it feels like

1543
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:39,860
they

1544
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:41,940
Are more involved with it than they should be

1545
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:44,900
Which I think everyone already knows but yeah

1546
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:52,660
Possibly, but you know, it might just be that he's not really interested in like working with cave story anymore because

1547
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:55,860
I mean, I think I think that is like 15 years old

1548
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:58,740
I think that's more likely because

1549
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:03,060
Another thing like people come up with conspiracies conspiracy theories about is like

1550
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:08,580
Oh, uh pixel wants to make a sequel to cave story, but Nicholas won't let him. I don't think that's true

1551
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:15,860
That's that's out of I've heard that before and out of all the things that people say about about this controversy

1552
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:19,300
That is probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard because yeah

1553
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:21,940
Out of out of anything

1554
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:28,580
Everything that could possibly happen with that game. Nicholas would love if there was a cave story too

1555
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:31,700
Because that that should just sells

1556
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:36,100
That's that's yeah, you know that they obviously don't want to make it themselves and pixel

1557
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:38,740
Probably doesn't want to do it either. So

1558
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:41,540
They're milking the original

1559
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:45,140
Yeah, and the game is already finished. It's

1560
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:49,860
Find the way it is. Yeah. Oh, did you ever put did you ever play the 3d version because I didn't dude?

1561
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:51,860
I did play minecraft. I played it

1562
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:57,060
I've also played minecraft. It's a 3d version of caves stories caves stories

1563
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:00,260
that you apparently

1564
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:03,060
Apparently pixel also helped with that one. I don't know

1565
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:09,620
It just that that that is what you just said about how Nicholas would love to make a cave story

1566
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:13,780
Sequel that's kind of what they did with the 3d one. They're like, oh, we want to make this

1567
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:18,260
But I doubt pixel like actually cared like he was probably like, oh, this is a stupid idea

1568
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:24,020
But they're they want me to help with it. So I guess I'll help now. Did Nicholas make it or did oh, okay

1569
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:28,020
Sorry, I thought nippon Ichi made it, but I think they just published it. I think

1570
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:34,100
Yeah, you're right. I have no idea what any of this is about and I want to talk about minecraft now

1571
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:39,700
Why well it's it's time for minecraft. I'm looking at I'm late. I'm looking at brown bridge

1572
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:46,180
I'm looking at I'm looking at the matthew mitosis stream. He's playing as like simon belmont and he's just like jumping around

1573
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,980
on a plane

1574
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:53,540
Okay, maybe this is too early. Maybe it's too early to say this

1575
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:59,540
I'm not impressed with what I'm seeing. Yeah, the stream isn't much

1576
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:04,500
I think he's just talking to the viewer about like so I'm trying to think about how to

1577
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,020
You know do movement and and collision with platforming

1578
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:13,380
And he's he's doing all that like walking through so it's it's not visually interesting

1579
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:16,740
Here's here's what I want to know. Does he have a night? Does he have

1580
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:24,260
Okay, first impressions and maybe I'm totally off base. This does not fill me with confidence not because like oh, there's not many graphics or anything

1581
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:26,020
it's because

1582
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:31,060
It he's he's fucking around with mechanics. Like how do I build a state machine? It looks like he

1583
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:33,940
Is experimenting with like mechanics

1584
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:36,660
And like how to mechanically build a game

1585
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:42,340
Which makes me think that he doesn't have like a game in mind that he like he doesn't have like an idea for a game

1586
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:45,060
He wants to make like he's just kind of trying to figure it out

1587
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:48,660
As he goes from what I understand on the patreon post

1588
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:52,740
he like has like a couple of ideas for games that he wants to make and he's uh

1589
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:55,380
He started off working on one

1590
01:50:55,860 --> 01:51:00,740
And then like his his I his plan was that like if he ever came across like a

1591
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:07,300
Insurmountable problem in one project. He tried to move on he'd move on to another one and see and see how that worked

1592
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:09,540
So I think he's on like the second one

1593
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:14,180
Of like his couple of ideas and that one is just like a straightforward action platformer

1594
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,140
You know or like a castlevania or whatever

1595
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:21,380
Which is why which is why he has like the rector model

1596
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:28,660
Yahtzee made a really good castlevania like or metroidvania. So I bet I bet you can do it too

1597
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:31,060
I should play that

1598
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:35,300
Uh, stop not stalker poacher poacher is really good. It's a really good little game

1599
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:38,260
It'll probably be a while before we see anything

1600
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:43,140
From this game of his which is kind of which which is a little sad because you know

1601
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:47,460
That means there won't be any videos and you know, a matthew metosis video is is always

1602
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:50,180
I feel like I've got my fill of matthew metosis

1603
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:54,420
I I like seeing him his videos and the way he talks about things is

1604
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:58,820
Is gooder than the his peers I would say

1605
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:00,420
uh

1606
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:02,420
But like in general

1607
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:05,940
I know about video games now. I don't really need

1608
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:10,260
Analysis videos about them. It's just sort of would be nice, but

1609
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:12,580
I don't know

1610
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:16,340
I'm too smart. Yeah, I feel I feel like the meta micro videos

1611
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:23,620
Was uh was already kind of like a a sign that he was probably done. It feels like a final video, you know

1612
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:30,100
I'm not I'm not shitting on my matthew in particular, but I'm just uh

1613
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:33,780
I'm kind of done with like video essays personally

1614
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:39,060
Like I don't want to watch like people talk about some shit for like three hours

1615
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:41,860
I might as well just actually like play the game or watch the movie

1616
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:48,100
I have I have I have contracted the number of like youtubers who's like video essays

1617
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:52,660
I will watch there are still a few who I will like always watch anything they make

1618
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:55,540
Uh, but that that number has gone down

1619
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:57,780
significantly

1620
01:52:57,860 --> 01:53:00,820
I love it when people make like eight hour videos about

1621
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:03,620
Stuff like that's like a full work day

1622
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:07,540
It's perfect for me because I listen to stuff. I've been

1623
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,580
I've yeah, that's true. I should do that

1624
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:12,820
This week I've listened to

1625
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:15,700
The uh the that one guy the patrician tv guy

1626
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:18,820
He made this this the set the seven hour video about morrowan

1627
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:21,300
And then he just I just finished like the other day

1628
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:24,020
I listened to the uh the 12 hour one about oblivion

1629
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:29,380
Can't wait for the 26 hour one about skyrim. I've never even played any of these games

1630
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:34,180
12 hours is actually the cap on like uploads on youtube

1631
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:37,780
So if it was 26 hours, it'd have to be three parts. Yeah

1632
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:42,580
I noticed that it's exactly 12 hours long. It's 1200

1633
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:44,900
And I was like, is that a coincidence?

1634
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:50,100
I didn't I didn't even know there was a limit because I maybe they change 20 hour long videos before

1635
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:53,380
Yeah, I have to maybe they changed it again

1636
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:58,660
I think it's 12 hours at least maybe maybe it is when you're uploading stream vods

1637
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:02,820
I am pretty sure in fact that I have seen like one of those memes like oh

1638
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:08,020
It's a thing that it happens for 10 hours except it was 100 hours. Oh, you're you're right. You're absolutely right

1639
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:12,420
Remember when uh the youtube limit was 10 minutes

1640
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:18,180
Hell yeah, but if you those were the days, but if you're like role on youtube was director

1641
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:23,060
You got to ignore that that was like your little director. Yeah, like early

1642
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:27,620
I've never even heard early youtube had this like thing where like you picked like uh

1643
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:31,460
I think it was like a genre of video you would upload and they all got different

1644
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:36,340
Yeah, I know right. This is like so crazy to think about they all got like little perks

1645
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:43,380
Uh, the only one I remember is that if you if you yeah your class like you speck into a class on youtube.com

1646
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:49,300
And one of the classes was director and since you're a director you make movies like oh, okay

1647
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:56,340
So as as a director you get to abscond the upload limit and upload videos. I think as long as you wanted

1648
01:54:58,340 --> 01:54:59,540
Well, I don't remember that at all

1649
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:01,780
I all I remember is the partner program

1650
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:03,620
And they used to

1651
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:08,740
They used to make it so you couldn't make custom thumbnails unless you were in the partner program. Yes, that's all I remember

1652
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:12,900
I remember I remember that as well. I I don't think I did it myself, but I do

1653
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:15,300
remember

1654
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:22,340
The the the technique of putting an image at the very middle part of a video so that it would become the thumbnail

1655
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:28,100
Yeah, so while you're watching it, it'll just be oh the thumbnail image for like five ten seconds

1656
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:32,100
Yeah, people tried to get around the system

1657
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:39,780
It's it's really crazy to think how archaic shit was back then but also how shitty everything is now with youtube

1658
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:43,380
Yeah

1659
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:45,780
Now it's shitty in more deliberate ways. Yes

1660
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:52,180
Now it's shitty in ways that serve them. I think

1661
01:55:53,060 --> 01:55:55,060
Oh, did you they uh

1662
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:58,660
The fucking the the the draw cast which is the name of the channel

1663
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,300
that has um oblivion fall

1664
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:04,260
and teleperte and ctole

1665
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:08,180
They um ctole messaged me. It was like, hey, can you help uh

1666
01:56:08,980 --> 01:56:10,740
spread this around

1667
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:13,380
And uh youtube just terminated their channel

1668
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:19,220
For like scam content. Yeah, I don't know what the hell that was about

1669
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:25,220
No reason at all that I could see thankfully it's back. I think they got it back. Yeah, it's it's back

1670
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:28,340
That's crazy, but like that was really bizarre. I've

1671
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:34,980
They just said they it was like it was like scamming or like two like a couple other things

1672
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:37,540
they said which is like just

1673
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:40,100
not even

1674
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:43,940
Just absolutely no logic behind it whatsoever that that that anyone could see

1675
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:48,180
So I guess it was just like a glitch or something or just uh

1676
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:52,660
I don't know a cosmic ray must have like flipped a transistor in there

1677
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:55,300
In there in there come in there

1678
01:56:55,300 --> 01:57:00,100
Super computers at the youtube headquarters and it and it made this happen. I also wish for a testium

1679
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:06,980
The isr on cast its gaze on the draw cast was it was over

1680
01:57:07,940 --> 01:57:12,260
It's back though now, right? Well, but it's back. So it's fine. All right. It's fine. All right. We're moving on

1681
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:17,540
Yeah, but the eye of that's the thing about the eye of sauron it looks at you and then everything's over, but then it's fine

1682
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:19,540
Yes

1683
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:21,540
There's a gonna be an episode of me

1684
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:24,260
on there soon

1685
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:26,660
We recorded it a while ago

1686
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:32,980
It's gonna be out the the the draw cast the draw cast animation. We had to make an animation real quick

1687
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:35,220
Oh

1688
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:42,500
And teleperty was on that one and of course and that was uh, well, that's not even fair. That's not even fair sure

1689
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:49,460
Uh, but I still made people laugh. So I think I win. I think I win my I didn't embarrass myself

1690
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:52,740
I thought I would but I didn't give one give one the moral victory

1691
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:56,660
Sure, sure

1692
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:59,860
Well, I'm jealous and then there was other like really good anime everyone else

1693
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:05,140
Aside from sito who is not an animator on that on that draw cast was incredible

1694
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:11,460
It's it's like it's like they're like professionals or something. They like draw for a living

1695
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:20,740
Imagine drawing for a living couldn't be me that's for sure

1696
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:23,780
Like literally it could not

1697
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:26,340
Fuck

1698
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:28,340
Fucking christ, dude, dude

1699
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:31,060
It's same

1700
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:35,780
I sneeze like that as well. I didn't think other people did

1701
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:39,620
I heard I heard you uh, I heard you have an internet troubles kid

1702
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:43,700
I was I was they were they worked out um

1703
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:47,220
And it's all it's really good. Actually. It was like

1704
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:54,500
30 25 to 30 megabit so megabytes per second upload, you know, whatever the thing says

1705
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:58,740
I'm not upload download, but that's still really good. Yeah

1706
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:02,180
Well, I mean we're at two hours

1707
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:08,740
So it's almost time for us to be moving on to voicemails unless you've got like anything you wanted to to talk about

1708
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:11,300
uh

1709
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:20,660
Well, uh cc tech you guys good with uh with starting up the voice the voicemail segment

1710
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:28,180
I would um of the procrastinator podcast. I would feel bad if I didn't if I didn't talk about uh a certain thing before

1711
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:31,460
uh moving on to voicemails because um

1712
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:35,540
Was the last couple of times the last couple of times on our 9 11

1713
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:42,260
Yeah, well, we actually did that earlier on. Oh, but uh, yeah. Yeah, too late. Uh, well, I guess I

1714
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:50,180
The last couple of times I was on this podcast I was uh between projects so to speak

1715
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:52,820
um, uh, but um

1716
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:56,820
And I really haven't been making a lot of videos recently, but I do I was uh

1717
01:59:57,460 --> 01:59:59,460
Involved in certain like collabs

1718
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:06,420
Lately, uh one of which was this uh this thing called gaming and the golden record. It's a bunch of like uh

1719
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:11,460
YouTube people came around and like were like the the basically the

1720
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:18,260
The prompt was like what game would you uh, would you send off the space to like have aliens discover it?

1721
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:20,420
You know like that uh super mario brothers

1722
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:24,820
Yes, yes, I'm sure uh, I I believe that was picked by someone

1723
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:27,700
But uh, I was I was involved in that video

1724
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:33,060
Uh, someone asked me and I acquiesced and then just uh just last friday

1725
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:36,740
Or uh a week ago as of this upload. There was another

1726
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:42,660
Another little collab where a bunch of people got together and made one minute long essays

1727
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:49,540
about basically anything and I um, I also was uh in that I talked about uh

1728
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:52,180
I talked about the b-52s the band

1729
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:59,460
Uh, and it's all it's all it's all uh back-to-back like yes the essays the video is all the essays together

1730
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:05,060
Yeah, and they like another minute remain. That's more of my speed because video essays are getting too long these days

1731
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:11,540
Yeah, that's like the whole I'd rather watch one. That's a minute. Yeah, it uh, I'm I'm I like the videos a lot

1732
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:16,740
I think uh the the editing for the uh the minute long ones are are really well done

1733
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:19,460
and in that like the

1734
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:26,020
The through line is is pretty clear even though like everyone just kind of did their own thing and didn't really like work together

1735
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:32,500
Uh, the editor hot sider. He did a really good job on that one and also I like the the golden rickard video as well

1736
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:35,380
I was uh happy with my prompt

1737
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:38,180
All right, uh, I guess we'll put links

1738
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:41,380
Those down in the in the nice content

1739
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:47,300
Do they do yeah nice con nice content world world very proud of you

1740
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:53,540
I I need to get into more content creation, but uh, I'm too lazy. What game would I send out into space?

1741
02:01:53,700 --> 02:02:01,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, um fucking fans. I was revenge. Obviously. Yeah, uh, I got the tails gets trolled book

1742
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:06,180
I got it. I bought it. I have it now. It's on my shelf. Oh, you beat me to it. I'm so happy

1743
02:02:07,140 --> 02:02:09,860
I still haven't gotten it's been selling pretty well, which is awesome

1744
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:16,660
Me and laserbot haven't gotten our copies yet because uh, I ordered like free copy. Well, they're free except for the um

1745
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:19,940
Production cost so it was like 10 dollars instead of 30

1746
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:25,940
But they like they prioritize bought copies before um the free copies for authors

1747
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:26,820
so

1748
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:30,740
Me and laserbot haven't gotten ours yet, but I'm looking forward to that

1749
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:36,660
Yeah, it's it's it's cool. I I knew this technology existed where you put up a book

1750
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:41,940
Amazon prints it and sends it rather than you having to do any production

1751
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:49,140
Yeah, print on demand is uh, I mean, it's it's very convenient, but I I never really looked into it

1752
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:54,500
I was thinking about doing it for like my own comics, but apparently it's like it's better for

1753
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:57,700
Uh written words

1754
02:02:57,940 --> 02:03:02,900
Um, like the quality of the paper is not like oh, uh smooth like

1755
02:03:03,620 --> 02:03:05,220
uh

1756
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:07,220
Whatever you call it paper

1757
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:10,740
Manga paper not manga paper a comic book stuck

1758
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:14,900
This stuff and and the colors are a bit glossy the colors are a bit washed out, but

1759
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:20,020
Um, it's cool. It's cool seeing tales and and him getting trolled

1760
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:22,660
And all the events that that follow

1761
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:30,020
I actually had to edit the colors myself, but because in the first copy that I ordered, um

1762
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:35,700
Like, you know the parts where like luigi and the troll king are fighting in the cave and it's like really dark

1763
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:37,860
Oh, yeah, I looked at those

1764
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:44,820
That that whole part when I if you just put in the comic pages and print them as is that whole part is just like pure black

1765
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:47,460
Yeah, I so I have lightened up

1766
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:50,660
Yeah, I had to lighten it up manually

1767
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:55,540
And the the other complaint I have is that it's really finicky about which like files

1768
02:03:56,020 --> 02:04:01,300
It accepts if it's like inside the margins at all it like freaks out and it's like oh, you can't submit this

1769
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:04,180
So I had to like keep editing it over and over again

1770
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:07,140
And I I have like four or five test copies

1771
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:10,500
Because of that because I had to keep like changing it

1772
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:13,540
But I think yeah, yeah

1773
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:16,820
I think it turned out uh the final version turned out okay

1774
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:18,820
Yeah

1775
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:22,420
Well, I better get I better get one a bit of quick procrastinating

1776
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:31,860
Yeah, what what what comic book wall what comic book shelf is is incomplete is complete without tales gets trolled next to the vapors chapter two

1777
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:38,260
And don't forget your kato anthology book. Oh, I should got that a few weeks ago

1778
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:40,740
I haven't I haven't got mine either. You know, I haven't checked my p.o

1779
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:46,260
I haven't checked my p.o. Box in a while. So it could just be sitting in my p.o. And then soon the lord of ghosts comic

1780
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:49,220
Oh

1781
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:54,260
Yeah, congrats my my children

1782
02:04:56,260 --> 02:05:02,660
Uh, all right, so voicemail time I think before the voicemail I want to say one thing the reason I say

1783
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:06,180
The reason I say stuff like that is because of the first sonichu

1784
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:09,140
it uh, um

1785
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:11,300
issue where

1786
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:17,700
This is like the funniest uh sonichu thing in my opinion the the cover of the first one where

1787
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:24,580
Chris says go out my son and zap to the extreme and then sonichu says I will thank you father

1788
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:29,620
Yes, of course. I mean, of course. Sure, of course. I'm familiar

1789
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:32,420
I'm I'm familiar with the material

1790
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:38,500
It but that that's like the whole reason I like added that to my vocabulary because just because of that

1791
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:46,180
It's go it's go sonichu go out and zap to the extreme. I will thank you father when when chris read it for like the audio

1792
02:05:46,900 --> 02:05:50,900
When chris did like a video where she where she flipped through the page and like narrated it live

1793
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:55,860
The way that she said that she read sonichu's line was like I will thank you father

1794
02:05:57,060 --> 02:05:59,060
Just awful

1795
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:03,060
That I will zap to the extreme

1796
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:06,580
That sounds that sounds like her accent

1797
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:12,740
But yeah, a little bit the way I imagined it is like I will thank you father. I will

1798
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:15,780
Well, I would I mean in my head he just

1799
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:20,340
I originally in my head. He just sounds like sonics. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah

1800
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:26,900
Zap cool. Yeah roast juice hot. Yeah, we're gonna fuck. Yeah zap bow bow

1801
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:32,820
Team rocket. No, thanks. I I know. Yeah, sonica is team rocky, but uh

1802
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:40,180
I this might be controversial to the tales gets told fans because I know that the um the fan dub is like really popular

1803
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:45,220
But I always usually read the characters voices and like their actual voices

1804
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:50,260
Like uh, you know, I haven't actually heard the fan dub. So I I can't

1805
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:54,820
But I mean, yeah, I would imagine that they sound like their characters

1806
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:58,820
Uh, they they don't well some of them do but some of them don't like

1807
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:02,500
The fan dub gives sonic like a really nerdy voice and he sounds like

1808
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:05,140
Oh, yeah, take tales

1809
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:12,340
Uh, this problem can be solved without any feelings. It doesn't sound anything like that, but it's like a similar. Um,

1810
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:14,820
You know, I respect

1811
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:17,860
It sounds like a bold artistic choice and you got to respect that

1812
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:24,340
But it's it's it's funnier to read in like sonics actual voice because he says, you know, how it is, uh

1813
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:30,980
The tales is getting trolled. They're calling him gay and shit. He can't take it because it's like something that the actual sonic would never say

1814
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:33,060
and it's just funnier to

1815
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:36,500
Imagine it in his voice. They're calling him gay and shit. He can't handle that

1816
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:39,060
Yeah

1817
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:41,060
That's no good

1818
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:43,460
Remember kids if any trolls call you gay

1819
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:50,980
That's no good. They should get you should tell shadow. They should bring Joliel white back

1820
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:53,940
As the voice of sonic

1821
02:07:53,940 --> 02:08:00,260
To bring him back from the grave, you know, roger craig smith was gonna quit voicing sonic and I wish he did because

1822
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:05,140
Like he sounds okay and like sonic boom, but like other than that

1823
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:11,220
Uh, I don't really like his voice as much as the previous sonic voices. I think he's fine

1824
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:15,540
I'm just more I just want them to just fucking stick to a guy, you know

1825
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:18,020
And they've had roger craig smith for so long

1826
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:22,580
They might as well just keep them like imagine if mario's voice changed every like five years

1827
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:28,260
Yeah, uh, they've had uh roger for the longest so they might as well keep them

1828
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:31,940
I know they like cut a bunch of the other I think

1829
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:38,340
I thought I thought they would get like a different guy for like I mean, you know

1830
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:45,060
The boom continuity is different from like the game continuity and yeah, that's that that's that's that's why that's why I think

1831
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:48,260
Roger sounds best because it's like a different interpretation of sonic

1832
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:51,780
Yeah

1833
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:56,900
So I would assume they would have two different guys, but whatever

1834
02:08:57,700 --> 02:09:01,940
Um, well, they sort okay. Well, I don't I don't know. I was gonna say they did in the old days

1835
02:09:01,940 --> 02:09:06,260
But sonic didn't have a voice in the games me old days. Oh, yeah, that's true. He does

1836
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:09,620
Well, actually actually actually I I take that back because

1837
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:12,340
For um sonic underground

1838
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:16,580
They got julio white but that was that came out at the same time as sonic adventure

1839
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:18,900
So he actually did have two different voices

1840
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:21,300
and then later when they did is

1841
02:09:21,860 --> 02:09:25,940
When he gets a uh a bubble of air doesn't he say something?

1842
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:29,140
He talks in that doesn't he?

1843
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:36,500
You know in sonic cd when you uh, you're when you're right when you when you run out of time. He says i'm out of here. Yeah, yeah

1844
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:40,660
And I think I think a japanese woman voiced him there

1845
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:47,300
Bass the same japanese woman who's saying the um tutut sonic warrior thing. Oh, no, I think that was the same one

1846
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:50,660
This had her voice them there. That's pretty cool

1847
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:54,660
Yeah, all right. All right, if I remember correctly, I could be wrong

1848
02:09:55,380 --> 02:10:00,580
Let's let's get going. Let's go before you do the voicemail. I need to get some oh my god

Go. All right. Go like the way go get water

1851
02:10:10,180 --> 02:10:14,740
I'm gonna I'm gonna I've had enough. I've had enough. You're all misbehaving

1852
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:19,140
You're all you're all keep delaying the you're all

1853
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:26,100
You're all delaying the inevitable, you know and the thing about the inevitable is you should actually just rush headlong into it

1854
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:29,300
I'm excited in fact

1855
02:10:30,260 --> 02:10:32,260
Yeah, if if at all possible

1856
02:10:32,580 --> 02:10:34,580
If there's like a like a

02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:40,260

Right, so the theme of this episode is cooking personally

1872
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:46,740
I enjoy making fried rice because the recipe allows for so much variation and the ingredients are very affordable

1873
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:53,940
What kind of dishes do you like to cook? Uh fried chicken. I like to put chicken in the oven and cook it and bake it

1874
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:57,300
All right. All right. It seems like it's time for the voicemails

1875
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:00,020
Ben will you do the honors?

1876
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:05,060
No, you already did the honors. No, it's cute. I think someone else is done. Uh, that was a very uh

1877
02:12:05,620 --> 02:12:08,120
Succinct summary of an average pcp episode

You cannot deny or you cannot compete with this either empire. I crene I don't beat

Hey doid gazers come on over leave behind leave behind your sinful kiwi farm with come in come into the light

Leave the sith ways behind and join and join the path of the jedi fairway with your bloodstained past

1906
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:24,180
Like Cecil from fawn fancy forest time to become a paladin of the pcp

1907

02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:35,860
Yeah, that's what i'm saying

1909
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:40,020
You should you should have you should have banned in the white race and help us in that genocide

1910
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:45,220
Absolutely. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you definitely don't want to be white when we take power

1911
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:49,860
You want to be you want to be putting yourself as far away from that as possible? Yeah

1912
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:54,100
Next next one is called, uh

1913
02:14:55,540 --> 02:14:57,540
Fuck wait

1914
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:01,620
It's on the other page. I gotta look at what the other page is. Uh, it's called

1915
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:03,860
Uh

1916
02:15:04,100 --> 02:15:09,060
Eat trash die fast. Oh three two one go

1917
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:16,260
So if you died right now or wherever you spend the most time, how long do you think it would take for people to find you?

1918
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:20,980
Uh, yeah, my my roommate aka my dad is here. So he would find me

1919
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:25,060
I think it would take I think it would take a few days. I think that

1920
02:15:25,780 --> 02:15:27,780
Nobody would come into my room

1921
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:30,580
I mean

1922
02:15:30,980 --> 02:15:36,900
No, I think it would probably take probably munchie and kazzie would would would get suspicious

1923
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:41,060
About where I am because like, uh, we're supposed to we're supposed to lift

1924
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:43,860
Don't don't you have don't you have roommates or like

1925
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:46,020
Apartment mates?

1926
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:51,700
Well, they wouldn't well, they wouldn't come into my room. They wouldn't they like I said before like we don't like interact with each other

1927
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:55,940
Oh, okay. Uh, so so they would not come looking for me unless like it started to smell

1928
02:15:56,580 --> 02:16:00,100
Unless my body started to now they just think that was a classic ben saint move

1929
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:03,300
Uh

1930
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:05,460
Gotcha

1931
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:09,220
If I can be like if I can be more specific, I think it would take like an hour

1932
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:12,100
For my dad to know if I was dead

1933
02:16:14,260 --> 02:16:15,300
Uh

1934
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:17,300
Geez, no, look at me. Look at me

1935
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:21,620
People care about me enough that they'd find out I was dead within less than a day

1936
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:25,700
Yeah, I wouldn't like I mean there's there's both good and bad to that because

1937
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:31,140
The bad part is if my parents died, I would probably kill myself because nobody else cares about me

1938
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:33,540
Sorry tails if this looks emo to the viewers

1939
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:38,260
But uh, I think um, I think in the I think

1940
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:42,020
It would be less it would be less than a week

1941
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:47,620
I think just only because now I have um supposed I'm supposed to lift regularly

1942
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:51,140
And if I started missing my lifting schedule, then people would be like, where is he?

1943
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:56,180
Before that it would have probably taken like a week or more for anyone to be like haven't heard from ben in a while

1944
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:59,860
And there's a weird smell coming out of his room. That's different from the usual one

1945
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:02,500
Hmm

1946
02:17:03,300 --> 02:17:05,620
These smells are a bit different from the normal smells

1947
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:08,340
I think before

1948
02:17:08,980 --> 02:17:12,340
I think if it were like, okay in my old house

1949
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:17,940
It might maybe would have taken like a week for anyone to be like suspect something. I think here

1950
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:25,460
And except for that my my new schedule if I were on my old schedule here, it could be like a month or more because like

1951
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:28,260
Nobody would expect me to be anywhere

1952
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:31,140
None of my roommates would be like wondering where I am

1953
02:17:32,180 --> 02:17:34,180
They would be yeah, I would be here indefinitely

1954
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:38,020
But not would you would you skeletonize?

1955
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:43,060
I think so. Yeah, I think I if if possible. I would attempt to skeletonize

1956
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:49,300
Legend has it if you die and skeletonized come through the window if you die and skeletonized before somebody finds you

1957
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:52,500
You get to be live life as a skeleton. You come back to life

1958
02:17:54,020 --> 02:17:55,860
Oh, that would be so awesome

1959
02:17:55,860 --> 02:17:59,700
You really want to make sure you die in a in a draw in a hot dry place

1960
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:07,940
You really want to get that uh that process uh started. Oh, just just move to arizona where I live and you'll die pretty fast

1961
02:18:09,140 --> 02:18:11,140
Just in general pretty fast

1962
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:12,660
Yeah

1963
02:18:12,660 --> 02:18:14,020
based

1964
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:17,620
Uh next voicemail next voicemail is called

1965
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:23,060
Uh, ben saint scaring me three two one go

1966
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:28,100
Ben i'm not gonna lie. It's pretty uncomfortable going on twitter every day to see

1967
02:18:28,740 --> 02:18:35,700
You tweeting about trixie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like her just as much as you do at least anymore, but

1968
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:41,620
I'm feeling comfortable. It's pretty disturbing. I'm not gonna lie. It's disturbing. Oh, I'm disturbed

1969
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:43,700
Oh, that's so crazy like oh

1970
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:51,780
What am I even watching right now? What am I even looking at? What is your fucking problem, dude? Take your fucking meds. Okay

1971
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:53,780
It's a meme

1972
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:59,700
What yeah, it's so weird. It's so fucking weird, dude. Like if you think that is weird, I don't

1973
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:06,500
I don't know how you deal. I don't know how you deal with life. You're not gonna be ready when life attacks. Okay

1974
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:09,780
You're a nothing master is what you are

1975
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:11,940
Uh

1976
02:19:11,940 --> 02:19:15,220
It's weird because it's like I have to say maybe they're thinking oh

1977
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:21,940
Other youtubers and like brand twitter accounts don't like talk about petty things

1978
02:19:22,180 --> 02:19:28,340
But you've been doing this for so long. They surely should understand. This is the ben saint way. I fucking do

1979
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:31,620
Um

1980
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:37,860
I don't know. It's just yeah. Why now see I was just thinking about this like other like people people were complaining at me

1981
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:42,500
Then like ben you're too salty ben. You're too you're too mad you'd live in in your head rent free

1982
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:45,860
But it's it's gotten like it's gotten to the point where I think

1983
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:48,340
People have just accepted it now

1984
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:53,620
And it's just and and most people are just like yeah, that's just been you know like yeah, that's just normal whatever

1985
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:56,660
And I was thinking like I made it. I broke through to the other side

1986
02:19:56,820 --> 02:20:01,140
I've brought everyone along with me to a new world where I can be as petty as I want to

1987
02:20:01,700 --> 02:20:03,380
And everyone is just fine with it

1988
02:20:03,620 --> 02:20:09,380
But this guy's a fucking hold out this guy's a part of the old world and it has to be destroyed to make room for the new

1989
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:14,180
Well, I don't think it's good, but I just don't care to do anything about it anymore

1990
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:20,900
I know I know I've just exhausted you. I've just exhausted you to the point that you it's you can't criticize me anymore

1991
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:25,620
I can't believe I'm on a podcast with ben sane known tweeter. I know

1992
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:27,700
I know

1993
02:20:27,700 --> 02:20:29,700
So embarrassing same

1994
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:30,580
You're telling me

1995
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:31,780
true

1996
02:20:31,780 --> 02:20:37,300
Yeah, it's hard to it's it's hard to be a brand manager because like you want to like start arguing with people

1997
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:41,540
But that's not professional, but ben doesn't care. He's just like, you know, fuck it. We were saying

1998
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:45,940
Okay, we were saying people were talking about uh, like nate

1999
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:53,140
In like nate's approach to the tricksy thing is like when people have asked him about like cantonate is like so

2000
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:56,020
averse to conflict that he goes like

2001
02:20:56,740 --> 02:21:02,820
Eh, these things happen. Eh, it's nobody's fault. Eh, the project just died no one to blame and it's like

2002
02:21:03,540 --> 02:21:04,660
No

2003
02:21:04,660 --> 02:21:10,980
Everybody knows it's so strange that tricksy killed it by move. It's so like it's it's so obvious that like it's like

2004
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:16,660
It's like you think that like it will automatically look bad if you say anything negative about anyone

2005
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:19,540
But like no if someone does something bad

2006
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:23,860
The right like the normal thing to do is be like, yeah that person fucked up

2007
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:30,180
And if it's true like as long as you're not like making that accusation baselessly like it's it's it's fine

2008
02:21:30,260 --> 02:21:35,780
And it's good to say that and it's weird not to it's like I think what could possibly be like

2009
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:41,220
Oh, he doesn't want to burn the bridge with tricksy. I don't think that's it. I think it's oh if people see that

2010
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:46,180
I have emotions and I get angry at stuff. Maybe I'd be angry at other things and it's like

2011
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:52,260
Sponsors won't want to interact with him if they see that he is like upset that

2012
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:57,140
His former partner fucking bailed on him and like wrecked their thing together

2013
02:21:57,540 --> 02:22:02,020
Like if they saw that like that bothered him, they'd be like, well, I don't want to work with this guy

2014
02:22:02,260 --> 02:22:07,140
This guy's a loose cannon. It's one thing to just like not talk about it because I I guess it's your business

2015
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:09,540
But if somebody asks a question and you answer it with

2016
02:22:09,940 --> 02:22:12,580
Hey, what whatever no no harm done

2017
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:18,260
It's like that's that's that's a strange thing. Why would you answer it if you're gonna do that?

2018
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:22,980
It's just the way just the way the cookie crumbles. It's nobody's fault. It's just it's just destiny

2019
02:22:22,980 --> 02:22:28,740
I guess I don't know. It's just like that a joker meme where it's like you think tricksy killed the thing

2020
02:22:29,380 --> 02:22:31,780
I I do and I'm tired of pretending she didn't

2021
02:22:32,740 --> 02:22:34,980
You know, oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2022
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:41,460
Fucking the rv situation whatever we all know we all know about the rv situation

2023
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:47,940
Uh, the next one is called I sort I sort of know but I don't you can get into it later

2024
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:51,460
It doesn't dad about the book the next one is called tarpitt

2025
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:53,620
trandor thaw

2026
02:22:53,620 --> 02:22:55,620
three two one go

2027
02:22:56,660 --> 02:23:02,340
Fast-talking craftsmen and indestructible super god tarpuk transom here to mine the past once again

2028
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:06,980
For only its good parts and discard the rest on the last pcp

2029
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:12,900
So like two weeks ago by the time that you hear this you talked about fertility statues made by like cavemen types

2030
02:23:13,060 --> 02:23:15,060
And you remembered it as basically porn

2031
02:23:15,860 --> 02:23:22,340
Well, I heard that as a kid too, but a while back some female archaeologists slash anthropologists slash whatever

2032
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:26,660
Notice that it's what you see if you're pregnant and you look down

2033
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:33,940
That's right. It is a sculpture made from the first person perspective and holy shit if that is not a cool as fuck idea

2034
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:43,700
Innovation how is it what if cavemen just had pregnancy fetishes? Okay, just because someone said it doesn't mean it's true

2035
02:23:44,660 --> 02:23:48,100
Yeah, I mean it's still hot either way look down like pov

2036
02:23:48,980 --> 02:23:50,980
statue

2037
02:23:51,220 --> 02:23:53,220
Like surely surely a pregnant woman

2038
02:23:54,020 --> 02:23:59,620
If she's making statues can look at other pregnant women and know what that looks like and then make a little

2039
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:04,420
Chubby short statue is like this is what it likes. It looks like to be

2040
02:24:05,300 --> 02:24:07,620
Fertile pregnant babies come out

2041
02:24:09,460 --> 02:24:11,940
Gross, what do you know? That's hot

2042
02:24:14,180 --> 02:24:16,180
Mmm

2043
02:24:17,220 --> 02:24:19,220
The I mean maybe I mean

2044
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:25,220
Obviously, I mean, yeah, obviously what it is and what it was used for is like it's anyone's guess who knows

2045
02:24:26,020 --> 02:24:32,100
Who fucking knows I I didn't really think it was probably our competing barrier. It's it's potentially

2046
02:24:32,180 --> 02:24:37,620
I mean, I've heard people say it and I think it's it's just sort of like it doesn't it doesn't sound that crazy

2047
02:24:37,860 --> 02:24:41,300
Like I don't know whether I mentioned it at the time, but I always thought it was like

2048
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:46,500
Similar to any other statue. They would do is just like art is

2049
02:24:47,380 --> 02:24:52,740
Observing the stuff around them. They draw the story of when they killed the mammoth on the wall in the cave

2050
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:57,540
I mean, they make a little fertile. Why wouldn't it be born? Why wouldn't it be born?

2051
02:24:58,100 --> 02:25:01,220
Because they'd be actually fucking I don't know. I don't I don't see any reason why

2052
02:25:02,260 --> 02:25:04,740
I don't see I don't see any reason why it couldn't be born

2053
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:11,060
Well, I didn't say it couldn't be born, but I feel like it's it's not as I don't know if they were that horny

2054
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:15,460
Then in in terms of like being repressed and what are you fucking talking about?

2055
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:21,300
They would just fuck they were insane. They wouldn't like spend time spend time making a statue. Oh, that's psychotic

2056
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:26,660
That's crazy. That's that's what you mean. What do you mean? That's insane. No, no, no, you you you you you you missin you

2057
02:25:26,740 --> 02:25:28,660
Misinterpreted what she was saying. She was like

2058
02:25:29,460 --> 02:25:32,340
They don't need to make porn because they can just fuck whenever they want

2059
02:25:33,380 --> 02:25:35,380
That's what you said. Yeah

2060
02:25:35,940 --> 02:25:40,820
Makes sense. I'm just no it's that's insane. What's you're crazy? What are you talking about?

2061
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:42,900
What do you mean? You think what do you think human?

2062
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:47,380
What do you that you think that like a civilized society

2063
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:51,780
Humans are just like going and like grabbing people and fucking no and they're just like, yeah, okay

2064
02:25:52,020 --> 02:25:59,860
Just living like fucking like orangutans. Yeah, just like just oh just the the unflans just just swinging around the boreal range and forcing copulation

2065
02:26:00,820 --> 02:26:02,820
Well, that's what you're describing is inhuman

2066
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:07,380
Isn't didn't they make those statues and like caveman times and shit?

2067
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:13,620
They didn't need porn because they would just say they didn't need it and it's impossible

2068
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:16,180
I'm just saying it feels more likely that there's just like

2069
02:26:16,900 --> 02:26:18,500
statues of stuff

2070
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:20,820
Like they would make art about things about life

2071
02:26:22,580 --> 02:26:24,340
I yes of

2072
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:29,460
Yes, but sex is a part of life and like yeah, I know sorry, but like when you're when you're when you're

2073
02:26:30,340 --> 02:26:32,340
Can do you not like the urge there?

2074
02:26:32,420 --> 02:26:37,460
Like when you figure out like ah, I can craft I can craft the likenesses of things

2075
02:26:38,100 --> 02:26:42,900
Like obviously there is a a demand there and there is like an idea there

2076
02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:47,460
It's like, huh, I could make something looks sexy and makes me fucking hot

2077
02:26:48,180 --> 02:26:51,780
And and we still do it and believe it or not. We still do it to this day

2078
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:59,140
We still craft images that get our fucking rocks off. Yes. I know and I'm pretty sure that impulse was probably there since the beginning of time

2079
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:02,900
I know why were you calling me crazy? It's not like I disagree with any of that

2080
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:05,220
but

2081
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:06,420
But you said

2082
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:11,460
Because I think that the thing about like oh, they they didn't need porn as much because they could just have sex

2083
02:27:12,260 --> 02:27:16,580
I don't know what that means. That sounds that's because all right. What I was getting at with that totally

2084
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:18,580
point

2085
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:23,620
was that as society became more civilized and cities and stuff

2086
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:26,820
from like small tribes

2087
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:32,580
To like giant cities people became more detached from each other

2088
02:27:33,300 --> 02:27:35,860
and so porn became more like

2089
02:27:36,580 --> 02:27:37,700
prevalent

2090
02:27:37,700 --> 02:27:41,220
And necessary because you I don't know

2091
02:27:42,260 --> 02:27:46,180
That's just a hunch. I'm I'm trying to like I think think about like

2092
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:49,940
I think it's victorian england that there would be a lot of porn

2093
02:27:51,540 --> 02:27:53,540
I think that in any era

2094
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:56,580
Any era at all of human civilization

2095
02:27:57,140 --> 02:27:58,980
there would have been

2096
02:27:58,980 --> 02:28:00,100
men

2097
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:01,620
who wanted

2098
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:07,300
Who who were who were not men men who were seeking sexual gratification and were not able to find it

2099
02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:09,620
immediately

2100
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:15,780
I feel like that's like going to be a universal thing throughout all. Okay. I just I just think it may have been

2101
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:17,380
like

2102
02:28:17,380 --> 02:28:21,060
Like if it was a graph, I think the thing would have gone up

2103
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:24,020
In in more like city

2104
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:30,580
Like you you think you think that you think that like uh, uh, uh, what uh, what's the word? Um

2105
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:36,660
Unfulfillment sexual unfulfillment would go up. Yeah with the rise of urbanism. Yeah

2106
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:43,300
Well, I mean, I'm thinking like not even just that but like this the in england in victoria

2107
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:45,300
I'm just thinking of victorian england is like

2108
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:50,180
There was a lot of like oh, you're not proper unless

2109
02:28:51,060 --> 02:28:53,060
unless you like

2110
02:28:53,300 --> 02:28:58,420
Like don't masturbate ever and like sexual repression became extremely fashionable

2111
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:01,700
And and I don't know religions and stuff

2112
02:29:02,740 --> 02:29:07,940
Back in the caveman times. They didn't have as much of that or at least, you know, there was a time before it

2113
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:11,140
I don't know sure

2114
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:12,900
They might not have had

2115
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:15,540
Puritanism is like an ideology

2116
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:20,740
Uh, okay. I mean, I guess I see what you mean, but I still don't agree with it

2117
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:25,780
Yeah, I mean, I'm not basing it off of anything. It was just a like a general hunch thing

2118
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:30,180
Okay, I think we've made some great progress today

2119
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:33,860
All I'm saying

2120
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:39,860
All I'm saying is I'm not crazy. Okay, it's what you it's what you it's what you see when you look down and you're pregnant

2121
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:42,180
Whatever, okay

2122
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:48,340
Sure, where's the where's the ancient fertility dildos if that's if that's you know what if that's what you see

2123
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:52,260
If that's what you see when you look at the statue, that's just as valid as anything else

2124
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:55,780
You know what if they were if they were really horny. Why didn't they make like uh

2125
02:29:56,580 --> 02:29:58,580
Flesh lights meaning out of rocks and shit

2126
02:29:59,380 --> 02:30:01,380
You know, I heard someone told me

2127
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:08,260
I don't remember who told me this but recently someone told me that they discovered an ancient egyptian vibrator

2128
02:30:08,580 --> 02:30:10,100
nice and

2129
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:13,140
What it was it's you're not gonna believe this. This is what they told me

2130
02:30:13,300 --> 02:30:14,980
I don't know if it's true. This is just what I was told

2131
02:30:14,980 --> 02:30:20,740
But the way that it worked was it was a hollow tube into which you would insert live bees

2132
02:30:24,580 --> 02:30:30,340
Inside them the hollow tube and that was what caused the vibration. No, I just heard this. I just heard this

2133
02:30:30,820 --> 02:30:32,820
No, it's funny enough to be true

2134
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:35,220
See, all right

2135
02:30:35,220 --> 02:30:40,420
There's another thing about all of this is that the the the sexual nature of a lot of

2136
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:44,500
Archaeological finds that were presented in english

2137
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:47,540
um at the time of of like

2138
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:51,940
The industrial revolution and areas around them is like, oh

2139
02:30:52,660 --> 02:30:58,900
So barbaric, we can't let them we can't let people know that there were statues of penises and stuff

2140
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:01,540
there's like famous um

2141
02:31:01,860 --> 02:31:07,460
Of like a like a a carving of a pharaoh with his wang out and he's got an erection

2142
02:31:07,860 --> 02:31:10,580
And in the british museum, they chopped that off

2143
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:16,180
They just chopped that part off and so that so so the people couldn't get like so ladies wouldn't faint

2144
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:20,500
They wouldn't get a case of the veins. That was can't can't cancel culture gone too far. Yeah

2145
02:31:21,140 --> 02:31:26,420
They circumcised him. Yeah, and so like I'm not sure how much of like the education

2146
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:28,420
of history

2147
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:30,420
In that way continues

2148
02:31:30,580 --> 02:31:34,660
So maybe I grew up not knowing enough about how horny everyone was

2149
02:31:37,460 --> 02:31:39,460
Okay, I mean I mean I think

2150
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:43,300
the the I'm gonna say that the

2151
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:47,860
The the gatekeeping the gatekeeping of sex

2152
02:31:48,740 --> 02:31:53,060
I believe is is probably a part of human society

2153
02:31:53,940 --> 02:31:59,540
Even even even in caveman days like even in caveman days you like before there was any civilization whatsoever

2154
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:01,780
You would have had like, you know

2155
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:06,900
You would have had like try, you know families that live together that wouldn't just want like, you know

2156
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:11,620
Fucking roving some fucking roving like, you know, vagrant like wandering

2157
02:32:11,780 --> 02:32:14,340
But yeah wandering by and just like like raping the raping

2158
02:32:16,340 --> 02:32:20,740
Like no, like no, I'll fuck I'll fucking kill you if you come near my fucking family you fucking scavenger

2159
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:23,060
Did they do that in the bible?

2160
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:28,260
Oh, no, they they sold their daughters into sex slavery. That's what they did in the bible

2161
02:32:28,980 --> 02:32:33,140
Yeah, for a few loaves. That's whatever everyone it was. It was the hottest thing

2162
02:32:33,220 --> 02:32:35,460
It was like the hot new thing to do. I'm not proud of it

2163
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:41,940
But you know peer pressure kind of at the time it it just seemed right. It just seemed cool. Everyone was doing it

2164
02:32:42,580 --> 02:32:44,980
I don't I don't like doing it, but it works

2165
02:32:46,660 --> 02:32:48,660
Didn't want to be cringe

2166
02:32:48,980 --> 02:32:53,380
You know, you got a hand at two of them though. It really works. It gets results. Yeah

2167
02:32:55,140 --> 02:33:01,060
Uh next voicemail next voicemail is called. Okay. There's an image and a video

2168
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:08,420
Attached it's about cuneiform. It's making it's writing with the cuneiform clay tablet. Okay three two one go

2169
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:15,620
On the topic of old stuff, I've been thinking about how cuneiform was used for writing for like 3 000 years

2170
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:19,940
So it's longevity far outstrips any other way to write anything

2171
02:33:20,900 --> 02:33:26,580
Uh and then I looked in would further and I found two things a holy shit is it ever small like goddamn

2172
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:29,940
And b nothing I've ever seen

2173
02:33:30,340 --> 02:33:37,780
In depictions has really captured the three dimensionality that it has how important the shadows are for being able to read it

2174
02:33:37,780 --> 02:33:40,980
And what the shapes actually look like in person. Yeah

2175
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:45,140
The picture that I included is of a tablet for scale

2176
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:48,740
And the number file video of it that if that goes through

2177
02:33:49,540 --> 02:33:53,460
Will show around the three minute mark what the shapes really look like. Uh, I just

2178
02:33:54,340 --> 02:33:59,540
Appreciate how its literal durability has allowed it to endure with perfect legibility

2179
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:02,820
And uh, I thought that was cool and wanted to share this is well

2180
02:34:02,820 --> 02:34:07,940
I mean, that's why we still talk about it is because it happens to be the writing form that is best preserved

2181
02:34:08,180 --> 02:34:11,620
I really like this tiny fucking iphone

2182
02:34:13,220 --> 02:34:17,140
It's so cute with the little squishes like you squish the little things into the clay

2183
02:34:17,780 --> 02:34:19,780
But it's an iphone remember like

2184
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:22,340
tiny little

2185
02:34:22,580 --> 02:34:24,580
I want a cuneiform phone. It is really small

2186
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:31,940
Uh, yeah, I've seen like when you when you when you see it written out like on paper like black ink on white paper like it doesn't look

2187
02:34:33,300 --> 02:34:35,300
I mean it looks different obviously

2188
02:34:35,860 --> 02:34:39,860
I don't know not knowing much about it. I have no fucking clue what i'm talking about

2189
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:44,100
Oh, it's like cave paintings where I mean it looks kind of cool. It's I like how it looks

2190
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:49,060
It's like in certain cave paintings where um under like a torch

2191
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:53,380
I mean a flashlight a flashlight would um, it wouldn't work

2192
02:34:54,260 --> 02:34:56,180
You'd just look at it and be like that doesn't look good

2193
02:34:56,260 --> 02:35:03,220
But with a torch light and you move the torch around the fire the flames they flicker and they make it look like it's a moving

2194
02:35:03,860 --> 02:35:05,860
image

2195
02:35:09,460 --> 02:35:16,980
It's it's it was it was like uh, it was like, uh, it was like a video I watched about it told me that

2196
02:35:17,700 --> 02:35:19,700
I don't really know

2197
02:35:19,700 --> 02:35:23,060
They said it was like the primitive animation like that sounds incredible

2198
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:30,820
But I don't I don't get it wait primitive animation. Oh like like the flickering flickering of the torch would make the thing look like it's moving

2199
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:36,340
But only with fire you can't like shine like a bright led light on it

2200
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:44,020
And as some guy figured that out when he realized that why they wouldn't have fucking led spotlights. What am I doing? He turned them off

2201
02:35:47,540 --> 02:35:50,740
And then he turned on he he lit a torch and he was like, oh my god, they're dancing

2202
02:35:51,460 --> 02:35:53,460
They're dancing

2203
02:35:54,180 --> 02:35:56,180
Amazing

2204
02:35:57,220 --> 02:35:59,940
I'm sure it looked very cool back in the day

2205
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:03,540
Lit by uh by camp firelight or whatever

2206
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:07,220
Uh next voicemail is called

2215
02:36:50,820 --> 02:36:55,540
It's the guy that tried to kidnap. It's the guy that tried to kidnap Trixie's nazi fiance

2216
02:36:56,340 --> 02:36:59,780
Oh, I have no idea what that is. Would you like to know more? Yeah, I know

2217
02:37:01,460 --> 02:37:03,460
You've made that perfectly clear

2218
02:37:04,740 --> 02:37:06,740
Uh

02:37:07,380 --> 02:37:09,780

Okay, has it has it been a year it uh, I don't think so

2224
02:37:24,580 --> 02:37:30,820
Am I maybe it was in october it happened? I don't know. I don't know when the fuck did when the fuck the void gazers start. Yeah

2225
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:33,140
I have

2226
02:37:33,140 --> 02:37:35,140
Honestly, I have no idea cares never mind

2227
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:37,220
honestly

2228
02:37:37,220 --> 02:37:38,980
Because we didn't hear about it until months later

2229
02:37:38,980 --> 02:37:43,380
So it happened at some it happened well before we heard about it. So maybe it has been a year

2230
02:37:43,940 --> 02:37:44,820
um

2231
02:37:44,820 --> 02:37:46,820
Next voicemail is called, uh

2232
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:52,020
I seek an answer based saint three two one go

2233
02:37:53,380 --> 02:37:59,300
My class reunion so cringe. I don't know. I never been to one. I I didn't go

2234
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:05,620
I thought it would probably be cringe and also I was like busy and I was like, uh, who has the fucking time?

2235
02:38:05,620 --> 02:38:10,020
Who cares though? I just didn't go fuck it. Uh, next one is called

2236
02:38:10,980 --> 02:38:14,900
Crypto is over and done with three two one go

2237
02:38:16,580 --> 02:38:20,260
So, uh, I just wanted to let you know that I bought some uh, cripple

2238
02:38:20,500 --> 02:38:22,500
No, not right before el salvador

2239
02:38:23,940 --> 02:38:26,180
Gardening house and let me tell you

2240
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:33,860
It was not the most uh, wisest decisions because I lost nearly 20 percentage of my investments

2241
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:38,260
So when there'd be occasions to not to follow my example

2242
02:38:39,540 --> 02:38:41,540
Yes, do not do

2243
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:47,460
What we do and check out this video by the grivel institute. Uh, it might it might educate you a little bit

2244
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:51,460
On your if you bought it like a week ago, then yeah, I'm really sorry

2245
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:55,300
You owned it when it went over that cliff when fucking el salvador adopted it

2246
02:38:55,380 --> 02:38:59,540
I don't know why that like it hurt the price so much, but it sure did

2247
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:06,740
It's 20% though. Uh, yeah, I can't speculate on why I think it's just sort of something

2248
02:39:07,460 --> 02:39:11,060
It's a new thing happened. Oh, everyone did do something and they did

2249
02:39:12,500 --> 02:39:15,140
A new thing happens and yeah, yeah, everyone do something

2250
02:39:15,220 --> 02:39:18,340
It's like musical chairs just like find a chair buy sell

2251
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:22,180
I don't know just do something and then like people see what where the trends are going

2252
02:39:22,260 --> 02:39:24,820
They follow the trend and then the trend becomes a huge thing

2253
02:39:25,540 --> 02:39:29,380
And it went down. Oh my god, Elon Musk made a made a tweet everybody find a chair

2254
02:39:29,460 --> 02:39:34,660
Everyone find either a red chair to sell or a green chair to buy. Oh, everyone's sitting in red. Uh, well price goes down

2255
02:39:35,300 --> 02:39:36,500
Okay

2256
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:38,500
See you next time

2257
02:39:39,380 --> 02:39:40,500
Um

2258
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:44,260
Next voicemail is called. What is it? It is called, uh

2259
02:39:45,220 --> 02:39:49,140
Crypto is over and done with number two three two one go

2260
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:52,900
This is a follow up to my ripple and divorce

2261
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:58,100
I ended up cutting my losses and go in on the chain link

2262
02:40:00,100 --> 02:40:03,140
But as fate would have it

2263
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:05,860
It's even worse

2264
02:40:06,100 --> 02:40:07,460
Why?

2265
02:40:07,460 --> 02:40:09,460
So, yeah, just

2266
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:12,900
I you cut your losses and made a worse decision

2267
02:40:14,660 --> 02:40:18,100
I guess it fell cut his losses sold his other crypto

2268
02:40:18,820 --> 02:40:22,740
Yeah, well, it's it's not cutting your losses if then you buy some more of a different crypto

2269
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:26,100
I think i'm out of the crypto

2270
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:32,100
Buying for for now unless I see some like really compelling evidence to like. Oh, no, it's it's gotta go

2271
02:40:32,260 --> 02:40:35,940
It's gotta go really far down from for me to get interested again

2272
02:40:36,980 --> 02:40:40,900
I've made my small profit and i'm good to sit on that forever

2273
02:40:43,060 --> 02:40:45,060
Man, I don't know if

2274
02:40:45,140 --> 02:40:50,100
People people are still saying it's going to 100 by the end of the year and I don't know that's just hopeful

2275
02:40:50,260 --> 02:40:53,220
They just want that to happen because they're invested in it

2276
02:40:54,500 --> 02:41:00,740
There's only like I want it to go to minus 100 by the end of the year so I can invest again true true

2277
02:41:01,780 --> 02:41:04,820
Uh next voicemail is called, uh

You don't have to ask for permission

2297
02:42:22,660 --> 02:42:26,100
And they and they were like i'm doing it to be courteous and respectful

2298
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:28,900
And I was like that's dumb

2299
02:42:29,060 --> 02:42:34,180
It's it's courteous. It's not discourteous and it's not disrespectful. In fact personally

2300
02:42:34,740 --> 02:42:39,780
I find it annoying when someone would ask me. Oh, can I draw your oc? You know, it's even worse than that

2301
02:42:40,740 --> 02:42:41,220
Yeah

2302
02:42:41,220 --> 02:42:44,980
People ask me for permission to make tails gets trolled like fan art

2303
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:48,660
And it's like first of all, I didn't even make tails gets trolled is

2304
02:42:48,740 --> 02:42:55,700
Felsichold is fucking fan art. You fucking imbecile actually fucking claude actually. No, it isn't it's it's above fan art

2305
02:42:55,700 --> 02:42:57,700
It's even more sophisticated than fan

2306
02:42:58,100 --> 02:43:02,100
But uh, I see the thing is I didn't even make tails gets trolled

2307
02:43:02,260 --> 02:43:05,540
And even if I did like you can do whatever you want. So it's like

2308
02:43:06,340 --> 02:43:08,340
I don't you can literally do

2309
02:43:08,420 --> 02:43:10,900
Whatever you want. Yeah, you do whatever you fucking want

2310
02:43:11,700 --> 02:43:14,260
Uh, this person got all defensive and blocked me

2311
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:19,780
They said they said I was uh, they said I was uh, they said like don't speak for another artist

2312
02:43:20,260 --> 02:43:22,500
It's like I didn't I just said it would annoy me

2313
02:43:22,660 --> 02:43:26,660
It would annoy me if someone asked me can I draw your oc's because yeah, of course you can

2314
02:43:27,220 --> 02:43:28,660
I didn't speak for anyone else

2315
02:43:28,660 --> 02:43:31,220
She got mad and she blocked me and then everyone in my discord

2316
02:43:31,700 --> 02:43:37,780
Everyone in my discord had a fucking fit sporktown harrowin had had one of her fucking psychotic episodes

2317
02:43:38,420 --> 02:43:41,700
And uh and got everyone to uh to dog pile on me

2318
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:46,500
So, you know very funny very very good. Ha ha we all had a good laugh

2319
02:43:47,380 --> 02:43:51,540
Uh, and that's what this is about. So there's context damn

2320
02:43:53,300 --> 02:43:56,420
I know right next voicemail is called

2321
02:43:57,380 --> 02:44:00,100
Wait, was that was that yiga gazers we just listened to yes

2322
02:44:01,620 --> 02:44:04,100
I think what no no that was

2323
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:06,980
No, um

2324
02:44:07,620 --> 02:44:11,460
It wasn't uh, was it yiga gazers was the one before

2325
02:44:12,820 --> 02:44:14,820
So that's me that was that was big guy. Yeah

2326
02:44:16,260 --> 02:44:18,900
I think I might have switched those names around

2327
02:44:19,620 --> 02:44:24,820
But like who cares whatever um next voicemail is called

2328
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:27,300
All

2329
02:44:28,820 --> 02:44:32,820
Nate on the podcast three two one go

2330
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:35,540
You talked about how

2331
02:44:35,540 --> 02:44:40,500
Nate doesn't want to be on the podcast because he doesn't want to talk about himself as much as you know

2332
02:44:40,980 --> 02:44:47,700
Random topics and I think you misinterpreted what you know you're wrong and ignoring the possibility that Nate just doesn't want to be on

2333
02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:50,100
The podcast because it opens him up to criticism

2334
02:44:50,980 --> 02:44:52,020
um

2335
02:44:52,100 --> 02:44:58,660
I think what he really meant is that the current focus of the episodes are normally what's been going on in my life

2336
02:44:58,820 --> 02:45:03,300
And you know what's been going on in my head the past week. What have I been thinking about whereas the

2337
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:11,300
Topics often encouraged talking about yourself. Yes, but talking about your opinions on other things

2338
02:45:11,620 --> 02:45:15,140
Talking about your deplore backstories as a content creator

2339
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:19,140
um things that audiences would be interested in

2340
02:45:19,860 --> 02:45:20,580
um

2341
02:45:20,580 --> 02:45:25,460
Viewing the podcast as part of your repertoire of personality driven

2342
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:32,020
Okay, all right. Okay, buddy. What this person is talking about with across to you are giving that

2343
02:45:32,740 --> 02:45:34,580
You are giving Nate way too much credit

2344
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:38,260
You have thought this through way more than he did the fact is that when I ask him

2345
02:45:38,900 --> 02:45:42,420
Why he doesn't want to be on the the show and he says because I don't want to talk about topics

2346
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:46,660
That doesn't make any sense and it's nonsense and he doesn't know what it means either

2347
02:45:46,980 --> 02:45:49,940
So like you're you're giving me you're giving you're like you thought it like no

2348
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:55,620
Here's like here's this like actually what it must mean is this like oh and if I if I connect these dots together

2349
02:45:55,700 --> 02:45:58,900
It's because oh it's actually because his interest must lie in this other place

2350
02:45:58,980 --> 02:46:03,940
And it's it actually conflicts with like his core philosophy of this. It's like no, it's just nonsense

2351
02:46:04,580 --> 02:46:06,260
It's just nonsense. Didn't um

2352
02:46:06,260 --> 02:46:10,980
Didn't he talk about himself or like stuff he was doing on the gamer zone?

2353
02:46:12,500 --> 02:46:15,220
Of course, what would you what would any what is any podcast?

2354
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:18,580
What do you talk about in any podcast you talk about yourself what you're doing?

2355
02:46:19,460 --> 02:46:21,460
And and what's up?

2356
02:46:22,100 --> 02:46:24,100
What is any podcast?

2357
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:31,540
Yeah, so it's just nonsense guy. Just just don't think about it anymore. It's not it's it's there's nothing to think about

2358
02:46:32,260 --> 02:46:33,300
Uh

2359
02:46:33,300 --> 02:46:36,900
Next voicemail is called ben bullying

2360
02:46:37,620 --> 02:46:40,340
Nice hold on. I will post it right there

2361
02:46:41,060 --> 02:46:44,020
Yeah, there it is. Okay, three two one go

2362
02:46:44,980 --> 02:46:46,980
This is a message for past ben

2363
02:46:47,380 --> 02:46:48,580
It is

2364
02:46:48,580 --> 02:46:51,060
9 11 at 12 24

2365
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:54,420
And there's no episode of the pcp

2366
02:46:55,140 --> 02:46:59,380
And fuck you ben. It's not my fault. It's game's fault. Gotcha

2367
02:47:04,340 --> 02:47:05,700
Uh

2368
02:47:05,700 --> 02:47:12,100
Sorry for the late episode, but like, you know, whatever it was like 10 hours late like oh, sorry

2369
02:47:12,420 --> 02:47:14,420
Why why was it late?

2370
02:47:14,420 --> 02:47:20,740
Oh, I I I uploaded it wrong and then I was away from my computer for a long time and I didn't notice

2371
02:47:21,860 --> 02:47:25,460
I didn't schedule it to upload. I I just put it up unlisted. Yeah

2372
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:29,300
Because I just forgot to hit the schedule button because of internet problems

2373
02:47:29,940 --> 02:47:33,380
Uh, yes, but it wasn't exactly I was moving

2374
02:47:34,660 --> 02:47:36,660
Okay

2375
02:47:37,060 --> 02:47:43,140
Uh, okay, the next one is an image link. So I will put that uh right here

2376
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:48,420
Horseshoe versus dr. Wolf. Let's go. Okay. Here we go

2377
02:47:49,140 --> 02:47:49,780
All right

2378
02:47:49,780 --> 02:47:56,820
The virgin in horseshoes didn't credit munchie for the pony avatar gets mad about inconsequential things is yellow

2379
02:47:56,820 --> 02:48:04,660
But we'll deny it the chad wolf assembled huge teams of unpaid volunteers features an equestria girl's dvd art

2380
02:48:04,900 --> 02:48:06,900
proudly white

2381
02:48:08,340 --> 02:48:11,220
Is that second one was he an equestria girl's dvd art?

2382
02:48:12,100 --> 02:48:15,220
No, I like how we don't question like, oh, of course. He's proudly white, but no

2383
02:48:15,620 --> 02:48:20,580
But the equation is probably well, I mean look at him. You look at him. He's white. You can see it

2384
02:48:20,740 --> 02:48:25,460
I mean, he's kind of gray. He's kind of gray, but like this is a good picture. Wish there were more blurbs

2385
02:48:26,500 --> 02:48:29,220
Only three eight. Yeah, come on. We can think of three is

2386
02:48:29,860 --> 02:48:32,020
There's there's wasted space. Yeah

2387
02:48:32,980 --> 02:48:39,140
Uh, hold on. I would say dr. Wolf. All right. I found a video of dr. Wolf himself reacting to it

2388
02:48:40,740 --> 02:48:41,940
Wait

2389
02:48:41,940 --> 02:48:43,780
Okay. Yeah. Yeah

2390
02:48:43,780 --> 02:48:46,260
Oh, okay. So the the box art people

2391
02:48:47,220 --> 02:48:53,540
Did they put a screenshot of a dr. Wolf video talking about equestria girls on the back of an actual dvd?

2392
02:48:54,340 --> 02:48:57,060
What what the fuck? What a terrible

2393
02:48:57,940 --> 02:48:59,940
That's awesome. Why would they do that?

2394
02:49:00,900 --> 02:49:03,380
That's insane. That's so bad

2395
02:49:04,260 --> 02:49:09,300
I guess the person doing the design just didn't give a shit the person who made it probably just thought it was from the show

2396
02:49:09,300 --> 02:49:11,300
And didn't know that happens actually a lot

2397
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:20,100
Weird it's probably like looked it up dr. Wolf's thumbnail or something or uh

2398
02:49:20,820 --> 02:49:25,060
Clip from his uh from his show was like one of the first results and they were just like, ah, here we go

2399
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:26,740
Oh

2400
02:49:26,740 --> 02:49:29,860
How bizarre but yeah, wow there is

2401
02:49:31,380 --> 02:49:38,020
Yeah, horseshoe or there be yeah horseshoe horseshoe never got on dvd box. Hey, where's the dvd is tricksy

2402
02:49:38,420 --> 02:49:43,780
Where's the blue rays? Then we could then we could have had it then maybe there'd be a uh a conversation to be had

2403
02:49:44,420 --> 02:49:46,420
Lamal, uh, no

2404
02:49:47,220 --> 02:49:49,220
I mean, I guess Chad Wolf wins

2405
02:49:50,100 --> 02:49:53,060
There's just no contest. So okay easy

2406
02:49:53,780 --> 02:49:55,780
Uh uh

2407
02:49:56,020 --> 02:49:58,020
Next one is called

2408
02:49:58,660 --> 02:50:00,660
Oh

2409
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:06,740
There he is

2410
02:50:07,380 --> 02:50:13,780
My man. Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay. Okay. It's like that fucking

2411
02:50:14,020 --> 02:50:20,900
It's like that picture monkey tweeted once where he added like some dumb character to the simpsons lineup and pretended it was real

2412
02:50:21,860 --> 02:50:28,260
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Gumbly. He didn't he didn't he didn't uh invent that. He got it from like he got it from 4chan

2413
02:50:29,220 --> 02:50:31,220
But it's exactly like that

2414
02:50:34,740 --> 02:50:38,820
I didn't need to stop looking at this. Oh, oh, you mean dr. Wolf in that screen. Yeah

2415
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:44,980
Yeah, like why would there be a little anthropomorphic wolf? Don't they know that the whole premise is that everyone is a human?

2416
02:50:45,780 --> 02:50:47,620
Didn't they watch the movie?

2417
02:50:47,620 --> 02:50:49,620
Well spike is a dog. I don't know

2418
02:50:50,580 --> 02:50:52,580
Oh, shit, you're right

2419
02:50:53,300 --> 02:50:55,300
There's dog. I can't believe this is real

2420
02:50:55,860 --> 02:51:01,220
This is insane. This is so funny. Uh, okay. Next one is called Subaru

2421
02:51:01,940 --> 02:51:05,540
Su-wat-ter-u-yo Subaru Su-wat-ter-u-yo

2422
02:51:06,100 --> 02:51:07,860
Three two one go

2423
02:51:07,860 --> 02:51:10,260
You have the power of full mind control

2424
02:51:10,820 --> 02:51:12,820
But only of five people

2425
02:51:12,820 --> 02:51:15,300
Who would you choose and what would you make them do?

2426
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:17,300
Joseph Robinette

2427
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:19,380
Rainbow Dash rarity twilight

2428
02:51:20,980 --> 02:51:23,540
The other one I'd be twilight. Huh?

2429
02:51:24,660 --> 02:51:29,220
You'd mind control people to role play as the ponies and you would be twilight. I would

2430
02:51:30,020 --> 02:51:32,660
I would mind can he's got my control fictitious people

2431
02:51:35,860 --> 02:51:42,500
Uh mind control five people. Um, I don't know. I'll just mind control five really rich people and haven't given Joe Biden and George Soros

2432
02:51:42,580 --> 02:51:44,580
Hillary Ron Clinton, uh

2433
02:51:46,020 --> 02:51:50,660
Jeff Jeff Bezos Elon Musk, uh, uh warren gunnels, uh

2434
02:51:52,260 --> 02:51:56,340
Who's the other one been saying rich three? All right. Yeah, I've been saying obviously

2435
02:51:57,220 --> 02:51:58,500
uh

2436
02:51:58,500 --> 02:52:01,060
Best guy ever, uh, uh the golden witch, uh

2437
02:52:02,660 --> 02:52:06,260
Endless just give and take uh lethal roar mage tom oliver

2438
02:52:06,660 --> 02:52:10,740
Muchi wears tiny hats and then we get and then I would force them all to come back on the podcast

2439
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:13,620
They need to be more specific

2440
02:52:14,020 --> 02:52:17,220
They need to be more specific about this question. Like is there a like a

2441
02:52:17,860 --> 02:52:20,100
distance limit to

2442
02:52:20,100 --> 02:52:25,140
How you can like control like mind control people or can you just like mind control anyone from anywhere?

2443
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:31,140
I like to treat it as a blanket. So it's like risk. It's it sounds like you can just pick five people

2444
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:37,620
That's that's sort of how the death networks because you know how you can like write make people do stuff before you kill them

2445
02:52:38,180 --> 02:52:39,060
Of course

2446
02:52:39,060 --> 02:52:40,580
sort of like that

2447
02:52:40,740 --> 02:52:42,740
I would get all of my favorite

2448
02:52:42,900 --> 02:52:49,860
Artists to read and enjoy my comics and say good job. That's what I hear here

2449
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:53,860
Here's my answer. I would uh mind control joe biden to legalize weed

2450
02:52:54,580 --> 02:52:56,580
That's perfect

2451
02:52:57,300 --> 02:53:02,260
Yeah, I would I would I would control I would mind control joe biden to enforce a

2452
02:53:02,980 --> 02:53:04,980
vaccination mandates. Oh

2453
02:53:04,980 --> 02:53:07,300
Wait, I it looks like I did it looks like

2454
02:53:08,020 --> 02:53:09,620
No need anymore

2455
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:14,340
What a coincidence. I thought you're gonna say mandate people to watch my little pony

2456
02:53:15,940 --> 02:53:19,780
Well gen five is you don't know me very well. Do you then? I guess I guess not

2457
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:27,620
No, it would make them make them read homestuck if anything. Oh, yeah, that's true

2458
02:53:28,660 --> 02:53:29,620
Yeah

2459
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:35,540
That's that's the only way. Well, I'll make Joe Biden read homestuck and talk about homestuck at length on one of his speeches

2460
02:53:35,700 --> 02:53:37,700
At like 0.5 percent speed

2461
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:42,180
Oh, yeah, and instead of his state of the union address. It's the homestuck address

2462
02:53:43,060 --> 02:53:49,060
He addresses he addresses he'll talk about his favorite state of the state of the fandom state of the fandom

2463
02:53:50,340 --> 02:53:52,180
Uh, yeah

2464
02:53:52,180 --> 02:53:59,540
Next voicemail is called a message from your gaping ass three two one go

2465
02:53:59,940 --> 02:54:01,940
Oh

2466
02:54:02,260 --> 02:54:09,380
Hey, Ben just sitting here in the mcdonald's drive-thru and I was just wondering do you point on doing

2467
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:14,500
A physical release of slime and pushman because if you are that would be based

2468
02:54:15,140 --> 02:54:19,780
Yeah, I'm yeah, I've definitely said it before I'm definitely gonna do a book when when

2469
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:24,020
Slime and when the when the game is done and I finish the comic. Yeah, I'm gonna

2470
02:54:24,740 --> 02:54:26,740
Uh, I'm going to

2471
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:31,060
Yeah, I'm gonna do I'm gonna do like a like a homestuck book is is the idea

2472
02:54:31,300 --> 02:54:35,700
It's gonna be like, you know for four panels of page and like commentary on the bottom

2473
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:40,660
I think is what I'm gonna do. I already started laying pages out actually actually I laid them out a long time ago

2474
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:42,660
Uh

2475
02:54:42,660 --> 02:54:44,740
You know up up to what I had done at the time

2476
02:54:45,380 --> 02:54:49,220
You know, I need to uh go back and uh complete that obviously

2477
02:54:49,780 --> 02:54:51,860
So, yeah, short answer is yes

2478
02:54:52,420 --> 02:54:56,660
And it will be like and it will be because it'll be it's many many more pages than the vapors

2479
02:54:56,740 --> 02:55:01,620
So it would need like a an actual like, you know, perfect bound, uh, like soft

2480
02:55:02,740 --> 02:55:07,460
Softcovered book not like a not like a saddle stitched, uh, you know

2481
02:55:09,860 --> 02:55:12,500
Copy a comic whatever you call it

2482
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:15,060
Uh, yep

2483
02:55:15,060 --> 02:55:20,580
Next voicemail is called a message from your gaping ass two three two one go

2484
02:55:21,860 --> 02:55:23,860
Hey, I also want to say

2485
02:55:24,260 --> 02:55:32,420
Uh, turns out you're actually the soy lord, uh stopping. So god damn soy already. I don't even fucking I don't even like soy

2486
02:55:33,140 --> 02:55:37,220
I like uh, I like almond milk and I like coconut milk. I don't like soy soy soy

2487
02:55:38,100 --> 02:55:42,900
Oh, no, never mind never mind the soy programming is activated soy soy soy

2488
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:45,300
You at one time I tasted it was enough

2489
02:55:46,740 --> 02:55:50,020
Now I I was wrong. I was wrong about that soy is good

2490
02:55:50,980 --> 02:55:55,700
Uh, uh, yeah guys actually soy doesn't turn you into a girl

2491
02:55:55,780 --> 02:55:57,780
Actually, soy doesn't have phytoestrogens

2492
02:55:58,020 --> 02:56:03,940
The watch the h-bomber guy video where he says that soy actually won't mind control you and turn you into a live

2493
02:56:05,300 --> 02:56:09,060
Hey, that's that's that's what I want. Yes. I want everyone to see that

2494
02:56:09,140 --> 02:56:11,140
I want everyone to think it's good for you actually

2495
02:56:11,140 --> 02:56:16,740
I really wish it was as easy as eating like a different or drinking a different kind of milk or whatever

2496
02:56:17,300 --> 02:56:19,300
But yeah

2497
02:56:20,260 --> 02:56:25,860
Eating them eating the miracle burger because why why would you get on hrt if you just eat soy all the time? Yeah

2498
02:56:26,260 --> 02:56:28,260
Soy soy soy

2499
02:56:29,220 --> 02:56:31,700
Hell if it was that easy, I would do it too

2500
02:56:32,980 --> 02:56:39,060
Soy if it were if it were you gotta eat the miracle burger. It's got like 100 times the estrogen

2501
02:56:39,540 --> 02:56:44,580
Oh, you mean the uh impossible burger from burger king. That's the one. Yes. Yes the impossible burger

2502
02:56:45,460 --> 02:56:47,060
Lamel

2503
02:56:47,060 --> 02:56:49,060
Also the 5g signals

2504
02:56:50,420 --> 02:56:52,420
Someone in a burger

2505
02:56:52,740 --> 02:56:58,740
Someone in a restaurant. We were I was joking about like, uh, you know vaccine conspiracies and a guy at the table over

2506
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:02,900
from us, he he chimed in to say something about like

2507
02:57:03,460 --> 02:57:09,860
5g and and like vaccines and stuff and like, uh, uh, like, you know, uh

2508
02:57:10,580 --> 02:57:12,900
heavy metal particles or something and and

2509
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:15,620
Okay, the the point is

2510
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:21,300
He chimed in and I genuinely could not tell if he was like saying like ha ha

2511
02:57:21,380 --> 02:57:25,220
Actually, there is some truth to the coveted like the vaccines are poison thing

2512
02:57:25,620 --> 02:57:30,900
Or if he was like chiming in to like make a joke along with us like ha ha. Yeah, that's so funny

2513
02:57:31,300 --> 02:57:33,380
You should check this stuff out. It's funny too

2514
02:57:33,700 --> 02:57:38,500
I genuinely could not figure out which one it was and it made me very uncomfortable because I was like

2515
02:57:38,740 --> 02:57:43,460
I don't want to laugh and I don't want to engage with this guy on the chance that he is being serious

2516
02:57:43,700 --> 02:57:48,980
But I don't want to shun him and make him feel bad on the chance that he is just trying to have a goof with me

2517
02:57:49,620 --> 02:57:53,700
And I and I was I was really I was really caught between a lot of rock and a hard place on that one

2518
02:57:53,860 --> 02:57:56,180
That's quite a conundrum. I know

2519
02:57:56,900 --> 02:58:03,060
I kind of just had to sort of thread the needle and be like ha ha like act like I was amused but not too amused

2520
02:58:03,460 --> 02:58:04,900
You know

2521
02:58:04,900 --> 02:58:06,900
Yeah, that was my solution

2522
02:58:07,860 --> 02:58:09,860
Um, I know that feel

2523
02:58:11,940 --> 02:58:16,820
Next voicemail is uh a message from your gaping ass three

2524
02:58:18,900 --> 02:58:20,900
Three two one go

2525
02:58:21,460 --> 02:58:24,820
Okay, here's my true thoughts about benjamin sing

2526
02:58:25,620 --> 02:58:28,260
Uh, he is hilarious

2527
02:58:28,820 --> 02:58:33,220
Absolutely funny. I love him true god here in terms of humor

2528
02:58:33,540 --> 02:58:38,260
But god damn how I want to strangle him sometimes with his fucking lefty opinions

2529
02:58:38,660 --> 02:58:46,180
It actually hurts me, but like it's funny. So I don't care. I can't tell if this is like a parody. I don't care, but uh

2530
02:58:49,620 --> 02:58:56,900
Cool, man, have a nice day. Thanks for the email. Is he what was the last bit? I think he said he's floundering or something

I'm here at the apple orchard. I just got done picking apples

2539
02:59:25,300 --> 02:59:30,260
I was listening to the latest episode and I got thinking you should make your own brony lecture

2540
02:59:30,660 --> 02:59:33,300
Jenny Nicholson got a million v's talking about bronies

2541
02:59:33,540 --> 02:59:35,940
You could do it too if you talked about your time in the fandom

2542
02:59:36,260 --> 02:59:39,620
The history of it all the stupid things that happen in all the freaks

2543
02:59:39,700 --> 02:59:44,980
You meant like brony curious and cake standard cake, especially as a gold nugget that needs to be mine

2544
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:48,660
Call the video the truth about bronies or the dark side of the brony phantom

2545

Anywho, I need to get back to picking apples fucking apples you idiot

2561
03:01:17,780 --> 03:01:19,620

Unless I've known them for a long time

2585
03:02:48,180 --> 03:02:53,860
Their discord name their real name for a minute there. I thought it was their middle. I think there's some people was yeah

03:03:24,340 --> 03:03:27,940
Like name that we just don't refer to each other as that'd be really weird

2595
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:32,820
Yeah, I thought st was your real last name

2596
03:03:33,780 --> 03:03:35,780
It is not it is not

2597
03:03:36,420 --> 03:03:42,100
A lot of people a lot a lot of people think that and a lot of people have assumed that nate's name is nate saint because

2598
03:03:42,900 --> 03:03:44,900
I love that. That's one of my favorites. Yeah

2599
03:03:45,780 --> 03:03:51,220
Yeah, that's pretty funny, but it's not it's not true. It's not. Yeah, he took uh, he took their mother's name

2600
03:03:51,620 --> 03:03:53,620

2606
03:04:10,260 --> 03:04:13,860
But um, I can't I keep for some reason I keep thinking of this

2607
03:04:13,940 --> 03:04:18,180
But the whole nate saint thing reminds me of the mario mario luigi mario thing again

2608
03:04:18,740 --> 03:04:25,620
You're you're obsessed. You're obsessed with mario mario luigi mario. That's that's like my favorite movie the super mario brothers movie

2609
03:04:26,340 --> 03:04:27,940
I had that thing

2610
03:04:27,940 --> 03:04:30,900
I had it on vhs as a kid and I remember liking it

2611
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:35,620
But I remember like the like the second half got taped over so I remember the first half really well

2612
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:38,260
And I remember the ending

2613
03:04:38,260 --> 03:04:44,740
I remember when like the dimensions merge or whatever. Yeah, and there's a big section in the middle that I just don't remember

2614
03:04:45,540 --> 03:04:49,540
Um, we got one final last minute voicemail

2615
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:52,820
Gender abolition extremists in the making

2616
03:04:53,620 --> 03:04:55,620
three two one go

2617
03:04:56,260 --> 03:05:00,340
Is there anybody whose life is actually improved by

2618
03:05:01,060 --> 03:05:07,300
Gender being a factor like compared to if it didn't exist and femininity and masculinity weren't real things

2619
03:05:07,540 --> 03:05:11,060
And everybody was just described by individual factors like

2620
03:05:11,780 --> 03:05:18,420
At best it feels like a total non factor where you're just you know, like you don't care. You're fine. Just be in yourself

2621
03:05:18,820 --> 03:05:27,300
Uh, and at worst it's a completely crippling condition that leaves you socially dejected and hating yourself like

2622
03:05:28,260 --> 03:05:31,620
Why isn't everybody on earth just a day then who the fuck came up with this?

2623
03:05:32,180 --> 03:05:34,820
Fuck this is what I've been saying. Yeah, it's I mean

2624
03:05:35,860 --> 03:05:36,980
gender

2625
03:05:36,980 --> 03:05:37,860
I think

2626
03:05:37,860 --> 03:05:43,140
But if in terms of like having a gender binary or like oh masculine feminine male female

2627
03:05:43,700 --> 03:05:45,300
um

2628
03:05:45,300 --> 03:05:47,300
men women uh

2629
03:05:47,380 --> 03:05:52,020
The utility is temporary in that people grew up like for me

2630
03:05:52,980 --> 03:05:57,860
I I like doing the woman things because it makes me feel better than

2631
03:05:58,340 --> 03:06:01,780
Like compensating for having lived as a man for so long

2632
03:06:02,420 --> 03:06:04,100
but ideally

2633
03:06:04,100 --> 03:06:08,740
That would have never been a living as a man and wanting to live as something else

2634
03:06:09,380 --> 03:06:11,380
It would have just been they them from the beginning

2635
03:06:12,660 --> 03:06:15,300
Yeah, that's that's that's kind of how I am like

2636
03:06:16,420 --> 03:06:19,860
I don't really like strongly identify as any gender like I've just

2637
03:06:20,660 --> 03:06:26,420
People think I look like a man. So I guess that's when I am out of convenience, but I I

2638
03:06:27,060 --> 03:06:29,060
I don't really care either way

2639
03:06:29,780 --> 03:06:39,060
I strongly feel that uh the like the the existence of gender like the the convention of gendered pronouns is just a very unfortunate sort of like linguistic

2640
03:06:39,780 --> 03:06:40,900
accident

2641
03:06:40,900 --> 03:06:43,780
That we didn't really need it didn't need to be that way

2642
03:06:44,180 --> 03:06:46,580
And it's it's unfortunate in that it like

2643
03:06:47,140 --> 03:06:51,540
Causes all this fucking all this fucking strife and confusion and all apparently

2644
03:06:51,940 --> 03:06:55,220
I wish we just didn't have it and then and then there would just there would be no

2645
03:06:55,380 --> 03:07:01,540
There would be so much we wouldn't even have to debate it apparently. It's like even worse in other languages besides english

2646
03:07:02,580 --> 03:07:03,780
sure

2647
03:07:03,780 --> 03:07:10,340
For us to have genders. I never really understood what that even means. It's it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a bit of

2648
03:07:10,340 --> 03:07:15,540
Like over complication that it's like do we I don't think we really get I feel like we don't get that much out of it

2649
03:07:15,540 --> 03:07:17,540
I feel like it's a cabinet in

2650
03:07:18,020 --> 03:07:21,300
Italian is feminins like why what is it?

2651
03:07:22,100 --> 03:07:28,180
How did it make well, I mean in some in I learned this from yon yon misily in some languages. It's like

2652
03:07:29,300 --> 03:07:37,140
It's genuinely like completely arbitrary like what vert like what nouns are masculine or what a feminine like like even if it's a person

2653
03:07:37,380 --> 03:07:41,380
Like if it's like a certain kind of person like a nephew or or or something like

2654
03:07:41,780 --> 03:07:47,300
So something like the word for a nephew can just like be masculine even if it's like a girl nephew, right?

2655
03:07:47,540 --> 03:07:49,540
What some languages

2656
03:07:49,540 --> 03:07:55,300
Oh, you mean other languages. Yeah, some languages are just completely arbitrary and there is literally like no

2657
03:07:55,380 --> 03:07:59,700
It doesn't it's not like oh this is this thing is called female because we have a

2658
03:08:00,100 --> 03:08:06,420
Female conception of its use or purpose like no like it's it's literally just like someone picked it at random once

2659
03:08:06,900 --> 03:08:10,420
That's like every word real quick. Have you talked to yon misily?

2660
03:08:11,460 --> 03:08:13,220
No

2661
03:08:13,220 --> 03:08:14,660
Okay, uh

2662
03:08:14,660 --> 03:08:18,980
Why would I have talked to yon misily because you just said you did oh you said you watched a video

2663
03:08:19,060 --> 03:08:24,580
He's a he's a youtuber. Oh, okay. Yeah. I thought they like I thought they were like on the podcast or something

2664
03:08:24,580 --> 03:08:28,660
I watched their um, I watched their mario video the other uh the other day

2665
03:08:29,140 --> 03:08:31,140
About how many I found them

2666
03:08:31,700 --> 03:08:36,020
I found them through that video and then I went back and I watched all their conlangs

2667
03:08:36,100 --> 03:08:41,060
Yeah, I actually I actually found them through uh their rhythm heaven videos because that's one of my other favorite

2668
03:08:41,700 --> 03:08:47,700
Uh game series yo cc. I've never played a rhythm heaven video, but I went back and I also watched the rhythm heaven videos

2669
03:08:47,780 --> 03:08:50,900
And that was really good. Yeah cc. Did you get the new wario where?

2670
03:08:52,260 --> 03:08:56,660
Uh, no not yet. Ah, it's great. I get I I I guess I'll have to uh

2671
03:08:57,380 --> 03:09:00,420
I'll have to get it to fill the void in my heart that

2672
03:09:01,220 --> 03:09:04,500
A new rhythm heaven game isn't going to be made anytime soon. So

2673
03:09:06,020 --> 03:09:08,980
Well, thank you. I'll have to wario's there get that as a substitute

2674
03:09:09,860 --> 03:09:11,860
That's right

2675
03:09:12,100 --> 03:09:18,420
Hi, at least at least kotake uchi is still doing art. Yeah, I like his I like his style. It's good

2676
03:09:19,060 --> 03:09:20,500
Uh, yeah

2677
03:09:20,500 --> 03:09:22,500
Great game. How much play?

2678
03:09:23,220 --> 03:09:28,740
I've you know, I don't know it you more of a wario land kind of guy

2679
03:09:29,780 --> 03:09:32,020
I'm just I'm just you know, I look at the game

2680
03:09:32,100 --> 03:09:36,180
Which it's like it's just a bunch of rhythm based mini games and I oh rhythm heaven on I

2681
03:09:37,220 --> 03:09:40,260
Yeah, or or or even wario where and I'm just like, I don't know

2682
03:09:40,900 --> 03:09:42,100
It seems like

2683
03:09:42,100 --> 03:09:46,020
I guess it just doesn't appeal to me as something that I want to do is like sit down and like

2684
03:09:47,300 --> 03:09:51,860
I'm not I'm not into like rhythm stuff. It's just like it's so it's so simplistic

2685
03:09:52,740 --> 03:09:55,940
I I understand that like why it would be fun. I guess but it's like

2686
03:09:56,740 --> 03:10:01,620
Doesn't it I'm not it doesn't call out to me like then you should you're gonna you're gonna get you're gonna get something out

2687
03:10:01,620 --> 03:10:03,860
Of this experience like uh

2688
03:10:03,860 --> 03:10:05,860
This kind of seems like a distraction

2689
03:10:06,020 --> 03:10:08,020
From what's really important well

2690
03:10:08,820 --> 03:10:15,620
Which is arguing on twitter which is posting on twitter about how I will pay money for people to unsubscribe from trixie's patreon

2691
03:10:16,020 --> 03:10:21,780
I must have my vengeance at any cost. Well, but that's what that's what matters to me right now. This is the real phantoms revenge

2692
03:10:23,860 --> 03:10:25,860
Yes, true

2693
03:10:26,420 --> 03:10:27,860
it's like uh

2694
03:10:27,940 --> 03:10:34,020
Mario's legend of the seven stars or whatever you get you're the shell

2695
03:10:34,660 --> 03:10:36,660
And if you time the button presses

2696
03:10:36,980 --> 03:10:37,940
correctly

2697
03:10:37,940 --> 03:10:39,940
It does extra damage

2698
03:10:41,700 --> 03:10:48,020
It's also like extra damage. It's also like mother three if you've ever played that. Oh, yeah, the battle played earthbound

2699
03:10:48,420 --> 03:10:50,500
Oh, yeah, the earthbound I have not played mother three

2700
03:10:50,980 --> 03:10:54,340
The battle system is sort of like rhythm heaven in mother three also

2701
03:10:55,060 --> 03:10:57,380
Yeah, you like time we have to press is to the music

2702
03:10:58,420 --> 03:11:00,100
Yeah

2703
03:11:00,100 --> 03:11:02,100
fascinating

2704
03:11:02,100 --> 03:11:04,100
uh

2705
03:11:04,740 --> 03:11:06,100
Is that it?

2706
03:11:06,100 --> 03:11:12,100
I really I really like the yon misleys. Uh, he means like three videos or something about rhythm heaven

2707
03:11:13,140 --> 03:11:17,940
Yeah, got a lot out of those. Well, if you if you ever get him on the podcast, you should invite me to

2708
03:11:19,940 --> 03:11:23,460
Okay, I mean if I ever just happened to stumble upon yon misle

2709
03:11:24,180 --> 03:11:26,820
Yeah, you can you can see him walking outside sometimes

2710
03:11:27,700 --> 03:11:32,100
If I if I ever just just walking around town and I bump into the guy and I say hey, man

2711
03:11:32,740 --> 03:11:38,660
You want to come on my podcast four thousand something followers? Let's see how much ben saint

2712
03:11:39,140 --> 03:11:45,300
Five thousand, you know, you may consume him to uh absorb him onto your podcast so it works

2713
03:11:45,700 --> 03:11:47,700
Steams are open. Wait, how many?

2714
03:11:48,100 --> 03:11:50,260
Yes, he is less than five thousand followers

2715
03:11:51,220 --> 03:11:57,300
Okay, this is this is this I want to mention this is uh, I'll feel embarrassed. I'll feel a little embarrassed if like

2716
03:11:57,860 --> 03:12:04,020
He what is it happens to listen to this episode and like here's me say this on the episode

2717
03:12:04,260 --> 03:12:09,060
But I was a bit I was pleasantly surprised and surprised surprised the other day

2718
03:12:09,540 --> 03:12:12,900
When I saw a youtuber that I know pledged to the patreon

2719
03:12:13,780 --> 03:12:18,260
Uh, uh to snaker the guy who does the yakuza video. Yeah, he pledged to the page

2720
03:12:18,260 --> 03:12:24,260
I was like is that is that really him? Is it the to snaker and it was um, it's like it's like wow

2721
03:12:24,420 --> 03:12:26,740
He watches nice. Yes. He's a cool guy

2722
03:12:27,860 --> 03:12:29,620
Yeah, oh

2723
03:12:29,620 --> 03:12:32,740
Well, shit, maybe I should say hi. Maybe you can probably get them on

2724
03:12:34,020 --> 03:12:36,340
I really like uh, I mean I don't play yakuza

2725
03:12:36,420 --> 03:12:42,980
But I really like his I really like his yik video and I really like his evo video and uh, there's a few more I think

2726
03:12:43,700 --> 03:12:47,300
Those are the two that I also was good. Yeah to snaker is great. I don't

2727
03:12:47,860 --> 03:12:52,260
I'm not sure if I've seen the pack. No, no, I have. Yeah, with the Dead Rising 4 video

2728
03:12:52,500 --> 03:12:55,620
I think is probably can you link to his channel because it sounds interesting

2729
03:12:57,780 --> 03:13:02,500
Do you yeah, okay, he does um, he wanted to hear that hot tricks he got

Yeah, he does um, uh, yeah, he does long he does long

Uh, hi if you're listening, I'm embarrassed to have uh, outed you like this

Oh, even revolution was also a good video
