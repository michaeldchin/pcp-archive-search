00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,900
Hello, everybody, and welcome once again to the Pro Crastinators Interview series, the one that's been on hold for six months.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,700
Forever?

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,400
Yeah, after a mere five episodes, but we're back.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,100
Hey.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:19,000
For some reason, that reason being, we've got a new member of the Pro Crastinators podcast who's interested in being interviewed.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,200
Is it Sheepover?

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
No, Sheepover...

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,100
Is it Psy?

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,600
Sheepover declined to...

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,800
Is it King Critic? Who could it be?

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh man, three hours of King Critic, can you imagine?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
No, it's Mumkey Jones!

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Mumkey Jones!

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Look at that audio clip, there we go.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
Maybe I'll turn it back down.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, Mumkey, what is it that made you want to be a part of this little club, this little gay ass internet arrangement?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, clearly, I didn't have the same background as you guys did, you guys all met with your pony days and all that shit, and that's kind of...

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Pretty much everything you guys represent is what I set out to humiliate and destroy.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,500
Yeah.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,000
So I was as surprised of being invited as I was that you guys even liked me in the first place.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I think it's because after finding out who you guys were and being invited to be on episode 30, I think that was the empathy episode,

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I watched most of your guys' stuff and I liked the vast majority of it, and I thought you guys were all cool guys,

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and I thought, you know, I'm more than flattered that they liked me too, so hell yeah, let's get on board of this shit.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
From our perspective, it was like, I mean, from the very first time I saw your videos, I was like, well, this guy's clearly coming from a similar angle to us,

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
but like, you know, we didn't know who you were, and then after...

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's one of those things where it's kind of the way that people have gotten into the PCP, and this is why there's this weird misconception that you can just join the PCP by having good enough videos.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Which you can.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please send all of your amateur videos to DigiBro.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's digitalboyreviews at gmail.com.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Like, the general way that the PCP formed was by all of us being big fans of one another, and with Monkey, it was just kind of a case that not only were you clearly like all of our videos, and all of us like yours.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, most.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Most.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, we like...

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've seen Ben's work, not impressed.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Initially, it was just Jesse who found you, and then he showed you to me.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
God bless him.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When I find a YouTuber who makes like one video I like, I watch all of their catalogs.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So as soon as he showed me the BegottaHK video, I watched like every one of the videos on Earth.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You were fucked.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because I had like a new video every day at some point.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So I watched all of it, and I was like, oh yeah, this guy's really cool, and I really enjoyed the Nuzlocke series, because I'd never seen such a like high production Let's Play before.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hey, that was me attempting to emulate the style of Pro Jarrod, because I really liked his Nuzlocke series, but I think I did it better than him, even though he's like a big shit.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, it helps that you're funny.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, and Pro Jarrod is a total normal.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
His audio mixing, we don't need to go too deep into this, because I know how much you love talking about audio mixing, but it's hard to hear him, because he has the game volume.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Too loud.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is a struggle to get through, because I can't hear half the shit he's saying, and he doesn't do any audience interaction.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He's like makes up sounds, and I'm like, okay, I can take his formula and perfect it, get some audience interaction with the names, polish up the sound a little bit more, even though in the fire red days I was using like a shit microphone.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But I still think it was better than his, you know.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, this is somewhere that me and Endless Jess don't quite see eye to eye on, is that I really like the audience interaction aspect.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, he doesn't like it?

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, he just hates the audience.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, he hates the idea of interacting with the audience and letting them get away with being a bunch of idiots, which you kind of do.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Which if I handled it, I wouldn't handle it the way you do.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What do I do?

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I would have audience interaction, but it would be on my terms.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You kind of let the audience run wild and say whatever they want.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You mean like in the Nuzlocke, what do you mean?

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, I just mean in general, like you interact with your audience a lot, but regardless of what they say, you will interact with it.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Like if they shit talk you, you'll still put that in a video.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's funny.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
For me, I would, I love having discussions and stuff, but like if someone's just talking shit, I'll just ban them, you know.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And then like I'll promote the, it's about cultivating your audience.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like what you want them to be like is how you sort of promote them.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But you've kind of let yours just run free and do whatever they want.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I think it's because you and I are making very different types of content.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mine are very much the, like this is the wild west of the internet where anything goes.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I'm going to say the edgiest, most offensive, racist things I can think of.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm going to make fun of everybody.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No holds barred.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Whereas you're like, you know, let's, let's analyze this show and appreciate it or hate it.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So I, it makes sense that I would want more of a wild west.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The internet is a hellhole sort of comment section.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Whereas you would want a thoughtful discussion of a soul eater.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey, soul eater is cool.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He said it in a cool way.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He's excited.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's cool.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm a baby.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm 12.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Anyways, so you, uh, yeah, you've got, you've got a very active comment section.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I imagine,

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's my favorite comment section.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I imagine that your audience interaction is heavily inspired by the, the biggest problem

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
in the universe podcast.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, sure.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I could see that.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They would always bring in voicemails of people shitting on them and it was the funniest

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
stuff.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And that's like, I always wanted to get more in on that, but it doesn't fit my, again,

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
like you just said, we're doing very different kinds of content.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And like for me, uh, if I just make, if I'm tried to make a video like one of yours, it

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
would just be weird.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You know, like on the main channel.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Like it just, it wouldn't inspire the same kind of interactions that yours would.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Whereas like with Maddox, he's kind of had that character for so long that it was like,

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
you know, people were talking to him the same way they would have on the old website.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,500
Um, you know, I remember one of the early videos I saw from you was the monkeys anime

109
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,000
reviews, monkeys anime reviews.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When I review myself.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, but you, you cite all these things that you've been ripping off and a lot of them

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
were stuff that I also was a fan of.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I was like, when I saw a fucking biggest problem, not only that you put in Maddox, but

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
also Dick Masterson, I think, and I was just like, Oh my God, this dude knows his shit.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Um, and a touch on that a little, I mean, this is.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,500
I touch on everything a little bit.

118
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
This is, this is breaching away from just you personally.

119
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,000
But you are like one of the only people I know who got into biggest problem via Dick

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Masterson.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's right.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's right.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And what's the deal with that?

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So I was on poll one day.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The best four-chan board.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, okay.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let's go back in time about 10 years when I was a sophomore in high school.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
10 years.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, let's go back in time about six, seven years.

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I would have been like 15 or 16.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So yeah, about five years.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I found the, the Dr. Phil clip, the infamous men are better than women with Dick Masterson

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
on Dr. Phil.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
And I was really inspired.

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

136
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
And I bought the book.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then in my sophomore year, I did, you always have to do those book projects in high

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
school, like read a book and write a letter to the author or write a three page report.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So I did mine over the biggest, or I did mine over men are better than women by Dick Masterson.

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But little 15, 16 year old mum, he didn't know it was satire.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I thought it was a real like guy.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I was like, what, this guy has the coolest name ever.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's perfect.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I wrote this.

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The letter I wrote to the author was kind of satire because I just wanted to piss off

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
my teacher because she was a hardcore, like feminist, you know, feminazi bitch.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I was like, okay, I'm going to write a letter to the author praising his genius piece of

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
work, men are better than women.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So then that's the end of that.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know, Dick really didn't put out anything else that I could find.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Did you not get any trouble for that essay?

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She thought it was funny.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So she has a sense of humor, at least.

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Mine would not have.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No, not.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
My also feminist AP English teacher.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You probably would have gotten sent to the guidance counselor.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Again.

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, again.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But then fast forward, I guess three or four years later, because I couldn't find anything

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
else from Dick.

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He kind of, the character disappeared and he went off and daxed at his own thing.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But then I'm on poll and I see there's a whole thread about how Dick Masterson just

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
did a podcast episode about SJWs and I'm thinking, what the fuck?

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah.

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What?

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's a dream come true.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So of course I clicked the link and there we go.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's like what?

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Episode 50, something of biggest problem.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm like, holy shit.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is a gold mine.

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's a whole Dick Masterson podcast.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I didn't know who Maddox was.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I had never heard of him up until that point.

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Haven't even seen him at that point.

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So I go listen to the back catalog.

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's the best podcast I've ever heard.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So yeah, I joined it.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I started listening because of my love of Dick.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And then I grew to love Maddox and now it's a full circle of...

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's a...

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What's the...

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
A parabola.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Sure.

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's a roller coaster because you go on the ride but you end at the same place you get

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
on.

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So you took a lot of influence from that podcast in the way you interact with fans,

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
reading comments on the show, allowing lots of shitposting.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's a shame you don't have a voicemail.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, that'd be fun.

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If people sent me like a soundcloud of them shitting on me, I'd probably do an episode

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
about it.

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It'd be fun.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I always thought it's interesting how you take it kind of to the next level and that

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you've had people just outright make videos on your channels.

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What is the deal with Baku Boys and it all that?

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
How does that come to pass?

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Baku Boys in particular is just somebody who over the last year of me doing this with

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
an audience, he's just like somebody who became my friend and he wanted to do a parody of

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
the show, which was just this unwatchable garbage of a parody, parody anime review.

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,480
And Mumkey Jones 2, my second channel, which used to be my main channel until it got

206
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,800
striked and I was like, nope, I'm not putting up with this, time to start over.

207
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,000
And now that the strikes are gone, Mumkey Jones 2 is my designated shitposting channel

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,840
and I just straight up said, anybody can send me anything and I'll put it on this channel,

209
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't care.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So that's how we get the Cream Man, Nuzlocke Let's Plays, we get Baku Boys, Terrible Reviews,

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
there's all kinds of fun stuff on there.

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Because I mean it's just a shitpost channel, you know, it's fun.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So how many YouTube channels have you had?

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh god, like my whole life?

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Infinite number.

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I was talking to Jess about you and he was saying something about you being fairly new

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and I was like, well, I'm pretty sure Mumkey Jones is like not even close to your first YouTube channel.

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's just the first one that's gotten popular.

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What is the first YouTube channel you ever made?

220
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What year and what was on it?

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
First one I made was when I was 11, so actually 10 years ago, and it was called Nubs because

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
my nickname in I guess middle school was Nubs because I would pull my arm inside of my shirt

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and then just stick out the elbow so it was like I was a war veteran who got his arm chopped off.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So everybody called me Nubs back in the day.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Have you ever not been a human shitpost?

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't think so.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I would get in trouble all the time in elementary school.

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
My whole life I've always gotten in trouble for just trying to be funny.

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
For being what we in professional circles refer to as a little shit.

230
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yep, I mean some people seem to like it.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And on that channel I would, my mum had like a shitty little tiny picture camera,

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
but it could also record videos so I'd have my little brother Patsy who would have been 8 or 9 at the time,

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:32,000
record me doing like Chris Angel Mindfreak parodies and I was also a fan of the movie Super Size Me

234
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
with Morgan Spurlock where he eats McDonald's every day for 30 days.

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I started doing parodies of that where I would like drink milk for 30 days

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
or be trapped in my bedroom closet for 30 days, but I mean obviously it's fake.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm just doing it all the same day.

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's all sound genius. How watchable are they?

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They're not. They're awful.

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't think they exist anymore because that channel, so this is the first time I got a channel taken down.

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I assume for copyright reasons.

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Or possibly community guidelines violations.

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So I was 13 at the time. I'm 2 years deep into this channel.

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I got just tons of horrible, unwatchable garbage on there that I would relentlessly like post all over the internet

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
because I wanted to become YouTube famous as all 11 year olds tend to do.

246
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is 2007, right?

247
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well now that you're 13 it's 2009.

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So like YouTube celebrity is not really a thing yet.

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's just that we knew there were some videos that were big.

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That was back when Little Caribo and AVGN were celebrities and they had like 40,000 subs.

251
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, and they weren't even really on YouTube at the beginning.

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, they're on websites.

253
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, I knew both of them at the time, but I didn't associate them with YouTube at all.

254
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I also didn't think they made money.

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I didn't think anybody was making money doing this until Game Grumps revealed that they were making money in the first episode.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So here's how the channel got taken down.

257
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This is the downfall of nubs.

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
There's this video I found.

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't remember what it was called, but the premise is that they have an Elmo toy.

260
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And this is like a professional film company made this video for their channel.

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And it's called like, it's like Elmo's a pimp.

262
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And Elmo's like, I'm gonna bitch slap a hoe. I'm Elmo.

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's like that kind of thing.

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So what I did was I downloaded their video and then I uploaded it on my channel and I called it Elmo's a pimp in all caps.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And it got like a good amount of views.

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So you just straight-free booted their video.

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So then the company-

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why did you think that was okay?

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is not the end of my hubris, my friend.

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So the company very politely just sends me a YouTube message saying, hey, this is our video.

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Can you take it down?

272
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
God, this must be like way before the whole content ID day.

273
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's way back in the day.

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can't even imagine a company politely messaging me to take my video down today.

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Believe it or not, I did not take advantage of their kindhearted gesture.

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Because I reply, I'm ready.

277
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm like, hey, this is a good opportunity for me.

278
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I said, how about you make a video like making fun of me or something?

279
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, I see. You tried to game them back.

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And then the next day my channel was deleted.

281
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Wow.

282
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It didn't work.

283
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's a little shit when I was 13.

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That was a foolish endeavor all around, I would say.

285
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So all those videos are gone.

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Why in the first place did you think it would be a good idea to re-upload their video?

287
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Because I was like 12.

288
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I thought it's popular, so I'll also get...

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What even could you rip it with back then?

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Did they have YouTube rips? Websites?

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They must have. We had something.

292
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, well, so that's your first channel, Dead.

293
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So I'm assuming you didn't have any side channels at the time.

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It was just that one.

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I didn't know. I didn't need any side channels because nobody was watching.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So what's the next channel you make?

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Then in, I guess in high school I had one that still exists,

298
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
but once Monkey got big I changed the name and I put all the videos on private.

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So all these videos are still out there.

300
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And I can post them sometime, just not yet.

301
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm biding my time for these ones.

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But these ones, like, maybe there's some that are watchable, you know?

303
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What kind of videos are they?

304
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Like sketch comedy, kind of stuff.

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I've talked about this other places, but we did a kind of a game show

306
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
based off of impractical jokers and kind of like based off a jackass

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
called Challenge Showdown where my group of friends, each episode,

308
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
one of them would be randomly picked to do a crazy challenge,

309
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
like chug five, five hour energies at the same time,

310
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
or go into Walmart and throw spaghetti all over the cash register person.

311
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Now how bad is the production quality of this shit?

312
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are you talking like barely audible wind noise everywhere?

313
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Um, most of it was filmed indoors, so it's not too bad.

314
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Wait, one of them threw spaghetti at a cashier.

315
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, that's inside Walmart.

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We were filming inside the store.

317
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh my god, you didn't get in trouble for that one?

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, we left. We ran out.

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, so okay, you had this show, then just sketch comedy.

320
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, I had a sketch show.

321
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I started a film club in my school because I wanted people to make videos with me

322
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
because like nobody really wanted to.

323
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I was the only guy in the whole school making videos.

324
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So I started a film club and the show I started using the people who joined the film club

325
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
was called Family Sitcom.

326
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I wanted to call it Family Shitcom, but it was associated with the school so I couldn't.

327
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And the idea was I wanted to, every week I wanted to have a new sketch out

328
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and I did that for about two months.

329
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And some of those are pretty golden actually.

330
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Some of them I consider to be like the best things I've made.

331
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So you've always been pretty prolific.

332
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah, I've tried to keep myself to a schedule.

333
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah, because I think it's the most important thing about building up skill is to work fast

334
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and get lots of stuff out there.

335
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And it's especially important when you're young.

336
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Like you build up that speed and that stamina and then you never quite lose it.

337
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's like once you've done a video every week then you now know that that's a thing you can do.

338
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So then going into the future you are always like, well I know I did that before.

339
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So I know it's possible.

340
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And something that pisses me off is I'll always see comments about like,

341
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
oh, monkey, it should be quality over quantity.

342
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And I'm like, bitch, fuck it, they're quality and they're quantity, fuck you.

343
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Well, I mean that's the thing, it's like you can do, if someone only gets out one video every six months

344
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and it's extremely high quality, but you get out a video every week

345
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and at least one out of four is extremely high quality, who's got the better channel?

346
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, I would rather watch a weekly show that's like a six out of ten

347
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
than watch one episode of a ten out of ten show that comes out once a year.

348
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's just me and I can see why people wouldn't like that as much,

349
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
but I'd rather just have more consistent shows.

350
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah, it's helpful for, it works well with what YouTube is now, which is a replacement for television.

351
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No one's watching TV, we need something to be, we need a constant drip feed of YouTube content

352
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
to fill in our day and as much as I love those ten out of ten videos

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
where I can go back and watch them again, it's like this isn't helping me on the daily grind of my life

354
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
where I need there to be a certain number of hours of YouTube content every day,

355
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
which for me, I don't get enough of it from other people so I just make it myself.

356
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah, you have to make your own videos.

357
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I think I heard that DigiBro just watches his own videos all day because they're so good.

358
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I heard that somewhere, I don't know where.

359
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's not true at all.

360
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So what do you watch?

361
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Because in spite of making a channel called Mumkey's Anime Reviews, you don't really watch much anime.

362
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No.

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And you've indicated a few times that you don't watch a whole lot of YouTube, it doesn't seem like.

364
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No.

365
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So what do you spend your time on? What do Mumkeys get down to?

366
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Most of my day is just spent sitting there wishing I had something to do.

367
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I've said this a million times, the best treatment for depression is distractions,

368
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and I think my problem is I keep running out of distractions and that's why I always feel so depressed all the time.

369
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's precisely why up until you come, like all I've been looking forward to all month is you coming here today,

370
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and then me planning what I'm going to do for the next month and a half,

371
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
because I've been depressed for most of this year so far,

372
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and the only thing that's going to get me out of it is...

373
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That Donald Trump election, man. Really got to you.

374
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't even care about that.

375
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But I've been depressed for most of the year and it's mostly because there's not enough to do,

376
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
sitting around in your room, even if you run out of YouTube videos, you're fucked.

377
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You're just like, well, I don't know what else I'm supposed to be doing right now,

378
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and watching anime is too tied to work for me, so it's not as relaxing as it should be.

379
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You can't just sit there and watch, you have to analyze everything.

380
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Or even if I could, I just feel like it's all tied to work somehow.

381
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But I'm like, I need to get out of the house or just hang out with other people,

382
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and I'm like, well, at least I'll know that the weekend that Mumkeys at my house,

383
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I won't be depressed because we'll be doing things.

384
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We'll just occupy our time.

385
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And the best part is, I don't have to look at Twitter, I don't have to look at my YouTube comments,

386
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
because I don't need something to distract me from what's going on.

387
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And Twitter and comments are just going to make you more depressed.

388
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Right, exactly.

389
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, that's the thing.

390
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The only reason to look at them is that you have nothing better to do.

391
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I would never go on Twitter at all if I had anything to do,

392
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
but because I don't, I'll just sit there and read people talking shit about me all day

393
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and getting more and more angry and making more and more drunken rants,

394
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
all because I'm too bored and I don't have enough to do.

395
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But I'm certainly not thinking about shitty commenters while we're doing a podcast,

396
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
aside from the fact that I'm referring to them.

397
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So, all right, we kind of got off away from your YouTube videos.

398
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I still want to know more about your other channels.

399
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So, you've got the one that's all set to private right now.

400
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What came next after that?

401
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Then came The Mumkey and Big Show, which is what got this whole Mumkey thing started,

402
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
which was just a shitty Let's Play channel with me and my old pal Biggs,

403
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
who has appeared in a few anime reviews.

404
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And a lot of Drunken Minecraft.

405
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah, yeah, he came back from The Let's Play Show.

406
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And I've told this story a million times, but I'm sure somebody doesn't know it.

407
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But the gist is, me and Biggs did a YouTube Let's Play channel for about two years.

408
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Then I started making the anime reviews just because I was bored and I thought it'd be funny.

409
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And so the first one was Girls Bravo.

410
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And then like seven months later came The Death Note 1.

411
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And then five months later came The Yamada 1.

412
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And then like half a year after that is when the Yamada video went viral for the first time.

413
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Got a shit ton of views and I was like, okay, okay, finally something. People like it.

414
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Wait, which channel was this all on?

415
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This is on The Monkey and Biggs Show.

416
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Okay, so the original post of Monkey and Biggs Show,

417
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
which was mostly a Let's Play channel that just had a few anime reviews spliced in?

418
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

419
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Okay.

420
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So at that point we got a bunch of subscribers on The Monkey and Biggs Show,

421
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
but I knew, well, when we upload more Let's Plays, they're gonna leave.

422
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
They don't want to watch this shit.

423
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Right.

424
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So I made a new channel called Monkey's Anime Reviews.

425
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And that's where that's where that started.

426
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And I started making anime reviews on the weekly.

427
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So how much did the Yamada video blow up on The Monkey and Biggs Show?

428
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
What view count were we talking?

429
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Like 400,000.

430
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh my god.

431
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah.

432
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So huge.

433
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Huge.

434
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So you can imagine my sadness when Biggs makes the decision to delete the channel

435
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
without like asking me or, you know, he could have just quit being on it.

436
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But no, he had to delete it.

437
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And YouTube, of course, the great company that they are,

438
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
if a channel gets deleted for any reason, they're not gonna give it back to you.

439
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Christ.

440
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So my big viral video gone forever.

441
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah.

442
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
That's a serious fucking view count.

443
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
400,000.

444
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah.

445
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What was your subscriber total on that channel?

446
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I think it peaked at like 1,000.

447
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Okay.

448
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So the viralness did not attract subscribers because most of the channel was Let's Play.

449
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
When they saw it was a Let's Play channel, I imagine they scurried away.

450
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
How many, like what was the frequency of uploads of these Let's Plays and what games and stuff?

451
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So this is when I got real serious about doing a schedule.

452
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And for a long time, The Monkey and Big Show, for almost an entire year we had two new videos

453
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
a day.

454
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh my god.

455
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
We had-

456
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Full Game Grumps.

457
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah.

458
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I've heard parts of this story, but I didn't realize that The Monkey and Big Show had been around

459
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
for so long and had so many videos.

460
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
This was like a serious full blown channel.

461
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yes.

462
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Why did he delete it?

463
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yes.

464
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yes.

465
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's why it was so devastating.

466
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And you didn't kill him.

467
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I almost did.

468
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I didn't talk to him for a long, long time.

469
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah.

470
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Which I shouldn't have even talked to him ever again, but-

471
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Did he ever like apologize?

472
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Of course not.

473
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Of course fucking not.

474
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Fucking piece of shit.

475
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
He still thinks he's justified to this day.

476
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Why did he delete it?

477
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
What was his reason?

478
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Because now that we had an audience and like we were averaging about 100 views per Let's

479
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Play episode, I was like, oh yeah, people are actually watching.

480
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So Biggs took it upon himself to actually, because I would edit and upload every single

481
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
video.

482
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Right.

483
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And my internet was shit, so it would take me like three hours to upload each video,

484
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
living out in the boonies.

485
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So I said, hey Biggs, can you edit these and upload them?

486
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
All you have to do is watch them and make sure we don't say each other's names and if we

487
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
do, edit it out and then upload it.

488
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
He said, oh yeah, I'll do it.

489
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'll do it.

490
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Three days ago by, he wouldn't upload a video.

491
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So I'd be pestering him in the text.

492
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah, dude, you missed the upload again today.

493
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What's going on?

494
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Oh yeah, I'll do it.

495
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'll do it.

496
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Doesn't do it.

497
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I keep pestering him.

498
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
He's like, oh, oh, fine, fine.

499
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
If you think I'm so lazy, I'll just delete it.

500
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
What?

501
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's early enough.

502
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It was gone.

503
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What the fuck?

504
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah, that's the, and that's one of the best friends I've ever had, did you?

505
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
One of the best friends I've ever had deleted my viral video.

506
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah.

507
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Biggs, you are a human waste.

508
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah.

509
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I hope you get diabetes and die.

510
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I think he hopes that too.

511
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You're singing him praises as far as he's concerned.

512
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
All right, so Monkey and Biggs gets deleted.

513
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Where do we go from here?

514
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So now I still have the Monkey's Anime Reviews channel, which luckily a lot of people had

515
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
already switched over to.

516
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,500
But now I have to find a way to get all those views back on the Omni Video, which doesn't

517
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,500
happen for quite a few months, but at some point it does go viral on Reddit again.

518
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
So this is the second time.

519
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,500
The same video goes viral and gets on the front page of Reddit.

520
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Unbelievable luck that that happened.

521
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
It's happened like three times total.

522
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
So it was luck the first time.

523
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
I mean, I guess that video is just that good.

524
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
I guess so.

525
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,500
I mean, it's a lot like I had a similar experience with my why good anime is hard to make video,

526
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,500
where that one had like went viral when it came out and got up to 300,000 views.

527
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,500
And then a full year later, it just suddenly rocketed up to a million.

528
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
And I have no idea why still.

529
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
I don't know where you don't know where it was posted.

530
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
No idea.

531
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't know if it was posted in a place or if it just got caught up because it was around.

532
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
It was like I hit 100,000 subscribers.

533
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,500
And right after that happened, like all my videos started getting a lot more views as

534
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
a YouTube start.

535
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
I think YouTube starts promoting you more once you hit 100K.

536
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
I need to hit 100K.

537
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
It takes you more seriously as a channel.

538
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,500
And so it starts, it puts you puts you in the algorithm more.

539
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,500
And so that video just caught a second wind and fucking like wildfire blew up the channel.

540
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Yeah.

541
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,500
And I gained like, it was like I hit 100K after like a slow steady buildup.

542
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
And then the next 30K in like a week.

543
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
God damn.

544
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Well, I hope that happens to me.

545
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I can't wait.

546
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
It sounds great.

547
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
What were you about to say?

548
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
You're continuing your story.

549
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
You've got monkeys anime.

550
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Yeah.

551
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Okay.

552
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
So it blows up again and I'm ecstatic.

553
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
So what kind of blow up are we talking about this time?

554
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I'm getting one new subscriber, I think every 10 seconds.

555
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Jesus.

556
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
And this happens for a full night.

557
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,500
So I wake up the next morning and it's like thousands higher than it was when I went to bed.

558
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
And it's still growing and growing and growing.

559
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
I'm like, oh yeah.

560
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Yeah, this is great.

561
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
I got him.

562
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,500
I got him in videos.

563
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
How many views does this second Yamada video?

564
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
They always end up with like half a million.

565
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Okay.

566
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Yeah.

567
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,500
So three times this video has reached half a million.

568
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,500
And this motherfucker, Flutterbutter, who God bless him because he patroned me at $50 per month for a long time to make up for this.

569
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:25,500
When he found it the first time, he took my Yamada video and put it on his Facebook account without any link to my YouTube or anything.

570
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
So free booted it.

571
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Yeah.

572
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Like who would do such a thing?

573
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Who would just download somebody else's hard work video and upload it further as if they made it?

574
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Like I can't think of a bigger scumbag.

575
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Do you know that term free booting?

576
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,500
No, I mean I can assume what it means.

577
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Well it was coined specifically to refer to the Facebook because there's tons of people who do this who take YouTube videos, re-upload them to Facebook with like the identifier scrubbed off and they go viral there because it's easier on Facebook.

578
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,500
It happened to Jesse with Fuck Up Dates.

579
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
That video has a lot of views anyway though.

580
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
It has like 100,000 on YouTube.

581
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,500
It has millions on Facebook from people's free booting.

582
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Hey I was going to say my Yamada video on Flutterbutter's Facebook got 2 million views and I, like that, I was flabbergasted.

583
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
That's a lot.

584
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Yeah.

585
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
I'm imagining all the ad revenue I missed out on.

586
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Uh, $2,000.

587
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
The ad revenue you missed out on.

588
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Hey Flutterbutter thanks for I guess the 250 you gave me on Patreon.

589
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Did he make money off of the Facebook?

590
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
I have no idea.

591
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
I don't care.

592
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
I really don't care.

593
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Yeah.

594
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,500
So uh, so you've got, you're now gaining subs on Monkey's Anime reviews.

595
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,500
At this point, my channel, so my channel has two strikes on it.

596
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Because I made a review of Boku No Pico where I did, I made no effort to censor anything.

597
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Yeah.

598
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Because I thought that the anime having a pixelated penis was enough censorship.

599
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
No.

600
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Not even close.

601
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
So that's strike number one.

602
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Strike number two.

603
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Not to mention there's like cum everywhere.

604
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Well, I mean, I said in the review that it was like ice cream or something, so I thought it was okay.

605
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Yeah, no.

606
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Not happening.

607
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Uh, so you think I would learn my lesson?

608
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
No.

609
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Because then, number two, strike number two, I make Boku No Pico abridged.

610
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Oh no.

611
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Which is currently still uploaded on my Facebook page if you're curious to see it.

612
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Again, that gets, that gets blown the fuck out.

613
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
They're like, nope.

614
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Strike two.

615
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
Now my channel is blowing up and I think, okay.

616
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,500
These are community guidelines strikes, by the way, which are much harder to beat back than, than, than content ID.

617
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Because they usually, I've had a couple of them on totally innocuous videos that still managed to, I couldn't get them back.

618
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
I couldn't beat the claims.

619
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
What was there?

620
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
What were they saying?

621
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
What's wrong with it?

622
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,500
One, one was on a video about a pony ask blog called Ask Princess Milestia.

623
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
And there was a huge, like.

624
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Well, I wonder why they took it down.

625
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Well, the thing is, none of the imagery was actually, like, 18 plus or anything.

626
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
But this, there was a, this is how I found out about SJWs.

627
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Because there was a huge SJW screed against that blog.

628
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
And they got it taken off of Tumblr.

629
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,500
They got Tumblr, a website full of porn, to take down Ask Princess Milestia because they were offended about it.

630
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
I think there was an internet aristocrat video about this very thing.

631
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,500
I, I distinctly remember something about that.

632
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,500
But yeah, they got that blog taken down and then they got my video taken down about the blog.

633
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,500
So, and so I got a guideline strike on that, contested it, didn't win.

634
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:43,500
The next one I got, this one's just utter bullshit, was for a review of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure that there was literally, I have no idea.

635
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,500
I think someone just had it out for me and got a guideline strike on it.

636
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
And yeah, it just went down.

637
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
And then I think I did beat that one, but it took a while.

638
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,500
And it was just like, yeah, guideline strikes are hard to beat.

639
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
They're pain in the ass.

640
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Well, I didn't get an opportunity to try to fight the third one because once you hit strike three, you're out.

641
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,500
You don't even get a chance to say, hey, you know, you took this down wrong.

642
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,500
So when I see him blowing up, I think, okay, I got to make a new video right now to celebrate all these new subs.

643
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:20,500
So I wanted to make a satirical video mocking how like porn on YouTube and people are always looking for porn on YouTube.

644
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,500
And if you're like, I had it on the Let's Play series that there was, we're doing Mega Man Legends too.

645
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:35,500
And at the time, each episode had like maybe 20 views, but then there was one that had like kind of a pornographic name and it had like 10 times the views.

646
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
So that was my inspiration.

647
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Like, why the fuck it says Mega Man Legends, let's play episode 14, like role hentai or something.

648
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Why does this have so many more views?

649
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Why are these idiots clicking on this?

650
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
Why are they searching for this on YouTube?

651
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,500
So the whole video was making fun of kind of that idea.

652
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,500
But I think where I fucked up was that the title of the video to play into the satire was all caps.

653
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Hentai porn, XXX, YouTube naked girls, boobs, blah, blah, blah.

654
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,500
So I think that just hit the computer, the system, they're like, oh, take it down, take it down.

655
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Like there's no way computers don't understand satire, I guess.

656
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
So they see that title and they take it down.

657
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,500
It's also that misleading titles are against the YouTube problem.

658
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
It wasn't misleading.

659
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
It's a satirical thing, right?

660
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
I would argue for it.

661
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,500
I would argue against YouTube about that, but you didn't get the chance.

662
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Yeah, I didn't get the chance.

663
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,500
So they take down the video and now I have no YouTube channel, they're all gone.

664
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,500
So when I make the new one, all the old fans have to somehow come back and find me.

665
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Because I don't have a Twitter, I don't have a Facebook or anything at that point.

666
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Or maybe I'd started the Facebook maybe.

667
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,500
But yeah, so I have to pretty much start from scratch again and all the fans have to find me again.

668
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,500
I'm sure there's hundreds, if not thousands of people out there who just forgot about me and never bothered to find me again.

669
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Which is so disappointing and sad.

670
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
That's why I keep...

671
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,500
The reason I have so many social media accounts everywhere is for this exact reason.

672
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
There's always people who won't...

673
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:05,500
I mean, there's people still who watch all of my main channel videos and somehow don't know about Digiroft or Dark

674
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,500
or the Twitter or something, even though I mentioned it in every video I make.

675
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,500
But there's always someone who's discovering it for the first time.

676
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
But for me, it's just, I just need there to be...

677
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:23,500
It's like one of those ancient demons where as long as one percent of it survives, the rest can grow back.

678
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,500
That's how I feel. As long as there's some people who know who I am, I can grow back.

679
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,500
So if the YouTube channel goes, at least I've got the Twitter guys, they'll follow me to the next channel.

680
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
And that channel will grow on its own.

681
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
But you were kind of an up shit creak with literally no power.

682
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Had nothing.

683
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,500
So that's when... What is now Monkey Jones 2? That's when I made that channel.

684
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Which was just called Monkey Jones at the time.

685
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Because I dropped the name Monkey's Anime Reviews in favor of Monkey Jones.

686
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I think that's what happened. This is all a blur in my head over the last year.

687
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,500
But then, of course, I start getting strikes on this channel too.

688
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
I'm like, fuck it, we're starting over again, boys!

689
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,500
So I make the new Monkey Jones channel, switch the old one to...

690
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,500
It was called Too Damn Monkey as a reference to Filthy Frank's shitpost channel.

691
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
And it was called this for a while. When I followed you, it was still called Too Damn Monkey.

692
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,500
It was called that for about half a year, I think, and then I decided, now let's just make it two.

693
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,500
People are too confused by what it means, and I'm tired of explaining it.

694
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,500
And then all the strikes, you know, cleared off, and now I have, you know, all four of these channels.

695
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,500
So this is why if you go all the way back through Monkey Jones 2, some of the Anime Reviews are there.

696
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Yeah.

697
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Some of the early ones.

698
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,500
But I made the new channel, I just reposted all of the Anime Reviews again.

699
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
I think there were like 10 up to that point.

700
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,500
So the current Monkey's Anime Reviews, Yamada's first time blows up a third time.

701
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Yep.

702
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,500
This video has saved your life countless times.

703
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Because if not for it blowing up again, you would still be in the situation if no one knows where you are.

704
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,500
I'd probably still be at like, you know, 500 subs at this point.

705
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,500
But yeah, it keeps blowing up, and then that gives people opportunities to find other videos that have potential for blowing up.

706
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,500
The Elliot Rodger video has been posted in some subreddits.

707
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,500
The InCells video gets posted to InCells like every week.

708
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
That's fucking great.

709
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
How do they feel about it?

710
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,500
For the most part, they think it's funny, but they're like, oh, he's misrepresenting this guy.

711
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Oh, of course.

712
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
And I'm like, dude, I just took posts from here.

713
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Yeah, literal quotes from you guys.

714
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,500
But I mean, I did go out of my way to find the funny stuff.

715
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Right, of course.

716
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
I mean, I don't know.

717
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
The concept alone is hilarious.

718
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,500
And the Corey in the House video has been posted some places because it's my second most viewed video, I think.

719
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Which I think it should be first.

720
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
I think it's way better than Yamada.

721
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,500
But I just have a personal preference for Elliot Rodger stuff.

722
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,500
I think the Yamada one is...

723
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,500
It's one of my favorites on your channel just because it's got that...

724
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
It's such a clear line.

725
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
You know, there's no...

726
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Like most of your videos, they go in a lot of different directions.

727
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Yamada is just one tension build the whole way through.

728
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,500
It just starts off seeming one way, then it starts to lean.

729
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,500
It just keeps leaning further and further until it just falls right off a cliff.

730
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
And that's what's so great about it.

731
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,500
And people say, why don't you make more videos like Yamada?

732
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
You need to keep making...

733
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,500
This is the video everybody likes, but I feel like I can't.

734
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
No, it's not duplicatable.

735
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
No, you can't.

736
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,500
And it'll be so obvious that he's just doing Yamada again.

737
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
You can't please these fucking idiots.

738
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Well, that's what people don't under...

739
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,500
People who aren't creative don't understand that like...

740
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
You can't just make Yamada again.

741
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Yeah, you can't just fucking recreate the same thing.

742
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,500
And it's going to be obvious and it's never going to top it.

743
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Because now everybody's expecting it, so the joke doesn't work.

744
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
If it was already...

745
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,500
It'd be one thing if you made a video that wasn't super successful,

746
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,500
it was a good idea, and then you iterated on that and made a better version.

747
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,500
But if it was already a huge success, there's no topping it.

748
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
There's no surprise anymore.

749
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Yeah, like we already have the Yamada video.

750
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
It's already done the rounds.

751
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Several rounds.

752
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Now it's time for something else to do the rounds.

753
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Can I find another video that is not the same, but will also become a huge hit?

754
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Oh, Jesus.

755
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Alright.

756
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
That about capitalizing your whole YouTube history.

757
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Do you have any other channels we should know about?

758
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I mean, we've got the new gaming channel.

759
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Yeah, yeah.

760
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,500
So, well, that's another sad tale of a co-host that didn't work.

761
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,500
But it started off as a monkey and an animal's gaming expedition.

762
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:39,500
And I tested the waters on the main Monkey Jones channel with my fire red Nuzlocke Let's Play.

763
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,500
And, you know, a fair number of people have liked it.

764
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,500
So I said, okay, I'll do a separate channel so that your feed...

765
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Most people just want the anime reviews.

766
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Let's not clog up their feed with three times a week of Pokemon Let's Play.

767
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
I'll do a new channel with it.

768
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,500
And my buddy, Manimal, he's been wanting to do video game review videos for years.

769
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,500
And he keeps talking about how he's going to start his own video game review channel.

770
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I said, dude, you can join up with me.

771
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
We're like best buds at this point.

772
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,500
I'll give you a free audience of a thousand people.

773
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,500
This great opportunity that most new content creators don't get.

774
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,500
You can just... I'll give you my audience.

775
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
You have the exact mindset I do, Monkey.

776
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,500
That's what I've told so many of Victor or other friends of mine, where I'm just like...

777
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:32,500
You don't understand that if you make anything and I like it and I can promote it, you're in the door.

778
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,500
You know, like a shade as a music producer.

779
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,500
He's made hundreds of dollars just because he makes beats for me and I'm already famous.

780
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,500
So people will buy my album because I'm Digi Bro.

781
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,500
It's like shade, all you have to do is make...

782
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:53,500
No other musician gets this opportunity to just make money just because you're tied to this other guy.

783
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,500
But it's totally worth it because you can launch a career out of it.

784
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,500
If people like your beats, they're going to want to hire you to do more.

785
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,500
I've been trying to convince Victor for years to become a YouTuber.

786
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,500
He just doesn't have a good idea for what he wants to do with it.

787
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Isn't it weird how frustrating it is that nobody wants to take advantage of you?

788
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I don't say that with any irony or anything.

789
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,500
I want my friends to take advantage of me so that they can be making things with me.

790
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,500
You know, Cob always wanted to make videos with me. He made a lot of videos with me back in the day.

791
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Cob, hey, I got 10,000 subs. Let's make some stuff together. People will watch it.

792
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
I don't know.

793
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Part of the problem is that it's so hard to convince people that it can take off.

794
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:46,500
For instance, on DigiBros, it's a Let's Play channel that for a very long time we didn't take seriously at all.

795
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,500
It was just for fun and I would have my friends and stuff on there.

796
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:59,500
I would always be like, you know guys, if we want to take this seriously, this channel can take off and it can become a job.

797
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
But no one would ever do it because they just don't see it.

798
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:07,500
Even though I'm standing here with a 300,000 subscriber channel going, I know it's possible.

799
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
I even know how to do it.

800
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:15,500
But it's just a matter of convincing people like, hey, I know that this seems like it won't work out

801
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,500
and for a year it's going to seem that way, but eventually it will take off.

802
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:27,500
I think it revealed to me that there is a very clear distinction between those who are consumers and those who are creators.

803
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:34,500
And I think it takes a very particular type of person to be an actual creator who has a bit of a work ethic

804
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
and actually is motivated to do things.

805
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,500
And I found very quickly that none of my friends meet that criteria.

806
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:47,500
So I was like, oh man, you want to do this, here's the audience for it, do it, oh yeah, okay.

807
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,500
What you just described is how the procrastinators happened.

808
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Because individually, none of us have friends who will do things.

809
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Ben and Nate are brothers and that's why both of them are, they both work on creative projects,

810
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
which is why they're both in the PCP.

811
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,500
We've had times where my brother and Hippo's brother were both in there.

812
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,500
We've had them in the chat before, but they never posted or anything and they never made anything.

813
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,500
So they're very talented, either one of them could launch a YouTube channel.

814
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,500
They just didn't have good ideas for it.

815
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,500
And all my other friends, I would try to get them involved in every video all the time.

816
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,500
I always wanted them in less place.

817
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
That's been the last year of my life.

818
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
I would always want to do skits, no one ever wanted to do skits.

819
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,500
It's so frustrating.

820
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,500
It's really difficult because you're just, it's like you can see the successful version of it.

821
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,500
You can picture in your mind, guys, if you just, if you just for one afternoon,

822
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,500
decide you want to just like stop sitting around being ironic hipsters about everything

823
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,500
and work on a video and take it seriously.

824
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,500
There's a chance this video could set us all up with careers, you know,

825
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
but no one will do it because they can't picture it the way that you can.

826
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,500
And the thing that makes me the most angry is that these fuckers are all talk.

827
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,500
They're all bark and no bite because they would spend, you know, the years before I was monkey,

828
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,500
we would just sit around and they'd talk about how they want to make all these things.

829
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,500
And now that I'm actually doing it and they have the opportunity to join me,

830
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
suddenly now they don't want to.

831
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,500
And I'd rather just play Call of Duty again tonight.

832
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Where the fuck was the cop from three years ago who was making videos with me every fucking weekend?

833
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Now that we have success you give up, that doesn't make any fucking sense.

834
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:41,500
It's just people become complacent because at some point, as a creative minded person,

835
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,500
I think there's a definitive moment when it sinks in, I'm not built for this.

836
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,500
You know, and it's like, it's when, I think maybe it's because you got successful that they realize.

837
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,500
I sense a lot of resentment about it.

838
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,500
I think it was a lot of jealousy and that might sound conceited,

839
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,500
but I feel like a lot of them felt that way like, oh, monkey doesn't deserve it.

840
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,500
I do. I'm grumble, grumble. I don't want to eat off of his success.

841
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
I do.

842
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,500
I mean, my friends weren't quite like that, but I definitely think that it was when I started,

843
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:17,500
I started really making it that it, when one person makes it, it makes everyone else assess

844
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
what's the difference between me and them.

845
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,500
And then that's when they realize maybe I can't do it.

846
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Like when they realize that you were doing work every week

847
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,500
and that they did not want to do that work every week

848
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,500
or like once they understood what the work would be

849
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,500
and that they didn't want to do that work, you know?

850
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
They decided, you know, maybe I'm better just as a consumer.

851
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Right.

852
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Not as a creator.

853
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,500
I mean, that's why I never became a filmmaker because before I did YouTube for years,

854
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
I wanted to be a film director.

855
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,500
Me and my cousin Boyd and my brother Victor.

856
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Well, the thing is that like we got all the material, we had a camera, we had, you know,

857
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:58,500
I'd listened to all these Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez talking about like,

858
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
just pick up your camera and go outside and film stuff.

859
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,500
I didn't go to film school.

860
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
I went to films.

861
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Yeah.

862
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Well, there was one quote in particular where Tarantino says,

863
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,500
spend your whole, like every day when you come home from work, work on a script.

864
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,500
And then on the weekend, shoot that script.

865
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
That's how you become a great filmmaker.

866
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
And I was like, that makes perfect sense.

867
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,500
That's obviously what you have to do.

868
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,500
But if you come home from work and you don't want to write a script

869
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,500
and this keeps happening and you keep telling yourself you'll do it eventually,

870
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,500
at some point you have to say, well, this obviously is something I'm never going to do.

871
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,500
And I think that might be, you know, what happened to my cousin

872
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,500
because he for a very long time was saying he was going to be a director.

873
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
And then at some point he just stopped bringing it up, you know,

874
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,500
because I think he realized, well, I'm not doing it.

875
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
So I'm obviously not doing it.

876
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,500
Whereas Victor is now doing it.

877
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Yeah.

878
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,500
And I mean, I feel the same way as my cousin.

879
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,500
I gave up at some point I realized I like, like,

880
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
how about instead of forcing myself to try to make films,

881
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
which I'm obviously not doing,

882
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,500
I could look at this thing that I do every day for no reason,

883
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,500
which is right about anime and try to make a career out of that, you know.

884
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Yeah.

885
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Yeah, I guess there are some things that you're just more pre pre built for doing

886
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
and you should figure that out.

887
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,500
Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is that Manimal was super excited about making these reviews

888
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,500
and then he never did.

889
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
But we we did want it.

890
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,500
He was very adamant that it shouldn't be just a let's play channel

891
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
because he looks down on that.

892
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
I used to as well.

893
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,500
But now, now that I know, like,

894
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
I think everybody does until they do it.

895
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Right.

896
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
It's not because I realize podcasts.

897
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,500
It's not because I realize all this is easy and easy video,

898
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,500
but because like it does mean something to a lot of the audience to have like every day.

899
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Here's my 15 minute video where I hear these people who I like talking about.

900
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,500
If you're if you're fucking entertaining enough that people will watch it,

901
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
you've earned it, you know.

902
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,500
Yeah, that's true.

903
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,500
Like people people can shit all day on like the Game Grumps, for instance.

904
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
And I mean, I don't think they're funny anymore.

905
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:02,500
But like the idea of being as funny as they are as consistently as they were

906
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,500
for a fucking year with two uploads a day, 20 minutes a day of you being funny.

907
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,500
You know, that's 20 minutes of improv comedy coming out every single day.

908
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Like in the game does not carry it.

909
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Like people watch Game Grumps for them.

910
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
People don't care about the video games they're playing.

911
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,500
I can't remember the last time I watched the Game Grumps without it being open in a different tab.

912
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Yeah.

913
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
I just listen to them talk.

914
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,500
I mean, if sometimes it's a game they're more reactive to you will.

915
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
But like, you know, if you're watching like Pokemon, you know, look at that.

916
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Yeah.

917
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Open it up in a new tab, sit around, listen to it all day, you know, or,

918
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:40,500
or just have it on like when I binge watched the entire Dan era, I just had it.

919
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Fuck.

920
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,500
I just had it full screen.

921
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,500
Was that like a year and a half at that point?

922
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
Yeah, it was close to two years.

923
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,500
That's a lot.

924
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Yeah.

925
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,500
And I hadn't seen any of it because I'd quit after John left.

926
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,500
That's fair.

927
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
And so I caught up on all of it in the span of a couple of weeks after my,

928
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,500
it was when my channel got deleted by YouTube.

929
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
So I was depressed.

930
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:05,500
So I just laid on like the couch and watched and just binged it for fucking two weeks.

931
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,500
And was it a good two weeks or a bad two weeks?

932
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Well, I mean,

933
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,500
Gingrumps numbed me to the crushing pain that I was feeling outside of watching Game Grumps.

934
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,500
Now, did, did you dislike Dan at first or like, did he grow on you?

935
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
Or are we always the same?

936
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,500
Um, he definitely grew on me in this.

937
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,500
I don't think I disliked him.

938
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,500
It was just that the breakup was so traumatizing.

939
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
And it was so out of nowhere.

940
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
Yeah.

941
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,500
And then that Dan sounded a lot like he, his voice was too similar to Aaron and he wasn't

942
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
confrontational in the way that they've been before.

943
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
It just didn't have the same chemistry.

944
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:45,500
And suddenly he was half the channel because he was on both steam train and Game Grumps.

945
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
Well, and I found steam train insufferable and I still do.

946
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
I've never been able to sit through a whole episode.

947
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,500
Is it because of Ross?

948
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,500
Yeah.

949
00:49:52,500 --> 00:50:00,500
I mean, it's, it's that, uh, like Ross and Barry can be funny, but just not on that show.

950
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:05,500
Like they can't be funny as, uh, as guys playing video games.

951
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Yeah.

952
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,500
I, I like Barry probably 30 times more than I like Ross.

953
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,500
I think Barry is pretty cool.

954
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
I think, I think both of that.

955
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Like if you listen to like Ross and Aaron talk about animation, like that one, uh, let's draw that they did.

956
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,500
It was like 50 minutes of them just discussing animation.

957
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Ross comes off as like a cool and interesting guy.

958
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Um, but when he's trying to be like funny and off the cuff, he just comes off as an obnoxious fucking boy.

959
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,500
Uh, and then Barry is just, uh, too normie.

960
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,500
I think he's just not a comedian.

961
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
He doesn't have like the comedy chops.

962
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:42,500
He's a good editor and he's, you know, he can write a good script, but not a good, uh, anyway, we're, we're off in the weeds.

963
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Yeah.

964
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,500
So he, Manimal didn't want it to be a standard Let's Play channel.

965
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
He wanted us to put in a whole bunch of work.

966
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,500
He wanted all the boring parts to be cut out, which for a long time we did.

967
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,500
I think the first game we did was his, one of his favorite games, Shadow Run.

968
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,500
Was it the first?

969
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
Yeah.

970
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
And like those are heavily edited.

971
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
There's always shit getting cut out all the time.

972
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,500
Yeah.

973
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
He also wanted us to do skits and stuff.

974
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:11,500
And those almost, almost primarily or almost exclusively came up in the Nuzlocs.

975
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Like the FireRed Nuzlocke had some fun live action skits with Manimal.

976
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,500
And then, uh, I don't know.

977
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,500
We did some other things.

978
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,500
Which the live action skits in the FireRed playthrough are legendary.

979
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,500
That's some of my favorite parts of your whole channel.

980
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,500
Just him running shirtless through the woods in like this weird junk pile.

981
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,500
That's out there.

982
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
Yeah.

983
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
Going like, beef jerky.

984
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Need food.

985
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,500
And then like, doesn't he tear his shirt off in one of them?

986
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,500
He does that all the time.

987
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Yeah, he tears his shirt off.

988
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:47,500
There's a part where he's, he's like running around your house and there's just like a sink full of beef jerky.

989
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,500
And he just like sees it and just starts eating it.

990
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
Like eating out of the trash and shit.

991
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
And then he like suplexes you or something at one point.

992
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,500
Yeah.

993
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,500
And then at the end when he's leaving, he like steals my garbage can because he loves garbage.

994
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,500
Yeah.

995
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,500
And he runs off with it.

996
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:05,500
That's my, that's one of my favorite like skits ever in a video.

997
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,500
It's the whole Manimal.

998
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,500
That's why I was so sad that Manimal's not around anymore.

999
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Yeah.

1000
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,500
So he wanted to do all these skits and to highly polish these Let's Plays.

1001
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,500
And then he also wanted to start his big game analysis thing.

1002
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
But then none of it happened.

1003
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,500
He's like, hey Manimal, you want to come over and record some skits for a video?

1004
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,500
Oh no.

1005
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,500
Okay.

1006
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,500
When he's over, when he's over and recording a Let's Play, hey, we should do a skit for this.

1007
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,500
No, I don't want to.

1008
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Hey Manimal.

1009
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,500
You said you're going to do a Nuzlocke.

1010
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,500
How's that coming?

1011
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,500
Oh, I'm working on it.

1012
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,500
Yeah.

1013
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
So I'm starting to realize, oh, he doesn't have it.

1014
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,500
Yeah.

1015
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
He doesn't have it.

1016
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,500
Without me, Manimal's nothing.

1017
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
He's not going to make anything on his own ever.

1018
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,500
I mean, I could tell that immediately.

1019
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Like I loved him as a skit prop and I thought if he was, if he was serious about like participating,

1020
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,500
he would always have been a good guy to have around.

1021
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,500
Like it's great to have a cool, strong guy.

1022
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,500
To just have one to show off in a video, like a such a great character because as a bunch

1023
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,500
of nerds on the internet, I think we all have a certain reverence for big, cool, strong,

1024
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,500
beefy men, you know?

1025
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,500
Sure.

1026
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,500
And like when we...

1027
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,500
And to have one who's like your...

1028
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Your buddy.

1029
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,500
Your soft-hearted best friend.

1030
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,500
Yeah, exactly.

1031
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,500
Like the idea of having this cool big, which I have a bunch of friends like this.

1032
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,500
Most of my friends are way more jacked than me.

1033
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,500
Hard to believe.

1034
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,500
Hard to believe.

1035
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,500
I love, well, because they're all, I'm not jacked at all, they're all jacked.

1036
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:29,500
But I love the idea of like showing off my strong friend, you know?

1037
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Getting to say like, hey, you guys all think I'm some, I'm some little nerd.

1038
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,500
But look who my friend here, he could kick all your asses, you know?

1039
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,500
I finally understand.

1040
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
Something gratifying about it.

1041
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,500
I finally understand why all women want Chad.

1042
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Yeah.

1043
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Because they want to show off their big manly trophy.

1044
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,500
Exactly.

1045
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
God damn it, we never stood a chance, Reggie.

1046
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,500
Yeah.

1047
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
So, I don't even think...

1048
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
Like Manable doesn't even qualify.

1049
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
Manable looks like a bear game.

1050
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,500
But he brings out my latent homo lust, for sure.

1051
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,500
I just want to be held in those strong arms.

1052
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,500
That protective coat of fur he has.

1053
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500
And I'd sleep in it, you know?

1054
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,500
But yeah, like, I mean, as I was watching those videos, I was always thinking like,

1055
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,500
well, this guy is clearly too normie to be a YouTuber on his own, you know?

1056
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
We did like a handful of skits.

1057
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Cause your comedic chemistry with him is exactly like mine with my friends on Digi and friends.

1058
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,500
If you ever watched any of the non-Victor Digi Bros.

1059
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,500
No, no I haven't.

1060
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,500
Yeah.

1061
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:31,500
There was a series called Digi and Friends, where it would just be me and whatever other friends were around.

1062
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,500
We'd usually release...

1063
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,500
Digi Bros was also two episodes a day for the first year that it was around.

1064
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,500
And it was usually one episode of Digi Bros and one episode of Digi and Friends.

1065
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,500
And yeah, I mean, I carried all the conversations.

1066
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Of course.

1067
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
Of course.

1068
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Like, it's just how it is.

1069
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,500
There was like the meme of Manimals Subway Sandwich, so we did a couple...

1070
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Which was great.

1071
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:58,500
We did a couple jokes of like the Subway Sandwich reveal video, but like those skits were super easy to make, so it was no big deal.

1072
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,500
But otherwise, he just, he didn't really want to do it.

1073
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,500
I really wanted him to join in the Monkey's Anime Reviews lore as a character,

1074
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,500
so he was in the B-movie review, and then he was in the Pokemon review.

1075
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:18,500
And after the Pokemon review, after that day, I'd never heard from him again.

1076
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,500
He recorded his audio, we recorded the skit in the bathtub and everything,

1077
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,500
and then after that day, he never messaged me again or anything.

1078
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,500
He just disappeared, and I was like, oh, what happened?

1079
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Was I mean to him when we were filming this?

1080
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
I don't understand at all.

1081
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:39,500
So then after like three months of no contact, I took his name off the channel.

1082
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,500
So I was like, well, I guess this is the final thing.

1083
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,500
There's no coming back from this.

1084
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,500
He's going to notice that the password has changed and that the name has changed.

1085
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:52,500
And now it's just a Monkey's Gaming Expedition, and I haven't talked to him.

1086
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,500
I don't know what happened.

1087
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
You don't think he's dead, do you?

1088
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,500
No, no, no.

1089
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,500
Because we have mutual friends who he still hangs out with.

1090
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
It was like, is it my fault?

1091
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:07,500
Like, I didn't message him either, but like, surely if he still wanted to be Adam,

1092
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
maybe he's thinking the same thing that I am.

1093
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,500
But I guess neither of us made the effort for whatever reason.

1094
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,500
That's what happens with me and most of my friends.

1095
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,500
At some point, neither one of us has contacted each other, and I keep thinking,

1096
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,500
should I, but surely if he wanted to hang out, he would have contacted me.

1097
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
They're probably thinking the same thing about you.

1098
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
Yeah, but then I'm also like, but that's the thing.

1099
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,500
I'm not contacting them because I don't know what we'd hang out and do.

1100
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
I'm like, well, you know, I don't want to lose this friend,

1101
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,500
but at the same time, what the hell do I have them around for?

1102
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
You know, just to sit around and do nothing.

1103
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,500
And it got to the point where maybe he felt like I was using him in some way

1104
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,500
because the only times we would ever hang out would be to work on videos

1105
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
because that's all I ever want to do.

1106
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,500
Right.

1107
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,500
I think that's why a lot of my friends got married.

1108
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,500
It's just what happens.

1109
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,500
This job gets into your head.

1110
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,500
It like really, I mean, this, what, what, you come over to my house for the weekend.

1111
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
By the way, this is a live podcast.

1112
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,500
If anyone couldn't tell, we're in the same room on the same microphone.

1113
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,500
And we're both naked.

1114
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
Because it's very hot in here.

1115
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,500
And the plan was, monkey was like, I'm coming over to your house for this weekend.

1116
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Let's record a thousand things.

1117
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,500
Yeah, that's all we've been doing.

1118
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,500
That's all we've done.

1119
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,500
And that's all I want to do.

1120
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
That's for me, it's the best possible thing.

1121
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Yeah.

1122
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,500
Like I, like that's, that's why I'm so close with the PCP.

1123
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Like we don't, I think there might be a conception of us doing anything other than the PCP together.

1124
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:36,500
And we don't, we hang out in this chat where we either are, I mean, some, we share our random thoughts and stuff.

1125
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,500
But like, we get into vicious arguments that are hurtful and personal sometimes.

1126
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
Yeah, but like, I love you, Jess.

1127
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:50,500
But like most of the, most of the, um, the times that we talk is all for recordings.

1128
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,500
We don't do calls.

1129
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Random.

1130
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,500
No, I hate calls.

1131
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,500
At the end of every PCP, as soon as I turn off the recording, I exit the call because I don't want to talk.

1132
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,500
I hate it.

1133
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,500
I do too.

1134
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:03,500
The only reason Nate hangs out in there is because he's trying to pressure everybody to get their audio before they leave the call.

1135
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Yeah, that's fair.

1136
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,500
Yeah.

1137
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:16,500
So we don't usually hang out and talk afterwards unless we have like, I don't know, sometimes we do and it can be nice, you know, but like, and sometimes I will orchestrate a podcast just so that we can have a conversation.

1138
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Like there's been plenty of podcasts that were recorded just on the basis of I want to talk to my friends.

1139
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,500
We did one recently that I threw out.

1140
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,500
Yeah.

1141
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
He just thought it didn't come out well.

1142
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
And I, I, I kind of agreed.

1143
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:39,500
And I also, the thing is that the conceit of the podcast was just an excuse to talk with friends, you know, and like when it was just me and you at the beginning, I thought that would have made a good podcast.

1144
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,500
But once everybody else joined in, I was like, well, this is just a conversation.

1145
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Yeah.

1146
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,500
I thought this doesn't really need to be public.

1147
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,500
This is going crazy.

1148
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,500
Yeah.

1149
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,500
Um, but that's, that's a thing that happens with us.

1150
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,500
And I don't necessarily see that as like a huge negative.

1151
00:58:52,500 --> 00:59:01,500
I just really enjoy making stuff and I enjoy having people around who can make stuff with me, which is why I've kind of taken to you so much because you have the same mindset I do.

1152
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:08,500
And you're as prolific as me, which, you know, it's harder for me to work with the other members of the PCP because they're all working on their own stuff.

1153
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:15,500
And they, like if I, if I get Nate to do something else, that's taking away from his videos.

1154
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,500
Yeah, it sounds like he doesn't have a lot of time to do his own stuff as it is.

1155
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:24,500
He's already working a full-time job and he's working on the PCP, which it used to be he edited PCP.

1156
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,500
And the only reason he stopped is because it was taking too much time away from editing his regularly.

1157
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,500
Well, because he would do a lot of editing.

1158
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,500
Autisticly go overboard because he cannot just fucking post a video to the internet.

1159
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:42,500
But, uh, but that's why, that's why as soon as I, like, I feel, I feel like me and you have the same mindset about videos, which is it's more important that it's done than that it's perfect.

1160
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,500
Sure.

1161
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,500
You know, like, you can't watch something if you don't put it up.

1162
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:51,500
Yeah, I don't care much about editing. I don't care much about, like, uh, like making it pretty or, or perfect for everybody.

1163
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,500
Because not every video has to be seen by everyone, you know?

1164
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:59,500
I make lots of stuff that I just post on my subreddit and that's it, you know?

1165
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,500
Um, or on Pornhub.

1166
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Wait, what, what have you posted on Pornhub?

1167
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,500
Well, I, uh, I assisted a friend of mine in making a video.

1168
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,500
Oh, okay, yeah.

1169
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,500
Yeah, I know that Hentai Samurai wasn't you.

1170
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,500
No.

1171
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,500
But you helped him out.

1172
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,500
Yeah.

1173
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:22,500
He's, he's currently, he's not around today because he, he's, uh, he's taking a sabbatical to the porn store.

1174
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:27,500
He's taking a, he's a, he's a, uh, he's an assistant manager at Got It Video.

1175
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,500
Wait, it doesn't sabbatical mean he's not working?

1176
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:35,500
For Hentai Samurai, it's a sabbatical from porn, from jacking up.

1177
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
He takes a vacation to go work at another job.

1178
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:42,500
Basically, he, he goes to work at a porn store to, because as a samurai, he has to-

1179
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Samurai!

1180
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,500
Yeah.

1181
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
As a samurai, he has to have a certain level of like countenance.

1182
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,500
Like he has to be, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?

1183
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Like Bushido?

1184
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,500
Like that Bushido code of like, uh, temperance or whatever?

1185
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,500
Of jerking off?

1186
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:58,500
Well, basically he's trying to not jerk off and by going to work for eight hours a day

1187
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:03,500
and, but being surrounded by porn, it helps him to build up his, uh, you know-

1188
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,500
His chakras.

1189
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,500
Yeah.

1190
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,500
He ends around at work all day, like fuming, like...

1191
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:13,500
I would imagine that 3D porn would disgust him and he only wants to see Hentai.

1192
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,500
Uh, Hentai Samurai is, he's, he loves all porn.

1193
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,500
He's a, he's a connoisseur of all times.

1194
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,500
He celebrates it.

1195
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500
He celebrates it.

1196
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:27,500
Anyway, I think the point we're trying to make is that these friends of ours feel like they're being used,

1197
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,500
whereas in my mind it's, I think we have a fun chemistry, a good friendship,

1198
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,500
and I want to share that with the whole world.

1199
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,500
Yeah.

1200
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,500
And he might feel like, oh, he's just using me to have a co-host on his-

1201
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,500
Let's, let's play.

1202
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,500
What's so difficult about it is that, like, I, the reason I had all my friends on there is

1203
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,500
because I think they're cool people.

1204
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,500
Yeah.

1205
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,500
You know, I like all these guys.

1206
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,500
So it's especially painful when they no longer want to do it or be friends with you.

1207
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,500
Yeah.

1208
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,500
Like, these are all people I wanted to show off.

1209
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,500
My only crime was that I love you.

1210
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,500
Yeah.

1211
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,500
If you listen to all my videos, you will probably have heard me talking about how much I love

1212
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,500
these people a lot.

1213
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,500
Like, I always am bragging about them because I think they're cool.

1214
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:07,500
Or if you listen to all the old music I used to force them to do, because that's, that was

1215
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,500
also a thing.

1216
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:13,500
I used to have all my friends were musicians, but none of them were, like, willing to actually

1217
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,500
make music.

1218
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,500
So I would just force them all into a room and have them, like, bullshit improv stuff,

1219
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,500
and then I would upload it.

1220
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,500
None of them wanted anything to do with it.

1221
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,500
But, but I love it, you know, and I still listen to all that stuff.

1222
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,500
They probably don't even remember half of it.

1223
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,500
So anyway.

1224
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
So, yeah.

1225
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,500
So you've gotten to that.

1226
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,100
You are now in the same position I am, falling out with all your friends, trying to get the

1227
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,500
hell out of your hometown.

1228
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,500
Yeah.

1229
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,500
You're moving the hell out.

1230
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,500
Yeah.

1231
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
By the time this is up, I'll probably be moved out.

1232
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,500
Oh, I don't know.

1233
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,500
This could come out tomorrow.

1234
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,500
Yeah.

1235
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,500
Well, I'm moving at the end of March.

1236
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,500
Okay.

1237
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,500
Yeah.

1238
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,100
So you're currently visiting North Carolina.

1239
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,000
I don't think it's any secret that your girlfriend is sheep over.

1240
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
No.

1241
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Not at this point.

1242
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
She's sheep over who you, how did you two meet?

1243
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I think the first time we talked was on Snapchat.

1244
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
She sent me a snap and I thought she looked like Murph from Interstellar.

1245
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Interstellar?

1246
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I was like, oh shit, dude, it's Murph.

1247
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Man, she's like this.

1248
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
She's two of the top ten waifus of all time, dude.

1249
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yeah, she is.

1250
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I got to get in with Murph.

1251
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And the rest is history.

1252
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So yeah, you've always had a very public Snapchat, which I thought that was another

1253
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
thing that interested me right from the beginning was your willingness to not just have fan

1254
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
interactions, but to let them get closer to you than I think most people would.

1255
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Like Snapchat, I was always afraid to have a public Snapchat because I'm like, I'm going

1256
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
to get dick pics.

1257
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I do every day.

1258
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Do you really?

1259
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Of course.

1260
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I've never gotten one.

1261
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I have a public Snapchat now.

1262
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I've never gotten a dick pic.

1263
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I think your fans respect you.

1264
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Well, that was the saddest thing that ever happened, in my opinion, was you opened a

1265
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
P.O. box.

1266
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I know where this is going.

1267
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Well, that monkey opened a P.O. box, which I've been meaning to do for a long time, but

1268
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I just, I guess I had assumed it was too expensive or too much of a pain in the ass.

1269
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
How much did you end up paying for it?

1270
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
60 bucks, I think, for six months.

1271
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I did like 100 for a full year.

1272
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Yeah, so you opened a P.O. box and when you did that, I was like, well, shit, if monkey

1273
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
is doing it, I want to do it.

1274
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I'm even bigger than him, I'll probably get even more shit.

1275
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And you sure did.

1276
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah, but the funny part is, because what you got was a bunch of dildos and sex toys, I'm

1277
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
expecting that.

1278
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And it never happened.

1279
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Seven months of having a P.O. box, never once did I get any sex stuff or anything weird,

1280
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
all just love letters.

1281
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
You get gifts and posters.

1282
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:54,000
There's unbelievably long fucking soliloquies about how my content changed someone's life

1283
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
and Bubki gets boy pussy aroma handles.

1284
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And you'll be putting up a new mailbag once a week and it's like an hour long with just

1285
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
a constant stream of gifts.

1286
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I struggled to make an eight minute episode with three packages, all of which are just

1287
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
fuck you gifts.

1288
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And I wanted to bring that up because I think there's a perception of you that because you

1289
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
embrace that, that that's what you want more of, but I don't think that's necessarily the

1290
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
case.

1291
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
That's a fear that by laughing at it and propping it up, it seems like I'm encouraging it.

1292
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Well, that's what I think when Jesse says that he has a different mindset about the

1293
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
interactions.

1294
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I think it's because he thinks you want just that, but you don't.

1295
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's just that's all you're getting.

1296
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
If it was just that, I mean, I'm not going to complain.

1297
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I still think it's funny because in my view, the Internet should be the wild, wild West.

1298
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And I think everybody on the Internet should be an asshole all the time, which I know you

1299
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
all very much disagree with, especially Jess.

1300
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But I mean, the Internet in my mind, ever since the beginning of me going on the Internet,

1301
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
it's been like going on 4chan, going on these cesspools of hatred.

1302
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And that's what I love.

1303
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And I think that's what the Internet should be about.

1304
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You could be nice to each other in person.

1305
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
That's the human interaction.

1306
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
The problem with it is that the Internet is real now.

1307
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And I think that the people who have the mindset like what you have, there's a lot of people

1308
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
who don't recognize or won't admit that it's no longer the same people.

1309
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
There was a time when the Internet was like a closed off place that was just for freaks

1310
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
and weirdos.

1311
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
It was like, if you can't make it in normal society, here's a place for you.

1312
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
But now everyone's on the Internet.

1313
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And it's like, now if we're just assholes to each other, then it's no different from

1314
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
doing it in real life.

1315
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And it's like, especially for those of us who don't have anywhere else to go in real life,

1316
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
it's like, I don't want to go to the place where everyone's an asshole.

1317
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I want to give me the hug box.

1318
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I need something on here.

1319
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Somewhere I can get my hugs.

1320
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
So I have to assume some people, the appeal of monkey is that it's a corner of the Internet

1321
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
where almost anything goes, like anything that YouTube won't ban before.

1322
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I'll make a video of me saying the word nigger in a rap song.

1323
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I mean, you do that all the time, obviously, but that's just one example.

1324
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I'll make a video about 9-11 and the Jews and all this stuff because it's the Internet.

1325
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I don't care.

1326
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Anything should go.

1327
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And I want to be the shining example of, oh yeah, on the Internet, anything is possible.

1328
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
But it seems like you're saying that's dying and now it's becoming a norm.

1329
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I think you can keep it alive in that corner.

1330
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Which is my goal.

1331
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
The problem is that we brought you into the PCP and brought your fan base to ours.

1332
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
That's your problem.

1333
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
We mixed them in an unfortunate way.

1334
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
So now your fans are coming to our channels just to get banned.

1335
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I mean, once you ban them, what's the problem after that?

1336
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Well, the problem is there's a thousand avenues on the Internet.

1337
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
But anyways, I understand the desire to keep that alive.

1338
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And that's kind of why I still go on 4chan for the same reason.

1339
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I like that the Internet can be a place that normal stuff can happen.

1340
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And my channel, obviously, I try to preserve meaningful conversation and stuff.

1341
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
But I don't always want that.

1342
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Sometimes I just want to go to 4chan and see the assholes be assholes to each other.

1343
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
So I totally understand the idea of having it alive.

1344
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But would you not say that if fans sent you genuine stuff, you would also be happy with that?

1345
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh, yeah.

1346
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I mean, let's not say that everything I've gotten is bad.

1347
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I've gotten some good things.

1348
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I think there's been a couple of times where I didn't show it in the video,

1349
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,000
but a letter, I actually teared up because it was just so nice.

1350
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I think that because of the monkey persona,

1351
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,000
there's a lot of people who assume that you would rather get negative comments

1352
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and people shitting on you when this is not really the case.

1353
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It depends on the type of video.

1354
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
If the Elliot Rodger review, I would like a serious discussion there.

1355
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It's a serious video.

1356
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
But all these fucking videos about yelling about Jews and stuff,

1357
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
just shit up the comments.

1358
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Let the comments reflect the video.

1359
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I think that's fair.

1360
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Do you think some of your audience has a difficult time discerning

1361
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
between when they should be serious or not?

1362
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Probably.

1363
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I mean, I don't care.

1364
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
As long as their mean comments are funny, even if they're genuine,

1365
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
if they're funny, then I still love them because it makes me laugh.

1366
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Funny is always the problem.

1367
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I think the biggest problem with commenters is that so many of them aren't funny

1368
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and think they are.

1369
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
That's by far my biggest.

1370
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I don't even mind.

1371
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I've gotten comments that shit on me that were legitimately funny

1372
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
that I will upvote.

1373
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
It's not every day.

1374
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
If you leave a comment that's just like, fuck you, then I'm like, well,

1375
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I think that's funny because the lack of effort is funny on its own.

1376
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It can be.

1377
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
But if it's just like someone, because I usually am like, I know why.

1378
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's just some snob fan or something to say fuck you.

1379
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I'm just like, yeah, you're banned.

1380
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Do you ever get comments where it just says OK and nothing more?

1381
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Those do make me laugh.

1382
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It's like, why did you post this?

1383
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I actually do think those were funny.

1384
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
What the fuck is this in reference to?

1385
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I always get so confused.

1386
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I don't know what to do about it.

1387
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I'm like, is this a shit post?

1388
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
What is this?

1389
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I love those.

1390
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Yeah.

1391
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
That's the thing.

1392
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Fuck you is too unambiguous.

1393
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
If you're so confounding, like I've had some where they're shitting on me,

1394
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
but they're just like so incompetent at English that I leave it up

1395
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
because I feel like they've defeated themselves.

1396
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Oh, yeah.

1397
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It can be a lot of fun.

1398
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
If you're still listening, just comment OK on this episode.

1399
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Someone probably already did.

1400
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Before they even got to this point, it's just that guy who does it.

1401
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It probably says OK and then edit dot, dot, dot, shit.

1402
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Now they're going to do that on purpose.

1403
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
You fucked it all up.

1404
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Maybe they'll take it another step farther from where we've thought.

1405
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Yeah, let's not give them any more freebies.

1406
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:22,000
So you are planning to either before this comes out or right afterwards

1407
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
to end Mumki's anime review.

1408
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Come and do an end, baby.

1409
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I'll finally be free.

1410
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Yeah.

1411
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Episode 50.

1412
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I thought I'd go to 100, but I think I've exercised the lore enough.

1413
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Mumki can only go through this cycle of knowing that it's all conspiracy

1414
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
and then thinking it's real and back and forth.

1415
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
It's already gotten to a point of saturation.

1416
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Yeah.

1417
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I'm like, OK, well, this needs to end.

1418
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I can't stretch this out forever.

1419
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Let's end it once and for all.

1420
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I'll keep making the exact same style of video,

1421
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
but we just won't call it Mumki's anime reviews.

1422
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
And it won't have the narrative with Uncle Alex and Jumki and all that.

1423
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Yeah, I know.

1424
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
All that's going to get retired.

1425
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I'll keep Jumki and Alexa as characters,

1426
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
but it'll be a different canon, maybe.

1427
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
So, oh, God, I got a burp coming in.

1428
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
There we go.

1429
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Where are you going to go after this, after it's all over?

1430
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Do you think you'll ever construct another narrative

1431
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
or do you think you're done with that whole aspect of it?

1432
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I think it was a fun little experiment.

1433
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And a lot of people seem to really like it.

1434
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
But if I don't have a good idea for it, I don't want to do it.

1435
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
So I'm not going to try to force it.

1436
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
That's why I've never done one.

1437
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
The pitfalls that people fall into,

1438
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
people think, oh, I have to do a narrative.

1439
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
The Jon Tron has a narrative sometimes and all this shit.

1440
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
So I have to force it in.

1441
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
And then that's when they're bad, is when you try to force it.

1442
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It has to come naturally with me or with Jess when he does it.

1443
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
With Jesse, he can't help it.

1444
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
It's like it's a destructive force in his life

1445
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
that he can't help but tie narratives into his videos.

1446
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And it's hurt his chances of success on YouTube, unfortunately.

1447
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
It's like the same thing with the triflers,

1448
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
which I'm sure we'll talk about later

1449
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
because we have another three hours of this to go.

1450
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
But people keep saying, oh, you got to write a sequel to the triflers.

1451
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I'm thinking, I'd love to.

1452
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
But if I don't have the good idea, I'm not going to write something that's shit.

1453
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I mean, maybe you'll have a good idea in 10 years or something.

1454
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Yeah, maybe.

1455
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Who knows?

1456
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah, and why does everyone...

1457
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
People are demanding this of you, not thinking about the fact

1458
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
that it's not like triflers is a New York Times bestseller

1459
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
and that wasting two years writing a sequel is going to be a huge payoff.

1460
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Yeah, they don't seem to understand that writing a book is a huge process.

1461
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
They think, as far as I know, I wrote the triflers in an afternoon.

1462
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And I didn't edit it once.

1463
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
That's just how they think it just came to be.

1464
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
They think, just do it again over the weekend.

1465
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Now, if I'm not mistaken, the triflers was completed before Monkey's Anime Review started.

1466
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

1467
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
So give me the timetable.

1468
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I have to go to the bathroom, but you can talk about the timetable of how the triflers came to be.

1469
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Okay.

1470
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:13,000
The initial idea for it of this group of kids in a basement who watched horrible videos,

1471
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
it came to me, I think, my senior year of high school.

1472
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And I kind of played around with it for a bit.

1473
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And then my freshman year of college, I completed another book I was working on,

1474
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
which I have not released or anything.

1475
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I think the only person who's read it other than my grandma and mom are sheep over and Tom Oliver.

1476
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
So then after I finished that book, I said, okay, let's see what we got with this triflers thing.

1477
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
So I worked on that.

1478
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
It took about a year and a half, maybe two years.

1479
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I think I finished it my junior year of college.

1480
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And then that's about when I started the Let's Plays, I think.

1481
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I think that timetable makes sense.

1482
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Maybe it was a little bit before.

1483
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
But yeah, then I started doing Monkey.

1484
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I forget about the book for about a year.

1485
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I do Monkey for about a full year.

1486
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And then as I go, hey, maybe I could polish up this book and people will buy it.

1487
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Because there are a few anime reviews where I just took straight pages from the triflers and that's the whole review.

1488
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
The Traps review is straight from the book.

1489
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
The Depression review is straight from the book.

1490
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And people like those videos.

1491
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
So I thought, well, maybe they'll like this book.

1492
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And they did.

1493
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
They overwhelmingly did.

1494
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
So it all worked out.

1495
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Have you had any particularly negative reviews of the triflers?

1496
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
No.

1497
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
No, I'm astonished by it.

1498
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Not one person said this book was not good.

1499
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Nobody's given it lower than like a four out of five.

1500
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Which I have to assume if they bought it in the first place, they were already interested and they were already a fan.

1501
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
So I don't know.

1502
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I mean, I was just like, to me, the fact that the book even has like competent pros is enough for it to be like, oh, this is a 10 out of 10.

1503
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Like, you know, most of the stuff I get sent by people who are like on the internet who are like, yeah, I'm writing a book.

1504
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And then they send it to me.

1505
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And within two sentences, I'm sick of it.

1506
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
You know, like most people just.

1507
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Writing is hard.

1508
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Yeah.

1509
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
It's hard.

1510
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
But if a lot of people just think they can't do it, like they just can't do it.

1511
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Right.

1512
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And like most of the problems I have with your book were more like, like, like high level problems.

1513
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Like it's like, like small structural things and nitpicks.

1514
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And like maybe this word would have been better in this sentence.

1515
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
You are sweating up a storm.

1516
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I'm noticing.

1517
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
You mean?

1518
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Yeah, you look like you're sweating up a storm.

1519
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
It's hot in here.

1520
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yeah.

1521
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
It's a little, it's a little, a little warm.

1522
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I get heated when I think about books.

1523
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Yeah.

1524
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Very passionate.

1525
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I guess so.

1526
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I didn't notice until just now.

1527
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I guess the sun got brighter.

1528
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah.

1529
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I want to close that goddamn curtain.

1530
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I can do that.

1531
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I don't know if that'll make it cooler in here, but fuck the sun.

1532
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So, so yeah.

1533
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So you, you finally put out this book.

1534
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
So your other one, which is a little shorter.

1535
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Yeah.

1536
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
You, you're thinking, still not thinking about releasing?

1537
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Maybe.

1538
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I think there are some major things I need to change about it.

1539
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
If you thought that there was too much sexual stuff with, with minors and the triflers.

1540
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Boy, howdy.

1541
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
This book's going to get me arrested for sure.

1542
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
So I think I need to achieve over, you know what I'm talking about.

1543
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yeah.

1544
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I don't think anybody, Tom, I asked Tom about the specific chapters and chapter five, just

1545
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
the most gruesome thing I've ever written in my life.

1546
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
And I asked him what he thought of it.

1547
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And he's like, Oh, well, I mean, I'm so used to this kind of stuff.

1548
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Thanks to the internet.

1549
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
That didn't really bother me, but everybody else was like traumatized.

1550
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
My mom, grandma, and sheep over.

1551
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
That's the thing.

1552
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
They're, I mean, if you, if you're, your stuff is like for internet people, I think, like

1553
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,000
this is when I read the triflers, my impression of it was like, this is the most millennial

1554
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
book ever written.

1555
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Whoa, wait, it's a bad thing.

1556
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
No, I'm a millennial.

1557
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I understand it.

1558
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I wanted to give you this quote.

1559
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Keep forgetting to mention this to you, but a few years back, back when I was, I guess

1560
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
probably five or six years ago, when I was trying to become a writer before this whole

1561
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
YouTube thing.

1562
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I'm a writer.

1563
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I'm a writer.

1564
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I've been saying that a lot lately and completely meaning it.

1565
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:26,000
But when I was trying to be a writer as opposed to a YouTuber, there was a party going on at

1566
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
my house with my parents, all their friends and stuff.

1567
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And one of my mom or dad's friends who works with them was like sloshed.

1568
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:39,000
She's probably late 30s, early 40s, got kids who were in high school kind of thing.

1569
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,000
And she was like drunkenly telling me that what, what she wants, like what I should write

1570
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
about is like all the illicit stuff that, that high school kids are getting up to like,

1571
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
hey, all the young kids, like tell me about like all the, all the, the drugs and sex life.

1572
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And I was like, I was never, I wasn't a part of any of that.

1573
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Like why would I know this story?

1574
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Like I only am good at writing what I know, which is about being.

1575
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
You should only write what you know.

1576
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Right.

1577
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Well, the way I saw it, I was like, what the kids are up to these days is not all that

1578
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
stuff.

1579
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
They're up to being isolated in their rooms at computers.

1580
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
But then when I read the triflers, I was like, this is exactly what that woman wanted.

1581
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,000
This is exactly what she wanted is the seedy, fucked up shit that young people are getting

1582
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
up to in high school.

1583
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
You know, I mean, granted that probably went a little further than she could have handled

1584
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
a lot further.

1585
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I imagine.

1586
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yeah.

1587
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
But, but I was like, this is exactly that.

1588
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And so I do think it touched on something that a lot of people want, which is, you know,

1589
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
to, because, because it feels real, like everything in the triflers, aside from the fact that Don

1590
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:49,000
is like a legitimate, like high level, like light Yagami, you know, like schemer.

1591
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
How'd you know my inspiration?

1592
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Aside from that, like everything in it felt like, yeah, this is the kids I knew in high

1593
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
school.

1594
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Like this is the kind of shit they, the edgy shit they would have got up to, you know,

1595
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
sitting around a basement watching live leak videos and stuff.

1596
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
You did have a friend who planned a school shooting.

1597
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Good old Phillip.

1598
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yeah.

1599
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Good old Phillip Bay was going to do it.

1600
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Not just playing.

1601
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
He had the weapons and everything.

1602
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
He was ready.

1603
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
He's a regular Mario Quintanilla.

1604
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I think he was busted because he had posted stuff online and people found it.

1605
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
He pulled an Elliot Roger.

1606
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Yeah.

1607
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
But except he actually got caught unlike Elliot.

1608
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I don't, I think he was before, yeah, he was before Elliot.

1609
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
His attempt.

1610
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
He was, he was post Virginia Tech.

1611
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I think that was more his inspiration.

1612
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I could have done a whole 30 minute review of your friend, Phillip, if only he would

1613
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
have gotten away with it.

1614
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Yeah.

1615
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
All right.

1616
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Well, so do you have plans to write another book anytime soon?

1617
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Do you think that'll happen?

1618
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Do you have any ideas for books popping around?

1619
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I've been thinking very hard about how I would approach a Triforce sequel.

1620
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:03,000
And I have like vague impressions of what it would be and things that would happen.

1621
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
But.

1622
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Detective novel starring Mason.

1623
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
That'd be, that'd be a little bit of it.

1624
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yeah.

1625
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
But like I said, unless I get like a really good idea, I'm not going to even attempt it.

1626
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
And I, writing a book is hard and it takes a lot of time and I just don't feel like it right now.

1627
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Like I just got off the high of this one being released.

1628
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Yeah.

1629
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,000
If anything, I would polish up and release the one that I wrote before the Triforce.

1630
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Well, I'm really curious about where, where your heart sort of resides in regards to content

1631
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
right now because you've mentioned that YouTube has become a little bit too formulaic

1632
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
and you're kind of sick of it in a way.

1633
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I think I was just getting sick of the anime reviews videos.

1634
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Yeah.

1635
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Because I have, as soon as this ends, I have like three new series in my mind that I really,

1636
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I'm really excited to do them.

1637
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Okay.

1638
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,000
One of which is, I think what I'm calling it is the tenisms where I take ten words that

1639
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
end in ism and I just dissect them and I go through them for like 10 to 15 minutes.

1640
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
So things like communism, autism, atheism, et cetera.

1641
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
So I'm really excited about that.

1642
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:15,000
It's like the same style as the anime reviews without the old joke that atheism is a Japanese

1643
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
anime.

1644
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Yeah.

1645
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
We get it, monkey.

1646
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You've done it 50 times.

1647
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Let's move on.

1648
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
So you've got, you've got some, some more YouTube stuff planned.

1649
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Yeah.

1650
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Lots more Let's Place planned.

1651
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Once I move in with Sheep and I, I hopefully.

1652
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Is Sheep going to become a co-host?

1653
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
No.

1654
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
No.

1655
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I hope not.

1656
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I don't think either one of us want that, but hopefully I'll be able to film more often

1657
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
because I've been having a lot of trouble filming in my current apartment.

1658
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Once I have more time, I want to, I bought Mario Maker for the 3DS.

1659
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I want to play the fuck out of that because I think it's fun as shit and some other things.

1660
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So.

1661
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Leaving aside the, the anime reviews, you do plan to continue the monkey character.

1662
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Yeah.

1663
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
But, but without the surrounding narrative.

1664
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So will he still be making reference to being molested or anything?

1665
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Or is it just like a screaming monkey?

1666
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I'm putting Uncle Alex to bed.

1667
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
We've had enough.

1668
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
So.

1669
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It's only so far you can go with that joke.

1670
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Yeah.

1671
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But you're still going to be like a, like a, like a gravelly voiced monkey man.

1672
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I'm still, I'm still going to be myself.

1673
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
And the mask is staying on.

1674
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Uh, yeah.

1675
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Yeah.

1676
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Yeah.

1677
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
We'll see how often I do live action.

1678
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Right.

1679
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Cause that's always, it's, it's hit or miss and it's also a lot of effort.

1680
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Do you think there's a chance that the mask is going to come off at some point just be,

1681
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
just to be able to, she's giving me a look like, yeah, it's happening.

1682
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Like there's no way he's keeping this up forever.

1683
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I think if, if I get more handsome.

1684
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Cause I figured the same thing, the fact that you're not bad looking at all.

1685
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
No.

1686
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
You, I.

1687
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I hate it.

1688
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,000
When I said, I asked the monkey, like, uh, like why he wears the mask or he, he said,

1689
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
he was telling me that he was trying to become a teacher.

1690
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
And I said, is that why you wear the mask?

1691
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And he said, no, horrible acne scarring.

1692
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So I expected you to be like legitimately ugly.

1693
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And look, look, monkey, I'll tell you right now.

1694
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I, I cannot look ugly people's directly in the face.

1695
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm not joking about that.

1696
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
If you, is that why you look away when Ben comes in the room?

1697
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Shit.

1698
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
That's not true.

1699
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
But we're learning.

1700
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:30,000
But when, when, uh, if I thought, if I didn't think that you had a face that I could look

1701
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
at, I wouldn't, I would be looking off into the distance the whole time we were talking.

1702
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I guarantee it.

1703
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So, um, I'm, I'm, I'm not, I'm not even kidding about that.

1704
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I'm a terrible person.

1705
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Let me tell you this, Digi.

1706
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,000
The day I, cause I'm only here visiting sheep for 10 days and then I'm going home for a week

1707
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
and then I'm moving on into North Carolina.

1708
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:55,000
For the day I get back, big brother, the TV show is doing a casting call in my city,

1709
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,000
like, like a few blocks from my house and I'm going to go fucking apply.

1710
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
And if I get on big brother, like this is all out.

1711
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
My, my face is going to be out there.

1712
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
My everything about me will be out there.

1713
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And my life will probably be ruined because after, you know, you get exposed as

1714
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
mumke on national television.

1715
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I don't think you get a job after that.

1716
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
No, but I want to be on big brother so bad that I'll throw away any semblance of a future

1717
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
at that chance for $500,000 and then after taxes, like $8.

1718
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I mean, I've, I, I don't know if you feel similarly to me at all because like you,

1719
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:38,000
you're just now sort of taking the internet personality thing more as like a career.

1720
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
And even then you're planning to get a normal job when you move to North Carolina.

1721
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Yeah, I fucking hope I do.

1722
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Yeah.

1723
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Cause like for me, the second I started making money off of YouTube, the prospect of ever doing

1724
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
a normal job again was just gone.

1725
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Like I never thought about it and never looked back.

1726
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Like the only reason I never get a new normal job is if like for some reason I couldn't

1727
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
do the internet at all.

1728
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Like, but I don't feel like that'll ever happen.

1729
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Like why, what would ever stop me, you know?

1730
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:11,000
So like for me, it was like, well, you know, it doesn't matter what I say online now

1731
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
because this is who I am now.

1732
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And then like, that's why I'm so willing to go around saying nigger on podcasts and writing

1733
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
songs about it.

1734
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
It's just like, this is, this is who I am now and fuck the old, the old me.

1735
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
So do you think you'll ever reach a point like that where it'll just be like, I'm not

1736
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
worried about preserving my ability to have a normal life?

1737
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Well, I think if I was that serious about that worry, then I wouldn't do the kinds of

1738
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
videos that I make.

1739
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I make things that are highly offensive in this SJW culture.

1740
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I mean, I guess if Donald Trump could become president after what he said, maybe I do stand

1741
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
a chance.

1742
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Yeah, but

1743
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You just gotta go to the right places.

1744
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Don't move to California.

1745
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
No.

1746
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Stay in the deep South where just find, find an establishment who unironically agrees

1747
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
with the things you've said in your videos that you're set, you know?

1748
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
The fear of the job, Lynch mob is very real.

1749
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
But ultimately, I mean, I feel like I'm at the point of no return already.

1750
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Like I've crossed it.

1751
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
So if it's going to happen, it's going to happen.

1752
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Like I've already put these videos out and they're on the internet forever.

1753
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Once you put it up once, but the prospect of doing this just as a job and do nothing

1754
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
else like you do, it's such a new type of job.

1755
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And it hasn't been around long enough to know if it's sustainable.

1756
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Five years from now, maybe Digi Bro isn't making any money anymore.

1757
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Or maybe you're making 20 grand a month.

1758
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
We have no way of knowing.

1759
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,000
That's the scariest thing about it is there's no benefits and there's no insurance.

1760
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
There's no boss.

1761
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Like you work for YouTube who's only out to fuck you.

1762
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
True.

1763
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Like they say they want to help you, but they fuck you at every turn.

1764
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yep.

1765
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And you're really relying on like, like if I didn't have Patreon, I would be fucked.

1766
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Right.

1767
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Like there's a lot of YouTubers who do just rely on ad revenue and sponsorships.

1768
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I really wonder how Jon Tron's going to survive his controversy.

1769
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Digi he'll be fine.

1770
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I'm sure he'll be fine.

1771
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
But like just like he makes so much like, I mean he'd have to, if he lost all his sponsorships

1772
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
for the things he says, he'd have to scale back his production, I'd assume.

1773
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
You know?

1774
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
That would help his videos a lot.

1775
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
It would.

1776
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
He should do that.

1777
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
But if Jon Tron makes a Patreon, he's making five grand a month minimum.

1778
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
That's probably true.

1779
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
So I think he's fine.

1780
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Yeah.

1781
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But that's the thing.

1782
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Like it's an interesting culture because we don't know if Patreon's going to start cannibalizing

1783
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
itself in the future.

1784
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Like that's always been a concern for me is the more people find out about it, the more

1785
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
spread thin the money gets, you know?

1786
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
There's going to get to a point where people, like that was a big concern of all of us when

1787
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
we made the PCP Patreon.

1788
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Oh yeah.

1789
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Are people going to unpatron one of us to patron the group?

1790
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Which I think did happen.

1791
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Probably a couple people.

1792
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Some people, like, lowered theirs from five to one so that they could throw in a buck

1793
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
to the PCP.

1794
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Yeah.

1795
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Which is, like, I mean, that kind of fucks us over in a way.

1796
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Yeah.

1797
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Because, like-

1798
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Definitely does.

1799
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Because we're all splitting the money anyway.

1800
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
So like now instead of Digi getting that two bucks, now he's getting like 20 cents.

1801
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Yeah, a problem.

1802
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:25,000
So, like, do you really, do you really like Ben St. that much that you want to take away

1803
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
$1.80 from Digi so that Ben can get, like, a 20-cent share?

1804
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Like, fuck Ben.

1805
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Just give the money to us directly.

1806
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Don't, I don't know.

1807
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
But I shouldn't say don't do the PCP Patreon because I get, like, what, 20 bucks a video

1808
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
off of it?

1809
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
That's kind of good.

1810
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Yeah.

1811
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I mean, the way I see it though, and this is why I think you would be able to do it,

1812
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
like you would be able to make a career out of this, is again because you're so prolific.

1813
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Because if you are constantly putting shit out, I see it as you've got a dart board and

1814
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
you're just, like, throwing dart after dart.

1815
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Like, if you spend all your time and money trying to craft the perfect dart before you

1816
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
throw it and then you miss, you've wasted a lot of time.

1817
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Yeah.

1818
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
You know?

1819
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
But if you've got, like, 100 cheap darts, all that matters is that it hits the bullseye.

1820
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
You know?

1821
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It doesn't matter what the dart looks like.

1822
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
If it hits the bullseye, you hit the bullseye and you make all the money, you know?

1823
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,000
So, like, I think the fact that, you know, you could just be putting out, like, a bunch

1824
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
of podcasts, a bunch of Let's Plays, a bunch of other shit, you know?

1825
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
And, like, something's got to hit eventually, you know?

1826
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:38,000
So, like, for me, you know, if for some reason I can't do anime anymore because they keep

1827
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
fucking hitting me with copyright strikes every other day.

1828
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
They're going to keep doing anything.

1829
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Like, if I decided, like, hey, the problem here is anime.

1830
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Let's just cut anime and go to another thing.

1831
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You think you could do that?

1832
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I think I could do that easily.

1833
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I mean, I cut pony and went to anime and became twice as successful.

1834
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Go back to pony.

1835
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Three times as successful.

1836
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
They need a new messiah over there.

1837
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
The bronies are struggling.

1838
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
The bronies are dead.

1839
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
There's no going back there.

1840
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
They're gone.

1841
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
MLP probably gets, like, what, 200 posts a day on the 4chan board?

1842
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
It's the worst board on the whole website.

1843
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I hope you know that.

1844
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I wouldn't know.

1845
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
They're the worst board on 4chan.

1846
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
It should have been what everyone thought it was going to be, which is that everyone,

1847
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
a repeat of the furry board.

1848
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
You know about the furry board?

1849
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
No, no.

1850
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Like, 10 years ago, maybe more, 4chan made a furry board, a containment board for the

1851
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,000
furry, and then they left it up for one week and then anybody who posted there all got

1852
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
banned.

1853
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
It was a carpet ban.

1854
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
It was all a trap.

1855
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Genius.

1856
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Even if you go there and troll them, just get fucked.

1857
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
That's what MLP should have been.

1858
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
They all deserve it.

1859
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
That's crazy.

1860
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Yeah, and that's what people thought it was when it first came out.

1861
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:00,000
But yeah, I think that you could, because you're so prolific, you could eventually,

1862
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
and that there's people who, you have a base now.

1863
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Like, all you need is a base.

1864
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Even if you only have 100 people, if they will continue to post your shit everywhere

1865
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
and follow you whatever you do and stuff, then there's always somewhere to go.

1866
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I think that the hardest part of being a creator on the internet is just establishing

1867
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
enough of a base that cares deeply enough to follow you to the next thing,

1868
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,000
which is kind of what fucked over Tom, that he had a little bit of a base,

1869
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
but he had already kind of lost most of his followers from Brony Curious by the time he

1870
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
made Rebel Pixels.

1871
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And then Rebel Pixels was like such a different thing.

1872
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I still don't even know what that channel is.

1873
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I looked at the videos and he was just talking about his computer.

1874
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
What is this shit?

1875
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:49,000
The idea of it is that it's supposed to be helping creators on the web.

1876
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
It's supposed to be a guidebook for internet creators kind of thing.

1877
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,000
So half of the videos are motivational speeches, and the other half are hardware reviews.

1878
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,000
But because he mostly got successful through reviewing tablets,

1879
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
then he just kept doing tablet reviews, and so it kind of became very focused on that.

1880
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
But it was just that the subject matter was so different,

1881
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
and his base was already so broken after his original channel,

1882
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
that it took a long time for Rebel Pixels to even pick up the steam that it has,

1883
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
which is over 10,000 subs, so it's not that bad.

1884
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Whereas for me, I went from ponies directly into anime.

1885
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
So anybody, which was probably out of my 70,000 subscribers,

1886
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,000
there was maybe 4,000 who cared enough to watch the anime videos.

1887
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And it was good and bad.

1888
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
It's like, oh yay, but really?

1889
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I went from averaging 40,000 to 70,000 views of video to averaging 2,000 to 5,000 views of video.

1890
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
But that's the thing.

1891
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
That base was there, and they were still sharing the videos,

1892
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
and they were still watching it just because they liked me,

1893
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
or they just happened to also be into anime,

1894
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
and eventually it grew out of that and blew up again.

1895
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
So that's why I think as long as you have that core audience

1896
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
who cares enough to follow you to the next thing,

1897
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
you've always got a second chance if you can capitalize on it.

1898
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,000
It makes me think of the tragedy of Ben, Nate, and Hippo,

1899
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
because I was shocked to learn that they had old pony channels

1900
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
that had like three times as many views as the ones they have now.

1901
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,000
And when they started over, like fucking Gibbente has what, 15,000 subs,

1902
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
and then poor Hippo is at like eight.

1903
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Well, part of the problem there, especially in Nate and Ben's case,

1904
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
was that they deliberately hid it from their old subscribers.

1905
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Why?

1906
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Because Nate didn't want to have the baggage of the MLP community,

1907
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
which in fairness-

1908
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
They're just people!

1909
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
In fairness, if you knew these people.

1910
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
It's a human being, they can like two things.

1911
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Right, but he was scared that his audience would end up just being those people

1912
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
and that a new one wouldn't form around here, whatever.

1913
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And so he never, like on the T-Bap channel,

1914
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
that channel was dead for like a solid year

1915
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:09,000
before Ben finally put up a video telling everyone what they had done,

1916
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
which incidentally, that video is how he met his girlfriend.

1917
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Oh!

1918
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Because she had no idea.

1919
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Like, she had been a huge fan of the T-Bap

1920
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
and then didn't know that they'd gone on to do all this other stuff

1921
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
until Ben put up this video, like,

1922
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
hey, by the way, we're alive and we've been doing stuff for the last year.

1923
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
That's all great, almost two years.

1924
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
So, yeah, they just, they just didn't announce it to their old fans.

1925
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
So that's why their base was so broken.

1926
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And then Hippo-

1927
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
That's bizarre to me.

1928
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I don't know why you would make that choice.

1929
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Like, I get what you said, but-

1930
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Who cares if the audience is all bronies?

1931
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Let them watch my fucking anime analysis.

1932
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I don't care.

1933
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Yeah.

1934
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Well, I'm just saying that that's, that's, you know,

1935
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,000
my mindset is like, even if everything fails, there's always a pickup.

1936
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Like, we can always keep trying,

1937
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
especially if you have enough money saved up from the previous one.

1938
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
When I make a Patreon exclusive video,

1939
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
which is for the $5 and up people,

1940
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
and I make like, maybe two of these a month,

1941
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
like, I'll do like a commentary over something

1942
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
or just talk about something that's going on,

1943
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I always tell them,

1944
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I'm making these videos just for you,

1945
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
not the Patreon exclusives,

1946
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
but every video is just for you guys,

1947
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
because I could lose every subscriber,

1948
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
except for the 100 people on Patreon,

1949
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
and I would still be doing this.

1950
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I would still be doing this just for you.

1951
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
There's no, that's why I've put out two videos this month

1952
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
that aren't even on YouTube,

1953
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
because it's like, as long as the patrons are there,

1954
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
that's all that matters.

1955
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And if the patrons start complaining,

1956
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
that's when I'll start listening, you know?

1957
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Like, I put out these videos about

1958
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
anime soundtrack composers, it's a totally different style,

1959
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
and like, in the comments on the videos,

1960
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
there's some people who really love it,

1961
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
some who don't like it,

1962
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
but no one's complained on Patreon yet.

1963
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
So as long as no one complains on Patreon,

1964
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
those videos keep happening, you know?

1965
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Do you think that's healthy, though,

1966
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
to be subjugated to the opinion specifically of the patrons?

1967
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Like, if they complain about something,

1968
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
would you stop doing it?

1969
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I wouldn't stop it just because one guy complained,

1970
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
or anything, but like, if...

1971
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
What if it was like a guy who's giving you

1972
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
100 bucks a video?

1973
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Would you be like, oh, well,

1974
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
maybe I shouldn't do that.

1975
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I don't...

1976
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
No one does that, and when they do,

1977
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I don't trust them.

1978
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Yeah.

1979
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Because there's nothing...

1980
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Like, dude, if you're gonna be a patron,

1981
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
like, at maximum, give $30.

1982
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
No, not give me 50 yet.

1983
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
There's a lot of 50s,

1984
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
and I really like those people.

1985
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I don't have any...

1986
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I had...

1987
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Like, the highest pledge I ever had

1988
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
that was consistent is this woman named

1989
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Anna Esther Volos, who has a couple

1990
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
YouTube videos that are pretty alright,

1991
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
and she's like an animator.

1992
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
And she used to be a patron to, like,

1993
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
every one of the PCP for, like,

1994
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
really high amounts.

1995
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
She gave me, like, $35 a video for years.

1996
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Oh, my God.

1997
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
So she personally has given me, like,

1998
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
thousands of dollars.

1999
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yo, Anna, hit me up.

2000
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
But she eventually reduced it a little bit.

2001
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
But, like, to me, that was like...

2002
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
That's like the most...

2003
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Like, that's the most you could pledge

2004
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
that I'll take it seriously,

2005
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
because I've had people...

2006
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
How could you not take it seriously?

2007
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Because I've had people who pledge 100,

2008
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
and then immediately get declined

2009
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
and have to reduce it to $5.

2010
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
You know?

2011
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
It's like, it happens all the time,

2012
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
because they always think that it's going

2013
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
to work one way,

2014
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
and that it just doesn't work out

2015
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
the way they think it will.

2016
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
You know?

2017
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
They somehow think they're going to

2018
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
either have $100 to give you,

2019
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
or that they don't understand

2020
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
how Patreon works, you know?

2021
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Or they get declined,

2022
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
and then they can't make it go through,

2023
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
and it's just like...

2024
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Because to me, it just inflates my numbers.

2025
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Like, I don't want it to look like

2026
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I make more than I do.

2027
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
That's true, because then people will be less willing,

2028
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
like, oh, why would I give them two bucks?

2029
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
He's got a thousand.

2030
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Yeah, exactly.

2031
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
So, yeah, well, we've gotten off

2032
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
into the weeds on that again.

2033
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I don't remember...

2034
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I don't know where we started.

2035
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
So, Manimal,

2036
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
he stopped being on the Let's Play.

2037
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Yeah.

2038
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Well, now we've got the

2039
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Let's Play channel is kind of

2040
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
free-for-all at this point.

2041
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
You've got a show with...

2042
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
You do some with Biggs,

2043
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
you've got some with Patch,

2044
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
you've got the Spyro...

2045
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Well, those have all come to an end

2046
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
now that I'm moving.

2047
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
The Spyro series,

2048
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
that's with Random Guest each time,

2049
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
which I think is genius.

2050
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Yeah, that's a fun idea.

2051
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Since I realized it's so hard

2052
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
to find a good co-host,

2053
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I thought, hey,

2054
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
let's just let everybody be a co-host.

2055
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
I'll give just any random person

2056
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
three episodes to listen to me

2057
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
play Spyro because they can't see the screen.

2058
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
So, it's just kind of like an excuse

2059
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
to have random conversations.

2060
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I've had Jess, Hippo,

2061
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
and Munchie from the PCP,

2062
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
and then I've had my brother,

2063
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
my real-life friend Maddie,

2064
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and then my internet friend Odd Belly.

2065
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And in Spyro 2,

2066
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
now that Spyro 1's over,

2067
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I want to branch out and get, like,

2068
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
fans and listeners and stuff.

2069
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Like, people I don't even know.

2070
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
But I'm going through a vetting process

2071
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
to make sure that I can listen to them

2072
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
for an hour.

2073
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
That reminds me,

2074
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
you once had a podcast

2075
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
called Anime Fight.

2076
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Yeah, let's talk about Anime Fight.

2077
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Which I've never actually watched,

2078
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
but because I could tell

2079
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
from the thumbnail alone

2080
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
that you had not vetted the people

2081
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Odd there,

2082
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
and that they were a bunch of fucking idiots.

2083
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
What was the deal with that?

2084
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
So, a big fan of

2085
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
the Movie Fights podcast

2086
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
on Screen Junkies,

2087
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
where there's a judge,

2088
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
and they give you a topic like,

2089
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
what is the best Quentin Tarantino movie?

2090
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
And then the three contestants argue it out,

2091
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
and then the judge awards a point to the winner.

2092
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
And I thought, hey,

2093
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
let's do that with Anime.

2094
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
But I'll let the fans join in,

2095
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
because I love my fan interaction.

2096
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
So I was like, hey,

2097
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
send me an email if you want to join in,

2098
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
and you can be on the show.

2099
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Surely enough, we got, you know,

2100
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
nine people in total.

2101
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Actually, Baku Boys,

2102
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
who we talked about earlier,

2103
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
was on one of them,

2104
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
and he actually won,

2105
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
just because he was the funniest.

2106
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Because the idea was,

2107
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
it's not a serious Anime Fight.

2108
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
They're all emulating me,

2109
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
and they all chose to do this

2110
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
of their own accord.

2111
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
They're trying to do the

2112
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
monkey memes of, oh,

2113
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
World War II is an anime

2114
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
that had over 6 million

2115
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
people who didn't like it,

2116
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
and that kind of shit.

2117
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
But most of them

2118
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
weren't very good at doing monkey.

2119
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
No.

2120
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Not, you know,

2121
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
not everyone's a comedian.

2122
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Especially not in a very specific

2123
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
personal style of one comedian

2124
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
that you're trying to emulate.

2125
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And it doesn't help that most of them

2126
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
are like 15 and 16 year old guys.

2127
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Right.

2128
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Like recording it kind of quietly

2129
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
upstairs, hoping that their parents

2130
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
don't hear what they're saying.

2131
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Doing the soft scream.

2132
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Yeah.

2133
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
And that's why Death Note

2134
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
is the best anime

2135
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
of all time.

2136
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
So if you want to just,

2137
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
if you want to cringe really hard

2138
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
for hours at a time,

2139
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I'd say go watch the old anime fights.

2140
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Full body cringe.

2141
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I accidentally clicked on one.

2142
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And even just hearing my introduction,

2143
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I don't know if I had to get out of there.

2144
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Even, I cringe that myself.

2145
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Terrible.

2146
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Even the shitposts

2147
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
master himself can't sit through

2148
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
with that level.

2149
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I've never watched them.

2150
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
They just uploaded immediately after.

2151
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
They were live streams.

2152
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
So there was a live audience the whole time.

2153
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
So I didn't have to watch it.

2154
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Incredible.

2155
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I love it.

2156
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
You just have it all this time.

2157
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
You still have never even bothered.

2158
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I'm not going to take them down.

2159
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I'm sure somebody can get something out of it.

2160
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Maybe it's like the Digibro idea

2161
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
of never taking anything down

2162
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
so they can see how I've grown.

2163
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
So that's just like...

2164
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
There's a dark corner in my channel.

2165
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
There is a bunch of stuff that's set to private

2166
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
on my old blog.

2167
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I don't know if I would...

2168
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
It's too late to go back and make it all public now.

2169
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
But I don't know if I still would have hidden it today.

2170
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I just know that I did at the time

2171
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
because I was like,

2172
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
well, here's a lot of tracks that need to be covered.

2173
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Let's not let all this exist

2174
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
for too much longer.

2175
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
What were the sorts of things on there?

2176
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Otaku sexuality analysis.

2177
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
That seems like something you would do today.

2178
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I would,

2179
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
but not in the same way.

2180
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
How did you do it?

2181
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
It's just that the way I wrote back then...

2182
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Was the hentai samurai giving you advice?

2183
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Me and the hentai samurai

2184
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
go way back.

2185
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I imagine.

2186
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
He's like a father figure to you.

2187
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
He's grown a lot as an artist over the last decade.

2188
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
With his whole one video.

2189
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
He did have some guest posts,

2190
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
actually, on my old blog.

2191
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
They were published under my name.

2192
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I never...

2193
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
He was shy back then.

2194
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
He didn't want anybody to know his real name,

2195
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Hentai Samurai.

2196
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
He didn't have the mask yet.

2197
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
He didn't have the underwear mask,

2198
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
so he didn't want to be public without the mask.

2199
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Anyway, oh god,

2200
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I don't remember what we were saying again.

2201
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
This has been a series

2202
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
of me forgetting what the fuck we were talking about.

2203
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
You're the navigator, so you figure it out,

2204
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
because I don't remember either.

2205
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Let me think of some more shit to ask you about.

2206
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
We've mostly been focused on your

2207
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
sort of YouTube career,

2208
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
but it seems like that's kind of dominated your life.

2209
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Tell us about what you were trying to do

2210
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
in college,

2211
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
because we know you almost

2212
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
became a teacher

2213
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
well into...

2214
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
This was only recently that you finally abandoned this...

2215
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
This terrible dream.

2216
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Yeah.

2217
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
The only thing that I was really good at

2218
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
in high school was English.

2219
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I was in all the advanced English classes.

2220
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
All my papers I would write

2221
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
in like five hours,

2222
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
and then get an A on where everybody else would be like,

2223
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
oh, it was so hard to write three-page paper,

2224
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
because I'm a retarded 17-year-old.

2225
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I always over...

2226
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Oh, of course.

2227
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
It's like easy and fun

2228
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
to put out an argument.

2229
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
All I wanted them to do was like,

2230
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
every day I was like, when are we going to get another written assignment?

2231
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
If that was all this class was,

2232
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
school would be amazing.

2233
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
The best class I've taken in my life

2234
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
was creative writing in high school,

2235
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
but that's partly because

2236
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
all my friends got into it too,

2237
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
and it was just the constant harassment hour.

2238
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
There's that one writing exercise

2239
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
where everybody

2240
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
writes a paragraph of a story

2241
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
that has it behind you.

2242
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
And this motherfucker, one of my

2243
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
good buddies, his name was

2244
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Zach.

2245
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
So Zach would ruin every single

2246
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
story with this character he created

2247
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
called Earthquake Man,

2248
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
and he wouldn't even read what had been happening.

2249
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
He would just write down,

2250
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
and then Earthquake Man killed everybody

2251
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
in the world with an earthquake.

2252
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
And my poor-bodied chum

2253
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
was sitting behind him,

2254
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
so he would have to pick up the pieces

2255
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
of the asteroid world time and time again

2256
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
and try to

2257
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
resurrect everybody who had been killed

2258
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
by Earthquake Man.

2259
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
So that was like

2260
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
shitposting the class.

2261
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
We ruined it for everybody,

2262
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
and it was tons of fun.

2263
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
It sounds like your whole life has been shitposting their life.

2264
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
It was fun.

2265
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I loved that class.

2266
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So yeah, in college,

2267
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I was like, okay, I guess I'll major in English.

2268
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I knew there were no prospects in that.

2269
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I don't need a major in English to do that.

2270
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I just need to write a book.

2271
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
So it got to the point

2272
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
in my sophomore year when I realized,

2273
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
well, if I'm really doing this English major,

2274
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
my only option is to be a teacher.

2275
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
That's the only career path that this leads to,

2276
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
as far as I know.

2277
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
So I studied to be a teacher.

2278
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I kind of liked it.

2279
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I did student teaching a little bit.

2280
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I would go into classrooms and give lessons and stuff.

2281
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
I thought it was okay.

2282
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I've always liked kids.

2283
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I've always either gotten along with people

2284
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
who were younger than me,

2285
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
or way older than me.

2286
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I typically don't hang out with people my own age.

2287
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Not my own age or one year older.

2288
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Well, because younger people always look up to me.

2289
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And I think you probably for the same reason

2290
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
we have a younger brother

2291
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
who's pretty close.

2292
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
And so I think it's like you have a certain

2293
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
nurturing tendency towards younger people.

2294
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And like,

2295
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
all growing up,

2296
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
most of my friends were usually just Victor's friends.

2297
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
People who he had around

2298
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
who would also

2299
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
treat me like I was their big brother

2300
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
as well.

2301
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And Manimol was two years older than me,

2302
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
so that was perfect for me.

2303
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I hang out with all the older kids,

2304
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
lightning along Johnson the same.

2305
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Cobb even was a year older than me in school.

2306
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Didn't have a whole lot of friends in my own grade,

2307
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
but that's fine.

2308
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
So yeah, I like people.

2309
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Typically I get along better with those who were younger

2310
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
and those who were older.

2311
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And then I started doing monkey.

2312
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And I was like, well, as soon as this is found,

2313
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
teaching's over.

2314
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
They're not letting me into school.

2315
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So I was really disheartened by that,

2316
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
thinking, well, I just wasted four years of my life

2317
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
at this college.

2318
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And then I make a couple videos and now I'm fucked.

2319
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
You make one a Feebiel file video

2320
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
and it's game over when it comes to teaching.

2321
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
As soon as they find it, it's game over.

2322
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
So when they announced,

2323
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I went to the meeting for

2324
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
the big student teaching thing,

2325
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I went to school for like a whole semester,

2326
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
like half a year.

2327
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
And just hearing all this shit they were saying

2328
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
and all the papers I had to fill out

2329
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
and all this garbage.

2330
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I thought, I don't want to do this.

2331
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
People have told me all the time

2332
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
that like people watch my videos and I'm like,

2333
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
you'd be a great teacher. Why don't you teach at university?

2334
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I'm like, because do you know what teachers have to do?

2335
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
It's not just get up in front of a class

2336
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
and be eloquent for an hour.

2337
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
It's like work constantly

2338
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
and tirelessly for no money.

2339
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Right. It's a lot of unpaid overtime

2340
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
that people don't understand.

2341
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I appreciate teachers infinitely more

2342
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
than ever because I've gone through the whole process

2343
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
of what it's like being one.

2344
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
And I also now know

2345
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
which teachers really sucked

2346
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
and why they sucked at their job.

2347
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
So I have a new found respect for it

2348
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
but I just don't think I can do it

2349
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
and now I'm kind of in this weird limbo of

2350
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I don't have a job, I can't get a job

2351
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
right now because I'm in the middle of moving

2352
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
and I don't know what to do

2353
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
with my career path.

2354
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I have a useless English degree

2355
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
as Avenue Q would say

2356
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
what do you do

2357
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
with a B.A. in English?

2358
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
So I'm in that position

2359
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
and I have this

2360
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
beacon light reaching out to me

2361
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
saying,

2362
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
do monkey has a job

2363
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
and that's just crazy.

2364
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Right.

2365
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And you've got these PCP guys who

2366
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
when I found you, you were very like

2367
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
oh, this YouTube is not a job.

2368
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I still feel that way.

2369
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
You kind of had a chip on your shoulder

2370
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
about it though and I first talked to you

2371
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
that you were like...

2372
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Oh, it's just pure jealousy.

2373
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
The fact that you can do this as a job makes me sick

2374
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
because I want to.

2375
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
But then as you became friends with the PCP

2376
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
it started seeming like you were taking your Patreon

2377
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
more and more seriously and that it became

2378
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
like once you knew other guys who were doing it

2379
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
it's like well fuck, if Digi's making all this money

2380
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
why am I not making all this money?

2381
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I'm just going to say right now I'm sitting at

2382
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
19,000 subscribers which thank you

2383
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
you gave me a thousand in a day from your

2384
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
your big famous video.

2385
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
But if I'm making $600 a month

2386
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
at 19,000 subs in my mind

2387
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
like just you double the subs

2388
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
you double the money. I see that correlation

2389
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
in my head.

2390
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
So I'm just at like the cusp

2391
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
of becoming like a

2392
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
D-list YouTube celebrity

2393
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
and I think if I do, you know

2394
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
get this to continue to grow

2395
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
and sustain me as an actual career

2396
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
but it's so unknown.

2397
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
That's something I'm glad you thought of it that way

2398
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
because I had two and I think a lot of people

2399
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
don't. They don't think about the fact that

2400
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
like every small amount of

2401
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
growth on YouTube is exactly

2402
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
that much to your paycheck

2403
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
and like if you

2404
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
like a lot of people are thinking like

2405
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
man I'm really wallowing in this like 10k

2406
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
realm or whatever

2407
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
and then you don't even think about the fact that

2408
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
like they're thinking everyone's eyes is on the

2409
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
horizon like everyone's thinking

2410
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
man I have to hit 100,000 before this will be

2411
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
serious but if you just double

2412
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
your subs you double your money

2413
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
you know like almost

2414
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
if it's correlating to the

2415
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
view counts you know and so people don't realize

2416
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
like even making a small step

2417
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
you know it all affects

2418
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
what you're making you know it's

2419
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
always a constant incline

2420
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
and everyone's so worried about catching

2421
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
the brass ring at the top that they're not thinking

2422
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
about how every step up the ladder is also

2423
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
an improvement you know. Yeah

2424
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
people don't seem to understand that if you have

2425
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
40,000 subs you could be

2426
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
living very comfortably like that could be your

2427
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
full-time job at 40,000 subs

2428
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
if you just did digibro after dark I think you'd

2429
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
still make a decent amount of money

2430
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
if uh if the I mean

2431
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I would if I just if I came out tomorrow

2432
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
and said uh digibros cancelled

2433
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
it's all after dark now I

2434
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
your patreon would be like 10%

2435
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
of what it is today it would

2436
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
it would plummet yeah um

2437
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I wouldn't have to pay DeVoo and

2438
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I you know

2439
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
wouldn't have to pay as much in taxes I think

2440
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
because I've had a lot of patrons

2441
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
telling me I will patron after dark

2442
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I have lots of people telling me like I don't

2443
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
care about the main channel I just care

2444
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
about after dark uh you know

2445
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
like I just follow you as a person

2446
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
so if I cancelled digibro

2447
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
first of all I wouldn't lose all the patrons immediately

2448
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
second of all I'd probably put more

2449
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
effort into after dark because I wouldn't have to

2450
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
worry about the main channel so I think

2451
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
some I would argue that some of the

2452
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
like the big 20 30 minute vlogs

2453
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
you do on there about even like things

2454
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
in anime more interesting yeah I

2455
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
like those more than normal videos

2456
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
the reason I do so much after dark is that I legitimately

2457
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
love it yeah it's just harder

2458
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
for me to charge for it because it's hard to draw the

2459
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
line it's hard to say like where does

2460
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
what's the difference between an

2461
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
after dark video that is patronable one that's

2462
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
not because I also love

2463
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
stuff like insomnia analysis

2464
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
which is like an hour of me doing

2465
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
random weird shit right that a

2466
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
lot of people will not sit through but

2467
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
to me that would be like the most

2468
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
patronable video you know like if there was

2469
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
a channel doing all stuff like that I'd be

2470
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
patient to it but like so it's it's hard

2471
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
to draw the line of like what's worth and what's

2472
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
not so I just make it very clear if it's a

2473
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
main channel video it's patron if it's not

2474
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
it's not you know unless it's like a

2475
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
podcast it's on the main channel or something

2476
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
but like yeah if I

2477
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
if I'd went full after dark I think I

2478
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
could still make a few hundred dollars on

2479
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
after dark I'd still make enough ad revenue

2480
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
to kind of it would just be

2481
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
where I was as a pony guy

2482
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
like I could probably make

2483
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
three hundred dollars a video put out four videos

2484
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
a month well I guess I'd probably

2485
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
change the I don't know how

2486
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
how I'd do per video on

2487
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
after dark I don't think you should I think

2488
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
after dark would be a per week

2489
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I think has to be per month and you can do

2490
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
what Tom Oliver was doing

2491
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
for a long time was just he would make a

2492
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
patron post every week so it was

2493
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
set as per like his because you can just

2494
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
write in per whatever yeah so

2495
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
he wrote in per week and then he would just

2496
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
collect all his videos from all his different channels

2497
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
hmm that's a smart idea

2498
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
so if I wish I could do that but they won't let me

2499
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
change it now that I'm stuck in the month thing

2500
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
oh yeah I feel like I'd be making more

2501
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
if I did it I'll let you change to the other

2502
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
not it's too late

2503
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I have the setting where

2504
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
as soon as somebody pledges the money immediately get charged

2505
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
yeah so now I can't change anything I'm just like stuck

2506
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
yeah

2507
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
yeah I would do it per week

2508
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
and I would probably

2509
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
make I could probably still make

2510
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
over a thousand dollars a month on just

2511
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
after dark and I mean that's minimum

2512
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
wage working at some that's what it was

2513
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
that's what I was making up to last year

2514
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
when the channel suddenly blew up so

2515
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
um yeah

2516
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
uh I

2517
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
encourage you to try to

2518
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
be a youtuber because I think you're cut out for it

2519
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
in a way that not a lot of other people are

2520
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
you know then I'm just worried about the benefits

2521
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
and what if I get sick

2522
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
like insurance is a lot of money

2523
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
and luckily I do have until

2524
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
like what I'm 26 to get off my parents

2525
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
insurance

2526
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
no no that's one thing he's gonna keep

2527
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
yeah he said he's gonna keep that

2528
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
yeah so it's all good

2529
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
maybe we're in luck

2530
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
ugh that chump guy

2531
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
pretty cool guy

2532
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I don't want to talk about Trump on here do I have to

2533
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
uh no you don't have to

2534
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I want us to go for another hour

2535
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I kind of have to like

2536
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
excrete everything from every orifice

2537
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
of my body you want to put this on hold for a little

2538
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
bit yeah I'm fine with it

2539
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
yeah alright um

2540
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
just remember to edit out the shitting part

2541
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
yeah okay

2542
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
we're back from the crapper we're back from

2543
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
evacuating those bowels

2544
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
ever been more empty so monkey

2545
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I wanted to ask you some stuff about your

2546
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
influences okay um

2547
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
part not only

2548
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
in a few different ways

2549
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
like for instance that we

2550
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
both seem to have the same stance

2551
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
on uh

2552
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
on working

2553
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
working putting putting out lots of content

2554
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
and sort of being self motivated

2555
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
and stuff and when I brought up

2556
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Quentin Tarantino you immediately

2557
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
had a quote from him that you cited

2558
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
so like was that

2559
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
were you influenced by him and his ethos

2560
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
or like who kind of inspired you to work the way you do

2561
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
uh well to

2562
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
to say about the Quentin Tarantino quote

2563
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
it's because that's a meme on

2564
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
tv the 4chan board

2565
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
where like they use it I guess to make fun of him

2566
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
even though his films are great so I don't

2567
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
know what the joke is even though that phrase

2568
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
makes I mean perfect sense

2569
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
like if anything it's uh bragging

2570
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
right I think they interpret

2571
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
it as being just extremely pretentious but

2572
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
if if anybody

2573
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
has earned being pretentious it's Quentin Tarantino

2574
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
because his movies are great

2575
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
uh so what was

2576
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
the question who who sort of influenced

2577
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
your uh work ethic where did

2578
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
you get the idea to work the way you do

2579
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
oh that's just something I've had since

2580
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I was born but

2581
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
god like even in

2582
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
elementary school I was just chugging along

2583
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
doing those multiplication tables

2584
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I just have to keep working all the time

2585
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
or else I I guess I fall into depression

2586
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I don't know it's just it's an

2587
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
innate drive like there's

2588
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
an inner locomotive that just keeps

2589
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
chugging along and I can sometimes hear

2590
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
it just in

2591
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
my head I've I've previously described

2592
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
my own depression as

2593
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
like it's all it's a base level

2594
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
like on a basic level you're always

2595
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
depressed and everything else is just

2596
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
stuff you're stacking on top of that

2597
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
and so you need it

2598
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
because as soon as it's not there you fall back

2599
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
to the basic level and would you say

2600
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
that your work is like that like like

2601
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
when you're not making work you're

2602
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
depressed or when you're not like doing something

2603
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
talking to somebody but then so

2604
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
like you have to do it to keep away

2605
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
from the depression I think that's

2606
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
a perfect summation because I

2607
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
hardly ever feel

2608
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
suicidal or like

2609
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
depressed to a point where it like physically hurts

2610
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
when I'm working on a video or writing a script

2611
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
or I guess

2612
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
watching Survivor but that's not really working

2613
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
well I think that's what I mean by like

2614
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
doing something right you know like something that makes

2615
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
you that that brings

2616
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
something out of you that makes it so you're not

2617
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
just sitting around thinking about

2618
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
depression and for those of you at home

2619
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
who don't relate to this you're probably thinking

2620
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
well it's as simple as just

2621
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
if you don't want to feel depressed go do a thing

2622
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
and that logically makes sense

2623
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
but once you fall into the trap

2624
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
like you get convinced that you don't feel like

2625
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
doing anything at all and I think

2626
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
there's all these movies I want to watch but I don't really

2627
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
feel like watching them

2628
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
one of the most

2629
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
the most resonant criticisms I

2630
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
ever got was from my

2631
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
mentor Ghost Lightning where I was complaining

2632
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
about I was telling him about something

2633
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I wanted to make like I was kind of bragging

2634
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
about something that I had an idea for but I

2635
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
hadn't actually made it so why am I bragging?

2636
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Good job, Animal. Good job, Cob.

2637
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Yeah this is me before

2638
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
YouTube you know back when I was an anime blogger

2639
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
so I'm bragging about some idea

2640
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I have and he's like why don't you you know why don't you

2641
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
work on that thing I think I was telling him

2642
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I was like upset or something he was like why don't

2643
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
you work on that thing you were talking about and I was like I'm not in the mood

2644
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
and he said you you have a real

2645
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
problem with always letting these moods control

2646
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
you and I thought I never

2647
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
thought about it as something you had power over

2648
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
that like you have to try to

2649
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
escape the mood because

2650
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
the mood if you if you just let yourself

2651
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
be governed by moods you'll never do anything

2652
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
you know you'll just be like well I'm depressed I'm not

2653
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
in the mood to do this or that so it's always

2654
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
a fight like like when I

2655
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
when I get out of that it's not because I'm

2656
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
like just able

2657
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
to change it it's like it takes a real

2658
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
like effort to like examine

2659
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
what you're doing and be like no I have

2660
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
to make a video today

2661
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
like this has to happen

2662
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
you know or else I'm uh I'm

2663
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
fucked so do you think there's a lot

2664
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
of that like just trying to keep

2665
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
to your schedule and stuff is that what like

2666
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
motivates you to help get you out of those those

2667
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
funks yeah it definitely prevents them

2668
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
from occurring in the first

2669
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
place it's kind of have you seen the movie

2670
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
never ending story

2671
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
not so there's something called the swamps

2672
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
of sadness where if

2673
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
if you're standing in it and you're feeling

2674
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
sad you'll keep sinking but if you have positive

2675
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
thoughts you can keep going through and

2676
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
it's the saddest part of the movie because the horse

2677
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
drowns to death and the swamp is like kids

2678
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
movie is very intense

2679
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
and the kid is screaming and crying

2680
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
but I think depression in a

2681
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
way is like the swamps of sadness where

2682
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
if you just think of other things

2683
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
you can keep walking through the muck but

2684
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
once you start sinking it's hard to get back

2685
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
out so I

2686
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
so having the schedule is

2687
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
is like my version of keep

2688
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
on walking through the swamp

2689
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
so how how much

2690
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
like what do you think you're

2691
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
what are you trying to communicate

2692
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
in your videos because it like

2693
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
is your main motivation just to be funny

2694
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
and to be entertaining for people because like

2695
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
for me so much

2696
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
of it comes from a desire to be understood

2697
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
to like like like

2698
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
the reason I have to make these analysis videos is that

2699
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
if I go out there and I say chaos the greatest

2700
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
anime of all time or something

2701
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
people are just gonna look at me like I'm insane

2702
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
unless I justify it you know

2703
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
so to me so much of my videos

2704
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
is like justifying these opinions I have

2705
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
so that people will understand where I'm coming

2706
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
from but your videos

2707
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
deliberately obfuscate

2708
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
your opinions to such an extent that there's

2709
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
lots of people who just don't understand

2710
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
what your opinions actually are on on most

2711
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
things does that ever bother

2712
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
you at all or does it like is it a problem at all

2713
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
that you have created it cultivated a

2714
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
character of just not being able to

2715
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
be understood the last couple

2716
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
PCPs I've been on

2717
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I just

2718
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
shitposted and I hope people appreciated

2719
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
them because otherwise it's got to be terrible

2720
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
listening to me talk we did one like

2721
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
how did you lose your virginity story and I just

2722
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
described the plot of moonlight exactly

2723
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
so and that's because

2724
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I think that me as a

2725
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
person as a human being I don't find myself

2726
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
interesting and I don't

2727
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
think other people would if I let myself

2728
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
go that much

2729
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
so I'm not that interested I'd rather

2730
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
just you know do be

2731
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I don't want to be me because it's fine

2732
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
who cares I don't think anybody

2733
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
should care do you feel like it backfires

2734
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
it all though when like for instance

2735
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
in the in the PCP chat I've described

2736
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
you as the boy who cried wolf because

2737
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
anytime you try to be sincere nobody

2738
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
can tell because you've

2739
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
gone so far into presenting an

2740
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
insincere character I mean

2741
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I'm okay with that it's fine yeah

2742
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
it doesn't bother me that much you don't

2743
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
you don't find it like a frustrating when

2744
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
people can't tell when you're trying

2745
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
to be real about something well I think

2746
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
if it's a main video like the

2747
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Elliot Roger one I don't think very many people

2748
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
think I was being ironic in that one yeah

2749
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
you kind of well you use a very different tone

2750
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
and everything

2751
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
and I'm and there's not really

2752
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
any jokes in that video so

2753
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
it's pretty clearly straightforward

2754
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
yeah and then like

2755
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
the countdown to suicide channel I don't

2756
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I don't shit post on there ever other than

2757
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
my drunken live streams but that's just fun

2758
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
yeah well that's what I like about that channel

2759
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
so much is that I can always kind of

2760
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
trust it like it always feels like okay

2761
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I think that's why

2762
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
like that was kind of the key for me

2763
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
understanding you enough to feel like

2764
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
that we could be friends because if

2765
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
all you did was shit post constantly

2766
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I just wouldn't be even be able to have a

2767
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
conversation with you right but I was

2768
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
like well there's clearly like a guy in

2769
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
there somewhere it's just a super boring

2770
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
guy who needs to

2771
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
always be ironic or satirical

2772
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
in order to be interesting because I

2773
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
like

2774
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
yes me like what what do I do on a daily basis

2775
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
if I fucking I do what everybody else does I jerk

2776
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
off once I sit there watch TV

2777
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
that make videos and only the videos part

2778
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
should be like anybody

2779
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
should care about nobody should care

2780
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
about what I as a human being

2781
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
do I'm not saying that like I want to protect

2782
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
myself or like oh don't look

2783
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
at me don't look behind the curtain but because it's

2784
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
just genuinely uninteresting

2785
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
right I mean

2786
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I find the countdown to suicide videos

2787
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
interesting but

2788
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I mean do you not think that if you

2789
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
made like if you could convert

2790
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
the the sort of what you're talking

2791
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
about in the countdown to suicide videos into

2792
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
main series serious content do you

2793
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
think people would would find that interesting

2794
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
well I think the depression review is the

2795
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
closest thing I've come to doing that

2796
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
and a lot of people seem

2797
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
affected by that video

2798
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
in I don't know if it's a positive or

2799
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
negative way but both are

2800
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I think good do you think you

2801
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
would you would consider like

2802
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
when monkeys anime reviews is over are you

2803
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
going to bring more sincere content

2804
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
to oh yes yes I'm

2805
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
going to branch out I've got

2806
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
three different types of videos I want

2807
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
to make I talked about the isms one

2808
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
but what level of sincerity

2809
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
would that one be

2810
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
that's gonna be all over the place like sometimes

2811
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
I'll be talking about how great

2812
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
feminism feminism is

2813
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
and then like I'll be shitting on atheism

2814
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
even though I'm an atheist like just a bunch

2815
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
of crazy wacky fun stuff

2816
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
because I think that would be

2817
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
it's somewhere in between

2818
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
me and you is where is where endless

2819
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Jess is where you've been like

2820
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
nonstop inauthentic and I've been

2821
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
nonstop authentic because I have such a

2822
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
difficult time making a video

2823
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
because I've had times before where I make

2824
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
something like your style and then people

2825
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
will message me like well what's your actual

2826
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
opinion people people are so invested

2827
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
in like what I think about stuff that they're

2828
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
like oh well it sucks that we don't get

2829
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
to make a follow-up vlog explaining

2830
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
my actual opinion about something

2831
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
and Jesse kind of falls

2832
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
in the middle where he'll represent both in the same

2833
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
video and that's why

2834
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
his so much of his audience can't

2835
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
parse the difference and that's why

2836
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
there's so many misunderstandings around them

2837
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
because it seems to be difficult do you think

2838
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
that this that you'll run into this

2839
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
issue and would it bother you even

2840
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
if it did like does it bother

2841
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
you to not be understood in your intentions

2842
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
no

2843
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
because it's so rare that it's even

2844
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
relevant to

2845
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I don't I can't think of one instance

2846
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
where I was being super sincere in a

2847
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
video and that people wrote it off as

2848
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
being sarcastic

2849
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
or disingenuous do you think there's more

2850
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
of a chance of that once you mix the

2851
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
like for instance

2852
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I mean to me this was clear

2853
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
but I don't know if it would be to everyone else

2854
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
that when you did your 10 anime heroes

2855
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
the whole Hank Hill analysis is like

2856
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
a completely legitimate and great

2857
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
analysis of why Hank Hill is such a good

2858
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
character and I was like well this seems

2859
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
sincere to me but will people think

2860
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
do you not know the story behind

2861
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
the Hank Hill part no what so

2862
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
so that's a that's a copypasta

2863
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I didn't write that oh I didn't know

2864
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
that at all yeah I I

2865
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
told more people caught on but a lot of people

2866
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
just kind of praised me as like a great

2867
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
analysis of Hank Hill

2868
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
great point about why he's a good kid now that

2869
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
you've mentioned it I feel like I've heard it

2870
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
years ago like like a long time ago

2871
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
it gets posted and every king of the hill

2872
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
thread on TV I see

2873
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I thought it was funny like somebody

2874
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
took the time to write that and I was like

2875
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I'm putting it in well see now now you understand

2876
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
that your intentions work

2877
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
everyone thinks you're an amazing analyst but

2878
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
that's a good thing I'll take it

2879
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
don't tell everybody

2880
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
listening don't tell anybody that I didn't write that

2881
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
I'll take the credit it's fine but are you at all

2882
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
concerned that in the future when you try to

2883
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
make more sincere content that people won't

2884
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
understand well so I did

2885
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
something I did that a while ago I did

2886
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
the top five YouTube channels that

2887
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
deserve more subscribers and I don't think anybody

2888
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
thought that was sarcastic I think

2889
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
I mean I explained what the channel was

2890
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
and why I liked it and it's hard

2891
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
there's no clear joke

2892
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
then because I know

2893
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
um Jesse was

2894
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
saying how he was you you had said

2895
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
that you you floated the idea of having

2896
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
monkeys reviews and jimmies reviews making

2897
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
it very clear the distinction between

2898
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
that idea didn't last very long

2899
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
yeah well just because

2900
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
it's less funny that way

2901
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
the ambiguity makes it funnier

2902
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
but it also makes it riskier

2903
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
because you never know what you're gonna get when you click

2904
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
on the video is he actually gonna talk about the

2905
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
top 10 anime heroes that's the thing it relies

2906
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
more on the audience to understand

2907
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
you know it's that like it's

2908
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
if you make it completely distinct

2909
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
then it might

2910
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
it's more audience friendly maybe

2911
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
well it's more audience friendly

2912
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
but it also is

2913
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
less artistically

2914
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
interesting you know and that's why

2915
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Jesse was so adamantly against it even though

2916
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
if he did that it would cause

2917
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
none of these misunderstandings would happen

2918
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
but he wants to put faith on the audience

2919
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
and I'm wondering

2920
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I'm surprised he is putting faith in the intelligence

2921
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
of his audience he seems like he wouldn't do that

2922
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
it's that he would rather

2923
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
elevate them rather than

2924
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
stupid to them that's how he sees

2925
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
that's kind of how he sees the whole world

2926
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
rather than bringing my stuff

2927
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
down to your level you have to come up to my level

2928
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
unfortunately they won't do it

2929
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
because they're idiots

2930
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
how do you

2931
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
how much faith do you have in your audience's intelligence?

2932
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I just think

2933
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
it's all in the script

2934
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
and if it's clear that I'm not making jokes

2935
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
then like they should know

2936
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I actually mean what I'm saying

2937
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
it's hard to get out of those moods

2938
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
when you're kind of sinking in the swamp

2939
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
and I was there's this video idea

2940
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I've had for a while that I think I'm gonna do next month

2941
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
just

2942
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
my top five favorite YouTube videos

2943
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
and these are the videos that I always

2944
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
go to when I'm feeling bad

2945
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
and they never fail to make me laugh

2946
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
or to smile and I was just gonna show them off

2947
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
and say go watch these fucking videos

2948
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
they work for me

2949
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I don't think anybody can misinterpret that

2950
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
because it's so straight forward

2951
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
why would I waste the time giving

2952
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
reviews of random videos

2953
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
that make me laugh

2954
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
if I wasn't being serious about it

2955
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
yeah I think

2956
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
but you are putting some level of faith

2957
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
in the audience's intelligence there

2958
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
but I think you're definitely

2959
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
doing enough to

2960
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
but even if they misinterpret it

2961
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I don't see really the negative

2962
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
if somebody watches that and thinks it's satired

2963
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
it's not very bothered by not being

2964
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
understood

2965
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I don't know why

2966
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
for me it's just I can't do it

2967
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
like the second someone misunderstands

2968
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
I have to correct them

2969
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
to one guy's comment

2970
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
that misinterpreted it and I'm like

2971
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
well I don't want to have to type out the whole reason

2972
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
that this isn't the case so let me go

2973
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
record a fucking 30 minute vlog

2974
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
I have to pee really badly

2975
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
we'll just cut this part out

2976
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
um uh uh

2977
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
damn it I know something I was gonna ask you

2978
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
but I forgot I'll think about it while I pee

2979
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
that's fine I suck at talking when you're out of the room anyway

2980
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
make noises

2981
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
fuck cub

2982
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
fuck cub

2983
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
better eat those chippies while you can girl

2984
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I've been eating them

2985
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
how dare you

2986
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I'm a sneaky eater

2987
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
sneaky girl

2988
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
fuck cub

2989
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
we gotta keep saying that even after I move

2990
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
yeah

2991
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I can't live without saying fuck cub

2992
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
we'll walk around the house and sing that

2993
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
that's when I walk into the room and say it and walk out

2994
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
fuck cub

2995
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
fuck cub

2996
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
fuck cub

2997
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
fuck cub

2998
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
yeah he says it back

2999
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
fuck cub

3000
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
fuck cub

3001
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
sorry I'm such a leaky boy

3002
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
that's okay I'm sure once we start drinking and we're doing a let's play

3003
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
I'll be getting up between every episode again

3004
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
yeah well we usually both are

3005
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
so um

3006
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
alright to get back into your influences

3007
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
what are your influences like what are the direct influences

3008
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
what is your style made of

3009
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I have a lot of guesses but you can

3010
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
share some

3011
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
well I guess in the video

3012
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
we talked about earlier the mumkees anime reviews

3013
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
of mumkees anime reviews

3014
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
they're pretty much just list everybody

3015
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
it's like the biggest problem in the

3016
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
universe

3017
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Jon's run a little bit

3018
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I don't know I think that

3019
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I was listing like half

3020
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
influences and half people

3021
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
who everybody says I'm stealing from

3022
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
but I've never actually like

3023
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I'm not inspired by them at all

3024
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
like video game dunkey I like his videos

3025
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
but I wouldn't say my style is even

3026
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
close to what he does in any way

3027
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
other than that our names are

3028
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
kind of similar it's just having any

3029
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
irreverence whatsoever everyone gets

3030
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
compared it's like everyone

3031
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
compares you to Jesse which is a closer comparison

3032
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
but his are more like actual anime

3033
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
reviews and yours are like

3034
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
nonsensical and it would be

3035
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
it's impossible to say that I'm inspired

3036
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
by him because I made 30 episodes

3037
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
before I even knew he was

3038
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
alive and and

3039
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
or demo people compare you to demo

3040
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
never seen a demo video funny and talk

3041
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
about anime and there's no other connection

3042
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
really I promise if we watch some of his videos

3043
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
you'd be like why do people compare me to this

3044
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
this is nothing like my style

3045
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
yeah you did you both did a video on

3046
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
bokeh no pico that's okay

3047
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
that's it I think somebody said he also

3048
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
did a boon eye sisters but I was too afraid

3049
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
to watch because I didn't want to steal his jokes on accident

3050
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
yeah um

3051
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
like I don't know

3052
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I don't really know

3053
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
what my comedy influences are

3054
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
you've been quoting a lot of the

3055
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
widest kids you know I imagine that was an influence

3056
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
uh yeah yeah

3057
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I mean I like their comedy

3058
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
I don't know if it's really

3059
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
similar to what I do

3060
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I mean not everything I mean

3061
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I was influenced by widest kids you know

3062
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
it's not similar to what I do at all

3063
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
a lot of just the

3064
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
just simply the gallon of PCP

3065
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
skit just that

3066
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
skit was a huge influence on me and

3067
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Victor's sketch comedy before

3068
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
you know what no I'll take it back I think

3069
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Trevor more specifically the leader of the widest

3070
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
kids you know is a major comedy

3071
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
influence to me because

3072
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
you asked earlier what my kind of goal is

3073
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
with it and the most important thing

3074
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
to me is to fight against

3075
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
any form of censorship and I want

3076
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I think anything that

3077
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
can be said like

3078
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
exercise it and say it

3079
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
even if it's ridiculous and offensive

3080
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
we should exercise this right of the freedom of speech

3081
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
and Trevor Moore

3082
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
in the first episode of widest kids you know

3083
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
it ends with a music video called the hitler rap

3084
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
where he's dressed up as hitler and he's

3085
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
doing a whole rap about

3086
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
the third rikin shit and it's like it's really funny

3087
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
and

3088
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
a lot of people would say you shouldn't be able to do that

3089
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I know they got in trouble once because

3090
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
they had a music video

3091
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
that was an instructional guide to children

3092
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
about how to get rid of their fathers

3093
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
by framing them for pedophilia

3094
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
yeah it's called get a new daddy I know every word

3095
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
yeah that's it's great

3096
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
it's one of the best skits

3097
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
it got them in real trouble because people were like

3098
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
you can't you can't do this

3099
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
because what if kids actually take it seriously

3100
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
police would take the old one away in a catty

3101
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
you can get a new daddy

3102
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
get a new mommy, new brother, new sister

3103
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
a new house, a new mommy

3104
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
so at that point he'd ruined his entire family

3105
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
and it was getting adopted into a new one

3106
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
so is there any other

3107
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
who else would you say

3108
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
is a big influence on your comedic style

3109
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
or your approach to comedy

3110
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I don't know

3111
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
shaped the young mind of monkey

3112
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
everybody knows when I was 11

3113
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
or no even younger when I was in elementary

3114
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
school I loved bo bo bo bo bo

3115
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I mean that's a satire

3116
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
and that's what I'm kind of going for

3117
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
and I liked how random and funny it was

3118
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
and I

3119
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I get really meta a lot

3120
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
and that's a very meta show

3121
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Don Patch is actively trying to become

3122
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
the main character of the show all the time

3123
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
and he says it

3124
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
he's like I want to be the main character

3125
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
so yeah I guess

3126
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I'm influenced by bo bo bo bo

3127
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
and how meta it is and all that shit

3128
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
so

3129
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I know you're

3130
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
big into film

3131
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
yeah

3132
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
one of the things that I've always had

3133
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
when it comes to people doing criticism

3134
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
on a more serious level like with monkey's anime reviews

3135
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
it's obvious that they're all sort of

3136
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
irreverent and random and it doesn't matter

3137
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
how much you know and even on

3138
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
like my Japanese anime

3139
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
which is more analytical but it never tries to

3140
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
put the stuff into the context of anime

3141
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
it's always just the show

3142
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
you know and I'm

3143
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
wondering when you do film analysis

3144
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
or when you do film reviews with you and

3145
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
and E-Rage one of the

3146
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
difficulties I have with the show is that I have

3147
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
no context

3148
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
and you're putting these movies into the context of film

3149
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
like is this movie good or bad

3150
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
but I don't know what movies you think are good

3151
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
or bad or things like that

3152
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
and I'm wondering like

3153
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
for instance when I watch YMS

3154
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
do you watch

3155
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I love his top 10

3156
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
of the year lists because

3157
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
they give you such a clear picture

3158
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
of his taste that anything

3159
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
he says about a movie you can just think about

3160
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
his top 10s and you're like well of course

3161
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
you wouldn't like a superhero movie

3162
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
it's just completely outside your genre

3163
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
you know so

3164
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
if you started doing movie reviews

3165
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
like I'm curious like

3166
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
what context do you have for films and like

3167
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
how many have you seen how much do you

3168
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
how how integrated

3169
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
into the medium are you and would you present

3170
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
this in your future videos

3171
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
I think outside of just giving my

3172
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
hot take with E-Rage I wouldn't

3173
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
want to do film reviews because I mean

3174
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
I'm not that knowledgeable

3175
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
in the field and I don't really

3176
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
have an established criteria of what makes

3177
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
a good movie or a bad movie

3178
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
if I see a movie and I like it I'll say

3179
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
here's why and if you like these things

3180
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
you'll like it too so I wouldn't say

3181
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
it's a deep analysis

3182
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I understand why you're frustrated

3183
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
when you watch it

3184
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
it's not so much that I'm frustrated is that

3185
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
I know you seem to care more

3186
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
about film than other mediums

3187
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
but it's difficult to tell

3188
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
how much you care

3189
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
is it like me with anime

3190
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
everything and know everything or is it just

3191
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
like I like going to the movies every week

3192
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
you know it's probably more the second

3193
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
one I just I like going to the movies

3194
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
more than probably 90%

3195
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
of people is there any

3196
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
like artists like is there any stuff

you follow like that you

3199
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000

yeah like how like

3202
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000

3203
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
stuff if you had to put together a top

Spock's Beards your transatlantic

3211
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I spend most of my time with that

3212
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
podcast like the biggest

3213
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
problem the dick show

3214
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
the flop house that kind

3215
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
of stuff those are the main ones I've never heard the flop

3216
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
house it's the

3217
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
two of the three guys are writers for the

3218
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
daily show and so they're pretty funny

3219
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I mean most of the time and they

3220
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
they just watched a bad movie

3221
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
and they talk about it and

3222
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I wouldn't recommend it I just know that I

3223
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
like it okay that's

3224
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
interesting yeah well because I don't recommend

3225
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
everything that I like because I know why

3226
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I like it and I wouldn't expect other people

3227
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
to like it for the same reason

3228
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
so yeah we have the music the

3229
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
podcast yeah I like watching

3230
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
movies probably more than

3231
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
watching I guess like anime

3232
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
or TV like I'd rather just watch

3233
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
a movie but

3234
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
there are a lot of TV shows I'm really passionate

3235
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
about like I was huge into Breaking Bad

3236
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
now I'm big into Fargo and Better Call

3237
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Saul a survivor obviously

3238
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
all I do these days

3239
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
is pretty much watch old

3240
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
survivor seasons like just

3241
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
and binge them all day when I'm not working on stuff

3242
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
you begin to like big brother

3243
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna go audition

3244
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
for big brother in like a week

3245
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
so you know wish me luck

3246
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
if I if I disappear and stop making

3247
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
videos it's because I'm on TV

3248
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
go turn it on channel 8

3249
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I was really fascinated by your

3250
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
attachment to like reality TV

3251
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
which most people on the internet

3252
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
completely because people

3253
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
don't understand because

3254
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I think the problem is they

3255
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
think it's all on the same level of

3256
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
like the bachelor which I think

3257
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
most people watch because it's shit

3258
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
but survivor is it's

3259
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
like a completely different genre I wouldn't

3260
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
even lump it in with the reality

3261
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
TV like that they think it's all like your real

3262
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
housewives bullshit

3263
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
but it's totally not yeah

3264
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
survivor was kind of the original

3265
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
the original and the best kind of survivor

3266
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
is by far the best yeah like way

3267
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
more product I mean I've seen a lot of it because my mom

3268
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
is a huge survivor fan and like

3269
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
yeah the level of production

3270
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
is way above all the other ones but it's

3271
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
still not real

3272
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
like what do you mean by not

3273
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
real like a lot of scripted

3274
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
not scripted but there's

3275
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
a lot of staging there's a lot of like

3276
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
when you know behind the scenes the magic's

3277
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
kind of gone you know where it's like

3278
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
but it's still a competition at

3279
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
its heart like it's no different from a game of

3280
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
baseball there's a lot of things that are organized but

3281
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
it's still a game it's about the

3282
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I mean they put together a good narrative out of

3283
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
it you know sure it's not a lot of

3284
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
editing but it's just not real in the sense

3285
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
of like oh this is all like exactly what

3286
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
it's like for sure it's because there's like

3287
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
40 stage hands to

3288
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
immediately off camera at any given time

3289
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
the problem is they have to edit

3290
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
three days of footage into

3291
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
a 40 minute narrative so sometimes

3292
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I mean in the editing room you have no choice

3293
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
if you want to have a cohesive narrative you have to do

3294
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
things like that but at the end

3295
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
of the day it's still a real game that's being played

3296
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
and you're watching like

3297
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
these Don Brackens manipulate people

3298
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
and become the king of the island

3299
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
and it's really really interesting to me

3300
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
and I love watching the strategy talk

3301
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I don't care so much for the competitions

3302
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I don't care for like the petty fights over stupid

3303
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
shit I like to watch those

3304
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
strategic masterminds the puppet masters

3305
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
who rise and use their intellect

3306
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
to just rule over

3307
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
everybody else and win the game and that's

3308
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
why I love it it was a great

3309
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
quote from Dick Masterson

3310
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I don't know the I don't remember exactly what he said

3311
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
or how he phrased it but it was on a recent

3312
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
podcast where he was talking

3313
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
about people complaining that the show is like

3314
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
just you know using gossip

3315
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
and like trying to like oh it's all guys

3316
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
he's like oh I'm so sorry

3317
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
that I have an hour of narrative

3318
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
content with a gigantic

3319
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
viewership every week that like that we spun

3320
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
a human drama that's

3321
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
deeply interesting to lots of people

3322
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
that happens to be based in reality

3323
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
I was like yeah like that's why I'm watching

3324
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
the dick show is like I want

3325
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
the goss I want the drama

3326
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
because it is deeply interesting

3327
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
to see this like character portrait

3328
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
of Maddox as this this

3329
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
this man whose whole identity

3330
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
is shifting in the eyes of people

3331
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
to like recognize him in a different way

3332
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
it's so if this was all scripted it would be like

3333
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
oh whatever it's not a drama but the fact that

3334
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
it's actually happening in real life is what makes

3335
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
the whole drama of the biggest problem

3336
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
so great and and it would be

3337
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
so like people people

3338
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
are saying like oh you're you're just you know taking advantage

3339
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
of the goss but it's like you need

3340
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
someone who can spin that and make it interesting

3341
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
and Dick's willingness to

3342
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
withhold so much information

3343
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
and dish it out at just the right moments

3344
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
and to keep finding ways to spin it

3345
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
and to get more people involved like

3346
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
he's managing it perfectly and that's

3347
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
why it's such a good show it's great

3348
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
like if if this if the exact same thing

3349
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
happened with me I would have made

3350
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
a five-hour podcast explaining

3351
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
everything in the next day

3352
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
you know like I would have laid out every single

3353
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
thing that happened between me and Maddox

3354
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
and the show would have been over

3355
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
and dick you know looked at it and went this can

3356
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
be a story and and the fact that it keeps

3357
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
that Maddox keeps doing

3358
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
things to make it keep going is why

3359
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
and why it remains that interesting

3360
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
even on the first episode of the dick

3361
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
show like we're all anxiously waiting

3362
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
to hear what happened and he doesn't even

3363
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
like really mention it until the last ten minutes

3364
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
and like what the fuck like I was on the edge of my seat

3365
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
the whole time there it is like he knows how

3366
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
to how to hold a story

3367
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
yeah and

3368
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
yeah I know you you've said that you

3369
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
you've kind of fallen out with the dick

3370
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
show because it's just too much it's

3371
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
it used to be like an hour long

3372
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
and now it's like two and a half

3373
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
hours long the funny thing about it is that he's

3374
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
he was saying that like it's that long

3375
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
because of the fact that people are

3376
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
paying for it and he's like I want to give them

3377
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
a lot you know like people are paying all

3378
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
this money to get this this big chunk of show

3379
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
every week and like

3380
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
on some on one hand I appreciate

3381
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
the other hand if I am at all busy

3382
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
that week yeah I am not going to be able

3383
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
to make the like I mostly watch it

3384
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
in like seven-hour marathons when I find

3385
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
it like when I find the chance

3386
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
and I watch it I have the

3387
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
video so I'll sit back

3388
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
on the couch and just like drink beer

3389
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
and watch it all day when I finally

3390
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
catch up yeah that's the problem I'm into right now

3391
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
is that I'm like three episodes behind

3392
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
so that's it's going to take me

3393
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
seven hours to catch up and I was like

3394
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I don't know if it's worth it I don't know

3395
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
but I just I skipped two episodes

3396
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
and jumped into the mad cucks one because I saw

3397
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
he was on there and I think that's a great

3398
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
idea to have a straight up parody

3399
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
of Maddox there on the show

3400
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
and and they're gonna they did a

3401
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
recording of a full biggest problem

3402
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
biggest problem episode which I'm greatly

3403
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
looking forward to. I can't wait for that.

3404
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
April Fool's Day.

3405
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Yeah it's going to be great

3406
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
but um

3407
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
anyway I don't want to talk too much about

3408
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
other no other other creators that

3409
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
our audience might not follow but this is

3410
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
it's kind of integral to how we

3411
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
like why I wanted to contact you is that

3412
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
you knew these these guys

3413
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
you know stuff like that because like in the

3414
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
movie me and me and Jesse

3415
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
uh and who else

3416
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
me and Jesse in particular

3417
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
are really big fans of biggest problems so we've been

3418
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
following all this as it was happening

3419
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
and stuff and I think yeah we don't I was

3420
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
already in contact with you when the breakup

3421
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
happened I think definitely

3422
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
yeah and then and I kind of message you like

3423
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
uh monkey and you know like

3424
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
we weren't like close yet but I was like

3425
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I don't know how to reach out to this guy

3426
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
to tell him like what's going on do you see

3427
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
this happening you know yeah I noticed you

3428
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
like a couple comments sections and then I think

3429
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
you probably found out that I liked it

3430
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
either from the mumkeys anime reviews video

3431
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
or in one of my nuzlocke in my nuzlocke

3432
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I talked about it too but uh

3433
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
I think it's interesting you asked me

3434
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
like what are my the 10 most important things

3435
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
to me and it sort of fell apart because like I said

3436
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
me as a person I'm not interesting

3437
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
but then once we start talking about something

3438
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
that we both like then we pick up the

3439
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
conversation again well I think I mean if

3440
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
you I don't think I'm

3441
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
interesting but I have

3442
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
interesting ways of interpreting things and I just

3443
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
will always

3444
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
talk about them like like if

3445
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
my uh vlogs were just

3446
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
literally like digibro a day

3447
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
in the life it would be a story of me making

3448
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
the vlog I'm making which

3449
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
has been some of them

3450
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
uh that's kind of the joke

3451
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
in uh Insomnia Analysis 3 is that

3452
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I keep um I

3453
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
hit record and then I set up the shot

3454
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
so like every shot starts with

3455
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
me setting it up and like moving the camera

3456
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
like dragging the tripod across the room

3457
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
and stuff like very meta yeah

3458
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
and just because

3459
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
yeah like it's it's not

3460
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
that you are interesting it's that you present

3461
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
things in an interesting way which I

3462
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
feel like I need

3463
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
the cloak of monkey to do that because

3464
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I I think I took all

3465
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
the most interesting parts of my personality

3466
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
and then put them

3467
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
on like you know

3468
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
I increased them ten fold with the character

3469
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
so now when I go back to just like

3470
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
talking as me it's like oh this is

3471
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
a boring version of this well

3472
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
we've been doing a podcast for almost three hours

3473
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
yeah yeah it's been fairly entertaining

3474
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I would hope so I mean I think

3475
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
I think there's always like

3476
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
it's kind of the reason I don't ever want to

3477
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
lose the main channel of digibro like you were

3478
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
saying that I could probably subsist off after dark

3479
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
and that's true but to me

3480
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
um like

3481
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
the second I do that I'm just

3482
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I'm just some guy

3483
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
you know like it's the the

3484
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
partifice of that I am creating

3485
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
something that I consider to be

3486
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
bigger than myself

3487
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
is how I'm able to also

3488
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
have this off-air persona

3489
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
like if it was just

3490
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
digibro talks about being digibro it would

3491
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
quickly become an uraburo

3492
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
to start eating itself and I would

3493
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
it's like a celebrity that's only famous for being famous

3494
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
exactly like I want

3495
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
there to be that like the

3496
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
reason you're interested in me

3497
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
is because you got in through this

3498
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
other thing you know you had to come from somewhere

3499
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
and like yeah I mean after dark

3500
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
has a lot of interesting vlogs that on their own

3501
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
like you said are better than the main channel videos

3502
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
pretty damn good and are not necessarily

3503
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
uh

3504
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
like it's not all just me being

3505
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
me you know it's not all the digibro

3506
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
show um but like to me

3507
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
it's important that that exists but I think

3508
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
that that allows for this other

3509
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
life to happen that's why I'm interested in

3510
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
um you know countdown to suicide

3511
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
like those videos wouldn't be interesting on their own

3512
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
but they also

3513
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
are interesting like just because

3514
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
monkey exists and I want to know

3515
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
what that guy is about I'm like what

3516
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
what drives someone to make this video

3517
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
that I thought was hilarious like what is there

3518
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
to that guy you know

3519
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
and I think that inherently makes you

3520
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
interesting even though you wouldn't be

3521
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
if not for that content you know

3522
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
much like the

3523
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
the anime fights podcast thing

3524
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
uh I cannot watch

3525
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
the countdown to suicide videos

3526
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
and I don't watch them I record them upload

3527
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
them and then I try to pretend it never happened

3528
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
other than reading the comments I

3529
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
can't stand to hear those

3530
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
things I said about myself

3531
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
there's a lot of my uh after dark vlogs

3532
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
that I can't watch back like I will

3533
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
when I when I make it

3534
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
I'll watch it back like to check to see

3535
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
if it's like coherent and I'll enjoy

3536
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
it but then if I go back like a week later

3537
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
it's just because the

3538
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
because it's not written all the phrasing

3539
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
is just so bad

3540
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
like it's all it's every point I make

3541
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
is something that the more I think about it

3542
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
I realize how I could have said it better

3543
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
you know and then you listen back and it's just like

3544
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
ugh this

3545
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
this is why no one understands you

3546
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
because you phrase everything so fucking incoherently

3547
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
um and of course

3548
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
you know I have to like watch myself be drunk

3549
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
and like walk around the room screaming

3550
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
now that's fun that's fun

3551
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I'll watch any video of me being drunk

3552
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I think it's always a blast

3553
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
and at the god of war rant where I just scream

3554
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
for 30 minutes

3555
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
that's a little difficult to get

3556
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
to again

3557
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
now that's the kind of video I would watch again

3558
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
for sure the ones where I get like super

3559
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
serious and talk about

3560
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
I've been depressed

3561
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
for five years I don't want to hear it

3562
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
I don't want to hear it you definitely can't sit through

3563
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
the decompression chambers oh yeah I imagine

3564
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
but particularly

3565
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
the last one where it was the one that

3566
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
was like the

3567
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
that's a good one when you talk shit about yourself

3568
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
but also talk highly of yourself

3569
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
at the same time that one was so hard

3570
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
to both finish and

3571
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
get through because I had listened to it back

3572
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
like because I was so unsure of it

3573
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
I kept listening back to the segments

3574
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
and every time I would just be like

3575
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
ugh

3576
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I can't believe I'm releasing this

3577
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
I encouraged you to release that a lot because I wanted

3578
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
to hear it and I mean a lot

3579
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
of people I think

3580
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
ultimately enjoyed it and got something out of it

3581
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
but like there was not never a point

3582
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
that I didn't regret it like I released it

3583
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
and most of like I didn't want to

3584
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
hear people's reactions to it and like

3585
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
every reaction I heard I was like yeah I knew this

3586
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
was coming I knew that was coming

3587
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
this is not I don't want

3588
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
this to exist I don't want to do this again

3589
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
let's not have it be this way

3590
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
is that why that show is cancelled

3591
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
partly I mean that

3592
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
and I just got busy after that and

3593
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
like yeah

3594
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I lost interest in the format

3595
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
you know like I'd rather just

3596
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
I've done a few things that are similar

3597
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
to decompression chambers on my reddit

3598
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
it's just a matter of there's a lot of stuff

3599
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
that I want to exist now that I don't want

3600
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
to be public you know have you ever had

3601
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
like that that's I mean you

3602
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
you separate your channel so surely on some level

3603
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
like countdown to suicide is

3604
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
meant to be hidden

3605
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
like I mean I it's

3606
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
in every single description

3607
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
of my videos when you list all my channels

3608
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
it's like I mean my reddit is always listed

3609
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
too but I'm not like out

3610
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
like if I posted something there it's because

3611
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
I want I want to

3612
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
hear what like my closest fans have to

3613
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
say but I don't necessarily

3614
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
want everyone's reaction

3615
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
to it like I don't want this to be

3616
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
like not that I'm hiding it from

3617
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
everybody but that it's not meant

3618
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
to be seen by a wide audience

3619
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
like like my book like that

3620
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
book was six years old great book

3621
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
and written you know like it was written by a

3622
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
different me and if I release that on

3623
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
after dark I just don't want

3624
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
to have to read people like criticizing

3625
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
the book as if I just wrote it you know

3626
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
it's like no this is an ancient piece of work

3627
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
that barely is related to me anymore

3628
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I just wanted it to exist out there

3629
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
and as long as a few people can get something

3630
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
out of it that's fine you know like

3631
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
so do you do you think that you

3632
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
have any kind of inclination to like

3633
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
release stuff that is deliberately

3634
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
not for the public

3635
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
not really I think

3636
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
if if for some bizarre reason

3637
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
monkeys count down to suicide blew up

3638
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
and it had like half a million subs

3639
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
and it was my biggest channel I'd be like

3640
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
okay that's fine I guess people like this

3641
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
I'd be I'd accept that

3642
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I think any of us would accept that

3643
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
that's cool like I wasn't trying to hide this

3644
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I don't care if people see it I mean

3645
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I don't try to make

3646
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
things that I don't want like thousands of

3647
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
people to see I mean you seem to be

3648
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
when you were you were a little upset

3649
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
when all the normies came to the channel after

3650
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
I shouted it out on the PC

3651
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
that's mostly a meme

3652
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
you know normies get the fuck out

3653
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
yeah

3654
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
your fans are always

3655
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
mad when you get more

3656
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
yeah and they're not being sarcastic most

3657
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
of them I think they actually want the normies

3658
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
to get the fuck out but it's not like

3659
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I'm gonna change my content style

3660
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
because there's more people watching it

3661
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
like they can just choose that it's too edgy

3662
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
for them and they can leave yeah that's the natural

3663
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
flow of things

3664
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
um

3665
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
alright well I've run through

3666
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
most of the questions I had thought of

3667
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
but that was a good 45 minutes

3668
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
we still need another 15 minutes of content

3669
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
does that include

3670
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
all the times we weren't recording

3671
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
because we were in the bathroom and stuff

3672
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
yeah it was only like 10 minutes that we were short on

3673
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
well we don't have to go to 3 hours

3674
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
I mean it's no big deal to me

3675
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
was there anything else you'd want

3676
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
people to understand about you or anything

3677
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
anything else you would say

3678
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
about your content where it's going

3679
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
why it exists

3680
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
so I could

3681
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
I could talk

3682
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
I guess about some of my ideas for

3683
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
the future things on Mumkey Jones

3684
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
because some people seem a little

3685
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
cautious about me saying

3686
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Mumkey's anime review is ending

3687
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
they're like oh god no

3688
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I have to un-pledge my Patreon

3689
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
he's gonna stop American videos

3690
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
it's not true at all

3691
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
I still want to make the same exact thing

3692
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
only just drop the joke about anime

3693
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
and drop all the Uncle Alex jokes

3694
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
it really has been fleshed out

3695
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
as much as I think it can be

3696
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
so I'm ready to get away from that

3697
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
so some ideas I have

3698
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I said the top 10

3699
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
isms thing

3700
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
I want to do some serious videos

3701
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
like my top 5 videos

3702
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
that are my favorite on YouTube

3703
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
and then other things I want to do

3704
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
I think it'd be fun

3705
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
every now and then did do another

3706
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
anime review

3707
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
of like an anime but I just don't call it that

3708
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
I would just it'd be like

3709
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
you know

3710
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
a soul leader and then instead of Mumkey's

3711
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
anime reviews it would say Mumkey Jones

3712
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
I think that should be like

3713
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
the new subtitle and I also

3714
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
want to do a series called

3715
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Mumkey 101 where the

3716
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
title of the video is like a big question

3717
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
and then I explore the question

3718
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
and try to answer it and some examples

3719
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I have are can women

3720
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
be forever alone

3721
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
and I would go through

3722
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
edits of like forever alone women

3723
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
versus you posted some screenshots

3724
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
for that which were hilarious

3725
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
because they were so fucking

3726
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
like I'm going to compare

3727
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
the difference between what the forever

3728
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
alone women sub is

3729
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
and what the normal forever alone

3730
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
one is and then like

3731
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
compare that to the incels who are

3732
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
actually forever alone

3733
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
so just exploring questions like that and having fun

3734
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
another one I have which

3735
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
you and me did

3736
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
we've recorded a podcast last night

3737
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
I don't know if that'll be out yet or when it's coming out

3738
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
I don't know

3739
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
it's going on my channel it probably won't be out until like

3740
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
the end of March

3741
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
but another question I want to try to answer

3742
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
is do Muslims deserve rights

3743
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
which is

3744
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
it seems like a joke question but then when you

3745
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
get into the stick of it

3746
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
yeah there's a lot to be said on the subject

3747
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
obviously they deserve human rights

3748
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
but then when you get down to the nitty gritty of

3749
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
you find out that subways

3750
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
some of them are banning all pork products

3751
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
now to adhere to their

3752
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Muslim customers like

3753
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
is that a right that they deserve because of their imaginary

3754
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
friend I think not

3755
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
well I mean if it's good for business for

3756
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Subway to do it then of course they should do it

3757
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
yeah but then you're like the poor white guy who lives

3758
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
in the newly enriched community

3759
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
who can no longer get bacon on his sub

3760
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
like is that fair for him

3761
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
just because of this imaginary friend bullshit

3762
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
go to another restaurant

3763
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
yeah well whatever

3764
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
so I'm gonna do some research on that

3765
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
and see how many

3766
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
communities are being culturally enriched

3767
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
and all the rights

3768
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
that are being changed

3769
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
so more controversial

3770
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
stuff that will make me lose thousands of subs

3771
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
every upload well I love that you're

3772
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
taking that even-handed

3773
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
approach of like everyone gets

3774
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
shit on everybody no one's safe

3775
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
even me especially me the Christians

3776
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
aren't safe the Muslims aren't safe the Jews

3777
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
aren't safe and now the atheists aren't safe

3778
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
I'm coming I'm gonna go to the atheism

3779
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
plus subreddit and just oh you all

3780
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
think you know so much

3781
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
you just think

3782
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
no proof that God

3783
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
doesn't exist and yet you're

3784
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
so convinced

3785
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
just have fun with it

3786
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
yeah and pick on some

3787
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
some some like edgy teen atheism

3788
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
obviously lots of fedora jokes

3789
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
just easy stuff yet

3790
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I think it's it's very important

3791
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
that I think the problem with comedy

3792
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
these days is that everybody

3793
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
is getting way too political with it

3794
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
but they're choosing a side

3795
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I think if you're gonna get political with it

3796
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
attack everybody don't just

3797
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
choose one side I mean that's what's so great

3798
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
about George Carlin is that his politics

3799
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
were just like I

3800
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
fuck everybody all of you are wrong about

3801
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
everything you know I'm the only one who

3802
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
makes any sense in this world

3803
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
you know which is why

3804
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
if Jesse

3805
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I always compare to Carlin and like everybody

3806
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
compares Louis C.K. to Carlin but

3807
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
no fuck Louis C.K.

3808
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
I think he used to be but not anymore

3809
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
just going just that

3810
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
yeah the attitude of like

3811
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
you've all wronged me

3812
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
like whatever system

3813
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
you've all created I'm not happy

3814
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
and it's because I'm in this system and you're all

3815
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
a part of this system so you have wronged me

3816
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
you know

3817
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
it's sort of the mentality

3818
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
it's important to be even handed with your hatred

3819
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
because it's not

3820
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
discrimination if you discriminate against every

3821
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
group equally it just

3822
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
it might seem like I attack

3823
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
feminists and like Muslims and stuff

3824
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
more often but it's just because they have more

3825
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
out there to make fun of and because they're

3826
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
the ones who are being more defended now

3827
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
yeah and they're the ones who are causing

3828
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
the most problems in my mind

3829
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
I mean it's

3830
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
it's like

3831
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
you know I feel like

3832
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
you're trying to keep the scales from getting

3833
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
tipped like

3834
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
when like it's getting

3835
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
harder and harder to make fun of Muslims

3836
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
right now

3837
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
even though it should be they should be made fun

3838
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
of just as much as Christians and anybody else

3839
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
it should all be equal and so the harder

3840
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
it gets to make fun of them the more you

3841
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
have to kind of push back and go no it's still

3842
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
okay

3843
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I want my bacon out of the subway

3844
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
everybody still deserves this

3845
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
I have to pee again

3846
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000

I really want like a vegetable

3876

if we're gonna get dinner we should do it way before

3877
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
yeah we should do it immediately after

3878
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
this podcast before we start drinking

3879
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000

I'll leave us out

3886
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
on a big question

3887
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
okay let's say

3888
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
is there like a question that you ask everybody in every interview

3889
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
no there's nothing like that

3890
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
let's say that tomorrow

3891
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
um

3892
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
um monkey jones one of your videos

3893
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
goes viral again

3894
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
do I get to pick which one?

3895
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
sure

3896
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
that's top 10 suicide methods

3897
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
I know that's your favorite

3898
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
yeah let's go with that one that's fine

3899
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
this goes viral

3900
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
spikes up to 50,000

3901
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
subscribe

3902
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
because finally it's a video that everyone understood

3903
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
they checked out the rest of your channel

3904
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
they realized it was more of the same

3905
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
which has been happening on a micro level

3906
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
like the last week

3907
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
I think mostly because of you

3908
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
because I've got an influx of comments on every

3909
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
video now instead of just like the most recent one

3910
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
and they're all saying whoa these videos are great

3911
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
dude this whole channel's gold

3912
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
I'm like yeah you're right

3913
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
you're fucking right they are

3914
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
we did it

3915
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
so let's say you get

3916
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
you're suddenly 50,000 subs

3917
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
hell yeah

3918
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
patreon jumps up

3919
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
you're making a thousand dollars a month

3920
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
fuck

3921
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
my goal on patreon says a thousand dollars

3922
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
this is my full time job

3923
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
so we'll see if that happens

3924
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
so you reach a thousand dollars a month

3925
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
you get 50,000 subs

3926
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
it looks like things are going to keep growing

3927
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
it's going to just do the same thing I'm doing now

3928
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
I don't know how I would switch it up

3929
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
I mean if they subscribe because I like

3930
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
what I'm doing so far so I just

3931
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
keep doing it I guess

3932
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
do you think you would

3933
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
let's expand it out

3934
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
let's say monkey

3935
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
this happens you live off of monkey jones for a little while

3936
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
you're goddamn right

3937
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
monkey explodes again

3938
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
now you're making 10,000 dollars a month

3939
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
fuck

3940
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
what do monkey do

3941
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
I don't know what are you expecting

3942
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
what do you do if you have a ton of expendable income

3943
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
and all the time in the world to spend it

3944
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
cause like for me so much of what

3945
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
I've been doing is on the basis

3946
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
of the fact that I can make

3947
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
if it

3948
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
really came down to it I could make

3949
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
two videos in a month and that's enough

3950
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
if I'm just worried about sustaining myself

3951
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
like no advancement

3952
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
or anything like just paying the rent

3953
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
and eating

3954
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
you know

3955
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
you could even make one video a month

3956
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
if Davoo didn't edit it definitely

3957
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
one

3958
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
so for the rest of the month I can do whatever the fuck I want

3959
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
so if monkey jones

3960
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
is on a timetable now

3961
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
where you don't have to have a video every week

3962
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
trying to grow the channel

3963
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
because you're already grown

3964
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
and you're making a guaranteed amount of month

3965
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
that is in excess of how much you need

3966
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
do you keep

3967
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
doing weekly videos all the time

3968
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
keeping to the same schedule

3969
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
or do you try to expand

3970
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
or do you try to do something different from the main channel videos

3971
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
where do you put this extra money you've made

3972
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
I think I continue

3973
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
to do the

3974
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
a video weekly or bi-weekly as my job

3975
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
but then now that this dream is accomplished

3976
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
I go back to the original dream

3977
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
that we all had back in the day

3978
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
you had it too of being a writer

3979
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
cause at the end of the day

3980
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
in my mind that's the high arch

3981
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
that's what I want to do

3982
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
because you've written a book

3983
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
I believe this book could be it

3984
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
if I just get that lucky break

3985
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
of somebody in the industry

3986
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
who wants to give it a chance

3987
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
which has not happened yet

3988
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
and I'm losing faith

3989
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
if you had the time

3990
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
would you just write another

3991
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
if you were making enough money off your channel

3992
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
that you knew you didn't need

3993
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
any regular job anytime soon

3994
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
are you just going to go full in on writing the book

3995
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
when you're not doing the channel

3996
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
what's the fucking book

3997
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
yeah well I think that's a great answer

3998
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
cause it's something that

3999
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
I think about a lot because of the fact

4000
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
I guess nobody thinks about this until they've made it

4001
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
but I got to that point

4002
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
in November

4003
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
where I said holy shit

4004
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
as long as I write four scripts at the start of the month

4005
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
and give them all to DeVoo

4006
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
I can do whatever I want for the rest of the month

4007
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I can make any dream project I've dreamed of

4008
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
when's that book coming did you

4009
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
yeah good question

4010
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
well a little thing

4011
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
happened where January

4012
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
rolled around and I wrote out this huge schedule

4013
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
of all the videos I was going to make

4014
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
that were going to come out at certain dates

4015
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
and dates in January and I was going to expand

4016
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
the channel and blow it up

4017
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
and then it would leave me with all this free time

4018
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
to work on a book

4019
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
and then Radcon 2 happened

4020
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
all of it went out the window

4021
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
and then I broke you as a human being

4022
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
yeah I've been depressed

4023
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
so

4024
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
that's Radcon for you

4025
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
yeah

4026
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
it wasn't so much Radcon

4027
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
well it was Radcon's fault

4028
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
nevermind

4029
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
what am I trying to defend you

4030
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
I don't know those Radcon boys

4031
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
they sure do make me depressed too

4032
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I guess that's what I meant to say

4033
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
it's not any of their fault

4034
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
it's the event itself and the time that it took out of my life

4035
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
let's just say it was Ben's fault

4036
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
yeah why not

4037
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
I want to end this interview by saying fuck Ben

4038
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
let's wrap it up so I can say fuck Ben

4039
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
alright um

4040
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000

like we have recorded

4044
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
probably 30

4045
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
shitposts to be released one a day

4046
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000

4047
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
for the month of April probably

4048
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
as well as

4049
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
a Let's Play

4050
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
that will be on your Let's Play channel

4051
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Monkey's

4052
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Gaming Expedition

4053
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
we actually did a full Nuzlocke

4054
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
last night we recorded a full Nuzlocke

4055
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
we stayed up all night

4056
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
drinking beer and recording

4057
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
a full Nuzlocke

4058
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
at hyper speed

4059
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
and we did the whole thing

4060
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
one of the most impressive things I've ever seen in my life

4061
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
I think so and with Victor

4062
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
you and I also did some

4063
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
I guess Vincent I should say we did some Let's Plays too

4064
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
we recorded like three episodes of Let's Play stuff

4065
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
that will be on Digi Bros

4066
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
yeah that will be on Digi Bros

4067
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
and me and Monkey are going to start doing

4068
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
podcasts together that's right I hope you guys like it

4069
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
we didn't do as much prep as we should have

4070
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
but I think it's a good pilot episode

4071
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
yeah and if it's successful

4072
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
maybe it'll

4073
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
I would really love it if we just became a podcast

4074
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
in many ways I would rather do

4075
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
podcasts than anything

4076
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
I'm doing right now

4077
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
one hour comedy podcast a week

4078
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
sounds like the dream

4079
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
I'm so jealous of Dick

4080
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
is it what we should all aspire to be

4081
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
he has a successful book

4082
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
and this podcast are you kidding me

4083
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
I was having

4084
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
I was talking to Jesse about this the other day

4085
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
what I admire the most about Dick is that he's

4086
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
proven that you can be hugely

4087
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
successful on the internet without

4088
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
participating in the internet

4089
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
which is what I think me and Jesse both dream of

4090
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
is escaping the internet

4091
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
a lot of people don't understand that because a lot of people live on the

4092
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
like are younger than us and grew up with the internet

4093
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
always being there I mean that was kind of me

4094
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
and to me growing up

4095
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
the internet was always shunned

4096
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
as a place for freaks and weirdos

4097
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
I was on it that's why I wanted to go on it

4098
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
I've been on since 2001

4099
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
but I've always seen it as

4100
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
this is not what you're supposed to be doing

4101
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
supposed to be out there living life

4102
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
old people are fucking dumb

4103
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
but it's ingrained in your mind

4104
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
and I've got all these memories of having friends

4105
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
having fun

4106
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
what was it like

4107
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
my best friend deleted my viral video

4108
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
yeah

4109
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
I don't know what friends are

4110
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
I would have killed him for that

4111
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
I would literally have fucking killed him

4112
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
one day my revenge will be complete

4113
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
when I look at Dick I'm like this is a dude

4114
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
who only interacts with the internet

4115
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
as much as he wants to

4116
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
and otherwise is able to be a man

4117
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
about town and have real relationships

4118
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
he's like the CEO of a company

4119
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
it doesn't even need any of the money

4120
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
does not need any of the dick show's money

4121
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
puts it all back into the dick show

4122
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
other than buying his house

4123
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
which is obviously a huge benefit

4124
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
that's very important for the show

4125
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
you can't have those goddamn apartment neighbors

4126
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
so

4127
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
he's

4128
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
definitely living the dream of

4129
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
when I look at him I think

4130
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
man I need to get out of here because

4131
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
it's not a matter that I'm not successful enough

4132
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
to have what Dick has

4133
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
I'm not living my life right

4134
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
I think we should all aspire to be dicknested

4135
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
in every different way

4136
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
he's the perfect man

4137
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
he's my idol, he's my hero

4138
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
back around episode 60

4139
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
of Biggest Problem

4140
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
I got on the Biggest Problem subreddit

4141
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
and I posted like a shower thought

4142
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
I said

4143
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
childhood is thinking Maddox is the genius

4144
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
but adulthood is realizing it's dick

4145
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
and everybody down voted me

4146
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
they thought I was wrong

4147
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
because that was back when everybody still praised Maddox

4148
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
and Dick was like just a derpy co-host

4149
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
that was the

4150
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
the parabolic arc that me and Jesse

4151
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
both followed watching the Biggest Problem

4152
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
is that in the beginning

4153
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Dick seems like the asshole because

4154
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
he was playing up the comedy and the character

4155
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
but then once, because Maddox took the arguing

4156
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
so seriously

4157
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
then Dick started taking the argument more seriously

4158
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
that's when you realize, wait a minute, Dick's the only one

4159
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
who actually makes any sense

4160
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Dick's the smarter one, he's like a normal dude

4161
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
and by the time you get past episode 50

4162
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
consistently Dick is way

4163
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
blowing Maddox the fuck out

4164
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
oh my god, Dick's my hero

4165
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
I think that's a huge reason why

4166
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Maddox wanted Dick off the show

4167
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
because he was upstaging him so much

4168
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
towards the end

4169
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Dick said that he was saying

4170
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
I feel like it's gonna get this way for Rucka

4171
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
he's probably in the mind state I was towards the end of the show

4172
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
which is that I have to have this show

4173
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
end before it becomes apparent that this is just

4174
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
me beating up on an autistic guy

4175
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
that's all Rucka is really doing

4176
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
he was really concerned

4177
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
that's what it was gonna turn into

4178
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
that's exactly what it was

4179
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
well everybody that's been

4180
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
three hours of

4181
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
man I hope you made it through all of that shit

4182
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
of Mumkey's

4183
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
interview

4184
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
hopefully this will mean

4185
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
the interview series is coming back

4186
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
I still have never interviewed Nate

4187
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
you haven't done Ben have you

4188
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
I did Ben, Ben was the first one

4189
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
yeah cause Patreon was in the title

4190
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
we did Ben, we did Ben, DeVoo

4191
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Jesse, Munchy

4192
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
and

4193
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
who was the other one

4194
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
Psy

4195
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
no I haven't done you

4196
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
so it's six out of ten I haven't done Mage, Tom,

4197
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Nate or

4198
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
King Critic I did Hippo

4199
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
and I haven't done

4200
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
who's missing from that King Critic

4201
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
David Clegg

4202
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
who the fuck am I missing

4203
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
I haven't done Nate, Tom,

4204
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Mage

4205
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
maybe I've done six

4206
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
oh yeah myself that's number ten

4207
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
I mean

4208
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
someone should interview me

4209
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
now you should do a three hour interview with yourself

4210
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
that's just did you wrap the dark

4211
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
just upload like a three hour compilation

4212
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
of those so hopefully we'll get

4213
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
to the last three guys

4214
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
and girl

4215
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
two guys and a girl, poor Mage

4216
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
thanks again for listening everybody

4217
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
and I'll see you in the next one

4218
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000

4219
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
bye
