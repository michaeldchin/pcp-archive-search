00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're just starting. We're just gonna fucking go.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The only podcast you ever need. This is the only one you need to listen to. All the rest, they're just suggestions. This is the one you listen to on repeat from now until the end of time. It's great.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The only mandatory podcast.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Whoa, who's that? Is that Ben Saint?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's me. It's Ben Saint. I'm alive. I survived another week.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The only podcast that has lamp oil, rope, bombs, if you want them, you have to listen to the entire thing.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
True.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And who's that? Who's that piping in from the back?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's me, Morshu.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Whomps?

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Morshu from The Legend of Zelda CD-i, the guy who says lamp oil, rope, bombs, you want it?

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I didn't know we had a guest on today's episode.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, but put Eleazar, put the Morshu in the corner. He's the new PCP guy with his old-

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh fuck.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
After all that work to make a legally distinct PCP guy.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There is no PCP guy. We changed the form out. It's Tombstones now. We're Tombstones. Put them on a Tombstone.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Where's the PCP guy Tombstone? Is he dead? Is he at large?

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
When you come into the graveyard, there's an archway and it's like a wrought iron arch.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It says procrastinator's graveyard over and in the middle there's a little engraving.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There's an engraving and it's his face. That's him. That's where he's at. He's overseeing the afterlife.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There's all this description. Sounds like how you would play a text-based game. I only do graphics, graphics only. I don't read, so...

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I play Noida. That has pixels.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It does. Moving up in the world.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've become addicted to the feeling of getting a really fast wand online, of getting castaway down to zero and just getting a chainsaw.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And just piss bullets everywhere. I need it. I need that thrill.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And if I start a run and I don't find chainsaws, I'm like, oh god, I'm so weak.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I feel weak right now because I'm not blasting damage at beasts.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I want to blast both of you. I just want to tear you apart.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Is that why Twitter's been a war zone for the last 10 days? You've just been blasting everybody?

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I've just put my chainsaw on my spark bolt and my spitter bolt and I just...

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No, it's not my fault. I didn't do anything. I've done nothing wrong. I apologize for nothing. Everyone else is wrong.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I'm not even kidding. I'm serious.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I just sit here. I just respond to life as it comes at me in the only reasonable way.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ben just sits there, buys keyboard with his couple of gallons of gasoline

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and every time he sees an opportunity, just pours a little bit on something.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I disagree with this characterization. No, I'm innocent. I'm innocent of everything.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay, good.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, everyone...

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've been looking at all that stuff and I'm like, whatever.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Personally, I'm too physically deteriorated to care about whatever is happening.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
God, I wish I were that physically deteriorated.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I've been this last week ravaged in a non-sexual way, which is the worst kind of way.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ravaged in a digital way, with a bout of disease of some kind.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's not a disease, really. It's just like I'm stupid.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Tell me more. Tell me about your disease.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's called not eating or drinking properly and it's destroyed me.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, I mean, ultimately, I think that was what it was, because I don't know.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm living in a new place, right?

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I said I was living in a new place and I'm like, okay, I'm cooking food for myself.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can cook food, that's fine.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think it's just something about the dryness in the room or something that I'm not used to.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And I got really dehydrated and I didn't notice, because I don't notice things.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So I got so dehydrated and it wasn't even warm, so I was not even thinking about that being a thing.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And then I started vomiting and it was the worst.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Every morning was agony, getting through the day.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It was all I could do to survive.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I was just like, and all of this time, stuff was happening on Twitter.

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm like, you know, I could think.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Nothing.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But I don't have the energy to do that.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I just need to live right now.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I just want to try. Nothing actually happens on Twitter.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Things happen off of Twitter and then people go to Twitter to bitch at me about things that happened elsewhere.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And then I spend the rest of the day replying to idiots who don't see that I'm the only rational actor.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's what's going on.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't get it twisted, but okay.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Excuse me.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sure, whatever.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, whatever.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's just a bunch of something.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is an opinion I could have on it.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't really know what it would be.

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I just want to live.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I just want to stop feeling pain.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I feel a little better today.

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
God, it sucks.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't understand.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When a physical ailment gets here, there's nothing else matters.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't understand.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're saying you were simply dehydrated.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Dude, dehydration will fuck with you.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, no, no.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's dehydrated.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, it got to a point where, you know, that like...

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Does dehydration make you throw up?

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It makes...

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, I don't know.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All right.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Here's what I assume was the series of events.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It was dehydration which caused constipation,

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
which made it difficult to eat things

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and to drink things without like,

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
like eventually throwing up.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm like, okay, I can't keep things down,

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but I need to ingest and I can't.

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I had to go to the hospital to get like water pumped into my veins.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Did they intubate you?

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They intubated you.

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They put a IV or whatever into my vein

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and I almost fainted because I'm scared of the blood

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and the blood came out of me and I was like,

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
oh, no, no, no, I need to lie down.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No, no, no, I need that.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Put it back in, please.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, sure.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah, it was the scariest thing of all time,

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
getting treated at a hospital.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I couldn't, you know,

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
dissuade people from going to hospital more

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
than the scariest of it all.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Definitely don't go to the hospital.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is a PCP official advice.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't go to the shoplift and don't go to the doctor.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Just, just die.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And don't go to college.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Disavow.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But the rest I disavow.

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's funny.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah, it was fine.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I mean, it wasn't fine, but it's finer than it was.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I now know that I'm stupid and I should drink more

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and that I've got to eat proper meals

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
even when I feel sick because if you don't eat,

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
you don't have fuel, you can't fight anything

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
when you don't have fuel, it just makes everything worse.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It gets you to a point where you can't recover naturally.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You know?

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't, I still don't quite, but you didn't,

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you didn't need to eat.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You didn't need fuel.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It was confusing.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You didn't need fuel to fight off a disease.

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You just needed to drink fucking water.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's all you needed.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No, it's confusing because like,

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I feel like I also have a cold and it's not corona

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
because we have COVID tests and I took one just in case.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't have COVID, but like,

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I feel like I've had a cold

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and this, it's always multiple things.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's never just, oh, you have this one symptom.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This means you have this one ailment

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and this is this one solution.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's always like, I do the one solution

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and it turns out I have another thing

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
that's also like, that's not the solution.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So I should like do two solutions to these things,

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
but they might contradict.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't know.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I hate medicals.

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I hate science.

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Fucking doctors.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
They're so smart.

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You should have tried to,

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you should have prayed the dehydration away instead.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I should have.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Good job.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Thanks.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You wouldn't have to go to the hospital then, huh?

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You didn't even think about that one?

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Maybe if I just like sliced open all of my limbs

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and drank the blood,

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that would cure my dehydration because it would be liquid.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Because then you'd have less blood that needs water,

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
but also your blood would be the water.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just recycle.

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's recycling.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's like green energy basically.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You should drink your pee too.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Disappear.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Disappear.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The drinking pee is like something I do on the rig anyway.

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't shoplift.

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's like a normal day to day.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't go to the doctor.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't go to the hospital.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't go to college and drink your pee.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why would you drink your pee

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
if you could just shoplift a drink by your own code?

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why would you...

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I mean, well...

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Fuck.

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Disappear.

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Disappear.

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No, no.

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Eleazar, cut this whole thing.

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Cut the entire episode out.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We're starting over.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Start over, please.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Cut my life.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Do pieces.

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No, no, no.

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's not the right song.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The song for this situation is clearly

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
get down with the sickness.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's the entire summary of what happened.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There's this small moments of early morning

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
where I'm feeling weak

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and I need to make myself breakfast or whatever

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
so that I have energy.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But I'm like, there's no way out of this.

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This is the end.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm hollowing in real time and I'm like,

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
you know what would be nice right now?

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's like a bottom of a muddy ditch

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and I could just throw myself into it

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and fade away.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Nobody would ever find me.

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I could just like, that's just what I need right now.

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You ever feel like that?

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You ever feel like just crawling into a space and dying?

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't know what not feeling like that is like anymore.

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's been too long.

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh, my man.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You know, when you play Dark Souls

221
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and you go and the Skeleton Men,

222
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
like right outside Firelitron.

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I feel like a Skeleton Man.

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's like when you're playing Noida

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and you don't have any chainsaws

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and your wand is just doing a little pew-pew-pew

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and you're like, this fucking sucks.

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I just want to kill everything.

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You know, it's more like when you're playing Minesweeper

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and you lapse in judgment for one second,

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
you click on mine,

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
because you just didn't count.

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Three, you counted two and you were an idiot.

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You were right at the end of an evil-sized Minesweeper thing.

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You don't have to explain Minesweeper to me.

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm an expert now.

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Have you been playing it?

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know anything about it.

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm an idiot.

240
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Simple, you click on the squares

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and then you get frustrated.

242
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

243
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's it.

244
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You missed the bonus episode where I became a Minesweeper

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and Picross Master.

246
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I was tutored.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I was tutored in the ways, in the mystic arts.

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Patreon.com

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
slash The Procrastinators.

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
$5 gets your access to all our bonus episodes,

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
including that one.

252
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What a time to be alive.

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What a time for the PCP.

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I said it before the episode.

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll say it again.

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We have entered the funniest era of the show,

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
in my opinion,

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and I cannot be dissuaded from this opinion.

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's all coming up roses.

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Great, it's looking up from here.

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know.

262
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What's the argument here?

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Where's the evidence to this claim?

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The jokes.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't see it.

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Come on, Ben.

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Where's the funny?

268
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Come with the funny.

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's not like ha ha funny.

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's funny like a...

271
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Is it sad funny, like pathetic funny?

272
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's funny like when you're at a funeral

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and you can't help laughing for some reason.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's funny like it's like rain on my wedding day.

275
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's ironic.

276
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a free ride that you just couldn't pay.

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's exactly what I'm saying.

278
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm on your wavelength.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's the new wave.

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's what it's going to be like from now on.

281
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Trixie quit.

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Trixie quit is what I'm saying.

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And I think it's really funny.

284
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't know if I'd say it's funny.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think it's funny.

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, I think it's unfortunate.

287
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I am glad.

288
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll just say it.

289
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll just say it.

290
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm glad.

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Good.

292
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's good.

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No, no, no apologies.

294
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

295
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's...

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't care if she's mad at me.

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
She should be.

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No way.

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's not what I meant to say.

300
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I mean, she...

301
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I should be mad, but I'm not.

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Fucker.

303
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Fucker is what I'm saying.

304
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
She's weird.

305
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
She's weird and I don't want to work with her.

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And it's good.

307
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
She...

308
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
She can't fucking...

309
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
She can't hang.

310
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
She can't hang, so she's gone.

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And that's what's up.

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Ben, this is when I was talking about the gas

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and the pouring the gas.

314
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is what I was talking about.

315
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No, no.

316
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This is...

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I said...

318
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
People ask like,

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
are you gonna talk about this on the podcast?

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What am I gonna not mention it?

321
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I must.

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I must acknowledge.

323
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We must acknowledge the facts of the universe

324
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
that we now inhabit.

325
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Of the dark timeline that we find ourselves in.

326
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't know.

327
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I mean, I don't feel like celebrating it necessarily.

328
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I wouldn't mind if Trixie felt like coming back.

329
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Like, I would be okay with her being on the show again.

330
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'd rather she didn't, but whatever.

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, you...

332
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Everyone's entitled to their opinions, I suppose.

333
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know what caused this schism all of a sudden.

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't know how everyone became enemies.

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm very confused.

336
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Well, you...

337
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, you saw...

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I mean, Alex, you saw the conversation we were having.

339
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I saw...

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And you saw...

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And you saw the tweet she made immediately afterwards.

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So, you've got all the pieces.

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I guess.

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I just don't understand how, like,

345
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
eight years of knowing someone can explode in a fireball

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
of, like, Radcon reward fallout.

347
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's very strange.

348
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You know, it's not...

349
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't know if that's entirely it.

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Her tweet made it sound like it was all about that,

351
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but it really wasn't.

352
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Maybe I don't know what tweet you're talking about then,

353
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
because I'm not sure...

354
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The one where she said...

355
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The one where she said,

356
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Ben is an incorrigible asshole,

357
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and I won't be on the PCP anymore.

358
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That one.

359
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, that one.

360
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Well...

361
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah.

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I mean, it's just a podcast.

363
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So, like, whatever.

364
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's a problem with Ben's saying as far as it seems to be the case.

365
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
As long as Ben's saying is here,

366
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Trixie will not want to be here.

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And it's like,

368
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
well, yeah, I can see not wanting to, like,

369
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
clash heads if you don't need to.

370
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But she hasn't been on the podcast in a while anyway.

371
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah.

372
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So, I feel like this is more like,

373
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
oh, no, she's leaving the PCP.

374
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Like, it feels like it's...

375
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
In the minds of many people witnessing it

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
is more of a big deal than it actually is.

377
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's just Ben and Trixie have fallen out.

378
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Like, things have happened like this before.

379
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't know whether it will come back to how it was before.

380
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Like, I don't think this is like,

381
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
oh, the irreparable bridge-burning, the end.

382
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Like, years from now, for 40 years,

383
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
they'll be still, like, throwing spears through each other's windows.

384
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Like, it is not...

385
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't know.

386
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It doesn't feel like that big of a deal.

387
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It just sort of, like, Ben annoys Trixie so much

388
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
he doesn't want to be on a podcast.

389
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's not really that big of a deal.

390
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't know. I don't know.

391
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't think I agree.

392
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I think she's gone forever

393
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
off to be weird with her creepy, shady roommates.

394
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And those are her new friends.

395
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And that's the direction she's taken.

396
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know, they're totally creepy, shady.

397
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Riley is a bit of a...

398
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
They're creepy, they're creepy, they're creepy, shady.

399
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Riley is, like, eccentric.

400
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know whether creepy is the word I would use.

401
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And I don't really know much about men salad and bird.

402
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They seem like more chill than Riley.

403
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Riley's, like, the big, crazy boy.

404
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This was the thing.

405
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The tweet made it sound like it was, like,

406
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
we were arguing about the...

407
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
the lecture, which we weren't.

408
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
She got mad and left because I was angry

409
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
that Riley was talking about planning his own Radcon

410
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
for us.

411
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And I was angry and I insulted him to her

412
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and denounced him in the strongest possible terms.

413
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And that was what was too much for her.

414
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And made her say, no, I'm leaving.

415
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Ben's a mean asshole and won't be on a podcast.

416
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Because he said mean things about my

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
quote-unquote producer, Lamal.

418
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And I just think that's weird.

419
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll just say this.

420
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I've been to BronyCon and I enjoyed the experience.

421
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I don't think me meeting Riley would be that bad.

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't find that to be, like, terror.

423
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't find him creepier or anything.

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
He seems like a wacky, crazy guy.

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Creepy is not the right word.

426
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't think he seems like an asshole.

427
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, maybe.

428
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But, like, he also seems like a nice person

429
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
to the people he cares about.

430
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's the impression I've been given.

431
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't agree with that.

432
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah, well, whatever.

433
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He seems tribal.

434
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
They all seem tribal.

435
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Like, they're the in-group and everyone else is the enemy.

436
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So in that way, yeah.

437
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I guess I would say nice to his friends.

438
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Against everyone else is the sense I get from them.

439
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But I would not stay in a positive way.

440
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But I see what you're saying.

441
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I see where you're coming from.

442
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I feel like...

443
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
They're not like the devil.

444
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And I could see myself...

445
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm not saying they're like the devil.

446
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Reaching out to them personally.

447
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That was bad of me.

448
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But, like, you clearly have no...

449
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Like, you have no intentions of ever, like, making peace with them.

450
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't like them.

451
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't like them.

452
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That was fine.

453
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's fine that I don't like them.

454
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's not a problem.

455
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It only became a problem when one of them

456
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
tried to stick their fucking nose into my business

457
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
with the rad con stuff.

458
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And Trixie, and I said, Trixie, this is...

459
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I hate this.

460
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And she was like...

461
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Why don't you respect my friends?

462
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, because they're fucking annoying

463
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and they are...

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
They don't understand boundaries.

465
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And keep them away from me.

466
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's it.

467
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's how I feel.

468
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And Ben St. did nothing wrong.

469
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Hashtag free Ben St.

470
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

471
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's like, from my perspective,

472
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I can see both sides of it.

473
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Like, yeah, they...

474
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Kind of...

475
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It is kind of weird and annoying that they're like...

476
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Rad con.

477
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Wait!

478
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We should just throw our own rad con.

479
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We can have it at, like, our concert.

480
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Like, okay, we'll just do that.

481
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Like, no.

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Like, fuck you.

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What the fuck gives you...

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What right do you think you have?

485
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What do you think you have a say in any of this?

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Of course you don't.

487
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Shut the fuck up.

488
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But I also see

489
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
their perspective a little bit.

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't know.

491
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm more willing...

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't think that you're in the wrong.

493
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I hate you for agreeing with them at all.

494
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Cool.

495
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't want to, like,

496
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
side with them or anything.

497
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But I just... I feel like this is...

498
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
There's gonna be a lot of, like,

499
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
bitterness built up

500
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
based on the idea that this is so

501
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
massive an event.

502
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And I'm like...

503
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We're all just people.

504
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's not really that, like,

505
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
devastating.

506
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Nothing's really been done...

507
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I mean, at the end of the day,

508
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
it is just a podcast

509
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and nothing...

510
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And nothing else is affected by it.

511
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I mean, sure.

512
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I understand that.

513
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Sure, yes.

514
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You know, in a cosmic sense, I mean,

515
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
we're all just tiny specks

516
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
on a little blue ball

517
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
orbiting a star, one of just

518
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
billions in the Milky Way galaxy.

519
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What does anything really matter

520
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
in the grand scheme of it all?

521
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I know, I know.

522
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I know.

523
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I just feel like

524
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
an urge to...

525
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't know.

526
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Like, calm everyone down, because it's like,

527
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
people are getting really upset.

528
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So, like, all over the place.

529
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm like...

530
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't know what can...

531
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like, this isn't...

532
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm not that concerned,

533
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
honestly.

534
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm also not concerned.

535
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
People get the impression

536
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
that you are raging at them.

537
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Like, you are absolutely like...

538
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Like, I want them dead.

539
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, sometimes I do get mad at people.

540
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I got mad

541
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
at those Radcon comments,

542
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
made me very mad.

543
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Some of the people on Twitter

544
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
responding to me about it made me very mad.

545
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Uh...

546
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What of it?

547
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I think the thing with you, Ben,

548
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
is that, like, in text or on Twitter,

549
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
madness comes across as more,

550
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
like, devastating and

551
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
diabolical than you do when you are

552
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
a human being, and I can hear you,

553
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and you're just Ben.

554
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You're just Ben.

555
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You couldn't hurt a fly, even if you had,

556
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
like, a two-handed sword.

557
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I could. I think I could.

558
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You gotta find two fucking

559
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
chainsaws and get your casting

560
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
delayed down.

561
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If I had a big wand, with a lot of capacity

562
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and a high and a low

563
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
refresh rate, I could

564
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
kill many flies

565
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
with bullets.

566
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Uh, I know what you mean.

567
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This whole thing has been very

568
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
weird for me as someone who is not

569
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
prone to conflict

570
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and tries to just, like, smooth things over.

571
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Watching this all explode, like,

572
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
back to back, and I'm just like,

573
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
okay, um, I don't even...

574
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'd even had the time

575
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
to formulate an opinion

576
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
on Riley and Co.

577
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I knew nothing about them, and then

578
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
all of a sudden, there was a fight,

579
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and I was like, ah, interesting.

580
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Okay, I have no

581
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
greater context for this.

582
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And it was weird.

583
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I mean, I mean, what more

584
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
context?

585
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
What more context do we need?

586
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't know. My context was a couple tweets

587
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and a cringe drama

588
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
video, and that was all the context I had,

589
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and I feel like...

590
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Wait, what cringe drama video?

591
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The big fight thing.

592
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The Ethan Ralph thing.

593
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That was not really related,

594
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
but it was like, direct information.

595
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
No, I'm just saying, like,

596
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
it's like, how did I realize who half these people were?

597
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It was through that video, so I'm like,

598
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm not gonna judge anybody from that video.

599
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
That's like, the worst

600
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the worst moment of all of their lives

601
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
in the last couple months, probably.

602
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, which they

603
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
decided

604
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
it would be a great idea to upload.

605
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It's pretty cringe. I will give you that.

606
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Right? Okay.

607
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I agree.

608
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So, I mean, I think we can draw

609
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
some conclusions.

610
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I mean, Trixie's known for posting cringe

611
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
before. This is different.

612
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
This is different cringe.

613
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I guess it is a little different. It's very personal.

614
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I was very surprised when I saw it.

615
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah.

616
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I mean, I have... It is the thing,

617
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
like, traditionally, you would be like, oh,

618
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
God, let's not talk about this.

619
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I hope it doesn't blow up. I'm surprised.

620
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But then to be the first, like,

621
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
journalist on the scene.

622
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The first journalist. I'm surprised

623
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
you guys are on a different wavelength

624
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
about this. You guys are all

625
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
you guys are pretty well

626
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
just like, eh, that's

627
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
whatever. Who knows

628
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
what means anything.

629
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I have many opinions

630
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
about what's going on and I hate

631
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
all of it. I hate everything

632
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
that's happening over there.

633
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I

634
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
hate that video.

635
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I hate Yig Studios.

636
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I hate everyone.

637
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Hmm.

638
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's it.

639
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I think my thing is more

640
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
the way I respond to things

641
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
is like, well, what

642
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
is the purpose? What

643
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
ends am I hoping to achieve

644
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
with the way I respond to anything?

645
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Like, I don't know. If I tell

646
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
them that I hate them,

647
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
even if it's true. I didn't tell anyone.

648
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I didn't actually tell anyone. That's new.

649
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
This is a new revelation.

650
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Okay. I didn't tell, but okay.

651
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah, I know what you mean. Alright, go on.

652
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I have, like, opinions

653
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
on the way that was handled and what it was.

654
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I found it generally to be kind of funny,

655
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
but like cringe and like

656
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
why.

657
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But, like,

658
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I feel like if I wanted

659
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
to change something, I wouldn't, like,

660
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I don't know.

661
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But my opinion on it is

662
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
like saying it on Twitter

663
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
or saying that, like,

664
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
in a podcast, it makes

665
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
no difference, really.

666
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
If I really wanted to change something, I would try and talk to them directly.

667
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Well, that's what I did. That's what I did.

668
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I talked, I talked.

669
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm not criticizing you. I'm just talking about how I handled this stuff.

670
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I started by talking to Trixie in the PCP chat

671
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
and it led to the fight

672
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and then she quit because she was mad.

673
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
That's what I did.

674
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So I don't, what are you saying?

675
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I guess

676
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
what I'm saying is, like,

677
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I wouldn't have wanted Trixie to quit.

678
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I would have wanted her to, like,

679
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
whatever problems I have,

680
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I would have wanted them to go away

681
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
rather than for her to leave with them.

682
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You know what I mean? Well, they weren't going to go away.

683
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
This isn't like a criticism of how you did anything.

684
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I just want everyone to be friends.

685
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
We just want to go back.

686
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We got to go back.

687
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
They weren't going to go away

688
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
because the Yig people

689
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
were completely overstepping

690
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
boundaries of good taste

691
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and

692
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
society

693
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and propriety

694
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and it wasn't okay

695
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
but Trixie cares more about them

696
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
than she does about us

697
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
so she was not willing to

698
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
hear it

699
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and so she left because she

700
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
can't deal with it

701
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
and that's a problem

702
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
and it wasn't going to go away

703
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and I'm glad I brought it up

704
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and if she needs to leave

705
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
over that then so be it

706
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
that's what she should do.

707
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I got a PBRB.

708
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Oh, god damn it.

709
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, no.

710
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Now it's just me and Ben

711
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and that awkward statement

712
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and I don't know how to follow it up with anything

713
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
relevant or meaningful.

714
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You guys are making it awkward

715
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
by not just agreeing with me.

716
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
If we were agreeing with you

717
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
this would be much more entertaining, I agree.

718
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
If we had like a 20 minute dunk session

719
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
that would have been much more entertaining.

720
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I don't need a 20 minute dunk session.

721
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I just need everyone to agree.

722
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You two

723
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
you're so like, oh conciliatory.

724
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh, can we all be friends?

725
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's true.

726
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
To my detriment I am conciliatory.

727
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I will admit that outright.

728
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I understand that but to my eye

729
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
there are irreconcilable differences here

730
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
that do not permit such a solution.

731
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That being the case

732
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I don't see

733
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
what has

734
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I don't see this as like a bad

735
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
way, is like a bad

736
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
resolution. It seems to me like this is the only

737
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
thing that could have happened.

738
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Well, I would agree. I think this probably was the only

739
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
way considering all the pieces that were on the board

740
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
this was going to go.

741
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I think it's like

742
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
my general reaction to these things

743
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
is to like set back, assess, try to figure out

744
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
everything that's going on and I don't know enough about

745
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
these other people, the you guys

746
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
to make a

747
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
informed decision and so

748
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
my general stance is to

749
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
just do nothing. I was like, well I don't know what's going on.

750
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Well I was totally willing, I was totally willing

751
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
to ignore them until they started

752
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
stepping on our fucking feet

753
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
and talking about going

754
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
over our heads and doing some shit that

755
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
they don't have any fucking business doing.

756
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That's what did it for me.

757
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It

758
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I wouldn't, I was not going to

759
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
say anything

760
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
until then. I don't know.

761
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I feel like

762
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I've said all I can really say

763
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
about it.

764
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I think

765
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
from my perspective

766
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
with regards to like RADCOM

767
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
organizing, it's always been sort of

768
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
out of my hands anyway because I live

769
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
so far away and it's sort of like

770
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I don't know, I don't feel

771
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
as connected to like organizations

772
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
of those things

773
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
so like if it just happened to be like hey

774
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
if Riley said

775
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
hey we're doing like a

776
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
RADCOM like brony lecture redo

777
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and we're going to pay for your flight, I'll be like yeah okay

778
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
like I wouldn't have too much of a problem

779
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
with them organizing that

780
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'd just fly over and just

781
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
exist for a while like I do

782
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
whenever I come over and

783
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
make some content

784
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
or content, I guess content's destroyed now

785
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
lol

786
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh yeah, that also happens

787
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
but like

788
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I feel like

789
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
you don't understand

790
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't have as much of a problem

791
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
you don't understand

792
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
it's more than that

793
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
because it wasn't just like hey I'll fly

794
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
everyone out

795
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
first of all, I don't believe he was actually

796
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
going to pay, I think he was lying

797
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
but whatever

798
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
setting that aside

799
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
it wasn't like oh I'll fly everyone out

800
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
so they can re-record this lecture

801
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
okay, we'll have RADCOM

802
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
we'll have it

803
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
at my concert

804
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
like me and Trixie will put on a concert

805
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and we'll just make RADCOM like a sideshow act

806
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
to that, we'll just subsume it into our thing

807
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and host it there

808
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
yeah, I mean obviously from

809
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and I just find it despicable

810
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
from the perspective of fans of RADCOM

811
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
that would not be what they want

812
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
the absolute gall of it all

813
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
the energy would definitely be different

814
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I was just thinking

815
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
myself, I'd be okay with whatever

816
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
happens, but like

817
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
if people want a RADCOM 5

818
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
or 4.5

819
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
whatever it was going to be

820
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
a Trixie and Riley

821
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
music concert obviously

822
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
is not what people know or care about

823
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
in the audience that we have

824
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
so it would be like

825
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
of course not

826
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
absolutely not

827
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
never, never, never, never

828
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't know

829
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I guess I'm just too open minded

830
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm just like yeah, why not

831
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I would be willing to do that

832
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I would be willing to go there

833
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
this is horrible

834
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
it's despicable

835
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm just over here with my

836
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
wooden planks and rope

837
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
and I'm building bridges every day

838
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
look at what has happened

839
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
look at the state

840
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
of the YIG Studio channel

841
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
which is being run

842
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
by these people

843
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I don't want them in charge of anything that I do

844
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
no thank you

845
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I agree, I'm not really down with

846
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
their aesthetic or what they're doing

847
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
their content doesn't interest me

848
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and I don't say that maliciously just as

849
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
merely a matter of taste

850
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I guess

851
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I don't know, the thing is

852
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
we're talking about this whole

853
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
what Riley wanted to do

854
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
but like

855
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
none of us ever had a conversation

856
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
passively

857
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
we're saying like Ben

858
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Riley never approached you despite the fact that

859
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
publicly had been stated a few times that you had been approached

860
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I don't think it really happened

861
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
that's what you were saying

862
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
it was never

863
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I guess

864
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
the only thing that I'm confused about

865
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
is it just

866
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
it sounds like we're extrapolating some things

867
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
from this hearsay

868
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't know what's true and what's not

869
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
people saw Riley saying stuff

870
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and then they showed it to me in my discord

871
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and I

872
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
said in the pcp chat

873
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
that I didn't like it

874
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and Trixie communicated that

875
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I didn't like what I was seeing

876
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
to Riley

877
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and Riley took that as a

878
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
oh, Ben has refused my offer

879
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
of hosting a radcon

880
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Ben

881
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Ben just doesn't want there to be another radcon

882
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I guess

883
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
that's the really

884
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
you know what, it's not the really

885
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
galling thing because there are many

886
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
truly galling aspects of the whole thing

887
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
but one particularly galling aspect

888
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
was the way that it was cast

889
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
the fact that I don't like

890
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
that these people

891
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
are planning radcon

892
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
for us without asking us about it

893
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
without even consulting us

894
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
as though they have any right to do that

895
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
is that like oh, well

896
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I guess if Ben says he doesn't like the plan

897
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
then Ben is just anti-radcon

898
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
he is the one that is like holding it up

899
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and preventing it

900
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
as though it's this or nothing

901
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
as though it's either like these strangers

902
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
these fucking strangers because that's what they are

903
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
these complete strangers can't plan

904
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
this thing then I guess

905
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Ben just never wants it to happen, he must be against it

906
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
oh, he must just hate it

907
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I mean, I don't think

908
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
anybody would deny that like

909
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
it feels like a lot of the moves

910
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and things that are said seem to be

911
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I don't know

912
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't want to say manipulative

913
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I will say manipulative

914
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
to gain sympathy

915
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
because as soon as this

916
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
happened you were kind of reframed as the enemy

917
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
which I don't think was the point

918
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I guess I'm just

919
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I don't know

920
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
it's strange because we never had a conversation about this

921
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I feel like a conversation probably would have cleared a lot of this up

922
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
if it was going to be like

923
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
hey

924
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
we want to redo the Brony lecture

925
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and we're going to be touring and doing concerts or whatever

926
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and if we can all meet up here

927
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and I'll pay for you

928
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
we're just doing this anyway but you can just

929
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
go do the thing by yourselves

930
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and we just happen to be in the area

931
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
that would have been one thing

932
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that would have been one thing

933
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
but if it was like oh, I'm going to produce

934
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
an entire new Radcon event

935
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and now I'm in charge of it

936
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
that's where I'd be like

937
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
eh, I'm not too keen on that

938
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
because I don't want to like

939
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
tightly integrate these people that I don't know

940
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
into the production

941
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
my only thing is

942
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I don't know which idea

943
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
was actually the one being proposed because like we said

944
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
none of us ever actually had

945
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
a conversation about this

946
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
because it was the former

947
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I read the comments

948
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I read what was said and it was the second one

949
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
that's why I was mad

950
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
okay, alright

951
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I have no way

952
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
of knowing for sure

953
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I posted the

954
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
screenshots, someone showed me the screenshots

955
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and I reposted them and you can read them

956
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and that's what they say

957
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
okay

958
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
okay

959
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I just don't

960
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
like it

961
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I just don't like it

962
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm not a fan of the situation myself

963
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I think

964
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I think it's all a bit like

965
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
it's all pretty cringe

966
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
it's not much, I don't know

967
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
oh I guess I should go to

968
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Trixie about what I think but I don't know what I think

969
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
should I just say

970
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
well

971
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I don't know

972
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
what am I supposed to DM her about

973
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
like

974
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
it just sort of feels like

975
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
there's nothing

976
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I can do about it

977
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't like being wrapped up in this

978
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
but whatever

979
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
nothing can be done

980
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
let's just

981
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
blow it all up

982
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
okay, let's do it

983
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
alright, kaboom

984
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
it's all dead, it's all gone

985
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
are we voicemails?

986
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
we could have Wreck on

987
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
but we can't call it Wreck

988
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
well I guess we can

989
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
it's like

990
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
it's a bastardization of Trixie's dead name

991
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
so it's kind of weird

992
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
there's nothing we can do

993
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
we gotta go into the graveyard

994
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and we gotta get

995
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
our lightning rod

996
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and we gotta dig up Brad Garlinghouse's corpse

997
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
we gotta revive him

998
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
we have to have BradCon too

999
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
it's the only option

1000
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
honestly, BradCon

1001
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm ready, I'm ready for BradCon

1002
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
look, we all gave Brad

1003
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
a ton of shit for XRP

1004
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
but now we're all into crypto

1005
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
a lot, he's the leader we need

1006
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
let's see how Ripple's doing

1007
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I was kind of annoyed

1008
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I was kind of like

1009
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
annoyed that my

1010
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
brother

1011
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
he had gotten into crypto

1012
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
through other means

1013
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
not through anything I had heard about

1014
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and he had gotten some Ripple

1015
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
and he made some money off of it and he told me

1016
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
and I was like, oh cool I guess

1017
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
because he didn't know about the whole XRP

1018
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Brad Garlinghouse stuff

1019
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
that ruined the PCP

1020
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
he doesn't know the context

1021
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
so I was like, I felt mad about it

1022
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
but obviously he didn't know

1023
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
it was just sort of like

1024
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
you were mad

1025
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
because he was into XRP

1026
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and he didn't know that

1027
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I wasn't mad at him

1028
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
it was just a little reaction I had

1029
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
like, oh fuck no

1030
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
you've betrayed me

1031
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
well I guess you couldn't have known

1032
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
that's funny, that's pretty funny actually

1033
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I just saw this live stream

1034
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
on this random YouTube channel

1035
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and I got into it

1036
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Ripple is

1037
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
it's up from

1038
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
it's up from

1039
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
where it was like last year

1040
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
but it's like

1041
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
not that high

1042
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
so it's neutral I guess

1043
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
that's how Ripple's doing in case

1044
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
in 2020 we destroyed XRP

1045
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
in 2022 we need to max revive it

1046
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
here's its entire

1047
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
here's its entire life story

1048
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
in graph form

1049
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
it went up and down and down and up and down

1050
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
it went down and then it went up again

1051
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
yep

1052
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
looks like stockmarket.png

1053
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
to me

1054
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
doing great Brad

1055
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
it's trading at 6 cents

1056
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
a bit

1057
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
oh my god it's almost worth the same as Dogecoin

1058
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
dude bits

1059
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
you remember my little pony

1060
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
do you remember when they had

1061
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
bits

1062
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I thought you meant on Twitch

1063
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
no no no no

1064
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Twitch copied my little pony back when it was called

1065
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
JustinTV

1066
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and that's where all the new episodes were live streamed

1067
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I remember what you know

1068
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
yeah do you remember

1069
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
that was like the parent side of Twitch

1070
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and Twitch was like a subsidiary gaming branch

1071
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and then Twitch just took over because it got so big

1072
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I've never heard of JustinTV

1073
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
back in the old days

1074
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
there was a little pony like

1075
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
oh this is a new episode coming out

1076
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and there was like 7 different streaming services

1077
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
that would stream the episode from Hasbro

1078
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
TV

1079
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and all these nerds would come

1080
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
and watch on JustinTV

1081
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the ponies

1082
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
that's what's gonna heal us

1083
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
we're all gonna get into gen 5

1084
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
it's gonna be good and we're all gonna be healed

1085
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
isn't already out? isn't already going?

1086
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
no the movie's coming out soon

1087
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I think

1088
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
there's 3D

1089
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
yeah we talked about this

1090
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and now it looks like

1091
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
any fucking

1092
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
DreamWorks movie

1093
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't know if the show's gonna be

1094
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
animated in the same style

1095
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
so it's a walloff

1096
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I bet it'll be

1097
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I bet it'll be 3D

1098
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
it is 3D

1099
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
oh the show yeah maybe

1100
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
yeah yeah

1101
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
what's the name?

1102
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
well that's something to be excited about

1103
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I guess that's something

1104
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
that's coming in the future

1105
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
get hype

1106
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
uh

1107
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
we still on board to do

1108
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
a pony movie review episode

1109
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm down

1110
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
pony movie review bonus episode

1111
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
hell yeah

1112
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
hell fucking yeah

1113
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm not gonna go see it in theaters though

1114
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
we're gonna be old people

1115
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
we're gonna be

1116
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I can't even imagine going to a movie theater anymore

1117
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
the kids these days they're like in the 3D

1118
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
ponies and that's stupid

1119
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
back in my day we had

1120
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
back in the day we had flash puppets

1121
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
flash puppets

1122
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and they made the funny meme

1123
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
faces in season 4

1124
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
do you remember the memes

1125
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
do you remember when they gave the purple one wings

1126
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and everybody bitched for months

1127
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
remember when the pink one made the funny face

1128
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
you know what they're not gonna be able to have a derpy in 3D

1129
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
you're not gonna be able to have an animation error like that

1130
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
oh are they gonna do you think they're gonna try

1131
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
to do any of that like

1132
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
like recreate the brony fandom

1133
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
like beat for beat

1134
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
it'd be pretty cringe if they did

1135
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
have like oh here's

1136
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
a accidental glitch

1137
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
pony and what are you

1138
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
what do you fans want to call that

1139
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
and then like they tweet about it and

1140
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
don't even summon that kind of energy

1141
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
into the physical plane

1142
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
well the thing is if they do do that

1143
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
it'll come like corporate

1144
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
feeling and then nobody would get into it at all

1145
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
yeah exactly

1146
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
it has to all be organic

1147
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I mean companies don't understand that

1148
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm sure they're already working like alright how are we gonna

1149
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
how are we gonna get the brony bucks

1150
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
we gotta figure out how to plant these little seeds

1151
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
and it'll suck but

1152
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I hope not

1153
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
it's kind of doomed from the start

1154
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
because the brony thing only came about

1155
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
because nobody was expecting

1156
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
a pony show to be

1157
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
good in any way

1158
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
it was a surprise that's what

1159
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
that was the gimmick at the beginning

1160
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
gen 5 is just like oh yeah

1161
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I wonder if they'll do that gimmick again

1162
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I wonder if they'll just do it again

1163
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I wonder if it'll still be good

1164
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
very unlikely

1165
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I don't know if it's evolved creatively with us

1166
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
it has pros and cons and it's like

1167
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
there's better cartoons out there

1168
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I don't know who's involved in the studio

1169
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
like making this show

1170
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
because I'm obviously Lauren Faust isn't involved

1171
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I don't know if like

1172
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Megan McArthur or the fuck her name was

1173
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
if she's still helming the ship with this new series

1174
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
or it's somebody else

1175
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
who knows

1176
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
but that'll probably affect whether it's good or not

1177
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
it's a different animation studio of course

1178
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
yeah

1179
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
whatever

1180
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
who cares there's nothing to talk about

1181
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
whatever

1182
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
the show wasn't even that good

1183
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
what?

1184
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
it wasn't even that good it was just fine

1185
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
no you don't understand

1186
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
there was a rainbow pony in it

1187
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
you don't understand

1188
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
it's true

1189
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
no I do understand all that

1190
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
that show was like 20% cooler

1191
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
than other shows

1192
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
do you remember when applejack wore those

1193
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
thigh high horse shoes

1194
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
that was strange

1195
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
galoshes

1196
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
no

1197
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
no

1198
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
no

1199
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
god no

1200
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
fuck

1201
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
shut up

1202
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
okay

1203
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
no more

1204
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
pony talk at the dinner table

1205
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
eat your slop

1206
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
hey you hear that

1207
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
about buffy the vampire slayer

1208
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
what

1209
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
let's go on

1210
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I've been watching

1211
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
your old buffy the vampire slayer

1212
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and it's been very nice

1213
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I'm on season 5 now

1214
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
because it's base

1215
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
why would you do that

1216
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
why wouldn't you just play noida

1217
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
it's like if noida was a tv show

1218
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and it was better than noida

1219
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
you could have a chainsaw

1220
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
you could shoot multiple bullets

1221
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
per frame

1222
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
60 bullets a second

1223
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
getting a new episode of

1224
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
the buffy the vampire slayer is just watching

1225
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
bensank die right in front of me

1226
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
that's why I like it

1227
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
hmm

1228
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
okay

1229
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
solid

1230
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
anyway

1231
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I want people in the audience

1232
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
to get into buffy the vampire slayer

1233
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
and then you will realize that

1234
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
it's the coolest thing ever but it's hard to talk about

1235
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
because there's so much continuity

1236
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
that you don't want to ruin anything

1237
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
people have been telling me to watch

1238
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
buffy the vampire slayer since I was like 13

1239
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
well you're late

1240
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
no I was right

1241
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I've been right all along

1242
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
nope

1243
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I can't

1244
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
literally my entire personality

1245
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
is that I haven't seen buffy the vampire slayer

1246
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and I can't go back

1247
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
on that I'd give them everything

1248
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
hmm

1249
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
oh no

1250
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
that's the weakness

1251
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
it's a vampire but instead of sunlight

1252
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
it's watching buffy the vampire slayer

1253
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
that's correct

1254
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
if a monitor appears

1255
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
with buffy the vampire slayer on it

1256
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
and the light of that monitor touches you

1257
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
you burn and turn to dust

1258
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
yeah

1259
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
it would do heavy

1260
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
a holy damage to me

1261
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
that's correct

1262
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
if I make a steak out of

1263
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
melted down buffy the vampire slayer

1264
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
DVDs

1265
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I think so

1266
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
to be fair that would kill probably anybody

1267
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
yeah

1268
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
that would probably kill most people

1269
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm actually just more

1270
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
vulnerable

1271
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
than most people

1272
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I have all the vampire weaknesses

1273
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
and none of its strengths

1274
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
if you stab Ben with that he turned into a poor

1275
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
90's CGI skeleton

1276
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and then collapsed the dust

1277
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
like vampires do in buffy the vampire slayer

1278
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
yes yes

1279
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Willow has funny jokes

1280
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
and Xander also has funny jokes

1281
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and buffy is buffy

1282
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and there's Giles and he's British

1283
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Giles the British man

1284
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
now we know why you like it

1285
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
oh yes I got the library

1286
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
turn it over

1287
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
find out about the vampire's buffy

1288
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
and buffy's like I don't want to do any of this stuff

1289
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
he's like well you have to train buffy

1290
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
you have to be a vampire slayer

1291
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
oh I'm British

1292
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
that's the whole show

1293
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
well if it's got

1294
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I guess we just watched it then

1295
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
then maybe I am interested

1296
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
no no no I live for racist characters

1297
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
of British people

1298
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
British

1299
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
if more people say British then the world will be more British

1300
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm British

1301
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm gonna drink a bottle of water

1302
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
a bottle of water

1303
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
a bottle of water

1304
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
wear your tees

1305
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
you fucks

1306
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
we're drinking all of them

1307
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
we don't have any left for speech

1308
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
damn that was pretty good

1309
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
alright I've been owned

1310
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
alright I've been owned

1311
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
so Kantan's dead

1312
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
yep

1313
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
it's on hiatus

1314
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
it's not on hiatus

1315
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
it's on hiatus

1316
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Trixie's been quote unquote fired

1317
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
and reiterated that she let herself be fired

1318
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
which I think

1319
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
the word is quit

1320
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I think quit is the word

1321
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I believe that is the word

1322
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
yeah that's how I would describe it

1323
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
well

1324
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I mean she said that

1325
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
it was Nate who didn't want to work with her

1326
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and Riley and all that

1327
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I don't understand

1328
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
this is it

1329
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
this is it again

1330
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
what did the crew

1331
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
in conjunction with

1332
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
this Kantan

1333
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
what did they have to do with it

1334
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
it's suspicious

1335
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I don't know

1336
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
it just speaks to a larger pattern that I'm seeing

1337
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
here where these

1338
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
individuals

1339
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
are just being inserted

1340
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
into places where they don't belong

1341
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
it seems like it's a package deal

1342
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
you know

1343
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
and I hate that and if it's a package deal

1344
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I say no thanks to the whole package

1345
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
so this is

1346
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
more reinforcement of why I did the right thing

1347
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
as I always do

1348
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
yeah

1349
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I guess there's just not enough information

1350
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
right now like I can understand

1351
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Trixie with

1352
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
her new boyfriend

1353
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
well no I can't

1354
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I can't understand that

1355
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
that was unacceptable when it was May

1356
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and it's unacceptable when anyone does it at any time

1357
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
sure

1358
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I guess I know but like

1359
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and now it's a business thing

1360
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Kantan is a business thing right

1361
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
there's a show

1362
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
you wouldn't

1363
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Trixie never brought May to

1364
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
shows

1365
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
well she tried her hardest to bring her to Radcon

1366
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
that's true

1367
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
the only reason May wasn't at the shows

1368
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
is because we put our foot down about it

1369
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
yeah

1370
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
this is what I'm talking about

1371
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
this is a pattern of behavior

1372
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
just

1373
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I don't know what to think about it

1374
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
exactly because I don't know anything about that situation

1375
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
or who said what about it

1376
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
could ask Nate but I don't know

1377
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
whether he want to talk about all that

1378
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
shit

1379
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I tried reaching out to Nate and he was very mama on the situation

1380
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
he's just like I don't want to talk about it

1381
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
and I was like alright fair enough

1382
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I mean it's obvious

1383
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I mean I guess I can only speculate

1384
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
this is just my speculation but it's

1385
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
seem really obvious

1386
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
that it's the fact that she's moving

1387
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
into an RV

1388
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and going to be roaming across the

1389
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
country

1390
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
that's the plan

1391
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
but she frames it like oh it's Nate's fault

1392
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
that Nate doesn't want to work

1393
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
under those circumstances

1394
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
when like

1395
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
you're the one who's changing shit up

1396
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
you're the one who's doing this

1397
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
it's not that Nate doesn't want

1398
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
to work with you anymore it's that you

1399
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
made all

1400
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
you have radically changed

1401
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
the situation

1402
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
yeah I mean

1403
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I would like to think

1404
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
that there was some sort of discussion about this

1405
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
before it was immediately implemented

1406
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
but I have a feeling there probably wasn't

1407
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
which is unfortunate

1408
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
well I don't know

1409
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
that's one thing I don't know

1410
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm talking about my ass because I don't know

1411
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
anything about any of this other than the surface

1412
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
image of it

1413
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm speculating but it seems obvious

1414
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and what Trixie said

1415
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
on Twitter pretty much corroborates it

1416
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
so I'm treating it as like

1417
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
99% certain

1418
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
it just seems like

1419
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
everything

1420
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
indicates that that is the issue

1421
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I'm curious about

1422
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
the RV thing like the idea of getting into

1423
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
an RV and traveling around like okay

1424
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
whatever

1425
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
being able to do cantant I can't

1426
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
help but say it like that I like saying it like that

1427
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
just fine being able to do

1428
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
cantant

1429
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
like in the RV

1430
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
means like traveling back

1431
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
to Virginia to do like a bunch of episodes

1432
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
then going in the RV and traveling away again

1433
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I guess

1434
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
like how else would it work

1435
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
that seemed to be the plan

1436
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
but then they were doing

1437
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
like

1438
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
like anime that came out

1439
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
like seasonal anime

1440
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
so it would need to be

1441
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
prompt it would need to be like as soon as

1442
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
the anime episodes are out

1443
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
yeah that's right

1444
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
so like how far could she reasonably go

1445
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
in an RV and then come back to do things

1446
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and also watch the anime at the same time

1447
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I don't know it feels

1448
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
like there's a lot of

1449
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
how would that work

1450
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
seems like kind of a problem

1451
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
seems like it might throw a wrench

1452
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
into things a little bit

1453
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I mean Victor has been on cantant

1454
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
before and Victor's cool

1455
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
so that might continue like that

1456
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
well Trixie said

1457
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Trixie said that

1458
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
like she assumed Victor

1459
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I think she just assumed Victor

1460
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I don't know I mean I'm not just going to take her word for it

1461
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Victor

1462
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and Vic and Hope have been like doing anime videos

1463
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
still like Vicks on that

1464
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
that stuff

1465
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I could see that

1466
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I hate anime

1467
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
and like if I were Nate

1468
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I would put all this effort into

1469
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
you know building up cantant into a thing

1470
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I wouldn't want to just abandon it

1471
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I would probably

1472
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
want to keep it going in some capacity

1473
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
even if my co-host were to leave

1474
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
whether or not he feels the same way

1475
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
or whether

1476
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
that's a possibility I mean I don't know

1477
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
maybe Vic wouldn't want to do that

1478
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
that would be

1479
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I mean who knows

1480
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
so I mean I guess

1481
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
it just remains to be seen what the fate of that

1482
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
is

1483
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I just I can't help but feel for Nate a little

1484
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
because he moved to Virginia

1485
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
for this show

1486
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I kind of agree

1487
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
but on the other hand

1488
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I think that's what you get when you work with Trixie

1489
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
this is just what she does

1490
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I mean back when it was like

1491
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
PCPHQ

1492
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
like way back like it didn't seem like

1493
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
same shit

1494
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
well maybe I don't know maybe I wasn't paying attention

1495
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
so that's the same thing

1496
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I mean we all

1497
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
well I think what it was

1498
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
is like we

1499
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
we'd all assumed

1500
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
like all of us had assumed that once there was an established

1501
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
location

1502
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
it would become

1503
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
more stable for everyone

1504
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and then we could like

1505
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
that was the idea behind PCPHQ from the beginning

1506
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
was like

1507
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
we get

1508
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
creators together close proximity

1509
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
to the studio be able to record things

1510
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
with each other whenever we feel like

1511
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
obviously quite difficult

1512
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
especially now

1513
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
because we're all doing different types of things

1514
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and like getting together for content is like

1515
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
not as much of a draw

1516
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
as it used to be

1517
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
but like

1518
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
for like I'm pretty sure

1519
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
like even though Trixie hasn't been known to like

1520
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
change ideas for things

1521
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I would have thought

1522
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
and I would have assumed that because Nate was there

1523
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
it would have been more stable

1524
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
more consistent more

1525
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
like that's a permanent

1526
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
fixture on the whole

1527
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
on the map and

1528
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
if Trixie wants to do something different

1529
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
she can do something different but also

1530
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
still appear on canteen and it'll be fine

1531
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
but I guess

1532
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
none of them are so

1533
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I don't know

1534
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I don't know what

1535
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I'm not sure what point you're

1536
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
getting at

1537
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
there's no point to anything

1538
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
it's all stupid

1539
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
we're all just specks of dust

1540
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
we're just orbiting in the space

1541
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
it's a galaxy

1542
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
trillions and billions

1543
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
billions

1544
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
we're all little stars that blink

1545
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
in a galaxy

1546
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I just find it to be

1547
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
unfortunate and I don't like it

1548
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I liked

1549
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
content for them

1550
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I thought that was cool

1551
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
finally getting some sort of

1552
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
it's not unfortunate

1553
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
it's choices

1554
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
people have made choices

1555
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
specifically Trixie has made choices

1556
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
that have caused this outcome

1557
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
those are mutually exclusive though

1558
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
yeah

1559
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I mean unfortunate for

1560
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Nate who did not choose

1561
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
whatever

1562
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
you can say that this is obviously a result

1563
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
of a logical conclusion to choices made

1564
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
but it can still be unfortunate that those choices

1565
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
were made in the first place

1566
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
well I guess you're right

1567
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I guess you're right

1568
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
excuse me

1569
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I apologize

1570
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
dab

1571
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
very well

1572
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I don't mind being the enlightened

1573
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
centrist on this one

1574
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I don't care

1575
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
so cringe

1576
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
but

1577
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
so be it

1578
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
if you want to

1579
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
just one more nail in your coffin

1580
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
then go right ahead

1581
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
if you want to put a nail

1582
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
like half into the coffin

1583
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
yeah

1584
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
in the middle

1585
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I don't necessarily want to put the nail

1586
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
all the way into the coffin

1587
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I can kind of see why you'd want to put the nail in the coffin

1588
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
but I can kind of see why you wouldn't

1589
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
so maybe I'll just kind of

1590
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
tap the nail

1591
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
so in case something bad happens

1592
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I can quickly nail the coffin

1593
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
ironically how I feel about all this

1594
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
because I feel so detached from it

1595
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I can't feel rage

1596
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
one side of the other

1597
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
it's not even just like

1598
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I feel furious

1599
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I'll just in case

1600
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
maybe it's not coming through

1601
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
maybe it doesn't come through when I speak in my voice as much

1602
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
okay good I want it to come through

1603
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm afraid it's not coming through hard enough

1604
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
well yeah honestly trust my tweets

1605
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
my treats reflect my feelings more than

1606
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
my voice does

1607
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
you have a voice of an angel Ben

1608
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
oh no

1609
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
god shucks no go on though

1610
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I don't know

1611
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I'm very

1612
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I'm I

1613
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I guess

1614
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I don't need to belabor the point anymore

1615
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
but I am mad

1616
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I there

1617
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I said it

1618
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I'm mad

1619
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
it's out there guys there's no coming back

1620
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
there's none

1621
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
there's this um

1622
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
this cat youtube video channel

1623
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I've been watching

1624
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
where this cat has these buttons

1625
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
and the buttons make noises

1626
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
like words

1627
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
and this person has been training the cat

1628
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
to associate these words

1629
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
with emotions and feelings and things

1630
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
so the cat has learned

1631
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
that when she's upset

1632
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
with something she can click the mad button

1633
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and she just goes mad

1634
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
mad mad

1635
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and her tail wags affirming

1636
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
that she is mad about something

1637
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
and I just thought that was funny

1638
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I'm just imagining Ben saying with this button

1639
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
pressing it to let the world know

1640
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
that he is mad now

1641
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
that's me on twitter yeah

1642
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
that's what twitter is for me

1643
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
it's the mad button

1644
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I'm gonna find the video because it's really cute

1645
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
fucking baste

1646
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
link it so someone can superimpose Ben's face

1647
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
mad mad mad

1648
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
what a perfect

1649
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
metaphor

1650
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
for being mad

1651
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
at least I cut this awkward sound

1652
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
no we're gonna have to piece a party

1653
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
podcast we can't do that

1654
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
we are

1655
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
and we can

1656
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
but I thought last time we talked about this

1657
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
we aren't and we don't

1658
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
no we do we do

1659
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
we must

1660
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
something has changed in the two weeks I was not on the podcast

1661
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
yeah we have crossover

1662
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
cheesy is like a

1663
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
he's like on the pizza party

1664
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
podcast now

1665
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
he's our man on the inside

1666
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
that's what I was gonna say he's our man on the inside

1667
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
he's our spy so we're gonna take it down from the inside

1668
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
that's exactly right

1669
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
or is cheesy trying to take down

1670
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
us from the inside

1671
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I don't even want to

1672
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
think about that possibility

1673
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
the consequences of which would be

1674
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
disastrous

1675
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
if it's all cheesy's fault

1676
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
he's done a lot of damage in the last two weeks

1677
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
no I disagree

1678
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
no I disagree

1679
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Riley is just a construct made by cheesy Manfredo

1680
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I unironically think

1681
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
that everything that has happened is good

1682
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
and I am happy about it

1683
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
and I am not

1684
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
sorry for anything

1685
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
there's people

1686
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I feel like you guys have this attitude

1687
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
and people on Twitter have this attitude that like

1688
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
oh no I hope you can resolve

1689
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
your differences I hope we can fix this and I legitimately

1690
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
do not want to fix this

1691
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I do not want this to be undone

1692
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
you consider this fixed

1693
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
yes yes I consider this to be the solution

1694
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
this is good

1695
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I like it

1696
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
and it's frustrating

1697
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
that I think I'm in the minority

1698
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
about that

1699
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
but I'm right

1700
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I don't like finality

1701
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
in these sorts of things

1702
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I guess that's the only reason

1703
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I mean at the end of the day

1704
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Trixie not being on the podcast anymore

1705
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
changes virtually nothing

1706
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
you know like nothing's really

1707
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
changed

1708
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
the bigger issue I guess

1709
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I have is just that like it feels like

1710
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
you know

1711
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
they were our friend for so long

1712
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
and now she's not and it's just like

1713
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I mean

1714
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
well I mean think about what that says

1715
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
think about what that says that like

1716
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
friendship ended over this

1717
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
that's my point I think it's really stupid

1718
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
how much did it how much

1719
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
how much did it actually mean

1720
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
then well that's that's kind of like

1721
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
the whole like reflection point like oh I

1722
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
guess there wasn't much there to begin with and that's

1723
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
really unfortunate there you go

1724
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
so I feel the same way

1725
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
bummer

1726
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
man I watched Godzilla vs Kong

1727
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
what a cool movie

1728
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
it was so stupid it was the best

1729
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
it was it was

1730
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
it was a monkey and a lizard punching

1731
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
it was all I could have ever wanted

1732
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I've heard I've heard mixed

1733
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I've heard seen some people saying it was base

1734
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and I've heard some people saying it was cringe

1735
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
it was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time

1736
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
whether they were

1737
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
gunning for the monkey or the

1738
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
crocodile yeah who who wins

1739
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
who wins Godzilla definitively

1740
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
wins

1741
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
so okay so

1742
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
you were right

1743
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
uh yeah I guess

1744
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I mean I'm sick

1745
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
you you were saying on Twitter

1746
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
you were arguing on Twitter that like

1747
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
you know obviously Godzilla

1748
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
is gonna has to win there's no way

1749
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
you couldn't

1750
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
but it was really cool it was cool the way

1751
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
they did the fight like they made it like

1752
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
like Godzilla is like a big tanky guy

1753
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
who moves slow but Kong could like swing between

1754
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
buildings and was like dodging all the hits and stuff

1755
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
like as soon as he took a good hit from Godzilla he went down

1756
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm like yeah that's

1757
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
if they were gonna fight that's probably how it would go down

1758
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
you know it was it was pretty fucking cool

1759
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
and there's lots there's lots of polygons moving

1760
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
around there's lots of shading and lighting and like

1761
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
good punching and buildings blew apart

1762
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
uh every time a human was on

1763
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
screen it was the cringiest thing of all time

1764
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
but luckily like half

1765
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
the movie like the main character of

1766
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
the movie was King Kong and it was really

1767
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
cool he like he like

1768
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
new sign language and signed to a little

1769
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
girl and it was smart

1770
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
it was so fucking cool like this

1771
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
little girl taught him they lived on an island with

1772
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
it was the dumbest movie of all time

1773
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
and I loved it

1774
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
watch it it's great

1775
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
okay turn two

1776
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I'm gonna be honest I

1777
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
probably won't watch it but I

1778
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I don't expect you to maybe

1779
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
someone in the audience will

1780
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
take that advice

1781
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I was just watching the one letter of media

1782
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I had a half in the bag about it and it looks

1783
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
like visually look pretty funny

1784
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
it's fucking sick

1785
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
pretty funny

1786
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
it's the worst Mechagodzilla design though

1787
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
definitely the worst Mechagodzilla design of all of them

1788
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
where would this

1789
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
rank in Godzilla films

1790
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
would you say Mr. Godzilla

1791
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
hmm

1792
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
um I mean all the

1793
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
legendary films have been kind of like

1794
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
okay

1795
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
but not great like

1796
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I don't think these are better than like the classic

1797
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Japanese monster movies

1798
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
just because like it's weird

1799
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
it's weird

1800
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
because like Godzilla's supposed to be like this

1801
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
like allegory for like you know like the

1802
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
dangers of like nuclear weapons and stuff

1803
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and it's hard for

1804
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
American audiences to empathize that

1805
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
when they are the nukers and not the nukees

1806
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
so like

1807
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
they change Godzilla's allegory

1808
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
in these legendary films from a

1809
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
nuclear thing to

1810
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
to an ecological allegory

1811
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
like he's like at the top of

1812
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
like the ecological food chain

1813
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
like Titans are like reversing the

1814
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
damage done by man to the environment

1815
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
and shit and that's kind of cringe

1816
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
but it's more like relevant to western audiences

1817
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
but it kind of like

1818
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
reduces Godzilla what he was supposed to be

1819
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
like thematically but like half the movies

1820
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
are just like him fighting with

1821
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
robots and like has nothing to do with that

1822
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
message anymore anyway so I don't get too bent out of shape about it

1823
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
but um

1824
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
it's kind of strange but there's

1825
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
the punchings really good and like this is

1826
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
the only time you're ever going to see like

1827
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
these classic monsters rendered

1828
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
in such high detail animating really subtly

1829
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
that you can't get out of rubber suits

1830
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
so for the novelty of that alone I enjoy

1831
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
them a lot because it's kind of how my child brain

1832
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
imagined all the fights happening

1833
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
on screen when I watch them when I was five like seeing

1834
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
that realized in real time is kind of cool

1835
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
okay

1836
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
but

1837
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
King Kong

1838
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
flanged or unflanged he's

1839
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
flanged because he's not in orangutan

1840
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
no that's why he lost

1841
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
yeah

1842
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
he was a flanged orangutan

1843
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
he's been flanged

1844
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Godzilla's not flanged

1845
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
no not at all

1846
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
so it was Godzilla supposed to be like a gorilla

1847
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
he looks like one

1848
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I mean no Godzilla

1849
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
King Kong yeah yeah

1850
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
he's a gorilla man

1851
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I'm going to find some gorilla facts

1852
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
one of the he's perhaps the greatest of them all

1853
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
oh no

1854
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
he's the king

1855
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
oh god

1856
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
alright let's look up some gorilla facts

1857
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
here we go

1858
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I might not find anything really funny

1859
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I know that gorillas can bench press

1860
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
like five thousand pounds

1861
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
they're like so fucking strong it's insane

1862
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
but like they're also

1863
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
they have to eat like

1864
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
constantly

1865
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
they constantly have to be eating

1866
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
because they're muscles

1867
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
they're talking energy

1868
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
inefficient

1869
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
the movie had the funniest opening scene

1870
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
of any movie ever

1871
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
it was like some song was playing

1872
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
and it was just Kong waking up

1873
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
and going through his day like a person

1874
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
like taking a shower and a waterfall

1875
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
oh okay

1876
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
like treating him like he's just a person getting up

1877
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
like you know how they do that in movies

1878
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
like the movie starts and someone like wakes up

1879
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
and goes about their morning routine

1880
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
but it was just a big giant monster

1881
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
it was a ten out of ten way to start

1882
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
hilarious

1883
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I just opened up the Wikipedia article for gorilla

1884
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
and I saw a picture of a gorilla

1885
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
and I thought what if I was

1886
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
standing where the photographer was

1887
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
looking at this gorilla

1888
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
with him looking back at me

1889
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
and I'm so fucking scared

1890
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I would hope that they're using a zoom lens

1891
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
in a very far away

1892
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
if he wanted to

1893
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
and he probably does

1894
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
he could just lope over to me in like seconds

1895
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and then he'd head off and rip me limb from limb

1896
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and it would just be a funny joke to him

1897
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
yeah but look at his expression

1898
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
he's gonna do it

1899
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
he looks like he's thinking about it

1900
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
it's like

1901
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
you're looking like a snack right there

1902
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
he's like

1903
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
it would be funny if I just

1904
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
if I just bifurcated

1905
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
that guy right now

1906
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
and he's right

1907
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
it would be funny that's the fucked up part

1908
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
to be effective

1909
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
if I had a

1910
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
if I just had a wand

1911
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
if I had a wand with

1912
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
all I need is one

1913
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
mana

1914
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
one mana reducer

1915
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
and one

1916
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
and a chainsaw

1917
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
and a good old fashioned multicast

1918
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
in the fight of gorilla versus ben

1919
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
give ben a wand and prep time

1920
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
he can beat anybody

1921
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I can beat any animal

1922
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
prep time

1923
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
easy that's my superpower

1924
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
they're fucking scary

1925
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I've learned the only gorilla fact I need to know

1926
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
which is that they're scary as fuck

1927
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
they're so big and they can look at you

1928
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
and be like

1929
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
they're so big

1930
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
that I poop my fucking pants

1931
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
and even think about them

1932
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
today's gorilla fact

1933
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
gorillas will make you poop your pants

1934
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
with fear

1935
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
that's pretty fucked up

1936
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
it's pretty fucked up how they evolved to do that

1937
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
but I mean I guess nature is pissed

1938
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
well it's like human reflex

1939
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
if you poop your pants

1940
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
then you way less

1941
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
so that you can run away faster

1942
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
makes sense

1943
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
oh

1944
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
they're poached for bush meat

1945
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
like Australia

1946
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
what's bush meat

1947
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
bush meat is meat from wildlife

1948
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
species that are hunted for human consumption

1949
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
oh so meat

1950
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
so meat is what you're describing

1951
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I think they mean like

1952
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
non farmed animals

1953
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
yeah I guess

1954
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
it'd be like not allowed

1955
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
meat

1956
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
oh bush meat

1957
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
is not

1958
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
bush meat is not to be confused with bush food

1959
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
which is

1960
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
any food native to Australia

1961
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
and used as sustenance by indigenous Australians

1962
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
so

1963
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
okay

1964
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
alright

1965
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
no bush

1966
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I guess people fucking hunt gorillas for meat

1967
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
that's so fucked

1968
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
a silverback gorilla is typically

1969
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
more than 12 years of age

1970
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
so he's basically a twink

1971
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
that he's gonna kill you

1972
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
if you hunt a gorilla

1973
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
and kill it for meat

1974
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
that sounds like a way for a human to become flanged

1975
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
that's pretty alpha

1976
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
taking down a gorilla

1977
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I think you have to beat him

1978
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
you have to fight him gorilla style

1979
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
which you can't do

1980
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
you simply can't

1981
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
you have to beat him with no prep time

1982
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Tarzan it's possible

1983
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
true Tarzan did fucking wreck shit

1984
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
and he could surf on vines

1985
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
he was pretty cool

1986
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I think he could surf on vines

1987
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
but I don't think he could beat a gorilla in a fist fight

1988
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
no no no do you remember the movie

1989
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
where he got

1990
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
no I haven't actually

1991
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
seen the movie

1992
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
you haven't seen Tarzan the movie Disney

1993
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
TM

1994
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
we just mentioned the movie and got a copyright claim

1995
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
from Disney

1996
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
this is a classic film Ben

1997
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
well

1998
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000

01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
what are you looking at a gorilla again

2002
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
are you pooping your pants

2003
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
no I'm sorry I got a message on

disturbing me a little bit

2006
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I'm sorry is it relevant

2007
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
or secret

2008
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
okay wait hold on

2009

hold on

2010
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
at least I cut this stuff

2011
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
a few moments later

2012
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
you guys still there yep

2013
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
sorry about that

2014
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
boo

2015
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
sorry

2016
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I had to

2017
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I got some

2018
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
weird shit was going on with my discord

2019
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
but I guess it's fixed now

2020
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
sorry everyone

2021
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
for that awkward pause at Eleazar Cut

2022
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

2023
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
the awkward pause they wouldn't know about

2024
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
if you didn't know

2025
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
but I'm mentioning it

2026
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Ben answer the question

2027
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
what's the question

2028
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
have you seen Tarzan the film

2029
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I think I've seen

2030
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
most of it

2031
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I don't honestly I'm not sure

2032
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I might not have seen it actually

2033
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
do you remember it from the Kingdom Hearts level

2034
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I remember Tarzan surfing

2035
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
on vines

2036
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I vaguely remember the Kingdom Hearts level

2037
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I remember Phil Collins

2038
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
yeah

2039
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
you basically remember

2040
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
I think I've probably watched

2041
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
the first half of it a couple times

2042
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
the Phil Collins soundtrack

2043
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
is unironically based

2044
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I've listened to it by myself

2045
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
like by itself

2046
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
before and it's just

2047
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
that guy knows how to play a drum and sing

2048
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
honestly

2049
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
my dad used to listen

2050
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
to Phil Collins and as a kid I like

2051
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
hated it I hated all the music my dad

2052
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
liked but now I hear

2053
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Genesis and I'm like

2054
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
okay this is kind of epic though

2055
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
this is kind of fucking epic

2056
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
it means you're getting old

2057
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
it means I have taste now

2058
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
that's how old people defend the fact that they're getting old

2059
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
but my dad also likes

2060
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
smooth jazz

2061
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
and easy listening and I hate that shit

2062
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
so it's not

2063
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
it's not total crossover

2064
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
everybody just likes Genesis

2065
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
what's that one

2066
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
what's that one

2067
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
about the

2068
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
easy lover

2069
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
that's a good song

2070
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
no singing

2071
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
say something

2072
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
for god's sake

2073
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
are we ready already

2074
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
we're giving up this fast

2075
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I guess we're an hour in you wanna go to voicemails

2076
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I was about to say it's pretty

2077
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
pretty normal to go to voicemails

2078
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I guess we're an hour

2079
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
this has gone by really fast

2080
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
we only talked about one thing

2081
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
this hour has blasted by

2082
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I haven't had much to talk about this week

2083
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
because of the

2084
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
previously said

2085
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
trying to live

2086
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
ouch

2087
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
which sucks

2088
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I wanted to get back

2089
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I wanted to work on that comic idea

2090
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I think I have an idea

2091
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I need to get going

2092
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
because the deadline for that thing

2093
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
is the end of April

2094
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
this is good

2095
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
to mention it

2096
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I wanted to mention it again

2097
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
the kato anthology

2098
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I believe the deadline is the end of April

2099
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
if you want to submit your comics

2100
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
to that

2101
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I mean

2102
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I don't know

2103
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
what if I make a one page comic

2104
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
and nothing happens

2105
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
you could have something

2106
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
you could have something happen in one page

2107
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
no, no, it can't be done

2108
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
it's a show about nothing

2109
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
no, nothing happens Jerry

2110
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
it's a four panel comic

2111
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
and it's the same panel four times

2112
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I've done that before

2113
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I've made that twitter joke before

2114
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
just have it be like

2115
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
27 pages of the red man comic

2116
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
link in the description

2117
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
if you the listener are

2118
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
or know a comic artist

2119
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
who might be interested in having their work printed

2120
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
for pay

2121
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
you keep all your intellectual property rights

2122
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
in the kato anthology

2123
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
they're gonna be starting a kickstarter for it

2124
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I don't exactly know when but soon

2125
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
soon after the deadline

2126
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
which is the end of April for submissions

2127
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
check it out

2128
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
if you please

2129
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
so what are you saying

2130
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
you're a bitch

2131
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I'm gonna do it

2132
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I'm just sort of

2133
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
fucking stupid

2134
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
oh, I see

2135
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
technically I could have been trying to work

2136
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
while sick

2137
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
but I feel like I don't want it

2138
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
well, that's hard

2139
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
yeah, it's hard

2140
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
that doesn't work well

2141
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I had something happen

2142
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
especially like just

2143
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
today

2144
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
and like last night and this morning

2145
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I got messaged by

2146
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
on twitter

2147
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
by one of the

2148
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
people

2149
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
who I constantly see

2150
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
replying to Christine Weston Chandler

2151
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
on twitter

2152
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
calling her all kinds of terrible things

2153
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
saying all kinds of nasty stuff about her

2154
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
you're a pervert

2155
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
you're a predator

2156
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
you're a pedophile

2157
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
and I

2158
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
and you know

2159
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I don't like these people

2160
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
it's really bizarre

2161
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
they respond to everything Chris does

2162
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
and I hate them and I don't like it

2163
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
it's an ugly look

2164
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
so this person messages me

2165
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I don't even remember why

2166
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
and it doesn't really matter

2167
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
but she said something

2168
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
about that

2169
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
and then she was like wait

2170
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
you're the guy who did that lecture

2171
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
you a white knight now

2172
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
that doesn't make any sense

2173
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
and I'm like listen

2174
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I respond to her and I'm like listen

2175
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
quit stalking Chris

2176
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
on twitter

2177
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
it's pathetic

2178
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
it's bizarre

2179
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
it's not a good look and it doesn't

2180
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
accomplish anything so just knock it off

2181
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
and she

2182
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
replied to me

2183
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
well first I mean

2184
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
she said

2185
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
in her poorly spelled

2186
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
grammatically

2187
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
semi-coherent

2188
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
rant back to me

2189
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
she included

2190
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
many a transphobic

2191
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
comments which did not

2192
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
sit well with me but

2193
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
in a mix among there

2194
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
was the sentiment that

2195
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
like Chris sent me

2196
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
unsolicited dick pics

2197
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
and so that's why I hate them

2198
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
and think they're a pervert

2199
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
and continually

2200
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
doing this

2201
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
and I had to take a step back and be like

2202
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
you know

2203
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
that is a legitimate grievance that this person has

2204
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
so

2205
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
maybe I partly feel a little bad

2206
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
for scolding them about it

2207
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
but at the same time

2208
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
it's still not productive

2209
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
what they're doing

2210
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
it's still not helping anything

2211
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
you can have a legitimate grievance

2212
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
while taking action that in no way

2213
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
you can get rid of that problem

2214
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
or settle that grievance

2215
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
right

2216
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
so I guess I felt a little abashed

2217
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
like

2218
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I hadn't considered that

2219
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
maybe Chris actually had done something

2220
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
which I guess she did

2221
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
but I guess it doesn't change my opinion

2222
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
that much

2223
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I still think they should just stop

2224
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I don't know

2225
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
so I guess I felt

2226
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
weird about that

2227
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I don't know

2228
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
how else to describe

2229
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I don't know what else to say about that

2230
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
but that was a funny story

2231
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
that happened to me

2232
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
believe it

2233
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
alright

2234
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
voicemails

2235
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
for sure

2236
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
bass

2237
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
let's get over to

2238
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
speakpipe.com

2239
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
slash

2240
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
pcp voicemail

2241
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
speak

2242
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
there's so many

2243
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
it's okay we'll blast through

2244
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
we'll go so fast

2245
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
speakpipe.com

2246
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
you're correct

2247
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
if we go to the second page

2248
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
the first one here is called

2249
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
five months late

2250
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
are we ready

2251
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
here we go

2252
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
three two one go

2253
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I haven't caught up to the newest pcp episodes

2254
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
but when I just watched, Tom essentially said

2255
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
that people who have a problem with the gender binary

2256
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
should try to get rid of gender language altogether

2257
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
instead of adding more choices that people have to learn

2258
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
as a probably cis male

2259
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I think that both of these are valid ways of abolishing gender

2260
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
so I support both

2261
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
if you get rid of gender language then boom

2262
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
gender language is gone, cool

2263
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
but if you keep adding more choices that essentially reaches the same result

2264
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
where the way you refer to someone becomes an expression of identity

2265
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
title

2266
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
or even just something akin to a name

2267
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
by virtue of there just being so many choices

2268
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
that are based on gender

2269
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
and becomes an individualistic thing

2270
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I do remember what he's talking about

2271
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
and what I was saying wasn't that

2272
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
that was the better choice

2273
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
the point was that it would be

2274
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
easier for people to understand

2275
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
because I think a lot of people get confused

2276
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
by

2277
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
non-binary gender pronouns

2278
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
and by trying to reduce choices

2279
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
and make things simpler

2280
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
it's easier for most people to understand and to make things more complicated

2281
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I don't know

2282
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I don't know anyone

2283
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I don't see anybody using

2284
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
like neopronouns

2285
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
they don't seem to be

2286
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I don't feel like they caught on

2287
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
no, I kind of think

2288
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
maybe that's for the best

2289
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
it's just ammo for

2290
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
bad actors to use

2291
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
well, well

2292
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I don't like that argument

2293
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I don't like that argument because

2294
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
that sort of places the blame

2295
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I don't think it's a blame thing

2296
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
it's a little bit like

2297
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
they were asking for it

2298
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
that's harsh

2299
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
that's harsh to say

2300
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
but I feel like it's kind of the same

2301
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
like

2302
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I think I should criticize it

2303
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
because it's like

2304
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
it's less efficient or whatever

2305
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I don't know

2306
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
no

2307
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
maybe I just didn't

2308
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I never got it

2309
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I guess I'm just personally I never got it

2310
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I'm personally glad that it hasn't caught on

2311
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
so I haven't had to reckon with it

2312
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I mean

2313
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
all of the sort of gender stuff

2314
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
at one point for me

2315
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
was confusing

2316
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
but I've gotten used to what little

2317
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
changes I've had to make

2318
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
right

2319
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I feel like naturally

2320
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
people have just accepted that it's easier

2321
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
to just say

2322
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
he, she and they

2323
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
as the three main things

2324
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
and

2325
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
special words

2326
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
are sort of

2327
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
not really

2328
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
that you can have them

2329
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
and I guess

2330
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
if I met a person who

2331
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
tried to use them

2332
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I would use them for that person

2333
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
like in wider society

2334
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
it's so confusing having more than three

2335
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I don't think people are ready to

2336
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
like branch out

2337
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I don't think they need to but I'm not known

2338
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
non-binary so I don't know

2339
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
whether there's some like yearning

2340
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
for a special word that isn't they

2341
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
maybe some people feel like that

2342
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I hope they

2343
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
as the default becomes

2344
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
more normalized

2345
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I think we should all just

2346
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
default to that and use it

2347
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
as more

2348
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I think it's great

2349
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I like it

2350
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
everyone's a they

2351
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
it's better this way

2352
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
it's they

2353
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
and then their literal name

2354
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
it's they way

2355
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
or the highway

2356
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
yeah

2357
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
got them

2358
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
okay next voicemail is called

2359
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
noita sucks lol

2360
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
okay three two one go

2361
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
no it is a piece of your game because

2362
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
when you go on top of the mountain to get the orb that's cool

2363
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
but then you have to go across the desert to get the other orb

2364
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
that's bullshit you have to go way too far

2365
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
and it takes too much time to get just 25 health

2366
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
in any ways because you don't want to give yourself a disadvantage

2367
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
but of course it didn't matter anyways

2368
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
because you got shit rng that run

2369
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
and the first three floors there's no fucking good ones

2370
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
and you have nothing and you get to the fourth floor

2371
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
and you die and you know what

2372
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
that doesn't matter because you already died because you crossed the fucking lava lake

2373
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
and you got killed by that

2374
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
you're a freaking nerd don't go for the desert orb

2375
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
you still fucking killed you because

2376
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
you got stuck on a fucking rock

2377
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
and it's like

2378
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
in the fucking game it's terrible like the first floor

2379
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
it's like you get terrible rng every time

2380
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
you go for the gold

2381
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
you go for the gold biome

2382
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
first thing every run you freaking dweeb

2383
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
no you just go down the holy mountain

2384
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
you just go down the mountain

2385
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and pray for a chainsaw

2386
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
if you put it on your wand you go

2387
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
because you're stupid and you didn't pick electric immunity

2388
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
you fucking idiot

2389
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
and that doesn't matter because

2390
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
the only way you can win this shitty game

2391
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
is if you get good rng

2392
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
like literally you're just trying to get like

2393
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
winning is so easy

2394
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
every fucking game

2395
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
or some other garbage

2396
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
there's so many more ways to do it

2397
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
you just don't know

2398
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
you just don't understand

2399
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
that's true, mana plus is the most

2400
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
you don't need it

2401
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
you don't need it

2402
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
it's just way easier if you have it

2403
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
this person is a fucking dweeb

2404
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
that felt like a

2405
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
ye old PCP argument

2406
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
right in my living room

2407
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
it really did

2408
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
god, imagine

2409
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
is it a nightmare and do I cry

2410
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
if I don't get any chainsaws

2411
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
or I don't get any spark bolt with triggers

2412
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
or I don't get any mana reducers

2413
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
yes

2414
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
but you can still win

2415
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
you can still win without those things

2416
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
it's winning is trivial

2417
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
winning is trivial

2418
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
you're a freaking...

2419
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
imagine what a fucking dork you have to be

2420
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
to start your run and be like

2421
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
op, but I mean

2422
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
you can't start the run

2423
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
by going to the...

2424
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
what do you go down in the mountain

2425
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
and you look for levitatium so you can get over the hill

2426
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
and walk over the... you're not supposed to do that

2427
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
you're just supposed to go down the mountain

2428
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
yeah, you can be a...

2429
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
oh, I'll spend an hour walking over to the

2430
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
desert and get that extra 25

2431
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
you just go

2432
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
and you shoot everything

2433
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
and you get

2434
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
the hearts and you get

2435
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
the chainsaws and you go

2436
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
and that's it

2437
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
and you just do it really fast

2438
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
and you just blast through and if you get bad rng

2439
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
good, it took you 5 seconds to get here

2440
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
so you just do it again

2441
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
that's how you

2442
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
fucking win the game

2443
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
in my opinion

2444
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
okay

okay

2575
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I just imagined a little parakeet saying that

2576
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
that was a little convincing

2577
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
that was a little more convincing than the other ones

2578
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
this made me reconsider some things

2579
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
okay next one

2580
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000

2589
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000

2602
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
straight he's committed to the bit

2603
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
and you know what is working for me

2604
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000

2605
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000

01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
your totally non-fraud

2607
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
fraudulent election

2608
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
sir the next voicemail is from

2609
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000

3, 2, 1, go

2611
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
my worst fear came to

2612
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Trixie left the

2613
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
PCP

2614
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I'm still struggling to

2615
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
get over it

2616
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
but at the end of the day

2617
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
it was her choice

2618
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
and I hope she'll eventually decide to come on

2619
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
even if it's like on an episode

2620
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
to say goodbye

2621
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I just want you all to be true to yourselves

2622
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
and maybe it's time to

2623
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
start looking for recruitment again

2624
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
and again

2625
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
hmm

2626
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
we've such an illustrious history of bringing people in

2627
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
we've never looked for recruitment in the first time

2628
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
no

2629
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
there will be no recruitment

2630
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
there will be no

2631
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
you gotta be grandfathered in

2632
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
that's true you gotta be grandfathered in

2633
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
new members

2634
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
they only poison the well

2635
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
we gotta keep the bloodlines pure

2636
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
we can only breed with each other

2637
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
no

2638
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
that's how it's gotta be

2639
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
they can't fuck

2640
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
anyone else

2641
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
hmm

2642
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I

2643
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
while I

2644
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
while I do not

2645
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
while I can't pretend

2646
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
to understand

2647
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
being

2648
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
sad that Trixie has left

2649
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I nevertheless

2650
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
recognize that it is a valid

2651
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
response and I empathize

2652
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
with the general concept

2653
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
of sadness

2654
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
LeMau

2655
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
uh

2656
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
that's my statement on the matter

2657
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
uh

2658
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
said at the funeral

2659
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000

2660
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
end with LeMau

2661
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000

batman

2743
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
when you've bitten off more than

2744
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
you can chew well

2745
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000

2746
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000

2747
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000

but you know what he's right

2754
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000

2756
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
shitting off more than you can

2757
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000

2764
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
speaking of which next voicemail is called

2765
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
a message from your gaping ass

2766
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
oh three two one

2767
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
go

2768
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
hey ben I have a problem I think you can

2769
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
relate to of course

2770
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
know why I really fucking hate the cast

2771
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
button on my phone

2772
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
do you know how annoying it is

2773
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
when you're playing with your whatchamado

2774
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
cast button and then suddenly you

2775
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
accidentally press the cast button

2776
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
and then oh look at that

2777
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
now all your roommates know you jack off the tranny

2778
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
porn and they're like wow

2779
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
look at this huge fucking faggot

2780
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
he likes jacking it off to lady boys

2781
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
and you know what

2782
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
maybe I fucking like it okay

2783
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
it's not your goddamn business you'll have to

2784
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
fucking look at it stop judging me

2785
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
anyway I hope

2786
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
there's a later setting that's introduced

2787
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
where I can turn off the cast button

2788
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
anyway uh tell me what you think I should do

2789
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
about this problem

2790
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
uh embrace it stop getting so

2791
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
worked up about people seeing the porn

2792
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
you watch you should just

2793
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
you should be

2794
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
proud

2795
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
of yourself

2796
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
proud of your boy

2797
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I'll make you proud of your boy

2798
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
just switch to a browser that doesn't have

2799
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
a cast that you built in

2800
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
just be proud to be a faggot

2801
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I guess is all I can say

2802
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I mean it's cool

2803
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
look it's not it's not it's not wrong

2804
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
to like a penis no matter

2805
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
what your sexual orientation

2806
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
because penises are funny

2807
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
no they're serious no

2808
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
shut up they're serious business

2809
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
you gotta fucking

2810
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
take them for

2811
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
for a spin

2812
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
don't be late

2813
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
what are you saying

2814
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
next voicemail

2815
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
please save me

2816
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
next voicemail is called panic play

2817
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
date three two one go

2818
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
many months ago

2819
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
tom had mentioned that there is an empty

2820
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
space in our hearts

2821
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
and minds that the game boy used

2822
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
to fill and I think I have found

2823
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
something that will fulfill that niche

2824
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
it is um

2825
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
called the panic play date

2826
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
you should check it out

2827
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
google it right now looks cool

2828
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
it's designed by teenage engineering

2829
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
um

2830
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
it's like a game boy with a little crank

2831
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
on the side like a fishing reel

2832
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
so I would imagine that would be

2833
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
an obvious choice of game

2834
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
um

2835
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
and yes the development

2836
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
gets free and open source if you want to

2837
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
mess around with it I have looked at it

2838
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
but I'm very uncreative

2839
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
what is the point

2840
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
let me know what you think

2841
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I think it looks cool I'm excited for it

2842
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
should be coming out later this year

2843
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
and I

2844
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I'm really really curious as to

2845
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
what people do with the crank

2846
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
um yeah I remember

2847
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
seeing this a while ago

2848
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
uh like announced like ah

2849
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
it's a revolutionary new idea

2850
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
it's a thing that looks a little bit like a game boy

2851
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
so you remember it so you're just nostalgic

2852
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
and it's got some sort of games on it

2853
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
and you crank the crank

2854
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
to charge the battery and also

2855
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
it's a gameplay feature thingy

2856
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
it's like a Nintendo

2857
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
esque gimmick

2858
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I'm like eh cool I guess

2859
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
okay

2860
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
how many things do you want a crank

2861
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
well that's the whole thing

2862
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I feel like the crank is probably going to do more harm than good

2863
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I feel like it was a gimmick idea that probably

2864
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
should not have been included

2865
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
yeah but it's

2866
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I mean without the crank

2867
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
just a knockoff game boy

2868
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I think if they yeah that's why they have the crank

2869
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
uh maybe

2870
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
they don't have like good games I don't think

2871
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I don't think the games are what they're selling it on

2872
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
it's just the game I'm assuming it's a platform

2873
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
and I don't see why I would want that

2874
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
it's an open platform that people can develop for

2875
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
kind of like kind of like how pico a got big

2876
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
hmm

2877
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
yeah so

2878
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
so it sounds like they should have just embraced the fact

2879
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
that they're just a knockoff game boy

2880
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
and just let people develop for that

2881
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I mean there's a whole market for like

2882
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
knockoff game boys that like people like

2883
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
so yeah

2884
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I don't I guess I don't mind the idea

2885
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
of like having like a crank for like different

2886
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
kind of like gameplay experiments

2887
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
and like people probably do cool things with it

2888
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
but I'm just thinking like

2889
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
like when I think of a game boy I think of something I can

2890
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
easily place in my pocket and that crank is going to

2891
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
fuck that up it's going to be annoying to have to

2892
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
like oh gotta move the crank and

2893
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
it'll get caught in my pocket trying to take it out

2894
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
yeah

2895
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
yeah it looks it's going to be jutting

2896
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
out I wish it could like fold it in

2897
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
or something

2898
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
can you can you like

2899
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I don't know maybe

2900
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
up in the back when you're not

2901
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
when you're not cranking it

2902
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
yeah I can see on the Wikipedia

2903
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
there's an image of it

2904
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
but I'm also

2905
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
seeing

2906
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
how much is it that's important if it's over

2907
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
$99 it's a failure

2908
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
like that was a great thing about game boys

2909
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
they were like disposable and didn't cost a lot of money

2910
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
notable indie game

2911
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
developers such as

2912
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Keita Takahashi which is the guy who made

2913
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Katamari so

2914
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
he's making a game for it

2915
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
uh cranking times

2916
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
time travel adventure I like that guy

2917
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
he's really cool so

2918
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I'll have a look at that

2919
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
fascinating

2920
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
uh

2921
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
cranking time travel adventure

2922
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
gameplay

2923
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
it's $150

2924
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
it's a little pricey

2925
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
yeah

2926
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I mean

2927
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
it's also yellow the worst color

2928
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I would have to see like what

2929
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I mean if it had really quality

2930
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
games I feel like $150 is fair

2931
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
but I mean does it

2932
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
is the question

2933
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
every console lives or dies by its library

2934
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
sure yeah sure

2935
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
oh it does

2936
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
it does kind of tuck itself in

2937
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
well that's good

2938
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
that's much better

2939
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
if it couldn't do that it would be really annoying

2940
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
yeah that's true

2941
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I don't know

2942
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
it's like mostly consolidated there

2943
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
that's pretty solid

2944
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
uh

2945
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
next one

2946
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
yeah

2947
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
next one is called Kyoto Ninja Clan

2948

konnichiwa

2951
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
this is ninja-sama

2952
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
where could

2953
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
samurai-sama

2954
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
be

2955
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
he disappeared

2956
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
maybe Kyoto Ninja Clan

2957
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
have

2958
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
something to do

2959
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
without this

2960
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
also it's possible

2961
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
beno-sinto-san

2962
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
beno-sinto-san

2963
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
also

2964
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
betre

2965
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Kyoto Ninja Clan

2966
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000

2967
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
return on ninja scroll

2968
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000

01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
ben

2972
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
what do you have against the continent

2973
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
of Asia

2974
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
why is the entire island nation of Japan

2975
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
out to destroy it

2976
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I have nothing against them

2977
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I just love scrolls

2978
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
so much I'll do anything for them

2979
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
even betre

2980
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I'll betre any clan for a scroll

2981
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
if I see

2982
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
if I see a quality scroll

2983
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I'm gonna join the clan

2984
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
and then I'm gonna

2985
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
you got your first wall scroll in high school

2986
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
and ever since then it's all been downhill

2987
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I was full metal alchemist

2988
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I got it at anime boston

2989
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
anyway next voice mail

2990
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
innocent pork chops

2991
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
mayoral masquerade

2992
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
3 2 1 go

2993
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
there was a little piggy

2994
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
except that pig got too big

2995
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
we're here to cut him down

2996
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
to size

2997
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
and snap him like he was a twig

2998
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
this hog had had a reason

2999
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
to do something he would

3000
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
regret

3001
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
an order from the city

3002
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:25,000
mayor

3003
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
to shut down machines

3004
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
and there

3005
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
there was a little pig

3006
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
got in a giant charade

3007
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
we have to let him go

3008
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
run free

3009
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
let him escape this

3010
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
masquerade

3011
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
with that in mind

3012
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
could someone call an uber

3013
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
for this swine

3014
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
well if you call an uber

3015
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
for the

3016
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
uber

3017
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
for the giant

3018
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
if you call an uber

3019
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
for the giant hog

3020
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
who has been ordered by the mayor

3021
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
to shut down machines

3022
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
won't he just

3023
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
decommission the uber

3024
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
he can't ride it

3025
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
he'll destroy the vehicle

3026
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
perhaps a horse drawn buggy

3027
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
a pig drawn buggy

3028
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
perhaps

3029
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
animal power

3030
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
animal power

3031
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
power to the people

3032
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
by people I mean beasts

3033
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
that's my recommendation

3034
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
next voicemail is called

3035
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000

01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
but I'm not going to

3042
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000

3043
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000

3044
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
go on

3045
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
fuck him

3046
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
in his

3047
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
brain

3048
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
no

3049
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
you wouldn't dare

3050
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000

cock

3054
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I wonder what it was like

3055
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
to record this

3056
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
that's just

3057
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000

01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000

01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I mean

3072
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I cannot believe these are still going on

I mean he's on message

3074
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
he's on message

3075
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
he has a thesis and he sticks to it

3076
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
and

3077
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I respect it

3078
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I respect the hustle

3079
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
the guy who does this 24-7

3080
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
next voicemail is called

3081
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Joker rap needs critique

3082
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
3, 2, 1, go

3083
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
hi PCP

3084
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
it's me out of character

3085
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I need some

3086
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
feedback on this

3087
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Joker rap I'm making about the Joker

3088
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
okay so here it goes

3089
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
most guys eat mice

3090
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
the Joker eats plaster

3091
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
most guys drive slow

3092
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
the Joker drives faster

3093
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
most guys can't shit

3094
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
the Joker is a master

3095
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
most guys can't do magic

3096
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
but the Joker is a caster

3097
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
most guys can't do math

3098
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
the Joker knows all the factors

3099
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
most guys think they're safe

3100
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
the Joker is bringing a disaster

3101
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
rabbits love breeding

3102
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
the Joker is busy defeating

3103
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
most guys are betas

3104
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
but the Joker is alpha leading

3105
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
okay that's it

3106
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
the actors

3107
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
does not fit I think

3108
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I think maybe trim down

3109
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
the ones that don't work as well

3110
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I keep all of the best ones

3111
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I think

3112
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
the one

3113
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
the Joker knows all the factors

3114
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
there's too many syllables

3115
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
the Joker knows factors

3116
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
the one that's

3117
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
syllable synchronicity

3118
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
I like how the Joker is a master

3119
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
of shitting

3120
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
he never

3121
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
shits off more than he can prove

3122
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
that's what we've learned about the Joker today

3123
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
um

3124
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
that's what was my favorite line personally

3125
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
um

3126
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
next voicemail is called

3127
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000

3132
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000

3135
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000

3136
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
no shaggy I don't

3137
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
it's not wrong

3138
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
next voicemail is called shaggy has

3139
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
a second thought

3140
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000

like

3143
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000

3144
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
have so much power

3145
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000

voicemail is called

3175
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
dm321

3176
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
go

3177
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
as you struggle give someone an uncharacteristically

3178
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
huge amount of strength and throws

3179
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
bin over the side of the fortress

3180
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
bin plummets to his death

3181
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
no

3182
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
don't make it to make a reflex save

3183
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
sounds like we're talking about mechanics

3184
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
they mutter amongst themselves

3185
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
unsure of whether bitcoin

3186
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
bin was the only person

3187
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
with bitcoins in that fortress

3188
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
or whether

3189
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
that lone figure up above

3190
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
may have some as well

3191
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I say to them

3192
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
go away

3193
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
go away please

3194
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
you're on your own

3195
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
shit I've got rid of my only ally

3196
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
and now I'm outnumbered even more than before

3197
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I dispel invisibility

3198
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I was standing here the whole time

3199
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
oh tom

3200
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000

no don't help her no she doesn't deserve it

3204
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
you saw what she just did to me

3205
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
her only friend

3206
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
bitcoin

3207
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I mean

3208
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
true

3209
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
that's why you should kill gib

3210
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
this is my ghost my ghost to speak

3211
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
that's why you should kill gib

3212
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
bitcoin you gotta kill her

3213
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
and then it'll all be yours

3214
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
I'll attempt to pick pocket the bitcoin

3215
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
oh

3216
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
why did you

3217
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
because

3218
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
you should have done that while you were still invisible

3219
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
no no

3220
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
you gotta become visible

3221
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
and then you have to pretend you're an ally

3222
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
then pick pocket

3223
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
while they're defensive

3224
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
if you're still in fight or flight

3225
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
you're gonna be watching your pocket

3226
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
I roll for notice

3227
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
I roll for noticing that

3228
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
no stop

3229
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I hate you

3230
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I try to notice something

3231
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
how do you do that how do you say

3232
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I hope I notice something happening to me

3233
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I think the dm would just guide you through

3234
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
yeah the dm would say

3235
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
roll a perception check

3236
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
roll to notice

3237
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
yeah it's not an action

3238
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I just stand there being like uh oh

3239
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
do I fuck it up

3240
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I grab your ass instead of your coin purse

3241
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
like uh oh I hope I'm not being

3242
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
pickpocketed right now

3243
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I mean when you think about it we're all passively hoping

3244
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
we're not getting pickpocketed right now

3245
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
well now I'm actively

3246
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
instead of all that

3247
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I'm at the top of the wall

3248
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
and the door bridges up

3249
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
the gates closed they can't get in

3250
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
I just uh

3251
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I'm just hiding behind the wall

3252
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
and behind the battlements

3253
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
that's what I do

3254
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
they can't get me

3255
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
you hide behind the battlements

3256
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
what about Tom

3257
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
well that's what that's Tom can do

3258
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
what he wants

3259
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
that's my action

3260
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Ben's in line of sight

3261
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
and we're not in initiative order

3262
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I'm dead I was curled over

3263
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
the fucking wall I'm done

3264
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
if you were still with

3265
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
in line of sight when you fell I would cast

3266
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
feather fall on you and that would drop

3267
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
concentration and so I'd have to lose my

3268
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
visibility and then I'll try

3269
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
how come you get to be a wizard

3270
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
I don't know because Tom says

3271
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
anything it was just

3272
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I'm playing a sorcerer

3273
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
in the game I'm actually playing right now so

3274
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
likely story

3275
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
you're a fucking

3276
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
you're trying to

3277
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
ensorcel us right now with these fanciful

3278
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
tales you're spinning

3279
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
these yarns

3280
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I pick up my wand which has

3281
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
no all the buffs

3282
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
and I cast chain saw

3283
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
on everything

3284
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
yeah that's it

3285
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I hope to god you've stacked it

3286
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
with a mana reducer I just pray

3287
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
okay

3288
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
sounds good

3289
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
DM

3290
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
let me roll

3291
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
for initiative please

3292
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
okay next voicemail is called

3293
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Ben's tweets to Trixie

3294
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
feel free to skip if old news

3295
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
no I will not skip

3296
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
3, 2, 1, go

3297
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I don't know if this will be like old and dead news

3298
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
by the time

3299
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
you respond to this but

3300
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
regarding like all of the

3301
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Trixie drama on Twitter

3302
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
and Ben's say in response to it

3303
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I actually really appreciate

3304
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Ben's tweets even though they are

3305
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
pretty harsh and

3306
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
kind of getting like a little bit

3307
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
maybe mean-spirited at a certain point

3308
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
but just like

3309
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
as like a PCP

3310
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
fan it has been very frustrating

3311
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
to see the situation with Trixie

3312
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
so it's actually somewhat

3313
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
cathartic to have someone just kind of like

3314
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
speak out and just

3315
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
nope the whole situation there

3316
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
so I mean I hope

3317
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
you don't keep on doing it you know

3318
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
forever because that would be a little bit immature

3319
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
but it just

3320
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
has been it

3321
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
it feels

3322
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
feels nice in a weird way

3323
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
but yeah I've been really liking the episodes

3324
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
of the podcast recently I feel like

3325
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
they kind of hit a slump when more

3326
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
of the members left but recently

3327
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
it's been hitting a really good stride so

3328
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I don't know here's to our episodes

3329
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
sorry about this one

3330
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
yeah

3331
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I wouldn't

3332
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I wasn't going to do it

3333
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I wasn't going to say anything

3334
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
the only reason I did

3335
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
is because

3336
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Trixie's crew

3337
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
stepped on my fucking toes

3338
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
stepped on our collective toes

3339
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
and that's the only reason why it had to

3340
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
come to this

3341
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I have been

3342
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
frustrated watching Trixie do

3343
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
everything for a long time

3344
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
now

3345
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
is it frustrating

3346
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
is it embarrassing yes

3347
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
but it's not my business I was just going to leave her to it

3348
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
but

3349
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
there's a point when it becomes my problem

3350
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
and

3351
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
that's what happened

3352
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
so

3353
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
thanks for the voicemail

3354
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
next one

3355
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
is called Roger Roger

3356
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
three two one

3357
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
go

3358
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
so now that Trixie left the show to burn every bridge

3359
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
she has ever made

3360
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
why not try to fix some of the old ones

3361
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
talking monkey and Jeff baby

3362
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
hit them up see if they want to come back

3363
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
for an episode I'm sure they'd be happy to hear from you guys

3364
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
anyway

3365
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
PCP forever

3366
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Tom will never die

3367
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
call me back

3368
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I certainly hope not

3369
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Tom alone will

3370
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
live to upload his consciousness

3371
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
into the fucking cyber mainframe

3372
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
this is the first chance I get

3373
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I mean Jeff

3374
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I don't feel like Jeff knows us at all

3375
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I think Jeff was the only

3376
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
but it would be hilarious if we got Jeff

3377
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
it would be funny

3378
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
it's hilarious in concept

3379
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
in concept only

3380
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I guess I would do it just for the gag

3381
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
but I have no idea what I would

3382
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
say to Jeff

3383
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
and I mean kind of the same for monkey

3384
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
like what do I have to say to monkey

3385
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
there's just so much time that's passed

3386
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
now it's just like

3387
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
it's a different person

3388
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
really

3389
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
it's yeah

3390
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
it's I mean I've thought about it

3391
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
like I've tossed

3392
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
around the idea of like wouldn't it be funny

3393
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
if we had monkey

3394
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I asked monkey to guess but like

3395
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
do I really want to

3396
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
not really

3397
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
my heart of hearts it's not what I desire

3398
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
against a monkey return

3399
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
I don't really hate monkey

3400
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
or anything it's just sort of like

3401
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I just don't want to talk to him

3402
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I mean it would be fine to have like

3403
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
my logic on again but I don't want to

3404
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
yeah

3405
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
yeah

3406
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I sort of yeah

3407
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
it's kind of similar

3408
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
not that they're equivalent it's just the same sort of feeling I have

3409
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
nothing would come of that

3410
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
I don't feel for me

3411
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
yeah

3412
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I guess I agree

3413
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
okay next one is called literally me

3414
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
three two one go

3415
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
and the podcast

3416
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
go back to being an alt right

3417
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
podcast now

3418
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
leave

3419
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
no

3420
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
no alt right

3421
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
it could though it could though

3422
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
no Ben Ben

3423
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
but I'm dying

3424
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
everyone says I'm right on Twitter

3425
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
and it feels good so I think

3426
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
maybe I should start leaning

3427
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
into it maybe I should start leaning

3428
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
into it

3429
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
oh god

3430
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
I've always led

3431
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
you know I've always led an alternative

3432
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
lifestyle what if I let an

3433
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
alt right

3434
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
turn it right

3435
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
keep joking about it I'm gonna have to start saying

3436
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
things like vowsh

3437
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
mmm

3438
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
mmm

3439
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Bosch hasn't made a video on it so I don't have

3440
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
an opinion Bosch hasn't made a video on the PCP

3441
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
so I don't know what I feel about it

3442
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I don't know

3443
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
it's it's it's

3444
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
it's hard to say it's just

3445
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
it's just so complicated

3446
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I need that man I need that man

3447
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
to cut through the bullshit

3448
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I need that man to slap

3449
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
his hands together

3450
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
when you look at comments

3451
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
on like the the lectures like

3452
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
specifically I look at the anamorphs and the guiltier

3453
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
lectures obviously because like they're the ones I do

3454
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
and there's just tons of people being like

3455
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
are they

3456
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
seriously misogynist and I'm just like

3457
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
can you really not tell

3458
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
it's a joke like

3459
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I don't even I don't even remember

3460
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
like what are they talking about

3461
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
like there are some times when like in the

3462
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
anamorphs one where Nate is like

3463
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
saying like haha a woman wrote this lol

3464
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
but like clearly as a joke

3465
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
and like it happens like twice I think and it's just

3466
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
like

3467
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
yeah I don't know like

3468
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I don't yeah

3469
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
yeah what

3470
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
I guess what is there are they are they really

3471
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
misogynist you really can't read the room

3472
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
at all I don't fucking know

3473
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
like I haven't

3474
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
yeah I haven't watched in a while but like

3475
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I assume I assume

3476
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
there's laughter and it's like

3477
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
a yeah so

3478
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
the I don't know

3479
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
it's I don't fucking know it's pretty funny

3480
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
it's pretty funny that a woman wrote a

3481
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
book I mean yeah

3482
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
what do they think of next I know it's crazy

3483
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Harry Potter

3484
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
oh

3485
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
see see this is why

3486
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
women shouldn't be allowed to write books because then

3487
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
because I mean we've seen what happened

3488
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
we've seen what happened with JK Rowling

3489
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
how many times are we going to let them get away with this

3490
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
this has to be the last time we have to put

3491
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
our foot down

3492
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
we did it guys we're an alt-right podcast again

3493
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
yeah

3494
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
I will push back against this

3495
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
damn damn

3496
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
I don't feel strong enough to fight this

3497
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
but I will I will just say

3498
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
don't do that

3499
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
get it Tom she's disease killer

3500
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
while she's weak

3501
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
no

3502
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
she hasn't been drinking her water

3503
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
you should be conscientious of others feelings

3504
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
die nerd

3505
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
that's what I say

3506
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
when someone says

3507
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
anything

3508
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
we'll go full march Simpson on this ship

3509
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
if you don't straighten up

3510
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
we'll see

3511
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
can I roll

3512
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
can I roll for

3513
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
charisma to

3514
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
hey Ben that's not how you do it

3515
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
you're supposed to be convinced by what you said

3516
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
you don't say I want to roll

3517
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
can I make a wisdom check

3518
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
a will saving throw

3519
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
to remain

3520
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
true to the

3521
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
my strong western values

3522
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I stab Ben in the neck with my stiletto heel

3523
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
round house kick

3524
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
damn

3525
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
make an attack roll

3526
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
shit

3527
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
I don't hear dice rolling

3528
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
oh I was rolling in my head

3529
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
and I thought someone else would do it

3530
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
I roll a 20 I went fuck

3531
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
oh shit that's funny

3532
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
that's it

3533
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
can't argue with that

3534
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
next voicemail is called

3535
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
the large nose man

3536
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
has finished

3537
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
three two one go

3538
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
I've done it

3539
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
no

3540
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
I've finally

3541
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
thought for Nate

3542
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
congratulations

3543
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
but that's not all

3544
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
while he was in a comatose state

3545
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I also convinced him

3546
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
to fire tricksy

3547
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
from canton

3548
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
oh yes my true

3549
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
mission has finally been

3550
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
completed

3551
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
you say I use

3552
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
the league of Nate fuckers

3553
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
to fuel my

3554
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
transphobic agenda

3555
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
and now my mission is

3556
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
complete

3557
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
this is on brand for us now

3558
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
and awake

3559
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
what I am most

3560
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
needed

3561
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
when will we need him

3562
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
under what circumstances

3563
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
we won't know until the time has come

3564
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
when the time is

3565
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
right we'll know

3566
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
at the end of the time

3567
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
when all of the fighters come back

3568
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
to do the final battle against the big

3569
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
battle

3570
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
it'll be a big

3571
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
battle you ever seen star wars

3572
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
you ever seen super smash brothers

3573
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I've seen something

3574
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
you ever read red wall

3575
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
the martins journey

3576
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
or whatever the fuck

3577
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
there's a lot of animals

3578
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
where they fight in that one

3579
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
there's small mice's mouses

3580
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I like that

3581
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
that was

3582
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
red school okay let's move on

3583
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
next voicemail is called

3584
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Ben was even more right

3585
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
dad

3586
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
you just keep getting righter and righter

3587
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
just keep getting alter and alter

3588
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
three two one go

3589
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
more twitter drama

3590
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
more correctness

3591
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
from the king

3592
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
keep it up

3593
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
then

3594
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
this is what it's all about

3595
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
I do it all for this

3596
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
for this moment

3597
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
the king

3598
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
voicemail that's me baby

3599
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
say for those voicemails

3600
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
I harvest the voicemails

3601
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
that say I'm cool

3602
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
I play them over and over again

3603
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I'm secretly

3604
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
not playing all the voicemails

3605
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
that say that I am

3606
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
not right

3607
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
they've all been

3608
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
deleted

3609
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Ben goes through all the voicemails

3610
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
the day before the podcast and clears

3611
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
out all the ones he doesn't like

3612
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
you all thought

3613
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
that I wasn't doing that

3614
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
but the joke's on you

3615
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I was

3616
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
next voicemail is called

3617
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
fear them three two one

3618
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
go

3619
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
what happened with the ninjutsu

3620
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
okay

3621
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
okay

3622
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
see you next time

3623
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
thank you for the warning

3624
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I guess

3625
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
the saga gets more complicated

3626
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
ninjas vs samurai who will win

3627
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
samurai sounds like

3628
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
he's on the rocks so

3629
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
it sounds like the ninjas have grasped the upper hand

3630
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
I've always been more of a ninja guy

3631
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
than a samurai guy

3632
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
samurai's my friend now

3633
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
we've gone so far back

3634
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I think it's like because

3635
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
you've stolen

3636
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
samurai scrolls so long ago

3637
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
that the samurai clan has deteriorated in that time

3638
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
but the ninja clan

3639
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
scroll has only recently been gone

3640
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
so they've still got their full strength

3641
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
that's a good point

3642
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
that's a good point oh shit

3643
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
oh my god wheels within wheels

3644
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
next voicemail is called

3645
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
mario kart update

3646
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
three two one go

3647
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
hey pcp

3648
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
it's me again

3649
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I'm the guy who's playing mario kart

3650
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
I am

3651
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
falling out of it I don't really like

3652
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
mario kart 8 anymore

3653
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
because once you get to the high ranks

3654
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
it's nothing but people playing mario kart

3655
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I'm so sorry to hear that

3656
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
is there anything I can do for you sir

3657
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
it's all the same it's not fun anymore

3658
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
they always choose the same maps

3659
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
the game gets really boring

3660
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
but I'm glad to say

3661
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
that I've started working on those commissions

3662
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
that I have been leaving people

3663
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
waiting on for several months

3664
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
you know life's really working out

3665
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
I got caught up on the podcast

3666
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
and I was surprised to see that

3667
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
um a tricksy

3668
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I

3669
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I don't know

3670
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
it's I'm honestly

3671
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
honestly it really makes me want to cry

3672
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
it's like it's so it's such

3673
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
it's such a sadness

3674
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
I don't even know what to say

3675
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
oh

3676
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
oh what happened

3677
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
damn

3678
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
that's some real emotion right there

3679
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I could

3680
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I could feel

3681
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
the tender

3682
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
the tender feelings

3683
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
I could hear he was crying on the inside

3684
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
he was putting on a brave face

3685
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
but his true feelings

3686
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
shone through

3687
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
next voicemail is called

3688
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
good podcast

3689
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
three two one go

3690
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
alright guys seriously

3691
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
I don't mean to hang on it too much but

3692
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
uh

3693
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
oh

3694
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
tricksy situation not looking good

3695
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
despite everything that's around the podcast though

3696
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
what do you mean

3697
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
I have been getting caught up while I do those commissions that I owe

3698
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
it's actually been pretty nice

3699
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
I've almost banged them all out

3700
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000

pretty funny

3785
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
there was one

3786
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I mean some people were

3787
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
saying that the

3788
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
the track that she

3789
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
put out on April

3790
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Fools some people were speculating

3791
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
that it was uh in response

3792
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
to me

3793
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
but it doesn't like it's not

3794
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
specific like there are some lines in it that sound

3795
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
like they could be about me but it's not like

3796
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
it's kind of just a general

3797
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
like haters

3798
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
don't know shit

3799
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
track so I don't know

3800
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
I don't know if that's normal

3801
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
it's fine to talk about haters

3802
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
yeah pretty much

3803
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000

3807
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000

3808
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
somebody needs to make a fucking diss track

3809
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
about you it builds character

3810
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
in which you are lacking

3811
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
please

3812
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000

3813
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000

3814
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
somebody diss track this fool

3815
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
uh next voicemail

3816
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
is called hi ben

3817
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
it's another one called hi ben

3818
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
okay three two one go

3819
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
okay so

3820
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
due to recent events

3821
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
um

3822
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
if Nate comes back on

3823
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
the PCP

3824
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
um

3825
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Ben can you just like

3826
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
you'll be in charge

3827
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I like the culture you've cultivated here

3828
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
thank you

3829
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
with the whole not screening voicemails thing

3830
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I think it really adds up

3831
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
to the show so

3832
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
yeah I think Nate would hate it

3833
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
just you and Gib just

3834
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
stay in charge and Nate can be like a

3835
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
special guest

3836
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I mean maybe

3837
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Nate maybe watch

3838
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
um I mean

3839
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
no no word

3840
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
on whether Nate has

3841
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
uh reconsidered

3842
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
his

3843
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
his status

3844
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
of that so I mean

3845
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I mean I could come back

3846
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
as it has always been a possibility

3847
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I see no reason to think that he will

3848
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
but like it's like

3849
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
like Nate left

3850
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
like a wound to fester and now it's too powerful

3851
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
and he can't treat it

3852
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
if he tries to come back and be just

3853
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
like the old times like hey everyone welcome to the

3854
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
p-bro grassy podcast

3855
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
we'd like to send upon him and

3856
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
eat him and destroy him

3857
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
too much has happened

3858
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
we can never go back

3859
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
to the way things were you can't go home again

3860
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
once you give up your

3861
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
PCP flange you can't get it back

3862
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
you'd have to go through a

3863
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
reflinging initiation ritual

3864
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
we unflanged him

3865
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
we unflanged him

3866
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
and once lost a flange

3867
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
he unflanged himself and walked away

3868
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
that's true that's true he gave up the flange

3869
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
it's truly the most

3870
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
unflanged move to leave the PCP

3871
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I did have to agree

3872
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I would there's nothing

3873
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
there's no more flanged

3874
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
uh

3875
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
thing to be us

3876
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
we have the biggest flange

3877
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
it's huge

3878
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
okay uh next voicemail is called

question actually

3886
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
so I was expanding

3887
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
my mind

3888
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000

3897
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
emails since last night

3898
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000

3900
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000

02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
the switcheroo

3919
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000

02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
one of these days

3938
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
next voicemail is called

3939
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Mike Literis

02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
lol 3 2 1 go

3941
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
I still remember the ambitions you had vividly

3942
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
I couldn't wait to check out which funny

3943
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
yet touching artistic achievements just had created

3944
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
in an effort to always surpass himself

3945
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
as an artist while I was gone

3946
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I couldn't wait to see how many hundreds of thousands

3947
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
of subscribers my favorite friendship simulator

3948
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
had gained in my absence

3949
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
just what wacky antics of my favorite

3950
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
unironically fact it's loving online creator

3951
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Nate had I missed

3952
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
also there's ban

3953
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
just thinking about the abundance of artistic masterpieces

3954
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
I'm wondering

3955
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
about the abundance of artistic masterpieces

3956
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
I must have missed send shivers down my spine

3957
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
a b p c p h q was already founded

3958
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
how many ones for munchie would I

3959
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
have to retroactively press

3960
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
so I innocently clicked on the pcp youtube channel

3961
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
not knowing what would await me

3962
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
I cried and screamed so blood curdling loud

3963
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
that I lost my voice permanently

3964
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
my dreams were shattered and I shot my pants

3965
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
and I had an orgasm

3966
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
in three weeks

3967
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I am utterly defeated and will never recover

3968
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
same

3969
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
give his best girl

3970
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
why did you come back

3971
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
why did you ruin it for yourself

3972
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
you should never

3973
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
you should never have looked

3974
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
you should have just let yourself be content

3975
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
with the fantasy

3976
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
not knowing

3977
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
it's like the typical story when god said not to look back

3978
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
and then someone did

3979
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
you look back and you've become the pillar

3980
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
you've become the pillar of salt

3981
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
it's you

3982
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
that's so sad

3983
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
what was that, that was a greek myth about that

3984
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
it was a fucking

3985
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
no it was Sodom and Gomorrah

3986
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
that was also a greek myth

3987
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
where your wife died

3988
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
and you can't look at her face

3989
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
oh yeah

3990
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
she's forever

3991
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
never coming back

3992
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I can't remember the name

3993
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
was it Persephone

3994
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Persephone in the underworld right

3995
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
yeah something like that

3996
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
that's the one that Pluto

3997
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
said because she ate the pomegranate

3998
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
so she has to be

3999
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
she has to be in the underworld

4000
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
half the time

4001
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
I don't know if that's the same one

4002
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
I think it might be a different one

4003
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
yeah

4004
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I've heard the one you're talking about

4005
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
yeah

4006
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
he goes to the underworld to get his wife back

4007
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
and you can't look at her

4008
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
what he does

4009
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
like a fool, like an idiot

4010
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
which is basically the same

4011
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
as the story of Lot

4012
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
it's Lot

4013
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
it's either Sodom or Gomorrah

4014
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
and his wife

4015
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
he's the only good man

4016
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
in the city

4017
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
and he has to flee

4018
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
and he takes his family with him

4019
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
and his wife

4020
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
and God says don't look back

4021
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
but his wife looks back and turns into a pillar of salt

4022
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
so he escapes with his daughters

4023
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
but it's okay because he just fucks his daughters

4024
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
instead of his wife

4025
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
and starts a new family with them

4026
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
so it's all good

4027
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
he's the only good man

4028
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
well I mean what choice do they have Tom

4029
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
you know

4030
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
God turned everyone else to salt

4031
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
what would you have done

4032
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
God's kind of an asshole

4033
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I mean

4034
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
he

4035
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
he knew what he was doing

4036
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
he knew what he was fucking doing

4037
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
so I'm saying

4038
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
next

4039
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000

4045
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
recording the PCP

4046
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
if I'm not too late

4047
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
I did not get what you guys are saying

4048
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
on the last one

4049
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000

4050
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
and whatever

4051
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000

4052
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000

4053
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
wait to fucking make your audience

4054
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
wanna forget about you

4055
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
becoming trailer trash

4056
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
and fighting over switch

4057
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
I completely agree

4058
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
100,000%

4059
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000

4064
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
what a shame

4065
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
good voicemail

02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
what a shame

4067
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
shame is the word I would use

4068
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
yeah

4069
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000

4070
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000

4076
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
