1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We can climb the bus right here.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, we need to lighten the mood. Ready?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It doesn't matter how much you push the envelope, it'll still be stationary.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What is that?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's a joke book. No pun intended. Vol. 2 by Will Livingston.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's keep going.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What did the Confederate soldiers used to eat off of?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Civilware.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What did they used to drink with?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Cups. Dixie cups.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I walked into my sister's room and tripped on a bra.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It was a booby trap.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A book just fell on my head. I only have myself to blame.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hold on, let me read it again.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A book just fell on my head. I only have my shelf to blame.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ruin it.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What is the leading cause of divorce in long-term marriages?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A stalemate.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's awful.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're awful.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you even understand what that means?

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Nope. Doesn't matter.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Alright, I'm done. For now.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Jeff of the Mother's Basement.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hi, hello. This is me again.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And the rebel pixel himself, Tom Oliver.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Alright, so guy, who do I have to fuck around here to get started on this podcast?

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I've been waiting for all this time.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's get this thing going already.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That was some good witty dialogue right there.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What we had going right there.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, I suppose.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, I've seen better witty on Tuesday.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now, let's begin this conversation.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Witty banter, what you say?

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Witty, what now?

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm comedically pretending not to understand the phrase.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Alright, I don't understand what anyone's saying right now,

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but the point is, the topic of the podcast is witty, witty.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Alright, the topic of the podcast is witty banter,

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and we've all got feelings about it,

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but really, I think we need to take a good long time to describe exactly what each of us is thinking of.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shall we open up Urban Dictionary and look up witty banter?

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Witty banter is what the lowlifes do over and fly over country when they're not busy picking corn.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, okay, I looked it up on Urban Dictionary, and here's what we've got.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Even if they are ugly, the witty banter will redeem their unfortunate looks.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And here's the quote.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Alright, listen to my example here.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is a real life usage from the Gilmore Girls.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Jake had the best witty banter yesterday.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I know it totally made me want to bone him.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is a great jumping off point, because whoever wrote that is totally under the persuasion

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that if someone can snap off a real quick witty one liner,

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
if someone can snap off some real cutting jpe or jab or jib or whatever it would have you,

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
then that's cool, and they're a cool guy and it's funny.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And if you can write someone whipping off one liners and zinging people off, snap, ice burn,

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
then that's good writing, and I don't think so.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I think that that is an overused thing in fiction and in writing in general,

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and that it's a crutch that a lot of people use, and I don't like it.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sure there's times when it's appropriate, but most of them are not.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The only kind of reminds me of, the scene that comes to my mind most of all when I think about this is,

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and maybe it's a bad example, but the scene in Metal Gear Solid 4, where...

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
By the way, I'm Ben St. St. Cops.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Patreon.com slash Ben St.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If you enjoyed this kind of witty commentary, you can head over to Patreon.com.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you enjoyed the couple sentences I just said, please consider supporting me.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Alright, but what I was saying was that, you know that scene in Metal Gear Solid 4

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
when Poop Man and Meryl are fighting for their lives at the end of the game

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and they're talking about their wedding that's coming up,

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
while they're getting murdered by everyone around them all the time.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It was really uncomfortable, and this seems to happen a lot with this stuff,

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
where something really serious is going on,

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and I don't know if they think that they can inject some levity into it,

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
when, meanwhile, Snake is crawling to his death over here,

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
he's being fucking cooked alive by microwaves,

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
well, these two are like, oh, we're gonna get such pretty dresses, boom, killed another guy,

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
oh, we're gonna have all the flowers, it's gonna be awesome, boom, killed five more people,

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
got shot in the arm.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's, you know, it's not something you can just add slap on top of something

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to just like enhance what's going on.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I mean, in Metal Gear Solid, that is kind of to an extent the point,

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
because Metal Gear Solid is, you know, I mean,

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
it's part Hideo Kojima's crazy fucking fever dream fantasy

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
about what's really going on in the world,

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and all the secret conspiracies,

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
but the other thing that it is, is it's a send up of action movies, right?

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Like, yeah, so that's something that they do in action movies all the time,

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and it's not necessarily about like, you know, being respectful in the moment,

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
it's about being entertaining to the viewer.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The idea is to portray coolness that makes people really impressed,

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
like, these people are so excited about what they're talking about,

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
in an action movie.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Davoo, shut up, he's trying to say something.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
In an action movie, you guys gotta turn my volume on, discord back up.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I was done talking for like five seconds

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
when everyone told me to shut up the stupid lab.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, yeah, okay, so what's, so the thing is, in an action movie,

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
violence isn't like a bad thing, violence is performance art.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So in that sense, you know, throwing wit on top of that

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and trying to make it as funny and entertaining for the audience as possible,

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
is in service of the goal of the scene.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So like, when Arnold Schwarzenegger fucking freezes somebody to death

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
in Batman and Robin, and he's just like,

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
what killed the dinosaurs?

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The eye sage, I mean, that's a terrible example,

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
but that's, that is, I mean, that's a great example.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I actually think that that's hilarious, but what I'm saying,

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
like, the things happening in that scene of Metal Gear Solid 4

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
are in the same sort of situation as like episode one of Star Wars,

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
where like, there's this big battle where all these different scenes are happening simultaneously,

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and one of them is like this witty banter while they're fucking fighting.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well meanwhile over here, Snake is fucking dying.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But that's done for the sake of juxtaposition, right?

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, here's, I have not seen, I have not played Metal Gear Solid 4,

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
so disclaimer about that, but it sounds to me like what the scene is trying to do,

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
like one, it's trying to be goofy and funny in that they can have this conversation

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
while they're fighting for their lives ostensibly.

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Also, I think the other thing maybe it's going for is that these two are like

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
such good and powerful super soldiers that they can have this kind of conversation

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
while like, Run of the Mill mooks are gunning them down, is that, is that maybe part of it?

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tell us a little about whether or not it makes sense.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You know, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that's what they were going for.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like it doesn't even take their full concentration to engage in this firefight?

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, and this is like the ultimate battle of their lives,

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
okay, but you know what, whatever, I'll give that to you.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's meant to be the comedic side of it, right?

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Like, that's a common thing in film to juxtapose something that's goofy and light hearted

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
with the most serious moment of the film in order to elicit like,

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
in order to take people on like an emotional roller coaster and keep them engaged.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Like, I don't know if you've seen the movie Cloud Atlas,

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but Cloud Atlas is effectively five different shorter movies,

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
each with vastly different tones and subject matters.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And one of them is basically like a British slapstick comedy

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and it's got like this really goofy chase scene

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
where like a bunch of old people are running away from like a home

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and that's juxtaposed with this super dramatic scene

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
where these two slaves are trying to escape from being captured

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and trying to find freedom, these like clone slaves.

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's a weird movie.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I think I saw it.

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And there's like a few other things and like that's,

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
the purpose of that is to compare and contrast

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and make the funnier parts of that funnier and make the dramatic parts

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
of the other scenes more dramatic in comparison.

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll give you all of that and I'll say that that is totally something

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
that you can do effectively, but you have to admit that there is a right way

148
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and a wrong way to do those things.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And my only contention is that in my humble opinion,

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think Metal Gear Solid 4 did it the wrong way for that one scene.

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's all I'm saying.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I mean, Kojima is not a very good film director.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's a terrible writer and he's not a great director.

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let me talk about a good writer

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and someone who used Witty Banter in a way that I like a lot.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
George R.R. Martin in Game of Thrones, right?

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, okay.

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I mean, in Game of Thrones, not every character engages in Witty Banter, right?

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
True.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Like Ned never, I think at some point Ned even thinks to himself like,

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
man, I can't do this sparring with words that everyone does here

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and keeps landing.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It sucks and I can't do it and I hate it.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's just, yeah, let's just get on with what we're doing here.

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Like Tyrion is this kind of snarky guy who doesn't have any respect for anyone

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and just sort of will flippantly say what he thinks all the time.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And people like Varys and Littlefinger are these kind of like crafty dudes

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
who like engage in all these, you know, court politics and stuff

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and they're always like trying to advance their station

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
with like a well-placed word and a whisper and whatever.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So like those kind of characters do have this sort of Witty Banter

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but then other characters like Brienne is like dumb as a stump

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and never could never in the books anyway.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey, that's misogynist.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No, in the book she's so dumb and she's also my favorite character.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
She's not that dumb.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't remember that.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
To me, she comes off as pretty dumb in the books.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, doesn't George R. Martin say at some point

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that she's supposed to be really dumb or something?

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't know.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I know he called Victarian dumb as a stump.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, right.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's what it was.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But anyway, like she would never engage in that.

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The Starks generally wouldn't, things like that.

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So what do you get that?

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Did you like the way Tyrion did it?

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm just saying that it's appropriate in some context

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
but not all of them and in that series the characters are in.

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ben, maybe if I can springboard off that,

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I think what you're trying to say is that like Witty Dialogue

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and like Witty Banter is a character trait and not a writing crutch

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
because there are a lot of...

195
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's so many times where you can have a Witty character

196
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
but like something that I, as much as I like the MCU and shit,

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
everybody has Witty Banter.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's not a character trait anymore

199
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
because like every character in those movies fucking snaps one line.

200
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And if you want to have...

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's exactly the issue that I was trying to raise with this topic.

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That is what I'm complaining about.

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Whether personality traits are Witty and cool

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and they do snarky things like that.

205
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
When a writer basically conflates a character

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
being clever with the actual script being clever.

207
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A writer tries to show how smart they are

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
by giving the character smart dialogue even though it's appropriate.

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
One of the interesting things about the MCU

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
because I think overall that the MCU is well written.

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
By the way, I have not seen very much of the MCU.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What's the MCU?

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I would say Marvel Cinematic Universe.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Marvel Cinematic Universe.

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I would say that the MCU does run into that problem

216
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
with certain writers.

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Joss Whedon.

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He's the one.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He's the guy.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, so...

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Jeff, you need the Lawsons.

222
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I got some water here.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Saying something cough, saying something cough.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Very shade dialogue.

225
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Hey, that's Witty dialogue.

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's pretty witty, yeah.

227
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But yeah, Joss Whedon does that a lot.

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Sometimes it works like in Buffy the Vampire Slayer

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
when you've got a bunch of high school kids trying to prove something.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, it makes sense for those kids to be engaging in that kind of banter.

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In Firefly where the tone is cowboys.

232
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It kind of makes sense in Cabin in the Woods.

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It kind of makes sense.

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But it gets exhausting when every superhero is trying to one-up each other

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
including Bruce Banner, who's by his very character a man of few words.

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And Iron Man is the only character in that who should be really doing that all the time.

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Black Widow, she's an assassin.

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah, and the problem with that is as soon as it blew up,

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
everyone started writing all the characters like that.

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And it's unfortunate.

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But I mean, in the main movies, or not the main movies,

242
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I guess the side movies where each character gets their own thing,

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the writing's a lot better because they're allowed to actually breathe and tell a story

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
as opposed to just, here's a bunch of people, we want them to bounce off the walls

245
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and get people to give us an 8 out of 10 on IMDb or whatever.

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's all you need and you're in the clear at that point.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It gets really interesting with Captain America Civil War

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
because they do break away from that at some points.

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And Spider-Man, who is a character who a lot of people define by his witty dialogue,

250
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
ends up being one of the most interesting characters in that movie

251
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
because of how he's written.

252
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He's clearly trying to be witty, but he's using it as a defense mechanism

253
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and he's pissing his pants scared and you can tell that from how he's written.

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Which I've heard people say that they've interpreted that's how Spider-Man has always been.

255
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's why he has all that witty dialogue.

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That is how Spider-Man has always been and that's why Andrew Garfield,

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and that's why Andrew Garfield's fucking terrible and the Amazing Spider-Man series

258
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
can go fucking die in a fire, witty dialogue ruined that too,

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
in addition to fucking Mark Webb not knowing how to direct anything other than a music video.

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Mark Webb.

261
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah, that's who they brought on to direct Spider-Man!

262
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It makes sense, dude. It makes sense.

263
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That seems like a corporate decision to me.

264
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Ten out of ten on that one.

265
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That seems like a corporate business meeting where they were trying to have witty dialogue,

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
like somebody's like, how...

267
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, you know, like Jeff was alluding to, you know,

268
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the corporate decisions are falling victim to witty dialogue themselves.

269
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Holy shit, let the dude talk, man.

270
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah, I have to really get a head start with all this lag.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Man, so much lag around here.

272
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's worse than Sarah Palin.

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So, you know...

274
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Did he just say that?

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And we hear him cut out as everybody laughs.

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Like eight minutes later.

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If you want to have a show where everyone is talking inappropriately,

278
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
with inappropriate levels of levity when they're all doing death-defying stunts,

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
you know, it's all about whether or not it makes sense for the characters.

280
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Cowboy Bebop's a good example because the three...

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
All the main characters in that show are all really bad at talking about their problems

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and how they feel and they don't like talking about themselves or anything seriously.

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's true.

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And I think it's always been suggested that it's because they all have the same kind of personality in that regard.

285
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's kind of what makes them naturally team up in the first place

286
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and the fact that they all smoke.

287
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And there's these natural causes for the witty dialogue to happen.

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now, it's part of the story and that's what wit is all about.

289
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We say witty.

290
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Witty means smart, intelligent, creative.

291
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But at some point, some witty, intelligent, creative person invented dialogue

292
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
where all the characters were taking a bunch of rhetorical jabs at one another back and forth

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and everyone associated that with witty and then proceeded to copy it in a way that wasn't witty at all.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's like if you ever listened to the...

295
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There was... Ron Tomatoes had a show.

296
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
They had a web show where they would play a bunch of people trying to do the stereotypical film critic type of reviews

297
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
for a movie and a montage and it was all a bunch of witty dialogue.

298
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Like, ugh, these two people didn't have very good performances.

299
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It was about as good as a deflated balloon.

300
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And it wasn't very witty at all.

301
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's cool.

302
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So what we're saying is witty dialogue, as it stands today, is not very witty.

303
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Sounds like you're saying that the definition has morphed a bit.

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And what we perceive now is not...

305
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I suppose I'd like to think that the origin for all these was because it was in keeping with the way that we wanted the characters to be portrayed.

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But perhaps now, like with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's more about...

307
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I was going to say this before, maybe audiences just like everyone to be doing that shit.

308
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Or they've come to associate that with smart dialogue and good characters.

309
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I think the definition now, I think, is the characters themselves thinking of themselves as witty.

310
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think that's the new definition.

311
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I think it might come back to that definition that you read to us, the urban dictionary thing.

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
About men who need to get laid even though they're ugly using...

313
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
To an extent, that definitely works.

314
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Look at Casey Neistat. He's married.

315
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That came across as mean. He's a very intelligent person.

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What I'm trying...

317
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's okay. People are ugly. It's alright.

318
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What I'm trying to get across, though, is like...

319
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I think maybe a lot of screenwriters and a lot of Hollywood people are just trying to create characters

320
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
that people online will say they want to fuck.

321
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Look at the Avengers. Everyone's like, I want to fuck Chris Hemsworth.

322
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I want to fuck Loki. I want to fuck Captain America.

323
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I want to fuck Robert Downey. They want to fuck all those characters.

324
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You have your Jeff Soundboard. Get working.

325
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh, no!

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Now everyone's going to know everyone I want to fuck!

327
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They didn't before by watching my live streams at youtube.com.

328
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But no, that's kind of a facetious thing.

329
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think it's true for certain writers.

330
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The person Digi asked us to bring up Diablo Cody.

331
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Diablo Cody can't write a scene where somebody doesn't have a quip about something.

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,000
When she's working with other people's characters and she's working within other script constraints,

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
like when she did the script revisions for the Evil Dead,

334
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
like the remake, which is one of the only good remakes,

335
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I think we brought this up on our remakes podcast.

336
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We did. We did.

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And when she was like a guest writer for Children's Hospital,

338
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
which great show, if you guys haven't seen Children's Hospital, that's good.

339
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But when she writes her own scripts, when she writes shit like fucking Jennifer's body,

340
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
or Juno, like it's insufferable.

341
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It can be absolutely insufferable to hear all these, like, again, with teenagers, it kind of works.

342
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I was going to say that the thing that I do like about it with Juno

343
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
is that you really, at least when I watched that movie,

344
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I got the feeling that these people were really trying to act super cool,

345
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and they totally aren't.

346
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And like Ellen Page is totally that kind of person in that movie.

347
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
She is not cool at all, but she's really trying to act that way.

348
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And I remember till the day I die, at the very beginning,

349
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
when she does the pregnancy test and walks up to the, what's his face from the offices up there,

350
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and he's just like, your ego is prego.

351
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's the greatest line I've ever heard in any movie ever.

352
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It is pretty good.

353
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The problem for me with Juno is that I watched Jennifer's body after watching Juno,

354
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and that throws in, like that movie is so bad that it throws in the question, her ability to write,

355
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and will make you think like, was Juno really that good?

356
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's fair.

357
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's fair.

358
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You know, did she just bamboozle us by getting lucky?

359
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
God.

360
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Like the script would have been the same no matter who the characters were,

361
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
but it happens to work because they're teenagers or something.

362
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah.

363
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Another person who has this problem is Aaron Sorkin,

364
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
who's the writer of The West Wing, The Newsroom, Social Network, a bunch of others.

365
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I would consider him to be a great writer,

366
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
but a lot of people are put off by the fact that all of his characters

367
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
are basically always trying to save the wittiest thing in any given situation,

368
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and a lot of them are just mouthpieces for his political views.

369
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But if you've watched The West Wing, if you've watched The Newsroom,

370
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
the dude writes a stirring speech.

371
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The dude can make a scene just like move you,

372
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
but to an extent, I think that his desire to impress you with,

373
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
oh, this pun that these characters came up with on the fly based on a situation that I wrote,

374
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
which doesn't make it impressive at all,

375
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
trying to impress you with that witt can take away from how good his characters actually are,

376
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
because they're well-defined and they've got a lot of depth to them,

377
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
but in the moment-to-moment thing, they come across as being a little,

378
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
ugh, this shit again, you know?

379
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah, you know, that's interesting,

380
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and I kind of want to raise a distinction based on what DeVoo was saying before,

381
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and what everybody's been saying.

382
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's like the new type of witty banter where the characters think they're really clever,

383
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
versus actually clever dialogue between characters.

384
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So like, I'm thinking of Quentin Tarantino as the guy that comes to mind for me,

385
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
with like, in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction,

386
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
but like, the Reservoir Dogs tipping scene at the very beginning of the movie.

387
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, I actually just recently watched that first scene.

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That whole first scene is brilliant.

389
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That is like my favorite movie of all time.

390
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
To sound like natural dialogue,

391
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
but condensed and compressed just enough to make it perfect.

392
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Right.

393
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah, it's witty.

394
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I mean, the guy writing it's witty.

395
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What makes that so witty?

396
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And the characters themselves are also witty.

397
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Everyone is witty.

398
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The writer and the characters are all doing a great job.

399
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That's what I'm saying, because the thing is, in the scene,

400
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
he's making an actually fairly persuasive argument as to why tipping is bullshit,

401
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and you shouldn't do, I mean, obviously, you know,

402
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
people are not even going to agree.

403
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This is this character's interpretation of what tipping is,

404
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
which obviously comes from, you know, some element down in Tarantino

405
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
that he's had this thought that tipping is kind of retarded,

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and it's being expressed with these characters,

407
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and they're all relating to it in a reasonable way.

408
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And it's totally good.

409
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And my favorite thing about that scene is that Mr. Orange is like,

410
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
you know what, I'm convinced.

411
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's giving me my dollar back.

412
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm not tipping anymore.

413
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Like, he convinces another character using this real life argument,

414
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and that's real wit.

415
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I'm a little bit convinced by that too.

416
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That's a real wit.

417
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I already had that guy's position.

418
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I mean, I do tip, but I totally agree with his philosophy going into it even.

419
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah, man.

420
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The way that like characters are walking to the scene later on,

421
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and like they have to, because there's a part where like the older guy

422
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
comes back into the scene later on,

423
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and they have to like repeat some of the information.

424
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
What do you mean you don't, Tim?

425
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, but it's doing just such a way to where it's even more funny

426
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
to hear it all over again.

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's great stuff.

428
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I feel like Tarantino, he, his dialogue is, has wit to it,

429
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
but that's because he makes every scene like about something

430
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
as opposed to just being about two characters bouncing off of each other.

431
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You know another great example of this is, is that scene in,

432
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I forget the movie.

433
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
He wrote like one scene for this movie.

434
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
God, I can't remember the name.

435
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But basically there's this speech where, fuck, what's his name?

436
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Christopher Walken is, he's like a mob boss,

437
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and he's, you know, you know the one I'm talking about

438
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
where he calls him an eggplant?

439
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And he just, he explains to this guy who's like a Sicilian mobster

440
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
that like Sicilians, like Sicilian women were raped by like the Moors,

441
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
who were black, who took over Sicily for a time,

442
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and that's why Sicilians now have dark hair.

443
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And he's just like, what I'm saying is you're a nigger.

444
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Like he's just like, he builds up to this like,

445
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
slandering like his bloodline and shit.

446
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But it's so funny.

447
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And like this whole speech goes in a huge tangent about like the history of Sicily,

448
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and like all that's happening is that he's telling this guy to fuck off

449
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and that he's not going to do what he wants.

450
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But it's hilarious, the way that he does that through this big story

451
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
that's historically accurate.

452
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That kind of reminds me of that scene in Hateful Eight

453
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
where Samuel L. Jackson tells that long story

454
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
about horribly torturing and murdering this kid

455
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and cuts out of it with him being like,

456
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
yep, he had my big black dingus in his mouth.

457
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That was a fantastic movie and a fantastic scene.

458
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't know if I'd call it fantastic.

459
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It had its perks, I guess.

460
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I quite enjoy all of Tarantino's movies, except for Death Proof,

461
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
because I haven't seen that one.

462
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That's his half of Grindhouse, and it's not great.

463
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Planet Terror is a lot better.

464
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I think Robert Rodriguez is just a lot better at doing schlock.

465
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But anyway, you look at pretty much any dialogue exchange

466
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
in any of his films, and there's something going on

467
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
that's building up the characters,

468
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and their wit always relates to who they are as a person.

469
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
He frequently plays witty characters off against dumber characters

470
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
who are also morally more in the right than them.

471
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
If you look at, say, In Glorious Bastards, fantastic movie,

472
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
the first scene of that movie is one of the greatest opening scenes

473
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
in any movie ever, and just that conversation

474
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
between Christoph Waltz and the farmer,

475
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
where he's saying all of this witty shit,

476
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and the farmer's just sort of being meek

477
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
because of the position that he's in,

478
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and also he's not hyper-educated,

479
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
but at the same time, you're relating more to the farmer's position,

480
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and it's less like, oh, look how clever this character is,

481
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
although he is being clever.

482
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's more like, look at this asshole, right?

483
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Look at how clever this guy wants us to think.

484
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He's got so much power over this guy, intellectually, politically.

485
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He's got every advantage over the guy.

486
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So you kind of feel like, damn, this guy's the coolest.

487
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I want to be with this guy.

488
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's the reversal of the usual,

489
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
or of the trap that I think two witty banter can fall into,

490
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
wherein have you guys seen that it's a comic,

491
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
but it's like a parody of social issue comics,

492
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
where there's two characters talking,

493
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and one guy, he's kind of a smart, nerd-looking guy,

494
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and the other is this sort of crudely drawn, big, yell-y guy,

495
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and the little glasses guy is like, I have this opinion,

496
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and the other's like, I disagree, and I hate you.

497
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And then the glasses guy's like, I keep my cool,

498
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and I'm the bigger man, and the other guy's like, not me,

499
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm so fucking crazy.

500
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The first panel is the smart guy being like,

501
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I have this opinion, which I share with the author of this comic.

502
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And the other guy's like, I have this alternate opinion,

503
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
that is contrary.

504
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So they're basically just like completely straw manning

505
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the other guy, the other arguments.

506
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And yeah, you see that all the time.

507
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You see that all the time in web comics and stuff.

508
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You make a character that is arguing.

509
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That's all of Tumblr, basically.

510
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You make a character that you agree with,

511
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and that you want the audience to agree with,

512
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and then you have him try to look cool, and be cool,

513
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and get one over on the enemy,

514
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and say something that really cuts the meat that the other guy

515
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
obviously has no rebuttal for.

516
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You know what the perfect example this is?

517
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The author didn't think of what a reasonable rebuttal would be.

518
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Are you thinking of Brian Griffin from Family Guy?

519
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Because he's exactly that character.

520
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But I mean, Brian Griffin is supposed to be full of shit,

521
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
because he's the stand-in for Seth MacFarlane.

522
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And everybody who writes that show

523
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
uses Brian to make fun of what an asshole Seth MacFarlane is.

524
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The episode where Brian tries to be a stand-up comedian,

525
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
for instance, is all about how shitty a stand-up comedian

526
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Seth MacFarlane is.

527
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Any time that Brian expresses a political opinion

528
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
like an asshole, that's Seth MacFarlane.

529
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Right, that's true.

530
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But yeah, the thing that those Tumblr comics remind me of

531
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
is fucking the Mac versus PC ads,

532
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and how those made me want to buy a PC.

533
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Oh yeah.

534
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Because fuck Mac.

535
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah.

536
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I always liked the PC guy better anyway.

537
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Fuck that hipster asshole Mac.

538
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Exactly, he's like this down to earth.

539
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Are you guys familiar with the response ads that Microsoft did?

540
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't know, maybe.

541
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
They just showed a bunch of people who own PCs

542
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
going off being cool people living their real lives

543
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
that don't have anything to do with computers.

544
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And they're like,

545
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Bravo, Microsoft, good job.

546
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Exactly.

547
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I remember people hated those commercials, too.

548
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Like the tech sphere,

549
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
because I have to go on tech blogs all the time,

550
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and everyone's like, these commercials are so cool.

551
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And then the PC ones came out,

552
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and they were so much more subtle and clever in response.

553
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And everyone's like, these are gay.

554
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
They don't even show the computer.

555
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Subtle and clever.

556
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That only should apply to Whitty Banter,

557
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
but also PC users.

558
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Meanwhile, Microsoft did earlier on

559
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
have an ad campaign that was very snarky.

560
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Whitty Banter's become snarky banter.

561
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Right.

562
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Because Microsoft also had an ad campaign

563
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
that was very snarky from earlier on

564
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
during the height,

565
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
down the peak of all the hatred delivered at Vista

566
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
before Windows 7 came out.

567
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I guess Microsoft wanted to come out with a campaign

568
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
to convince people that Vista didn't suck that much.

569
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And from what I've heard from tech people,

570
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I heard it was mostly like a hardware issue

571
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
on the part of Gateway and Walmart,

572
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
but I don't know.

573
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But Microsoft had these ads where they had real-life

574
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
non-actors come in

575
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
to try out the new,

576
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
secretly fake Windows operating system

577
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
known as Windows Mojave.

578
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And they interviewed people asking them

579
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
what they thought of Vista,

580
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and everyone said, oh, Vista sucks.

581
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Well, I'm a normal dumb person.

582
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I think this sucks.

583
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Okay, now let's try Windows Mojave.

584
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And they tried it, and like, this is great.

585
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I used it for five minutes, and I think it's really great.

586
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm an unpaid non-actor person, real-life guy.

587
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
How much do you like Windows Mojave?

588
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I love it.

589
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Well, guess what?

590
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Windows Mojave is Windows Vista

591
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
with a different name on top.

592
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Oh, my God.

593
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
She was so wrong.

594
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's like, Windows Vista, you're an idiot.

595
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Buy our products.

596
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Like, who the heck exactly convinced?

597
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh, that's great.

598
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Vista, you're an idiot.

599
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So, like, they pour it.

600
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So, like, they pour it.

601
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, my God.

602
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So, like, they pour it.

603
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That's the meaning.

604
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It doesn't say that.

605
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Go on, Ben.

606
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That's the meaning of it.

607
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Like, they poured two...

608
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah.

609
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
They poured two tall, cool, refreshing glasses

610
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
of Windows Cola, and you drank one of each,

611
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and then they asked you which one tasted better,

612
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and they said, oh, this one.

613
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah.

614
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
This Cola is Mojave.

615
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That is, like, a proven fact, though.

616
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Like, people have certain biases.

617
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There's a great episode of Penn and Teller's bullshit

618
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
where they're talking about bottled water,

619
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and they go to a fancy restaurant,

620
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and they have this guy be, like, the water steward,

621
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and he, like, brings out all these different samples

622
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
of bottled water and, like, boxy bottles

623
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and circular bottles and all these fancy bottles,

624
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and, like, he tells them, oh, this is from the mountains

625
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
of the Himalayas, this is from such and such,

626
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
this is from such and such.

627
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
They drink it, and it's like, oh, that's got a very...

628
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
it's got sort of a metallic aftertaste.

629
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Ooh, that's kind of minty, you know,

630
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
they're, like, making all these comments,

631
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
and then they just, they take them around to the back

632
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
where they've got Teller's just there

633
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
with a garden hose pouring water into all these fucking bottles.

634
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They did that with food, too.

635
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Fantastic.

636
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
They brought this back into a restaurant,

637
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and they started serving them, like, Taco Bell

638
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and, like, Walmart 99-cent shit,

639
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and the same guy came out and, like,

640
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
trying to make it look all fancy,

641
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and then tell them it was, like, this really expensive shit,

642
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and they were all like, this is fantastic.

643
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And, you know...

644
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Presentation matters a lot.

645
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
True, true.

646
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That reminds me of the one issue

647
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
in Biggest Problem in the Universe.

648
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Most of the time I agreed with Dick,

649
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
but the one thing that I was totally on Maddox's side about

650
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
was his thing about expensive steak.

651
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh, yeah.

652
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah, expensive steak.

653
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Dick Masterson swears that, like,

654
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
paying, like, $60 for a steak is, like...

655
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I remember that.

656
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's just not comparable to whatever...

657
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Or, like, $100 for a steak.

658
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You know, Maddox kind of conceded.

659
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
He swears that there's some real tangible difference

660
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
by a really expensive steak.

661
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
There is. There is.

662
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I've...

663
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I mean, like, I've been wind and dined

664
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
at fancy restaurants as a member of the press,

665
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and believe me when I say

666
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that a really succulent cut of steak

667
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
that's prepared well is a lot better

668
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
than what you're gonna get.

669
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Well, hang on.

670
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
How much of that is in the prepared part?

671
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You know, how much of that comes into the preparation

672
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and the presentation and the tenderizing

673
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and all that stuff?

674
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I think, like, 50%.

675
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But, I mean, again,

676
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
that's what you're paying for at a fancy restaurant

677
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
is a chef who knows how to do that well

678
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
in addition to great ingredients.

679
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But there's only...

680
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
There's only so good a steak can be.

681
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Right? There's gotta be some point in which

682
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
paying more for a steak can no longer...

683
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh, yeah.

684
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm just saying, I went to the House of Prime Rib

685
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
in San Francisco,

686
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
which is like an $80 plate restaurant

687
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
where they only serve prime rib,

688
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and I fucking came in my pants.

689
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I came in my pants

690
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
in front of business people.

691
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
In front of God, Jesus, and the bear,

692
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
he came in his pants.

693
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I came in my pants.

694
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It was delicious.

695
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's one of the...

696
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
There was an...

697
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
There reminds me of an incredible drill tweet

698
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
from like a week ago,

699
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
where he says, like, yeah,

700
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
a pamphlet labeled MRA shit

701
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
comes tumbling out of my pocket

702
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
during my weekly Wild Wings J.O. session,

703
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
costing me the yo-play deal.

704
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Drill's a legend, man.

705
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Shout out to Drill.

706
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I fucking love Drill so much.

707
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Holy shit.

708
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We're way off topic, man.

709
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah, we've gotten drastically off topic.

710
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We can kind of bring the idea here

711
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
back to our witty banter topic,

712
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
which was, in fact, our topic,

713
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
in that it's...

714
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The Wild Wings J.O. session.

715
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's not about...

716
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You can't just dress up fancy shit.

717
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Like, no matter how good

718
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
or how much action is going on in your movie...

719
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Nice, silky smooth segue.

720
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, thank you.

721
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
No matter how many billions you've spent

722
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
on making your scene look professional,

723
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
like in all your Avengers shit,

724
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
it's not going to make a lick of difference.

725
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's not going to impress people who actually care

726
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
about good dialogue and good characters.

727
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Let me dial back to a specific example.

728
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
This was the thing that I think I was thinking of

729
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
when I suggested this topic.

730
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And it's a webcomic that I don't hate it,

731
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
but I definitely don't like it either.

732
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Well, I mean, you hate it because it's not yours.

733
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's taken away from your market share.

734
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That's true.

735
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That's absolutely true.

736
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But...

737
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Alright, so it's called Dumbing of Age,

738
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and it's like a daily...

739
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah?

740
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Okay, I guess you got an opinion.

741
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's like a daily gag strip,

742
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
but it also tells a semi-serious dramatic story

743
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
about a bunch of college freshmen fucking around.

744
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I don't know.

745
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's fine and all,

746
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
but I really think that the structure of it

747
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
takes away from it because it's a dramatic story,

748
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
but it's told as these daily gags.

749
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And so every...

750
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Not everyone, but most of the beats

751
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
have to end with the joke.

752
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So these characters' dramatic lives

753
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
are just punctuated by an endless series

754
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
of goofy gags

755
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and snarky comebacks.

756
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yes, and one line is...

757
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm looking at one right now

758
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
where the religious girl is talking to her gay friend

759
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and she's just had a boyfriend

760
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
because he's dating her as a beard, whatever,

761
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and she's realized that she can't keep doing this to him.

762
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And she's like,

763
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
no, we've got to stop this.

764
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And she says,

765
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
it's not right for us to be together.

766
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You got to go back where you belong now

767
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
with your own kind.

768
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Get out of here.

769
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't need you anymore.

770
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And then the boyfriend kind of

771
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
does a snarky expression and goes,

772
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
is that from Harry and the Henderson's?

773
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Turns out this dramatic scene

774
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
is being undercut by some

775
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
goofy old movie reference

776
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
where he's got to let his pet dog

777
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
go for a while or something.

778
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And I don't like it when this happens.

779
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I think it is a disservice.

780
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm pretty sure that they toss a gag

781
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
into that within two comics

782
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
of the scene where one of the characters

783
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
almost gets raped.

784
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
They do.

785
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
They have all these gag.

786
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And a character will say something snarky

787
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and nasty at the end of a panel,

788
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
but it doesn't necessarily disrupt the story.

789
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You would expect someone to have

790
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
some reaction or response,

791
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but usually the next strip just starts up

792
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
without any mention of it.

793
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Not all the time, but a lot of the time.

794
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
This guy also does that fucking Tumblr thing

795
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
where every single character he disagrees with

796
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
is painted as basically Satan.

797
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There's some of that.

798
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I've been keeping up with it.

799
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I don't know why.

800
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I don't know why.

801
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You know how you get into a habit of

802
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
checking back with a webcomic after a while

803
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and you just do it instinctually?

804
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
When you've read so much of it,

805
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
you can't stop reading it.

806
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
There's this character now

807
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
who's hyper religious

808
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and she's trying to run

809
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
the trans girl

810
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
who lives in their dorm out of the dorm

811
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
by blackmailing the super,

812
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
which of course involves a lot of stupid

813
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Mickey Mouse gags and shit.

814
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
She's the religious stand-in

815
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
compared to the other character

816
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
who it's Joyce who's heavily implied

817
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
is completely losing all of her faith in God

818
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
because her best friend's gay.

819
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah, that's her arc, right?

820
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Her arc is she's losing her faith

821
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and becoming a better person as a result.

822
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Because she's not religious anymore.

823
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It's so heavy-handed.

824
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Part of the problem

825
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
is that this comic is from the guy

826
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
who wrote Short Pact.

827
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah, he does a lot.

828
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
He's very prolific.

829
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
He's very prolific,

830
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and all of his comics involve the same characters

831
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
in different sort of situations

832
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
because he's never come up with a new character

833
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
in like 15 fucking years.

834
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Yeah, that's weird.

835
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's weird, it's like the same characters later

836
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
after they've gotten married and had a kid or whatever.

837
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah, and his dialogue

838
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
isn't even good?

839
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's not.

840
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's not.

841
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But he's really trying to be clever

842
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and get off gags.

843
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
He makes like,

844
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
okay, there was one I just read where

845
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
a girl at a social-

846
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
she's at church and she tears off her dress

847
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and she goes, was that a Taraway dress?

848
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And she replies,

849
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
is a Tara what you say?

850
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's a Simpsons joke.

851
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That is just a straight up fucking ripped off from Homer Simpson.

852
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yo, I'm looking at that comic right now, Ben,

853
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and it's pretty hot. That's all I've got to say about it.

854
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Oh, he draws porn.

855
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
He draws porn.

856
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
He draws his own characters.

857
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
He canonically draws porn scenes.

858
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Well, so does the greatest comic artist of all time,

859
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Christian Westerchild, but we don't have that

860
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
against him to do it.

861
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
No, but this is bad porn.

862
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
In the comic itself,

863
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
characters will hook up and it'll skip to the next day,

864
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
but then he'll go and actually draw the section

865
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and post it on Slipshine.com.

866
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You can go to Slipshine.com

867
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and buy that comic right now.

868
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Things are gonna get slippery.

869
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But the best thing about those

870
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
the best thing

871
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
about those comics

872
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
is when fucking

873
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
4chan gets a hold of them

874
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and edits them together.

875
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh, yeah, of course.

876
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh, my God.

877
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
You see, that's where the magic comes in.

878
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I don't want to get into a whole thing about this,

879
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
but I have really strong

880
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but conflicted feelings

881
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
about creators like that who draw porn

882
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
of their own creations like that.

883
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Really?

884
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It really ties me up in knots.

885
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I know I would.

886
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I really hate it, but I really

887
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Yeah, we know you would.

888
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I really feel weird about it.

889
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Is that so?

890
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You know, webcomics.

891
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
But I also feel bad for feeling weird about it.

892
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Webcomics.

893
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I know a webcomic

894
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
that does not have snarky witty dialogue

895
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
is Cucumber Quest,

896
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
the only webcomic I've ever read

897
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and it's still going

898
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and all the characters

899
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
except for the main character

900
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
are kind of dumb

901
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
or not self-aware

902
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
or really impulsive and irrational

903
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
in hilarious ways.

904
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The main character plays the straight man

905
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
to all of them, but he's not that strong-willed

906
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
so he just gets swept away by all of them

907
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
but he's always trying

908
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
to be like, wait, come on, that's a totally stupid decision.

909
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
No!

910
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And it's hilarious.

911
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
The titular cucumber.

912
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's very relatable to any situation

913
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
you've been in in your life

914
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
when you were making a stupid decision

915
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and no one was listening to you

916
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
but hey, it goes deeper than that

917
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
because as the series has been going on

918
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
it's been starting to come into focus

919
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
it's starting to be clear

920
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
that all the impulsive actions

921
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
of all the characters turns out to be

922
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
accidentally or unintentionally

923
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
more along the lines of what you actually

924
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
the point is he's not all right

925
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
it turns out that the actions that everyone has been taking

926
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
has a lot more

927
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
logic behind it than it may seem

928
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
at first and it's a nice balance

929
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
of, oh man

930
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I was trying to say that

931
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I was trying to get this point in for like 20 minutes

932
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and the longer it sits in my mind

933
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
the more inarticulate it gets

934
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
my dialogue is not witty at all

935
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
so I think what the show

936
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
is what the comic is alluding to

937
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
is that the rational

938
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
thinking of the main character

939
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
in combination with the more

940
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
impulsive actions of all the other characters

941
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
put together

942
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
well whatever

943
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
the podcast listeners are going to be able to hear

944
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
in the podcast I'll be able to hear them

945
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
right

946
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
so it seems like

947
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
it's going to be the rational thinking of the main character

948
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
in tandem

949
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
with the more impulsive thinking of all the other characters

950
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
is going to lead the story

951
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
to a successful conclusion

952
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
and that's the kind of more humble

953
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
writing that I'm a fan of

954
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
like in the Lego movie where it has all of these creative characters

955
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
the ones you can just build

956
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
anything against the instructions

957
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and at first you're like oh these are obviously the savants

958
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
they're the only people who can break

959
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
the system and be cool and awesome

960
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and obviously all the people writing the movie

961
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and making the movie are all fancy themselves

962
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
as the creative types but

963
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
toward the end it starts to suggest

964
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
that just being a wild creative person

965
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
isn't very good you got to be more

966
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
rational than that

967
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
and so the movie shows you got to have both

968
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
types it's a writer

969
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
sitting down writing a story

970
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
about how they're not the answer

971
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and the solution to everyone's problems

972
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
isn't that interesting

973
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
now that is with

974
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
by do say so myself

975
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
wait what

976
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
what movie was that?

977
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
the Lego movie

978
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
the Lego movie yeah

979
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
cool

980
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
yeah go on Ben

981
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
okay

982
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
well first let me just make a side note

983
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
that control alt delete

984
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
is the ultimate webcomic

985
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
full of snarky dial

986
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and two clever by half

987
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
bullshit

988
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
by the way

989
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
is also the sound of that face that they all make

990
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
that's true

991
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
that's totally true

992
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
the only one that I feel is a little bit more

993
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
of a shame is

994
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
XKCD which is inundated with clever

995
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
bullshit that I hate

996
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and kind of ruins I can't read it much

997
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
anymore

998
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
sometimes the tone of XKCD

999
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
is really off

1000
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
but sometimes it's legitimately clever

1001
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
it lacks good punchlines

1002
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
it can be a really clever comic

1003
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I love the math stuff

1004
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I much prefer Saturday morning breakfast cereal

1005
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and

1006
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I hate Saturday morning breakfast cereal

1007
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I hate cannot stand that

1008
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
that's a fight for another day

1009
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I know I'm in the minority

1010
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
that's a fight for another day

1011
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and I really liked amazing

1012
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
the power powers in gun show

1013
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
before they stopped doing things

1014
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
gun show is great

1015
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
what was I talking about before you mentioned

1016
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
XKCD

1017
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
XKCD can be funny

1018
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
but I don't think the dialogue is ever funny

1019
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I don't think the dialogue itself

1020
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
is ever clever in a good way

1021
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I agree

1022
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
the dialogue is never amazing

1023
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
it's got really

1024
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
snarky sometimes

1025
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm looking at some of control alt delete

1026
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and I'm immediately remembering

1027
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
why I don't read any webcomics

1028
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
it's because

1029
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
you run out of jokes immediately

1030
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I tried to do a webcomic back when I was 16

1031
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I was going to do it

1032
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
twice a week

1033
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I ran out of jokes in a week and a half

1034
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
and I gave up like all webcomic artists should

1035
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
just resort to random violence

1036
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I tried two webcomics

1037
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
back in the day

1038
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
but those more fell apart

1039
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
because art is hard

1040
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
and finding artists to do shit for you is hard

1041
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
yeah

1042
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I

1043
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I wrote some good dialogue

1044
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm just going to say I wrote some pretty good dialogue

1045
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
oh sure

1046
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
maybe

1047
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
statistically someone had to

1048
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I actually write a lot of stuff

1049
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I've got strong opinions

1050
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
on the flip side of this

1051
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
which is a whole bunch of people

1052
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
complain whenever characters

1053
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
are witty in anything

1054
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and they're like oh that's not realistic

1055
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and what they seem to want is

1056
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
what we're doing now

1057
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
the back and forth where everybody's

1058
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
stumbling over their words and sounding like idiots

1059
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
um

1060
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and that's

1061
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
let me defend that position

1062
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
because if characters are so

1063
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
clever and so witty and have such great

1064
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
good liners that it's

1065
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
realistic and strains credulity

1066
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I think that's bad

1067
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I think that's bad too

1068
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
witty dialogue in real life

1069
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I think that can be a legitimate

1070
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
in real life battles

1071
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
real life deathifying situations

1072
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
can sometimes have witty dialogue

1073
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
there was some sergeant or whoever who said

1074
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
alright man there's two types of men

1075
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
on this battlefield those who are dead

1076
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and those who are going to be move out

1077
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and that was spoken on Normandy

1078
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
as it was going on

1079
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
there was a couple of them who got a good chuckle

1080
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
right before they got shot

1081
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
right before they got a bullet to the neck

1082
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I don't think

1083
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
that realism

1084
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
is really ever

1085
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
the goal

1086
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
in creating a work of fiction

1087
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
the goal is verisimilitude

1088
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
the goal is believability

1089
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
not realism

1090
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and

1091
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
to an extent

1092
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
if they're too witty that takes away

1093
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
from it but to the same extent

1094
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
if people are stumbling over their words

1095
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and using lots of filler words that sounds awkward

1096
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
that's not something people want to watch

1097
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
and that sounds fake in its own way

1098
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
like a real

1099
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
a real conversation

1100
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
not improvised like somebody who

1101
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
took all of this dialogue

1102
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and made people like all of what we're saying right now

1103
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
somebody who took that and made somebody

1104
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
rehearse it and deliver it

1105
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that would sound more fake

1106
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
than if they cut out all of the fluff bits

1107
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
and only

1108
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
hit the salient points

1109
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and didn't have us dancing around the same points over and over again

1110
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and just had us

1111
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
get to what we wanted to say

1112
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
on the subject of

1113
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
like you said, not going for realism

1114
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
necessarily but going for believability

1115
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I agree with that and I like that

1116
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
and I think that Tyrion and Game of Thrones

1117
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
is a really great example

1118
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
like his comebacks and stuff

1119
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
are maybe

1120
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
unrealistically good sometimes

1121
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
but it's okay when he does it because everyone else

1122
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
because he's

1123
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
all the times he does stuff like that

1124
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
establish him as being generally smarter

1125
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
than the people around him

1126
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
so when he is making one-liners

1127
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
and being like too clever by half

1128
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
it's kind of okay because you know

1129
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
that he is this like larger than life

1130
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
smarter than the people around him

1131
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
dude

1132
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
so even though it's not necessarily realistic when he does it

1133
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
it works

1134
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
that's what I have to say about that

1135
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
haha

1136
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I was just reading some of these

1137
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
SMBC comics

1138
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and noticing

1139
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
the thing about SMBC is that

1140
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
it's all the same

1141
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
it all feels like the same joke

1142
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
it's all some like

1143
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
it's some science fiction

1144
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
or like economic or scientific

1145
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
economic was a lot of him yeah

1146
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
his social concept

1147
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and then he just kind of presents it

1148
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
and has like a kid

1149
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
be like but dad

1150
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
why don't we just you know

1151
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
economic thing and the dad is like

1152
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
no son because

1153
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
you know other economic thing

1154
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
take into its logical extreme

1155
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
that's exactly the one I just read

1156
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
since he became a dad

1157
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
that's certainly more and more true

1158
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
like he's

1159
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
my issue is not that it's all about dads

1160
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
and their kids it's just that

1161
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
they all have the same like

1162
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
cadence

1163
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
wish fulfillment stuff for him though

1164
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
that's like here's how I'd fuck with my kid

1165
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
you know

1166
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
if this situation came out

1167
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
oh yeah every father just wants to fuck his kid

1168
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm with you brother

1169
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
that's not what he said

1170
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
haha

1171
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
fuck god damn it

1172
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
on

1173
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
okay on the subject

1174
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
of witty banter and someone getting off

1175
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
one liners

1176
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I heard like a brief snippet of an interview

1177
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
with Steven Fry the other day

1178
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and someone asked him

1179
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
about the differences between

1180
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
British comedy and American comedy

1181
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and what he said was interesting

1182
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
and I'm gonna try and remember it

1183
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and I hope I don't completely butcher it

1184
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I don't think I remember it exactly but I'll try

1185
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and he said like American comedy

1186
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
is very

1187
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
focused on like the comedian is

1188
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
like the hero and the comedian is smarter

1189
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
than everyone else

1190
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
and like you know kind of

1191
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
gives them up for the fools that they are

1192
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
whereas the British

1193
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
comedian is the fool

1194
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
and like life just shits on him

1195
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
so interesting that is

1196
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
yeah I think

1197
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I'm gonna try the example

1198
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I think the example he gave was like

1199
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
if someone is playing a guitar

1200
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
badly an American comic

1201
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
might come and like smash the guitar

1202
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
and everyone would go haha that's what I wanted

1203
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
to do

1204
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
he says what we're all thinking or whatever

1205
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
the comedian would be the guitar player

1206
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
who gets his guitar smashed

1207
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
by some dick

1208
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
yeah

1209
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
so there's a thing I guess maybe

1210
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
the witty banter

1211
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
that irks me so much

1212
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
is kind of an American thing

1213
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
or like an America centric thing

1214
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
could be it does feel that way

1215
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
now that you mention it

1216
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
did someone just leave

1217
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
his audio is fucking up so he's

1218
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
oh well I guess that's

1219
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
is it as good a time as any to end?

1220
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
probably

1221
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
we've only been going for like 50 minutes

1222
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
but I'm pretty comfortable with that

1223
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I will say before we close out

1224
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
despite all of that

1225
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
everything that we just said

1226
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
there are times when I enjoy

1227
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
and list witty banter as a guilty pleasure

1228
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
sometimes

1229
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
why don't you give some examples

1230
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
of witty banter done

1231
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
you know that's a good idea

1232
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I've been complaining about the concept a lot

1233
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
although I acknowledge that it can be done well

1234
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
well how about like anything

1235
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
in the Avengers movies if you like those

1236
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I fucking love the entire MCU

1237
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I like Joss Whedon's writing

1238
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
the Avengers is fun

1239
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
that's the whole thing

1240
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I can recognize that it's stupid

1241
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
but in the moment it's just like

1242
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I like it

1243
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm not a big fan

1244
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I haven't seen any of the Avengers movies

1245
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
but I imagine people don't really watch them

1246
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
for like intense character

1247
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
development or stuff like that

1248
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't know

1249
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
they watch the side movies

1250
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
for that they watch the Avengers

1251
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
for the big third act

1252
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
climax to every single

1253
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
other movie in the entire

1254
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
franchise

1255
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
that's what the crossover movies are

1256
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
so there's no character development in those

1257
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
there can't be

1258
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and it may still be guilty

1259
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
of this

1260
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
it may still be guilty of just making all the characters witty

1261
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
for the sake of it but nobody seems to really give a shit

1262
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
so you know at the end of the day

1263
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
what really matters is if people are enjoying themselves

1264
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I mean

1265
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
you know in a monetary sense so

1266
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
fuck it

1267
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
wait enjoying themselves in a monetary sense

1268
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
no no they're enjoying themselves and

1269
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
like the people enjoy the movie

1270
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
so they're willing to go see it and they don't care

1271
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
if the characters are consistent or any of that

1272
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
whatever

1273
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I think that truly witty

1274
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
not quote unquote witty

1275
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
banter or dialogue

1276
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
can only happen

1277
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
when it's occurring in a way that's consistent

1278
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
with like strong character

1279
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
development and characterization

1280
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and if it's like

1281
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
a witty line that's just

1282
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
in there to be witty and doesn't

1283
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
serve the purpose of the narrative

1284
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
or the character or whatever

1285
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
is bad it doesn't matter how witty it is

1286
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
it's bad and it shouldn't be there

1287
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
if it doesn't mesh

1288
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
with everything else that should be going on in the scene

1289
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
yeah like something like where

1290
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Sheldon walks up to Penny's door and goes

1291
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
knock knock knock Penny

1292
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
she opens door and she is a Penny

1293
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
that's witty dialogue

1294
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
that's real witty

1295
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
that's the kind of thing I want to see

1296
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
alright anyone have anything else

1297
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
or shall we end it now

1298
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
let's end it now

1299
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
okay everybody

1300
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000

1301
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000

1302
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
bye

1303
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I'm an asshole

1304
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I am a stupid

1305
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I've got a deadline

1306
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
don't wanna do it

1307
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
what the hell is wrong with me

1308
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I'm supposed to

1309
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
be making money

1310
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I'm

1311
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
supposed to be creating

1312
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
creating

1313
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
funny things

1314
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
that the people

1315
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
gladly will pay

1316
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
for artistic

1317
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
genius that's what

1318
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
they came for

1319
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
instead I'm tweeting

1320
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
hashtag repeating

1321
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
that's why

1322
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
there's no heat and holes

1323
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
in the ceiling

1324
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
yeah it's

1325
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
right the burden

1326
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
it's a hard knock life

1327
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
being a genius
