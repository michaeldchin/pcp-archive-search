1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm not generally satisfied by the pace at which the world dispenses engagement, so on a conceptual level, I've always been obsessed with theme parks.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The idea is to create a controlled environment, allowing you to wander through and effortlessly create an experience of streamlined, instant gratification fun.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, a podcast on the internet what a novelty.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I am the best guy ever and we're joined today by Munchy Where's Tiny Hats?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's me, Legoland. Here I am before you today, the most decadent king of all. I'm here to spread my wealth and tell you about the most wondrous plans.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Famous Sonic YouTuber Hippocrit?

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I was gonna say Legoland, you bitch.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What?

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I love Legoland.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh, not as much as me.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We've also got The Davoo.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hip bone, skelly, crits, wild ride was a really good value.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And Monkey Jones.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're not even a minute in and I already have to pee.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh no.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's do what I do, dude.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Just do what I do and just go on air.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just pee into your own mouth.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's true.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm gonna pee into the bottle that I'm drinking out of and then just keep drinking out of it.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, that's called second harvest. That's a water, a barter, barter, second harvest.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wow, that's good.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Is that to Paul Newman's iced tea brand second harvest?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You know, I'm drinking Rolling Rocks, so it probably wouldn't change the taste at all.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, for Rolling Cock.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Nate, what is the PCP?

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The PCP is the most knuckle-

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Advanced.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Whitening, earth-shattering,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Red Pill exploding Red Pill podcast in the world about a bunch of internet creators

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
who all came together because they had the perfect opinion when combined.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Perfect.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Wait, do we introduce the show every episode now?

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're working on it.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We're working on it.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, that's nice.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's cool.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Keep forgetting what the show is and we have to remind them.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's true.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's true.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So hopefully they'll bake it into their brains this time.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So today, everybody, we're talking about amusement parks.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
amusement parks, water parks, bumper cars, roller coasters.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, the teacups.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The teacups.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Getting belated by Armenian men who run the rides.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now we're talking.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Circus tent.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Dude, lots grinding into your fucking feet until they bleed.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's true.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Exactly.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's my favorite part.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, the great thing about amusement parks, I just want to say off the bat, is that you

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
forget how painful just existing as a three-dimensional being is until the end of the day after you

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
just, you know, like you walk around, you experience life, and then at the end of the day you walk

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
home and you're dead.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's great.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We should mention that we decided to do this after me becoming infatuated with a certain

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
water park vlogger by the name of Cy.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What is this?

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I am not privy to this meme.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Dude.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There's no meme here.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Cy raised a water park vlog, and I was so enthralled by it, and specifically its thumbnail, and

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
how literally ingenious it is, and how much I legitimately enjoyed it.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I just want to see water park vlogs constantly.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We know Cy has a kind of a weird predicament where his like subscribers don't all watch

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
his videos.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let me tell you, Cy, if you want 100% retention, the world needs water park vlogs.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Water park vlogs.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Guys, let me make a deal with you.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's the best water park in the world!

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And seriously, Cy, that was great.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Guys, I guarantee you I can get Cy to give me that thumbnail without text on it if we

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
want to use that as a thumbnail for this episode.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We should!

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, yeah, you're already going to see the thumbnail, because if it's going to be the

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
thumbnail you just click on.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, fantastic.

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Cy is in the thumbnail.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This episode is getting probably, what, 1500 views max?

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I think that's how it works.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, probably.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey, before we get too deep into the thing, let me read, okay, so there's no amusement

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
park entry, an urban dictionary, but what I did find was a disease called amusement park

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
hangover.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
All right, so let me just read this to you.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That feeling, and this is just like I was talking about before, the feeling you get the day

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
after going to an amusement park, particularly when you spend all day on intense rides,

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
symptoms include horse voice, headache, fatigue, and general pains, and then the description

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
is not funny, so I'm not going to read it.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So there you go.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There you go.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, so that's where we're coming from.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What is our favorite amusement park?

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I got to say Disney World in fucking Orlando, California.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Disney World, no question.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Nate, do you remember, do you remember this one time on Twitter where, I forget the exact

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
context of it.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Disney World, Disneyland, we were arguing whether Disneyland or Disney World was the

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
amusement park that one of our fans was attending, and I defeated you in hand-to-hand combat.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You did.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And I humiliated you, and you officially on that day handed me, quote, all of your

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
internets with a Z.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So I am not, in PCP Canada, in PCP lore, I'm objectively more powerful than Nate because

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have all of his internets.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So what that manifests is if you look at my download speeds, they're struggling to crank

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
out 0.01 kilobytes per second, whereas Munchy is just living in the lap of luxury, downloading

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
all the terror flops you could possibly want in his fucking life.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
One day I'll get him back.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Whenever I click on a download link, I just hear a punch sound effect because it's

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
downloading so fast.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Download 55 new mouse clickers?

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That instant.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Alright, Nate, why is Disney World the best theme park other than all the propaganda?

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, that sounds like a shitty answer everybody knows there.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let me see, I think I've been to, I don't know, maybe like six or so amusement parks

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
probably in my whole life, but Disney World was definitely the most fun.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay, but I'm sure a lot of it has to do, as I'm sure many of our stories will involve

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
the specific things that happened there and the situation that brought you there and the

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
people that were there, et cetera, et cetera.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So when I was in high school, me and my older brother Ben, who you might know, we both were

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
in marching band, and our marching band was pretty darn good.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And yeah, I know it's taken a weird start, but we were in marching band, I played the

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
clarinet, Ben played the saxophone, and we were well loved amongst our people in Massachusetts

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
where the school was.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well basically, our marching band was good enough where we were invited to Disney World

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to participate in March down the main avenue, and we all just, this would happen every single

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
year, we would all get together, we'd pack up our shit, and we'd all go down to Disney

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
World, and we'd just have a great time.

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So go there to March during one of Disney World's gay days, did you and Ben have an

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
experience every year?

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Do they allow gay people in Disney World?

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That place is really gone to shit.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This isn't a meme.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They specifically have gay days.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Does that mean no straight people are allowed?

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I mean, I'm sure you can go if you're straight, as long as you, you know, hike your pants up.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You just have to suck a dick on your way.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, but specifically so that same-sex couples can come over and hang out and make out without

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
all the Christian kitties getting corrupted.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay, you know, I think that's a real fucking thing.

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's an exclusion by exclusion.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's very popular.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, separate but equal.

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's kind of cool, you know, it should decide.

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But my favorite thing about that is how Mad Walt Disney would have been if he knew this

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
video.

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He'd be mistaking all these orgies and be like, God damn it, why didn't he freeze my head

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
like they said?

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I want in.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I didn't give the Nazis enough money.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So we'll see, that's the great thing.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's what I was going to say.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The best thing about Disney World is that canonically is the place where the frozen

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Messiah Walt Disney's corpse lives right now.

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And one day he will rise from the dead to save us all from the cuckoldry of modern life.

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So that's, you know, that's why I go down there once a year to pray to him.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's my Mecca.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And it's got the rock and roll roller coaster with Aerosmith, baby.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So that's where I do most of my work on that roller coaster.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Like, cool it would be if Walt Disney actually did get cured of death and he just came back.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
Like and that actually paid off.

170
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,000
And then he had like the, the, all of his, what do you call them?

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When you, yeah, copyrights.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
All of his copyrights would be extended for another billion years because now he's alive.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh yeah.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The law will be fucked.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's what's going to happen.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Disney is just going to like, the company's just going to hire someone to act like Walt

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Disney.

178
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now copyright, this is copyright now because since we, since we asked them to extend it

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
too many times, we're just going to like reset the entire counter again.

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's going to be the new strat.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Silly old religious people who believe in souls and whatnot.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Not even, you know, you don't have to be religious, but whatever.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
People who believe in souls think that like death is magical.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But death really is like an engineering problem that we could one day solve.

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If Walt Disney came back from the dead, I think Disney would have a, the company would have

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
a really hard time readjusting to being like artistically motivated in like a personal way.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Maybe like, that's what it feels like to like have an idea.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I just, just the other day I was watching some documentary about a guy who like, used to

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
work at Walt Disney.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He called Walt Disney.

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I fucked up.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I fucked up bad.

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But he, like he said this quote that is totally famous, but I just forgot and he reminded me.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's that Walt Disney is the guy who said that like, we don't make art to make money.

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We make money to make art.

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So for him, it was all about just, you know, like having the resources available to continue

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
to make his craft.

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And you know, who knows?

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You know, Jew hating aside, you know, you got to respect that.

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You got to respect that.

202
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, I respect you.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's my personal goal.

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's my personal goal.

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know why I have to excuse that.

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Of course.

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Walt Disney famous for his Viagra with series.

208
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Much beloved.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Much beloved.

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Big Princess Tutu fan.

213
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now I, I too love all things Disney.

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm a big Disney movie kind of guy and I love Disney theme parks.

215
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
However, I do not live on the disgusting, uh, rancid, fucking like, like yellow colored

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
dick that is the East Coast of the United States.

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I live on the West Coast.

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We're old money.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We're old money.

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah.

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're new money.

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You'll never be one of us.

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You'll never be one of us.

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Disney specifically made the other parks because this is what I saw from their, from their

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Disney world propaganda movies on the travel channel.

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It was like, you know, back in the 60s, the ride over to get to Disneyland was filled with

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
all these cheap, cheesy hotels and diners and dives and shitty places and cheap smoke

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
shops.

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,500
And Disney was like, well, that's just a shitty way to get to my park.

230
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
So he built other ones.

231
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, by the way, guys, the ride into Disneyland is no longer like that.

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Law.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is that, okay.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, right.

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay.

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm following it.

237
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Law.

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Anyway, Disneyland is from what I hear just like shittier Disney world, but fuck you.

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You even have the magic castle, you cuck.

240
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you doing?

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We have the magic castle.

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You got a cheap imitation.

243
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It doesn't have Walt Disney's body frozen inside.

244
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okay.

245
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's not the real magic castle.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
True, true.

247
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay.

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The best part about Disneyland is how they literally like emotionally manipulate you

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
on every conceivable level, physical and emotional.

250
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
They like, they like have like, like different smells that they emanate from their fucking

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
carnices.

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah.

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Like, like, like every single restaurant has at least one dead body inside emanating

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
delicious smells for you to.

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Delicious pheromones.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Dude, look.

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I've read this in a book in the game, game design book of lenses book by Jesse Shield,

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
a guy who worked at Disney.

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He was saying that when they were making Disneyland, Walt Disney was like looking around like,

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
you know, like pointing at people like, okay, go there.

262
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay.

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That right.

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Put that one there.

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You know, that kind of shit.

266
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,500
Then sometimes he would bend down on his knees and then kind of like hobble around a little

267
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
bit.

268
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
People were like, why you hobble on your knees?

269
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,000
And he's like, I got to know what this park looks like from the perspective of a kid.

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And it's like, oh shit.

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's so cool.

272
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Genius.

273
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In the fucking dirt.

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,500
He's just going to like a wheelchair or something, dude.

275
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,000
Are you going to like hop on a lady's back so you can see what it's like from a baby?

276
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like, what the fuck?

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah.

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why not just take two barrels of a shotgun and blow off your fucking calves and then

279
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
you're, you know, a couple feet shorter.

280
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I know you really should do that.

281
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He just, he just doesn't understand the hardships to come.

282
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He needs to get serious.

283
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He needs to get serious about that shit.

284
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Get your fucking head in the game Walt Disney.

285
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Jesus Christ.

286
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What I was going to ask is, I mean, so the Undertaler, right?

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He's a staple of the Disneyland experience as I understand it.

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Every time I go there and I want, you know, you know, I think I'm going to go, okay, I'm

289
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
going to go, I'm going to go to Adventureland.

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm going to get on Splash Mound and then I think, oh wait.

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And then I like walk near and he's like, oh my Jesus.

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm so good to see you.

293
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is he like a mascot?

294
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The Undertaler is like, he's the Casey Neistat of Disneyland.

295
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah.

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He defines the culture of that area.

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I believe like the Undertaler is like a mascot at Disneyland.

298
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I remember seeing in the news one time that like one, like Mickey Mouse mascot at like

299
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Disney World like touched a 13 year old girl's like chest right before a photo shoot.

300
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And so he got arrested.

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think the Undertaler gets arrested if he doesn't molest the kid he's taking a picture

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
with.

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Guys, just keep your ear to the ground for when Disney buys the Undertale copyright

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
rights.

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Keep your ear that there are, that there are fucking developments being made at Disneyland

306
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
for a Undertale ride one day.

307
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
When the PCP gets like 15 billion subscribers and then we get bought out by Disney, then

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
they're going to have full rights to the Undertaler character and they're going to be able to,

309
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you know, use him in whatever disgusting wicked ways they see fit by making him a cleaner,

310
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
more socially adjusted person.

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's going to be a complete perversion of the original vision of the character.

312
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
By the way, next time I go to Disneyland, I'm going to piss my pants so I can really get

313
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
into the shoes of the Undertaler.

314
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can really see what it's all about.

315
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's like performance art.

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's like performance art.

317
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's real Gonzo journalism.

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah.

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The Undertaler is definitely the pissed Gonzo journalist.

320
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He really just has to live it and, you know, write about it as he sees fit.

321
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay.

322
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
All right.

323
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But no more fucking around.

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Undertaler, get out of my way.

325
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh, I'm in the acid now.

326
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There's new acid rides at Disneyland.

327
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
In case you didn't know.

328
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The fucking best part about Disneyland, I don't know if this is even in world, is the giant

329
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
turkey legs.

330
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The turkey legs are fucking huge and like the size of my head and every time I go there,

331
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I eat like two and I literally barf every single time and it's what I want.

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I legitimately throw up at Disneyland every single time I go.

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Every single time.

334
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't know how meme-y you're being, but that seems to be the perfect technique.

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No.

336
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm not any.

337
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I do it all the time.

338
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Every single time because I just want to eat all the turkey legs because they're so big.

339
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They're so big.

340
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
One of the theme parks I always go to, it has like these really awesome giant turkey legs

341
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and I remember like a picture of me as a kid with my brother with those giant disproportionately

342
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
huge turkey legs.

343
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Where the fuck do they genetically engineer these Titan turkeys?

344
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's what I was going to ask because I never got a turkey leg in an amusement park, but

345
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I feel like there's just amusement park staple food which includes those giant turkey legs

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
because whenever King Richard's Faire is a big Massachusetts, or is it in Connecticut?

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, it's in Massachusetts like a big medieval festival that happens every year or whatever

348
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and Renaissance Faire, that's where I'm looking for.

349
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah, and it's like they sell the giant turkey legs and they also sell them in Disneyland.

350
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Is there like some menu that like all amusement parks order from?

351
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I mean personally, my favorite was always the clam chowder bread bowls.

352
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Those are my personal favorite of all time.

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Clam chowder bread bowl is an amusement park food?

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, I've never, that's fucking crazy.

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Well that's what I was going to say because I know I get them at King Richard's Faire

356
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
when I go, but I've never gotten them in an amusement park.

357
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah, I don't see anybody at Disneyland or the bowl of soup.

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Fucking knight and kings and fucking bars did not have a clam chowder, you goddamn fucking bitch.

359
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
My question is, what's everybody's thoughts on funnel cake?

360
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Because I personally fucking hate it.

361
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I love funnel cake with strawberries and whipped cream on it.

362
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh, it's my favorite.

363
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Is that the cake that you put in a funnel in those deviant art comics?

364
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Is that what they do?

365
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh shit.

366
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's like a weird grid of batter that they deep fry.

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It really is a grid.

368
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's like if you have stringy diarrhea and you deep fry it and then cover it in powdered sugar.

369
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's what a funnel cake is.

370
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I've never seen this before in my fucking life.

371
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is the worst thing I've ever been subjected to.

372
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's pretty good.

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's like, let me think, how to describe it?

374
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, just imagine cake, but imagine it fried instead of whatever.

375
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's just a very light, fluffy fry.

376
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Imagine if French fries were sweet instead of salty and never stopped.

377
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It was just a giant spaghetti.

378
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's called sweet potato fries and those are good.

379
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What does funnel cake have to do with amusement parks?

380
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because they're amusement parks, according to me and Nate.

381
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And you guys are all wrong, I guess.

382
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's one of the staple foods, yeah.

383
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, actually, they sell those and then they sell...

384
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Shit, what are they called?

385
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
These are actually, you see them a lot at baseball games as well or like football games.

386
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, they're called hot dogs.

387
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
They're just like...

388
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Not a fucking hot dog.

389
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well, that too, but like...

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Heroes.

391
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's like a funnel cake.

392
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You may have heard them, they're called hamburgers.

393
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
God damn it.

394
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What the fuck is this thing?

395
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's just like a funnel cake.

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No, god damn it.

397
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's called cup of water.

398
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's like a funnel cake, but it's like one piece.

399
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Barefoot.

400
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's just a thing.

401
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Fuck it.

402
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Fuck it.

403
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay, alright.

404
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Alright, that's enough talking for you one day.

405
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You just go ahead and get back in the cage real quick here on the big boys' talk.

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The actual best food ever made outside of any, you know, like not just relegated to amusement parks,

407
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but they're generally inside of it.

408
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Before like, when extinct were Dippin' Dots.

409
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Dippin' Dots were the only fucking food I loved in my entire life.

410
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah, those were at their parks too.

411
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Why do you see they're extinct?

412
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Like, I still have them at Walmart down here.

413
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What?

414
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, monkey me too.

415
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We have them at Walmart, yeah.

416
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay, okay.

417
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, over here, they used to be like at McDonald's.

418
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
They used to be like at every single fucking store.

419
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
They used to be everywhere.

420
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They're like popular mainstreamies.

421
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I used to always get them.

422
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Let me tell you.

423
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But now, I don't see them anywhere.

424
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Okay, I was down at my favorite amusement park the other day, the Creationist Museum.

425
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Not a joke.

426
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Is that the Ken Ham one?

427
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What's his name?

428
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Ken Ham or Ken Bone?

429
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I always mix them up.

430
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Maybe Ken Ham.

431
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's the one in Kentucky that's like nearby.

432
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So it's whatever that one is.

433
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The guy who debated Bill Nye way back in the days before Bill Nye was a cook.

434
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Ken Bone is the really cool, funny XD presidential election.

435
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But the point is, it's clearly superior to Disneyland because they did have Dippin' Dots.

436
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
They had old Dippin' Dots booths.

437
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What the?

438
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You can start around me.

439
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No, here's the thing with Dippin' Dots, though, is that they have to be like in a super, super

440
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
cold freezer.

441
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They have to build special freezers just to keep them from melting.

442
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So it's like too much of a liability to have them because they keep fucking melting.

443
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The theme park guy.

444
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Because they got too many kids wandering in there and freezing to death.

445
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's just a big, you know.

446
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And then they try to burn down the restaurant.

447
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's like a whole boot.

448
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's crazy.

449
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, like the Dippin' Dots at the theme park I went to, they were like everywhere.

450
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Every couple of street paths, you run into one.

451
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And like, my family has always been very conservative with money when we go to one.

452
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So it's just a constant tease.

453
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And so I never actually had them.

454
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But they looked cool.

455
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Ice cream of the future.

456
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Goddamn it, I've seen them here for like seven years.

457
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
How long can the future go?

458
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah.

459
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Hey, remember Dibs that were like a bucket full of like these little individual ice cream

460
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
things?

461
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh yeah.

462
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Dibs?

463
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah, they're like covered in chocolate that you guys are talking about.

464
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Dibs are everywhere for me.

465
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Sorry dude, this is Food of the Future.

466
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
All we're going to be eating here in 20-30.

467
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah.

468
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You better get woke.

469
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Basically nothing in this podcast so far has like run true.

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Like, oh yeah, I know that.

471
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Like nothing.

472
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Well, what do they have in their lives over there?

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I haven't ever walked before and seen a funny fucking clown juggle out of them.

474
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Do they have like a fucking crime rib and steak over at your music park?

475
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh yes, it's me.

476
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The average English nine-year-old child.

477
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, I shall have my pride.

478
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I shall have my starline with my sword with my elbow.

479
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We have fuck off.

480
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Candy floss.

481
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Candy to me.

482
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Get out of here.

483
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That sounds like the least healthy thing for your teeth of all time.

484
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh wait.

485
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No, you call it...

486
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That explains a few things.

487
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You call it cotton candy.

488
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's right.

489
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We call it candy floss.

490
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I guess because it gets stuck in your teeth.

491
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's the joke.

492
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh shit.

493
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It just melts on your tongue, you sick fuck.

494
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Guys, who else has this crazy moment of finding out all at once

495
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
that cotton candy is called something different in other places

496
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and in other places it's called it so pervasively

497
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
that a local had to spend five seconds remembering the word for cotton candy.

498
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I had no idea it wasn't called that everywhere.

499
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's fucking crazy.

500
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah, that's fucking crazy.

501
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's like the biggest, most crazy one I've experienced in like many years.

502
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I thought I knew all the ones.

503
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I guess if you say we have cotton candy too, dunk ass, and then do that emoji.

504
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay, Kim, tell us more.

505
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What's England like with this shit?

506
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Well, I'm very easily amused, so...

507
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Everywhere's an amusing park if I try hard, no.

508
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

509
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Like a regular park will do me just fine.

510
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But I haven't been to many and usually when I have

511
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
it's like been part of a school thing or like a family thing.

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But like, hey kids, since you've been good

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
we're going on a school trip to Thorpe Park

514
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
or Chessington World of Adventures.

515
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm like, clean.

516
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
These parks sound like work.

517
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Why do they sound like homework textbooks?

518
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I know, I feel like America's a lot more densely packed with amusement parks

519
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
because they're just not more everywhere.

520
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I only know those two.

521
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I only know those two and then Legoland.

522
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And then there's a bunch of zoos.

523
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Six Flags Adventures.

524
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No Six Flags, no Disneyland.

525
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You don't know about Six Flags, no?

526
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I know about it.

527
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's got that, the both of them.

528
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I actually have a picture of 12 year old me posing with the dancing old man

529
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
because I went for Six Flags when he was there.

530
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh my god!

531
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You have to put that.

532
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't remember, but I'll try to find it.

533
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It might be on my old, old Facebook account

534
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
that I'll have to reactivate and dig through,

535
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
but I'll fucking do it.

536
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Why did they let a monkey into a theme park?

537
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
He was working there.

538
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We all know that monkeys work in an amusement park.

539
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Please, please put that on screen right now.

540
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Be insane.

541
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
If I find it.

542
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
By the way, cool thing about Chessington World of Adventures

543
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
is that the land has a literal castle on it

544
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
because the people own the estate.

545
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I knew it, I knew it.

546
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You are castles.

547
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We have more castles than amusement parks.

548
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm pretty sure.

549
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So turning actual history into a,

550
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
this whole fucking castle has no history.

551
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's not part of the park.

552
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah, fuck the Native Americans, know what I'm saying?

553
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's just sort of on the hill

554
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and it's the people who own the land own the castle

555
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and you can sort of go up to it,

556
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
but I don't think you can go in.

557
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I haven't tried, but yeah.

558
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
One of the two theme parks, they're always near me,

559
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
is sort of based on a history thing,

560
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
but I'll get into that later, tease for the future.

561
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You knock on the castle door.

562
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Where's my starline?

563
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Starline, I ordered it in the area 35 minutes ago

564
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and I'm starting to get queasy.

565
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
All right folks, we've talked about the food.

566
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But I've got some insight for you

567
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
because I famously worked for a summer at an amusement park.

568
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So let's talk a little bit about the rides.

569
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yes, finally the main event.

570
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Let me ask you, how much training do you think

571
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
each 16-year-old worker gets

572
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
before operating this giant piece of machinery

573
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
that they're responsible for the lives of all the people on them?

574
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, how much training do you think I got

575
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
for every ride?

576
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
There's a reason the most popular undergraduate degree

577
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
in the world is amusement park ride operation.

578
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So, you know, good four years.

579
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Moku, are you a carny specifically?

580
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I want to believe that you were a carny clown.

581
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I want to believe you were a fortune teller.

582
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Maybe. I mean, I just operated the rides

583
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
but I did predict some future events.

584
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Okay.

585
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So, how'd it go down Moku?

586
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So, the way my amusement park worked,

587
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
which I worked at Adventureland,

588
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
which is in some city in Iowa, I forget the city,

589
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
somewhere around Des Moines,

590
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
they didn't want you to get bored at any one ride.

591
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So every single week you would get trained for a different ride

592
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and then do that ride for the whole week

593
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and then move on to the next one.

594
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So by the end of the summer, I had pretty much operated

595
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
every ride in the park, which is kind of cool

596
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
because then I knew how they all worked.

597
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That sounds like a good idea, yeah.

598
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But, like, you know, you work Monday through Sunday

599
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
or whatever the fuck, and the Monday morning,

600
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
they give you about five to ten minutes

601
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
like telling you how to do the ride,

602
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and then that's it.

603
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And then you just like on your own for the whole week

604
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and you're like a fucking 16 or 17 year old kid.

605
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Awesome.

606
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Did anything go wrong?

607
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Not for me.

608
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Well, that's the thing.

609
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's always fun because, like,

610
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
you're 16 and there's no responsibility.

611
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So you can just, like, tell kids in line

612
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
who are waiting like, you know how many kids died

613
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
in this ride yesterday, man?

614
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I just got done cleaning the blood off the seats, dude.

615
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, it's pretty...

616
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Did you actually redo that?

617
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Of course I did. Of course I did.

618
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You're not a carny unless you tell the kids that

619
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
another kid died on the ride.

620
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I agree.

621
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Number one dream in life was to become a carny.

622
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That's what he trained day and night for.

623
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But something strange about it

624
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
is that I guess amusement parks have

625
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
like a weird thing with the child labor laws

626
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
because, like, even if you're under 16,

627
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
like, 14 year olds were allowed to work

628
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
like the restaurants and shit.

629
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh, what the fuck?

630
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, but the thing is, like,

631
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
there was no restriction on how many hours.

632
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Like, I was a wee lad

633
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and I was working like 55 hours a week.

634
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Maybe it's because it's like a seasonal job

635
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and, like, there's like a special thing with it.

636
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But, like, I was there

637
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
because the morning shift was 5 hours

638
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and the night shift was 7.

639
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I would just work both because why the fuck not?

640
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I drove all the way there.

641
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So I'd be working, like, you know, 12 hour days,

642
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
6 days a week.

643
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And I don't know why they're allowed to do that

644
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
for people who are not adults.

645
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's weird.

646
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That's a very good question.

647
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Y'all need to unionize.

648
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
They need a leader.

649
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
They need a union-leadered monkey.

650
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You're the man for the job.

651
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh, yeah.

652
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Well, I think Unes, I think Monkey Jones.

653
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Instantly.

654
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Elliot Roger did nothing wrong.

655
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That's the platform.

656
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's what he sounds like, dude.

657
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Sweet Monkey Jones.

658
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
See, I'm going to make a new Elliot Roger video.

659
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The cowards will eat it up.

660
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Monkey, did you ever get mumbly?

661
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Mumbly all the time?

662
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Because that's the number one thing.

663
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm thinking, how many times do they think

664
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
when they start a new day or a new week

665
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
thinking, you know what,

666
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm going to clearly enunciate

667
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
the instructions for this ride

668
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and how many times, how many loops

669
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
can they go on before they give up

670
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and just be like, put your hands in the blah, blah, blah, blah.

671
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Oh, I see what you're saying.

672
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Now, I mean, it's like the same

673
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
sends over and over again.

674
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's not too hard.

675
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
There was one ride at a theme park

676
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and a fucking pre-recorded thing

677
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
by a professional.

678
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It was like, keep your hands in the sea

679
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
at all times.

680
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I was like, holy shit, this is great.

681
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You can hear it perfectly.

682
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's way more pleasant to listen to

683
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
because it's with an actual microphone

684
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and they got rid of it at some point

685
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
and went back to the mumbly teenager

686
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and I'm like, I don't blame them.

687
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This is a broken system.

688
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Why not use pre-recordings?

689
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Dude, that was the best.

690
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Disneyland is broken up in two parks.

691
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
One is actually Disneyland and then there's a sister park.

692
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's like across the fucking...

693
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You just walk two seconds and then you get into another one.

694
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's called California Adventure.

695
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
There's a ride that's called a Soren over California.

696
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Something in that effect.

697
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
In fact, David Putty from Seinfeld

698
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
walks out and he's in this fucking snazzy

699
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
pouts outfit and he's like, it's me, David Putty.

700
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Fucking keep your fucking

701
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
slut hands to yourself, bitch.

702
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And then he slams the door on your face

703
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and then you get this cool

704
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
like AMV of real life

705
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
while you jam the fuck out

706
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and like fly.

707
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
AMV of real life.

708
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
There was one ride called, I don't know,

709
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
some generic crazy scientist name.

710
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's one of those indoor rides

711
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
that has all these crazy lighting effects

712
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and it spins you around a bunch.

713
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But the line to the ride is also indoors

714
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and it's got this TV

715
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
that played this intro sequence

716
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and it's got several minutes

717
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
of intro of world building

718
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and it's very built the invention

719
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and like what he did and how he did it

720
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and what it's all about and what the ride is

721
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and like, but you can't hear any of it

722
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
because it's too crowded and loud

723
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
but I was like, why'd they fill all this shit?

724
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I know what you're saying, but I think

725
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I know what they're aspiring to when they do that

726
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
because like the best atmosphere

727
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
of any ride I've ever been on

728
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
was the Tower of Terror in Disney World.

729
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah.

730
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Which has this grand buildup, you're in this hotel

731
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and they're like, oh, these are the guests

732
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and like the line is so fucking long

733
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
like you get plenty of time to watch

734
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
the whole story as it unfolds on the TVs around you

735
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and the whole place is like decked out

736
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
there's bell hops fucking each other

737
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
in the corners and shit.

738
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The atmosphere is perfect

739
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and then it builds up and like the same voice

740
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
that we use for the narrator is like

741
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
as you're finally on the ride and it lifts you up

742
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and you're looking out at the park through the cracks

743
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and like the broken down walls of the hotel

744
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
it's like goodbye and then

745
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
you go falling as the fucking ride kicks off

746
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and it's such a great atmospheric adventure

747
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
that was so fucking great.

748
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Two points on that.

749
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
First of all, the Tower of Terror is literally the best ride up

750
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
they fucking removed it

751
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
they removed it from Disneyland

752
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
they got rid of it.

753
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
What about Disney World?

754
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Well, I don't know about Disney World

755
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
but I don't care about that because it's probably gay.

756
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Anyway, and fucking Disneyland, the Tower of Terror

757
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
was like the coolest fucking thing ever

758
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and it was like it was in California Adventure

759
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
because it was like oh fuck it, there's a California hotel

760
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
who would think they could make a Twilight Zone ride

761
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and make it actually like cool

762
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
but you know what, they fucking removed it

763
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and it was like iconic, it was iconic

764
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
everyone loved the Tower of Terror, it was fucking incredible.

765
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I forgot that, that makes it even better

766
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
but I will say

767
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
hold on, they removed it

768
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and they placed it with a fucking

769
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Guardians of the Galaxy

770
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's Nate, you haven't seen

771
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
either movie so you don't get it grown

772
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
first of all.

773
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces

774
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
of the small screen of all time, I know that much.

775
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Isn't it the movie where Max Landis' dad killed

776
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
two people in Cold Blood?

777
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm not talking about the Rod Sterling show

778
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
that's what I'm talking about.

779
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I know about no movie.

780
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I've got a Rod Sterling for you, Wing.

781
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Well okay, so as much as I love that

782
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
that's not my favorite ride of all time

783
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
okay, my favorite ride of all time

784
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
is in a little place you might have heard of

785
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
called Tokyo Nippon, alright

786
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and I rode this every single day

787
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
called the subway system

788
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
of Tokyo, Japan

789
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
so you get on this thing

790
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and they really create atmosphere

791
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
there's all these slant-eyed actors looking at you

792
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
there's obviously something

793
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
there's all these yellows

794
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I appreciate the commitment of the character

795
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
of these fucked up individuals

796
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and the little announcer is like

797
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
ah, Denwa, doors are now closing

798
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
you fat American fuck

799
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and I'm like yeah, thanks dude, I get it

800
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and then I ride, I ride, I ride

801
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I've experienced it my whole life, I did it every day

802
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
several times a day, it was cheap as fuck

803
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I wish I lived somewhere where there was a subway

804
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
so I could do it again, I love subways

805
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Subways are my favorite amusement park ride

806
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I like thrilling rides, Nate, but I like scarier rides

807
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm trying to buy all those ghouls

808
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and freaks, I might make my heart pound

809
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
a little bit too fast there

810
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I think you might be going a little bit to

811
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
an over the line there

812
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
that's understandable

813
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
escalator land

814
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
when do we get to the ride

815
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
is the ride

816
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
yippee

817
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
what a classic

818
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
incredible, thank you

819
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
did anybody else think that show was called fairy god

820
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
parents and not fairly odd parents

821
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
that's fucking bullshit

822
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I was playing a Nickelodeon trivia game

823
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and the question was like what's the show

824
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
with Timmy and I was like oh that's fucking

825
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
fairy god parents dude and I got it wrong

826
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
cause it was fairly odd parents

827
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
fucking bullshit name

828
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Timmy was an average kid

829
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
that oh I don't understand

830
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
mom and dad and vicki

831
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
only give me names

832
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and then he went to fucking go

833
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and get his garden

834
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and then we practiced

835
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and then he was shot

836
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and then we went to school

837
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
there was no parents

838
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
there was no parents

839
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
did you guys see that they changed the theme song

840
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
cause they have a new female character

841
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
who is sharing the fairy god parents

842
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
with Timmy and it's fucking terrible

843
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I haven't seen it but I heard about it

844
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
okay, alright, Gib was saying something

845
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
what would you say Gib

846
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I was gonna start talking about my favorite ride

847
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
which

848
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
they're probably like all the rides I've ever been on

849
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
are probably worse than all American ones

850
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
just because

851
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
you know, I don't know

852
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
it's probably smaller I assume

853
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I assume everything in America is like 10 feet

854
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
taller than everything in England

855
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
yeah, that's right

856
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
like people included

857
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
as I've encountered

858
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
alright, guys

859
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
we're gonna get back to the whole thing of discussing

860
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
everybody's favorite deep berks

861
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
hey, hip-hop is talking

862
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
sorry, I had to go do a thing

863
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
for a minute and had to come back

864
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and re-announce myself

865
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
why would you

866
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
what did you think we were doing

867
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
what did you think we were doing

868
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
theme songs

869
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you shouldn't open with

870
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
fair enough

871
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
anyway, um, yeah

872
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I love Davoo

873
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I've never been into roller coasters

874
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
they scare me, especially

875
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
even the one at Legoland, like there's a one at Legoland

876
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
where it's a green

877
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
green

878
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
yeah dude

879
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
it was the first one I ever made myself go on

880
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and I tensed up

881
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
my whole body so that I basically

882
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
blacked out and I couldn't see and I died

883
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
but it was really cool

884
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
but later in my life

885
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
when I had glasses

886
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and I was at this theme

887
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I was at Thorpe Park for like

888
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
the end of school year

889
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
hey kids, we're taking you to

890
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
we're taking you to a thing

891
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and everyone's like, yeah

892
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
it's cool, we're all friends

893
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and I'm like, oh no, I don't have those

894
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
but this will be the moment

895
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
this will be the time in my life

896
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
when I can have the cool day out

897
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
with everyone and become cool

898
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and it was alright

899
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
but I was too scared to go on the rides

900
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
because I'd never really tried them

901
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and I hate it

902
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
so there was this one roller coaster

903
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
where I was like, I gotta do it with somebody

904
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I gotta do it at some point, I just gotta do it

905
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
so I got onto this thing

906
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and it's one of those rides where you like

907
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
your legs are dangling down below

908
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and I got in

909
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I was like fucking scared out of my mind

910
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and we were going

911
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and then one of the guys on my left

912
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
said, hey

913
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
you didn't put your glasses away

914
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
you got your glasses on

915
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
they're gonna fall off and I'm like

916
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
what? I didn't know that was gonna happen

917
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
so frantically

918
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I was just trying to

919
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
you have the thing around your shoulders

920
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
my arms couldn't

921
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
really quite reach around

922
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
but I could just about get my pinky finger

923
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
wrapped around the rim of my glasses

924
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and I was just holding on, I could feel it slipping off my face

925
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
and I was concentrating on that the whole time

926
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and I was just scrunched up and like

927
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
weird and when we got through the end

928
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I was just

929
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
so relieved that I managed to keep my glasses on

930
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
but then they had the picture come out

931
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
with like, here's you guys

932
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and all these cool guys

933
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
they're like screaming with a big mouth

934
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
exactly how you're supposed to look

935
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and there's me scrunched up, eyes closed

936
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
like a weird twisted

937
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
dead bug holding on to my little glasses

938
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
a freak, a monster

939
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I looked disgusting and nobody said anything

940
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
but I knew, I was like

941
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I've been there dude

942
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I've been on those rides trying to hold on

943
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
my various eye-wares that I wear

944
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
all the time, yeah

945
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
that would be hard, you have to just duct tape them to your head

946
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
yeah, but that was cool

947
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
that got me okayed

948
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
with roller coasters but I think the

949
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
most fun I had was

950
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
recently this summer, I went

951
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
to one because

952
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
you may know, I do like

953
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
a yearly week

954
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
with helping disabled kids

955
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
there's like a week camp

956
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and I do that stuff

957
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
it's about time Ben got that help that he needed

958
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
it's pretty rude that you call that a week camp

959
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
for these week people

960
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
it's a week long camp

961
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and one of the days we go out

962
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
to a amusement park and

963
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
the last time I went, I think it was

964
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Chessington World of Adventures

965
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
there's two in the whole of the UK

966
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and we went to the second one

967
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and there was like a virtual reality

968
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
3D headset ride

969
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
that was super fast and it was like planets exploding

970
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
with a

971
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Cortana lady saying

972
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
you're going through, we're going to warp speed

973
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
now and I'm like, oh my goodness

974
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
whoa, it was great

975
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
because I didn't have to

976
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
look at the ground, I could just feel

977
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
like I was going through space

978
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
so that was good, I like that

979
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
it's interesting to see how VR

980
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
gets worked more into riots as we

981
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
move into our future because the whole point

982
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
of an amusement ride to begin with is to

983
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
simulate the feeling of death

984
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
that's what they're really for, to make you terrified

985
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
your core and think, I'm about to die

986
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and you get that dopamine rush to your brain

987
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
which we enjoy, so if we could just do that

988
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
sitting on our asses through VR

989
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
then it'd be a lot cheaper

990
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
the moment that we get that, the whole issue

991
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
with theme parks is that people are slowly

992
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
realizing that there's just not much fun

993
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
to be had that you can't just have in your bedroom

994
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
on the internet

995
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I would say

996
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
that ride is the perfect

997
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and only good usage of a VR headset

998
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I've ever seen

999
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
you were flying through the air

1000
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
you could feel the wind

1001
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
buffeting your whole body

1002
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
there's no wind in space

1003
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
so how could that be true

1004
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
we were all thinking that

1005
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I think that it'll always be

1006
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
as long as human beings have physical bodies

1007
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and are basically the same creature that we are now

1008
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
which might not always be the case

1009
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
but while we are something like an amusement park

1010
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
we'll always have a utility

1011
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
just for the sake of changing your surroundings

1012
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
sometimes I mean I spend all fucking

1013
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
day looking at my computer and working and shit

1014
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
in the exact same like 3 foot

1015
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
location at all times

1016
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
either at home or at work

1017
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and to just divert

1018
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
from that for a time and go somewhere else

1019
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and do something that's just out of the norm

1020
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
God it feels good

1021
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
God I love it

1022
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I sort of joked earlier about like a normal park

1023
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
being just enough for me

1024
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm easily amused but it's kind of true

1025
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
just a change of environment

1026
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is really nice

1027
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and the thing with actual parks

1028
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
is that there's not that many people in them

1029
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
amusement parks

1030
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
scare me with the

1031
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
huge crowds

1032
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm not good with the huge crowds

1033
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I have many memories

1034
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I have a lot of memories of getting

1035
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
separated from brothers or family members

1036
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
or friends and stuff

1037
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and not being the one

1038
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
with the map and being like

1039
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I mean I'm just gonna die

1040
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I'm just gonna walk

1041
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
to dino land and jump

1042
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
into a mouth

1043
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Speaking of crowds

1044
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
there was one crowd related story

1045
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
it's actually the opposite of what you're saying

1046
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
but there was one time when my family

1047
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
we all went to Six Flags, New England

1048
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
in Springfield, Massachusetts

1049
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and so it was like

1050
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the end of the day I don't remember what day it was

1051
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
but for whatever reason it wasn't a very full day

1052
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
but at the very end of the

1053
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
day as the place was closing down

1054
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
it was like 6pm or something I think

1055
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think it closes kind of early whatever day that was

1056
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
so we happened to be there and like nobody was there

1057
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and me and my dad were just like

1058
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
you know what we went on the Superman roller coaster

1059
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
instantly one of the greatest roller coasters in the world

1060
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
everyone should ride it

1061
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
it's super fun that big

1062
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
dive at the very beginning

1063
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
but the point is

1064
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
me and my dad went on it

1065
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and we realized after we got out

1066
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
then we came back we were like let's do it again before we leave

1067
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
at the end of the day so we went at it again

1068
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and we realized there's literally no line

1069
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
let's just do it again

1070
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and so we did it again three full

1071
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
times over and over again on this roller coaster

1072
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
well I'm sure the people running it

1073
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
rolled their eyes they're like oh look at these

1074
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
look at these cool customers riding the same ride

1075
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
a million times but fuck them

1076
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
me and my dad had so much fun on that ride

1077
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
it was fucking fantastic I love

1078
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Superman and that roller coaster

1079
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
it was great so crowds can get fucked

1080
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I hope everyone dies

1081
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Isis I've got a couple targets

1082
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
for you mapped out on my map here

1083
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
some places where a lot of people gather

1084
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
you can just clear them out for me

1085
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
it'd be very convenient for me

1086
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
let's make that happen

1087
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
ride a roller coaster three times is a pretty good exchange

1088
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
for not having locks on your doors

1089
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
fair bargain

1090
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
what are you getting at

1091
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm not getting at anything

1092
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
oh

1093
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
we're gonna say our favorite

1094
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
T-Tarks

1095
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
let's do that

1096
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I forgot to mention the reason I brought up

1097
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
the like thing with the

1098
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
VR thing

1099
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
the reason I brought up the disabled kids thing

1100
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
was because I had to go

1101
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
on the ride with them otherwise

1102
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm a helper I can't

1103
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
they were fine the person I was with

1104
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
they were having a blast

1105
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
could you imagine being so retarded you can't sit down

1106
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
and get buckled in

1107
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I can't imagine

1108
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
those kids didn't

1109
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
it's hard to deal with kids

1110
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
people who are retarded literally mean slow

1111
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
so they're like deal with kids

1112
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
you go fast because they're on the ride

1113
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
yes

1114
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
that's true

1115
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
we're bringing them up to speed baby

1116
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
oh yes

1117
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I don't have a favorite theme park

1118
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
by the way because I'm gay

1119
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
no wait Legoland

1120
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
that's the one

1121
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
you do Legoland

1122
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I also

1123
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
it's a toss up between Legoland and Disneyland for me

1124
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I also love Universal Studios

1125
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
my least favorite is by far SeaWorld

1126
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
super fucking boring

1127
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and they don't let you get to see them

1128
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
torture the animals they do it behind the scenes

1129
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
they don't like you to see it

1130
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
ever since they stopped murdering Shamu for our enjoyment

1131
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
that place has really gone down

1132
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I want to see blood in the fucking water

1133
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
she deserves it

1134
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
but what always upset me is I would always think

1135
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
like SeaWorld

1136
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
water park vlogs

1137
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I want to go there

1138
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
we haven't even got to water parks

1139
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
that's going to be the whole park tour of this podcast

1140
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I would always want to go there

1141
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I would always want to go there

1142
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
to get wet but then I would like

1143
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
there's like no wet

1144
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
you need kind of wet like Shamu can like splash you

1145
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
but like I don't know

1146
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I want to get dripping I want to get sloppy

1147
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I want to get mushy

1148
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
that's what I want but I couldn't do it

1149
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I wouldn't think of SeaWorld as a water park

1150
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I think of it as like a fucking aquarium

1151
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
yeah it's pretty much an aquarium

1152
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
it's just supposed to but I don't know

1153
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I want to see the fucking

1154
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
guys just okay everybody

1155
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
alright take a journey with me everybody

1156
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
just close your eyes

1157
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and think back to when you were like

1158
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
14 years old

1159
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
it's the summer time the sun's beaten down

1160
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
that was like 10 days ago from Munch

1161
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I know

1162
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
you're on a class trip everybody

1163
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
you're wearing your swim trunks you got your t-shirt on

1164
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
you're going on rides

1165
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
you're checking out your 14 year old classmates

1166
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
with their burgeoning titties

1167
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
you're looking at what they got

1168
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
you're hanging out with all your friends

1169
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
it's nice and warm

1170
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
you're getting the fucking ice cream from the vendors

1171
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
you're going on rides and shit

1172
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
you're spilling them everywhere but it doesn't matter

1173
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
because you just go in the lazy river

1174
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and you chill with your buddies

1175
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and you're hanging out there for an hour

1176
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
as you just lazily drift

1177
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
it's the most fun you've ever had in your fucking life

1178
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
this is what I'm getting at

1179
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
water parks are the greatest thing in the world

1180
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I love water parks intensely

1181
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I love the lazy river

1182
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I was born in a lazy river and one day I will die there

1183
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
that's my destiny

1184
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I do like those but I never like water parks

1185
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
purely because

1186
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I got to wear a swimsuit

1187
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and I can't wear a shirt and it's like

1188
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm embarrassed about my gross body

1189
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
it's not cool enough

1190
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
it's not cool enough to be seen

1191
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
wear a surfershirt

1192
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
what the fuck is that

1193
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
we're an under armor compression shirt

1194
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
to shape your muscles

1195
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
people are going to know

1196
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
he's trying to hide something

1197
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
okay your problem is you give a shit

1198
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
fuck him dude

1199
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
you're there to check out 14 year old tits

1200
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
you're not there to impress anybody

1201
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'll go there today

1202
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I think if Ben Saint has the courage

1203
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
to go outside we should all have the courage

1204
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
to be naked in public

1205
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I agree

1206
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
water parks are great

1207
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
there's a water park that's near my house

1208
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
that's local and there's this giant ride

1209
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I think it's called

1210
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
literally the toilet

1211
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and what you do is you just walk up to

1212
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
the top of this very huge

1213
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
it's like a funnel

1214
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
that is the rise

1215
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
it's slanted

1216
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
so what you do is you just get up to the top of this thing

1217
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and you get in this little

1218
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
it's kind of like the lazy river

1219
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
you sit your ass in

1220
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
and then what happens is

1221
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't know if I can draw this diagram

1222
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
but just imagine you get pushed

1223
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
you get fucking shoved

1224
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
you ride the

1225
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
the water wave spiral

1226
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
you do a spiral in the funnel

1227
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and it's straight down

1228
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
it's sideways so you're going up

1229
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and you're defying gravity

1230
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
going upside down on this fucking funnel

1231
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
until you finally get spit out

1232
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and you get destroyed

1233
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
just think about the bizarre engineering work

1234
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
to make these like strange death machines

1235
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
just to make ourselves

1236
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
have fun for a little while

1237
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
it's so cool, I love the idea of making

1238
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
amusement park rides

1239
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
it's so like retarded

1240
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
but it's the coolest thing ever

1241
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I actually do have a favorite amusement park ride

1242
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
which is

1243
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I don't remember what it's called

1244
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
the tin turning wheel thing

1245
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
it's one of those ones where you're in a giant coffee cup

1246
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and it spins and it sucks you into the wall

1247
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
tea cups, tea cups, tea cups or whatever

1248
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
it's like the silly silo

1249
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
where it spins in a circle and you stick to the wall

1250
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and the floor drops

1251
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
one of the theme parks I live near

1252
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
they have one that's the one that goes

1253
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
way up and it goes sideways and stuff

1254
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
but that one's fine

1255
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
but they have this other really old one

1256
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I wouldn't be surprised if it was gone

1257
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
if I went there again

1258
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
it feels very 70s, it's got like carpet and stuff

1259
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
even though it's outside

1260
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and it's just so tucked

1261
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
out of the way where people don't notice it

1262
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
so it's very

1263
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
unpopular which means there's almost

1264
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
never a line I always get to go right in there

1265
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
so because of that

1266
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
experience and the aesthetic of it

1267
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
that makes it my favorite ride because it

1268
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
consistently doesn't have a line to wait through

1269
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
yeah

1270
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
yeah that's great

1271
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
accessibility and like

1272
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
isn't that a great experience to like find this great ride

1273
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
that other people just don't know about

1274
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and you've got there's just there's something about this

1275
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
that is so linked with like my

1276
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
happiest childhood memories

1277
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
everything having to do with amusement parks

1278
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
it just makes me happy to think about

1279
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
it's just such a joy

1280
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I love these, this is like the one thing

1281
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
that I like about children

1282
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
or that like things are made for children

1283
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
other than their bodies

1284
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
other than their sexy ass blooming bodies

1285
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
fortunately they won't give me a call

1286
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
every single one

1287
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
all right, I'll send you a snap right after this podcast

1288
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Nate

1289
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
sounds good

1290
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
yeah fuck Disney World

1291
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I know what the best amusement park is

1292
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
motherfucking thrillville baby

1293
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
look at thrillville go

1294
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
here comes ps2 zero

1295
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
you can go

1296
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
you can go flirt with a fucking 12 year old kid

1297
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
it's fun, you don't get arrested for it

1298
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I do in real life all the time dude

1299
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
well that's legal for you

1300
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
some of us get arrested for that

1301
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
thrillville you think a ride's dumb

1302
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
you fucking get rid of that shit and build a new one

1303
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
it's easy, it's fucking easy

1304
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
you don't even want to finish the roller coaster

1305
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
you just want to say let it crash

1306
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
you can do that, it's easy, it's fun

1307
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
does that hurt your morale for the workers

1308
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
well it probably helps the work of morale

1309
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
but it depresses total earnings

1310
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
the janitors don't like it because they have a lot of blood and guts to clean up

1311
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
but everybody else enjoys it

1312
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
because the kids are dead

1313
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
we should have a ride on thrillville

1314
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Billy Johnson

1315
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
he's a 12 year old boy, I ride him a lot

1316
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Ayo

1317
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
look at pedophiles go

1318
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
here they come, jails hero

1319
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
does anybody have similar stories to this

1320
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
so I've had a couple of incidents that happened like this

1321
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
but basically what I'm talking about is like

1322
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
so there's this batman ride or it was like a night wing ride

1323
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
it probably has changed since I was last there

1324
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
at six flags so it's this thing where you

1325
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
it's like a spinny circle that just

1326
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
lifts in the air and then you kind of like fly

1327
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
you lie down like on your stomach you get kind of

1328
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
squished into this thing and you hold on to the bars

1329
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
then it just like spins you like towards your face

1330
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
like you're flying like Superman

1331
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
so actually it should have been called the Superman ride

1332
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't know why it's called the batman ride but anyway

1333
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
so like we get in there and like the ride

1334
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
starts and we all like get into position

1335
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
and then the ride like shuts down

1336
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
like it gets stuck like that

1337
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
so I was there

1338
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
for probably like 45 minutes until like

1339
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
they pride me out of there

1340
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and I have situations where I'm like at the top of a roller coaster

1341
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
like about to go down

1342
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and then the ride like gets stuck

1343
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and then you're stuck there

1344
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
it's broken though

1345
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
that's never happened

1346
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I've been on ones that get stuck and then like

1347
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
someone climbs up and fixes a thing but only for a few minutes

1348
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
see it's at those kinds of moments

1349
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
that you realize how stupid it is

1350
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
to even be doing this in the first place

1351
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
and how like an amusement park ride

1352
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
is not what man was meant to do

1353
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
with the physical form

1354
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I know one roller coaster that has like these

1355
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
like stairs at like the top of the

1356
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
initial peak the initial peak

1357
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
that gets you going up there's these little like you know

1358
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
steel steps but like you have to go up

1359
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
you have to like like I actually saw it once

1360
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
a maintenance worker has to get on the ride

1361
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
then stop the roller coaster

1362
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
before it goes down the peak and he steps off

1363
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and then he goes on those little steppy things

1364
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
and I'm like whoa that's a cool

1365
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
as perilous place to work to like do your job

1366
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I do have a similar

1367
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I do have a somewhat I have a very just just a frustrating

1368
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
shitty gay experience which was

1369
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
this one log flume that has like

1370
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
the longest line in the fucking

1371
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
world and it's a 45 second

1372
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
ride like one second

1373
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
of ride is one minute of line

1374
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
and it closed

1375
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
when we were like three people away from

1376
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
getting on oh god damn it

1377
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I've had that happen to me too it's the worst

1378
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I was like why the fuck

1379
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
don't they put a giant

1380
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
stop sign on the

1381
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
beginning of the line 45

1382
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
minutes before closing

1383
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
that is such logic

1384
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
easy problem to solve you just stop people from getting

1385
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
in line as opposed to stopping them when it's

1386
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
time to shut it down it's so easy to do

1387
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
but they just don't give a fuck

1388
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
they don't give a fuck they're going to ruin

1389
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
children's lives

1390
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
my favorite ride

1391
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
is probably

1392
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
the simpsons ride for the incredible

1393
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
atmospheric vibe that I get just

1394
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
being in line

1395
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
just like the aesthetics

1396
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
match the gameplay wholeheartedly

1397
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
just when you hear that

1398
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
you'd hear that voice coming over the PA

1399
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Homer what are those monsters

1400
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
doing over there I don't understand

1401
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
no those are those are saying

1402
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
fire is skeleton

1403
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
that is not a good mo impression at all

1404
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
it's not mo

1405
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
so uh yeah

1406
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
actually like the second part of the ride where it gets to like

1407
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
so let's say some gangsta steps to

1408
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
your fly girl you just did it

1409
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
a Q

1410
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
shotgun blast yeah okay there you go

1411
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
the simpsons ride is legitimately fucking sick

1412
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
it's sick as fuck it's fucking

1413
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
lol it makes me laugh

1414
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
so fucking hard

1415
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
and uh

1416
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
like I don't even like the ride

1417
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
it's like the line of the ride

1418
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
because we are in line to get to the ride

1419
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
you have to wait like 45 minutes and then

1420
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
you just like blast simpsons ebony

1421
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
into your redna and then it's like

1422
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
behind the scenes like lore

1423
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
about how like that one fucking funny yellow guy

1424
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
who wants to get

1425
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
the simpsons

1426
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and then you can just see him do the funny fucking

1427
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
scheme on the tv

1428
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
that's actually great when they put effort into

1429
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
like the setup leading to the ride itself

1430
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
that's good like the uh

1431
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
like the fucking uh

1432
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
charlotte's own ride

then I'm done saying things

1618
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I remembered during the course of this that there

1619
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
was a very more more of a quaint

1620
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
theme park on the isle

1621
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
of white which is like an island

1622
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
just to the south of here just just for

1623
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
no black people right I understand okay yeah

1624
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
well white with a whatever

1625
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
bitch

1626
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
it's a tiny little island and it has

1627
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
this tiny theme park which is based

1628
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
on what the isle of white

1629
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
is known for is like known for smuggling

1630
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
because it's like a good place for pirates to smuggle

1631
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
shit and it's called black gang shine

1632
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
if anybody in the audience has been to

1633
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
black gang shine

1634
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
it's

1635
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
so fucking cool it's

1636
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
it's a place my dad used to go

1637
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
for every holiday he and

1638
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
his family would go to black gang shine and he brought

1639
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
me and my brothers to there

1640
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
and now there's like a like a it's like a

1641
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
our family heirloom is that theme park is great

1642
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and

1643
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
if I get an image

1644
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
there's a giant shine you said

1645
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
yeah shine like

1646
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
c-h-i-n-e

1647
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
oh okay okay yeah

1648
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
and it's pirate smuggler themed

1649
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and it's just it's so cool

1650
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
it's a giant pirate

1651
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
smuggler a statue at the entrance

1652
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and it's not like the biggest

1653
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
that's awesome

1654
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I just have a lot of fun memories

1655
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
of it there's like this western

1656
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
town area

1657
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
and a dinosaur place

1658
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
it's not like the greatest place ever

1659
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the smugglers are well known for smuggling

1660
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
dinosaurs in and out of this island

1661
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
oh and there was this one thing

1662
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
oh it's so scary

1663
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
it was like a trick mirror thing

1664
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
it's a little castle area

1665
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and you go in there and there's this

1666
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
this beautiful lady behind the glass

1667
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
and she's like you listen to the audio playing

1668
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
it's like I'm a lady I'm normal

1669
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm not evil and then

1670
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
after like five minutes of speaking

1671
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
there's suddenly a scary music plays

1672
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
boom and then there's like

1673
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
a mirror trickery thing where

1674
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
she physically looks like

1675
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
she turns into a monster

1676
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
but it's like because she's reflected from a mirror

1677
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
and you can't see the mirror as you're looking through the window

1678
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
so I thought like she's literally

1679
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
like an actual demon suddenly

1680
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and I jumped and I pissed my pants and I ran away

1681
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
but I love that so much

1682
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I hope it's still there I want to go back there

1683
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
when I have kids and show them

1684
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
and force them to piss their pants and die

1685
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
yeah I love

1686
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
that place so much if anybody knows that place

1687
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
that's great that's the coolest

1688
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
fuck yeah I have a few more

1689
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
points here as well I mean I could go out about theme parks all day

1690
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I have tons of memories from them

1691
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
because you know the most important thing I just want to comment on

1692
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
like the restaurants in theme parks are like

1693
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
usually shit but like

1694
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
one of the best restaurants I've ever been to

1695
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
and people will test this because it's super fucking expensive

1696
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
is the blue bayou at Disneyland

1697
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
do they have the equivalent of

1698
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
the blue bayou at Disney World

1699
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
do you know what that is

1700
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
it doesn't ring a bell I'm not sure

1701
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
you all know the price of the Caribbean ride right

1702
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
of course of course

1703
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
you are on a boat

1704
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
and there's like a slow river

1705
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
there's a little bit of dips and ups

1706
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
kind of like an atmospheric

1707
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
New Orleans sort of like a swamp setting

1708
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
but inside of this

1709
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
imagine the ride as a

1710
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
circle that's like pretty big

1711
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
in the middle

1712
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
behind the trees of the ride behind like the props

1713
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
of the ride there is a fucking

1714
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
super ass

1715
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
smug ass like anime expert

1716
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
rooftop soiree

1717
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
fucking like fancy

1718
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Louisiana fancy restaurant

1719
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
inside of the ride

1720
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
and you can see all the cool fucking like

1721
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000

1722
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000

1724
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000

01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
props for that that's pretty amazing

1732
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
it's fucking sick I love it

1733
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
world building

1734
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
exactly I should mention that I'm going to Disneyland

1735
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
on the 23rd

1736
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
oh my god

1737
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
for my birthday

1738
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
party

1739
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
if you want to meet up with munchie too bad

1740
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
because this came out the day after

1741
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
get a look at

1742
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
donky go

1743
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
you said it might do

1744
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
one last thing

1745
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
while it's not

1746
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
exactly an amusement park I went to the

1747
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Nickelodeon hotel in Florida

1748
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
when I was a wee baby

1749
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
hey I did that too

1750
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
that's where we stayed during our thing

1751
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I think

1752
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
it might be confusing things up whatever

1753
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
let's make the pcp hq

1754
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
at the Nickelodeon hotel please

1755
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
that's a good idea

1756
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
assigned sealed and the check is in the mail

1757
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
from Obama to us

1758
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
for endorsement hotel change

1759
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
so yeah so I went there

1760
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
his full name is

1761
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Obama Hussein slime

1762
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Obama

1763
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Nickelodeon slime guy

1764
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
excellent

1765
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
the reason he's so into slime is because black people are so intrusive

1766
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
in slimy

1767
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
he just takes some slime off from their body

1768
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
just carves them off and puts on

1769
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
his meals

1770
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
anyway so while I was at the Nickelodeon hotel

1771
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
there was this big sort of

1772
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
mini water park

1773
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
slide apparatus where you could get

1774
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
water

1775
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
the important thing is it was Miami

1776
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
or around there at least

1777
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
there was about to be a thunder storm

1778
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and also probably hurricane

1779
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
that was like about to destroy

1780
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
you should go inside

1781
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
probably and not be where the lightning is

1782
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
that was the first time I ever played Battlefront 2

1783
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
that was also the first trip where I

1784
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
like while in Florida it's slightly off topic

1785
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
but I saw an alligator for the first time

1786
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I was like this is my favorite thing ever

1787
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I also got really sick because I touched one

1788
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
what if an alligator was also

1789
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
investigating something

1790
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
hello look at don't go

1791
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
here he comes but never have a

1792
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
kind of on this hero

1793
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
hey don't go

1794
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
let's go let's go

1795
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
do we have a

1796
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
which prostitute would you rather

1797
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
fuck at the Nickelodeon hotel

1798
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
as told by ginger

1799
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
or Jenny the robot

1800
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
from my life as a teen robot

1801
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Jenny the robot obviously

1802
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
her it amuses me

1803
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
how much her popularity has exploded

1804
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
via porn after the show ended

1805
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
dill pickles yeah

1806
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I would fuck the main stormtrooper

1807
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I don't think dill pickles is a fucking prostitute

1808
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
neither is Jenny

1809
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
she's a classy young lady goddammit

1810
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
he's a one year old baby

1811
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
not an all grown up

1812
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
he's available

1813
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
in all grown up he's an obnoxious 10 year old piece of shit

1814
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
oh dude

1815
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
he's not one he's just 10

1816
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
he's just 5

1817
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I mean that's better right

1818
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I would rather fuck a 10 year old

1819
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
than a one year old baby

1820
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
serious question would it be better to fuck

1821
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
a one year old or a 10 year old for their sake

1822
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
cause if they're one they might not remember getting fucked

1823
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
but if they're 10 you could fuck them up a lot

1824
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
you can't fit your dick in a baby

1825
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I can find a way

1826
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I mean not me ask her a friend here

1827
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
oh no

1828
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
no no

1829
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
there goes her amortization

1830
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
there goes my hero

1831
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
there goes my hero

1832
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
look at donkey go

1833
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
that's the rule of threes baby

1834
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
there it is

1835
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
wait wait let me test it

1836
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
let's see if it's 20 the fourth time

1837
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
look at donkey go

1838
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
no nobody left

1839
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
oh shit boy

1840
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
before the recording started you were talking about

1841
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
the idea of having a sound board for the PCP

1842
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
that you're in control of

1843
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I would absolutely love a there goes our

1844
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
amortization sound

1845
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
that is a great idea

1846
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
oh that's unfortunate

1847
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
do you have anything to say about fair

1848
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
since they're kind of related

1849
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
no I want to go to quest

1850
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I talked about that renaissance fair for a bit

1851
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
we could stretch that out to a whole other PCP

1852
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
yeah

1853
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
press one if you want to hear an old PCP about fairs

1854
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
first carnivals and festivals

1855
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
all the places were clowns

1856
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
and they're a congregate

1857
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I just need episode of only me

1858
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I'll invite my special guest the japanese juggalope

1859
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
he's the underteller who was on this one

1860
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
that's an excellent idea

1861
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
here we go to questions everybody

1862
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
here's one from twitter

1863
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
you guys literally just didn't even get to me

1864
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I had a lot to say

1865
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
fuck me I guess

1866
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
why don't you interrupt sooner or something

1867
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I guess

1868
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I mean

1869
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
really it's more like

1870
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I thought that this podcast was going to go in a totally different direction

1871
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I thought we were going to be talking more about

1872
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
the need more analysis

1873
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
since it ended up just being a bunch of memories

1874
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
so I guess

1875
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
yeah I have a lot to say about

1876
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
it's not a fucking anime for children you can't analyze

1877
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
it

1878
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
is a

1879
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
designer of roller coasters

1880
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
you know exactly

1881
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I'm coming on forever

1882
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
roller coasters forever

1883
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I can go as long as we want

1884
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
so fucking

1885
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
if I was at a theme park

1886
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
the board meeting

1887
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
when they talk about how they're going to invent theme parks

1888
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
it's the origin of theme parks

1889
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
board meeting sounds like a cool fun meeting

1890
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
if you ask me

1891
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I would have put down my papers

1892
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
don't go

1893
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I'm sorry

1894
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I would have put down my papers and adjusted my bifocals

1895
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
and looked at the guy

1896
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
in the middle of the pitch for theme parks

1897
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
well if people are going to be standing around

1898
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
for like three hours a day

1899
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
in lines and this idea is not going to work

1900
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
come up with something else you know

1901
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
because that's what I always feel like when I'm in a line

1902
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
at the theme park where I'm like this whole idea

1903
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
like as much fun as I've had at theme parks

1904
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I feel like my experience with them has been

1905
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
weirdly mixed and that like

1906
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I just feel like the whole idea

1907
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
like just doesn't really work yet

1908
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
we really need to live in like a post-singularity

1909
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
post-scarcity society

1910
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
before theme parks can really work

1911
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
what are you talking about

1912
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
they're economically viable right now right

1913
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I assume they would be

1914
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
go on to questions this is a different topic

1915
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
no no no

1916
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
you can't get away that easy

1917
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
like lines are long

1918
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
but what are you

1919
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
what are you going to do about it huh

1920
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
what is your actual like

1921
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
you buy a fast pass for 100 bucks

1922
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
just go in the exit and get right in the right

1923
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
or if you're with a disabled person

1924
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
you can go right to the front

1925
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
dude I abused so many

1926
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
disabilities while I was at Disneyland

1927
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I abused so many

1928
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
my fucking my crack smoking

1929
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
uncle is like dude

1930
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
like one time I was shot in the arm and I don't have an arm anymore

1931
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
so like give me some tickets bro

1932
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and they're like okay and then I fucking

1933
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I stole them from him

1934
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
and I did all the rides very fast

1935
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
oh there you go

1936
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I'm like paying it forward

1937
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
cause I've only been to like two theme parks really

1938
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
really two that are near me

1939
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
and my parents are like why go to other ones

1940
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
so I've been to those two so many times

1941
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
that I feel like I've sort of like

1942
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I'm sort of like the illusion sort of breaks

1943
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
right so I get more of a cynical view

1944
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I really want to go to other theme parks once in a while

1945
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and like do that

1946
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
yeah yeah but like there's this one called worlds of fun

1947
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
which is like

1948
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
themed after the world

1949
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
so it's like different areas of different countries

1950
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
more like board meeting

1951
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
is it like Epoch kind of

1952
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
it's like it was a China area

1953
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
a fucking America area

1954
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and it's the most boring bog standard theming ever

1955
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and you don't even notice it cause it's not even thick enough

1956
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
it's like it's such a subtle theme

1957
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
you don't notice it and it's boring and stupid

1958
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
and like and like my

1959
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
my parents which is mostly

1960
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
most of the time I've gone to theme parks with my parents

1961
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
they're just really bad at having fun

1962
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
they like they don't understand how to have fun

1963
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
like they don't like to um

1964
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
they don't like to fork over the excess of money for food

1965
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
so they always like pack lunches and like

1966
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
so not fun god damn it

1967
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I came here to waste money god damn

1968
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
yeah exactly

1969
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
they always like walk back to the car

1970
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
cause they don't want to take it to the park

1971
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
yeah and I'm like why

1972
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
this is so fucking stupid

1973
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I don't want to waste money

1974
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I would rather have like a yummy turkey sandwich that my mom made

1975
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
than an 8 dollars and 50 cents fucking hot dog

1976
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
well it depends

1977
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I think with that it's like uh

1978
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
sandwiches and stuff it's always like

1979
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
kinda gooey and gross cause it's been in a hot car

1980
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
it's not the same

1981
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
my dad always put a cooler and I got cool packs in it

1982
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
and shit you know so

1983
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
my parents did that too

1984
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
it's like all the inconvenience of camping

1985
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
being like crowbarred into

1986
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
an already expensive experience

1987
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
of going to a theme park

1988
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
but yeah that's really the big issue for me

1989
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I never want to feel like I have enough money to spend

1990
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
and it always feels like

1991
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
it's just constantly fighting me to spend more money

1992
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
so that in combination with lines

1993
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
in combination with going to the same two theme parks forever

1994
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
like the other theme park we have

1995
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
which is like 4 hours away

1996
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
is called Silver Dollar City

1997
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
which actually has

1998
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
a theme right it has like an aesthetic

1999
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
which is like

2000
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
old timey america right so like 1800s

2001
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
because

2002
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
it was all based around a cave

2003
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
cause Missouri has a lot of caves apparently

2004
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
so these people

2005
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
like owned the cave back in the 50s

2006
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
and they started showing the cave off

2007
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
and selling tickets to it

2008
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
so eventually they started like having

2009
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
attractions on the line

2010
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
leading up to the cave

2011
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
and people ended up just watching the attractions

2012
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
so then they started building restaurants

2013
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
and then they started building rides

2014
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
and so eventually it became a theme park

2015
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
all around a cave right

2016
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
but it all was extrapolated

2017
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
off of the aesthetic of

2018
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
you know the

2019
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
the homesteading americans

2020
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
who found the cave right

2021
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
and also the indians who also found the cave

2022
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
according to the guy guiding us through the cave

2023
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
like how the who the fuck

2024
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
reported on that story I don't know

2025
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
also when we descend into the cave

2026
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
on their man-made staircase they play the theme

2027
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
of the empire from Star Wars

2028
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
the dum-bum-ba-dum-bum-ba-dum-bum-ba-dum

2029
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I'm like whoa

2030
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
but yeah it's a really cool theme park

2031
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
why that specifically

2032
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I know right well it's cool cause you're going into

2033
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
this big cave you know

2034
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
but like it's a cool theme park

2035
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
because it has all one

2036
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
tone one setting

2037
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
and it's very consistent

2038
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
you know everything feels like old timey america

2039
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
the rides are like

2040
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
the fire in the hole

2041
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
which is like an indoor roller coaster

2042
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
all about fighting fires before we had hoses and shit

2043
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
so it's really terrifying you know

2044
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
and like they've got like

2045
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
what's it like

2046
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
like a TNT themed roller coaster

2047
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
and so much shit like that

2048
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
and you know it's also christian too

2049
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I think like christians own it

2050
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
so sometimes there can be like

2051
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
there can be like some christian

2052
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
like there can be like some country singers

2053
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
at one of the little theater places

2054
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
the most country thing possible

2055
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
yeah yeah and like they can like incorporate god stuff

2056
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
and it doesn't break immersion

2057
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
because it's old timey america right

2058
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
so it like works right

2059
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I don't know where I was going with this

2060
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
but like oh yeah they even have a

2061
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
they have like a haunted house but it's themed after

2062
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
you know like an old timey mansion

2063
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
and it's really cool with like a

2064
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
five degrees tilted and it's the coolest

2065
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
possible experience of life

2066
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
is it built on an ancient

2067
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
in a native american burial ground

2068
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
oh it should be man they should like expand

2069
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
like find an age of american burial ground

2070
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
go there and build it

2071
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
and let all the engine spirits out

2072
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
okay you're right sorry I like theme parks

2073
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I just I just it's just like

2074
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
the last couple times we went to one

2075
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
it was just we weren't in the mood to do a vacation

2076
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
you know like it's just it's hard to get me in the mood

2077
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
to vacation you know it's just like

2078
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
theme parks are hard

2079
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
with like a family of

2080
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
various different ages particularly when

2081
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
my sister was very small because it's like

2082
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
she couldn't go on any rides and my parents

2083
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
were too old to care to go on rides

2084
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
and it was like this sucks right I need to go

2085
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
with just my friends and my girlfriend which I could

2086
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
probably afford to do now

2087
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I've never been to a theme park by myself

2088
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
but I feel like I would enjoy it

2089
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
a lot because of the

2090
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
because of the freedom to just

2091
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
not do anything if I don't feel like it

2092
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
every time you're with a person you're like

2093
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
are you having fun do you want to do this

2094
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I guess we'll do this what about you

2095
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
huh

2096
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
who's hungry let's go get food oh I don't

2097
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I'm not hungry well I mean

2098
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
you're a kid so you got to come

2099
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
with us well you know

2100
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I do like going if you can go with like someone that you

2101
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
you know just like a good friend who

2102
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
vibes with you well one person or two people

2103
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
like if I were with any of you guys I'm sure we would

2104
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
have a good time because we don't give a fuck about what the other

2105
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
person thinks you can just tell me if you're having a

2106
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
problem or something and then you know we'll

2107
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
immediately fix it as opposed to like a friend

2108
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
you don't know as well who just acts cagey and won't

2109
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
be upfront about what they want to do or whatever

2110
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
you know that's bullshit I treat amusement parks a lot

2111
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
like conventions as I described

2112
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
in the convention pockets where it's just

2113
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
very this is they're much better than convention in

2114
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
the way it's just a cool way to hang out with your

2115
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
friends and if you invite your buddy it's a cool

2116
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
time and just to do things

2117
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
that you might die on and it makes you feel

2118
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
like more like brothers

2119
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
also DeVoo once

2120
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
the PCPHQ happens I will take you

2121
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
specifically to an amusement park and we will go

2122
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
together yeah I realize

2123
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
like yeah going with the PCP would be great because

2124
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
you guys because even my offline

2125
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
friends who I've had throughout my life and gone to theme parks

2126
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
with aren't good at having fun either

2127
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
and my favorite thing about

2128
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
being in the PCP is you like

2129
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
there's enough people who are good at having fun I could

2130
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
just coast on it and have a great

2131
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
time so we yeah I'd love to

2132
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
do

2133
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Red Con 3 should just be at a theme park

2134
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
hey

2135
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
by the way I just want to say you mentioned

2136
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Christian themes and I just wanted to mention

2137
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
one of the most one of the most thrilling

2138
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
experiences I had at one

2139
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
of these

2140
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
amusement type place was at the

2141
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
creationist museum where

2142
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
they there's a so there's like

2143
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
an Ark ride where you can just go walk on a life

2144
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
size recreation of Noah's Ark

2145
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
that's what he actually wrote on I

2146
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
didn't do that but they did give

2147
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
us the real scoop there was a whole you know

2148
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
walk-through place where they did educate us on what

2149
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
really went down so just so everybody knows

2150
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
dinosaurs were on the Ark

2151
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
they were there they just died off

2152
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
unrelatedly afterward that's just

2153
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
this is so you know that's how it went down

2154
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I didn't worry about that because I want to know if the Legoland

2155
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
ride looked at any part about Jesus

2156
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
or Noah's Ark

2157
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Oh Nate, at Creation Museum

2158
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
did they have like a live reenactment

2159
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
of a monkey not turning into a human

2160
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Racism

2161
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
How dare you

2162
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
By the way, it's just

2163
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
that you cite a museum as a theme park because I would also do

2164
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
that for there there's a there's

2165
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
like a like there is an actual

2166
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
real there's an actual real like

2167
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
United States Navy like

2168
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
battleship turn museum because it's so fucking

2169
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
old called United States midway

2170
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and it's

2171
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
docked here permanently in San Diego it's like a museum now

2172
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
and you walk and you can walk out through all the

2173
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
corridors of the ship and

2174
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
there's like there is this one

2175
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
you can get like snacks and stuff too and there's just one like

2176
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
ride I would call it where it's like

2177
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
you get in this sort of like

2178
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
fucking cannon

2179
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
they like

2180
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
stuff you into like this like little like almost

2181
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
like bus sized like virtual

2182
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
reality like shuttle and it's just

2183
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
like let's pretend

2184
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
what would happen if you guys were on World War

2185
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
2 what would happen then let's make

2186
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
like this movie about like like

2187
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
it's like a virtual reality ride where

2188
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
the bus like turns and like

2189
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
twist

2190
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
like like for the twist and turns you make

2191
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
within like the video if you get what I'm saying

2192
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
like it doesn't actually go anywhere it just like

2193
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
assimilates what it would be like if you were

2194
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
making those turns and that was fucking cool

2195
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I got to see a lot of people die

2196
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I got to see a lot of Japanese people

2197
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
get kicked the fucking bucket and it was great

2198
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
hell yeah when I when I was a wee lad

2199
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
in the Boy Scouts me and my mom

2200
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
we spent

2201
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
a weekend on the like on a

2202
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
battleship just like staying there for like a weekend

2203
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
of fun and adventure and stuff

2204
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
and it was like one of the most fun weekends of my entire life

2205
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
but so that aside

2206
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I did want to say another thing that

2207
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
D'Vu mentioned to me was he mentioned

2208
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
a specific line and it was

2209
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
attractions while you're in line and that just got

2210
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
me thinking about wouldn't it be great

2211
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
if if prostitution

2212
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
was legal and they just had actual whores

2213
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
okay just just follow me here for a second

2214
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
okay like imagine you're in the world right

2215
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
you're at Disney World and you're in line

2216
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
prostitute and they got they got Disney

2217
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
princesses just just they're whores

2218
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
and they will fuck you and like you can fuck

2219
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Rapunzel who I want to remind everyone is

2220
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
canonically 18 so even though she looks like

2221
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
she's 14 she is in fact 18 so

2222
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I would just just wouldn't that be a great

2223
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
attraction huh when you're in line would that be great

2224
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
everybody right

2225
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
my final feeling on theme parks right

2226
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I mean by the way yes

2227
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I hope you're bouncing off my idea

2228
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
but go on

2229
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
well I mean it's part of it which is that I want

2230
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
theme parks to just be several orders

2231
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
of magnitude like more

2232
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
extravagant than they are again post

2233
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
yes exactly post scarcity

2234
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
economy is like because I

2235
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
because I know like Walt Disney had way more

2236
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
fucking like ambitions to food is

2237
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
weird utilitarianism here we go

2238
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
this isn't

2239
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
about getting there it's about how cool

2240
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
it would be when we are there and it's

2241
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
about cool shit not like resources

2242
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
not like fucking mining oil

2243
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
from Titan it's about having theme parks

2244
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
right uh-huh

2245
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
cool tycoons

2246
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
yeah but like yeah you know

2247
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
like Disney himself had

2248
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
so many more ambitions as to what he

2249
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
wanted like Disney world and apcot

2250
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
to be he wanted them to be like actual

2251
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
shit because people keep conceptualizing

2252
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
like like like cities

2253
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
that are just like these little tiny areas

2254
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
where you walk around and you could just do

2255
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
everything that humans want to do and it's really

2256
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
tight concise video gamey way

2257
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
that's what theme parks are ultimately trying to do is make

2258
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
video games IRL that's right you know that's right

2259
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
and we just they just need to you know what I really want

2260
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I want a theme park that is like

2261
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
a giant

2262
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
thrift store slash antique shop

2263
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
right because my favorite thing about those

2264
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
like tap those little stores

2265
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
is that they are often built out of like buildings

2266
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
that are not meant to be stores and they have all these

2267
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
weird rooms that like no one

2268
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
is in and I love that

2269
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
and I just want to have like a giant mansion

2270
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
that has rides in it

2271
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
like that one weird mansion that's like in California

2272
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
or whatever built by a crazy woman

2273
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
or whatever over the course of 30 years and you could

2274
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
explore this mansion and go around in all these weird

2275
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
rooms because we're talking about

2276
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
yeah if I'm ever in California for long enough in the

2277
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
right part of California because I know it's like the size

2278
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
of a fucking European nation

2279
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
California I would love to visit that place

2280
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
because like the thing about the

2281
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
dude hit me up and we'll go dude yeah

2282
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
because like

2283
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
theme parks are cool because you conceptualize

2284
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
yourself going on this adventure

2285
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
but when you go there it's like everyone's there it's like

2286
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
being in a fucking auditorium

2287
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
and I love I'd love to have

2288
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
an incredibly huge mansion

2289
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
with so many rooms that some of which

2290
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
some people don't even know about and you just

2291
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
walk around I would absolutely

2292
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I would pay $500 a year

2293
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
for a season pass to a mansion

2294
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
it's so huge that you could find your own hallways

2295
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
and like no one will ever be there and you could

2296
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
like jack off

2297
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
did I mention that I worked at

2298
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
in Newport Rhode Island doing like

2299
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
tours of like the great

2300
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Newport mansions that are like gigantic

2301
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
yeah they're like they're like actual palaces just

2302
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
based on capitalism not aristocracy

2303
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
it's pretty great pretty much

2304
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
pretty much incredible incredible

2305
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
so by the way they were

2306
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
simply divine and shout out by the way

2307
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
to the great American mall in

2308
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Minneapolis Minnesota that I visited

2309
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
some time earlier was that this year

2310
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I can't remember but

2311
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
that was just a big old it's a big old amusement

2312
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
park inside a mall in like the center

2313
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
of the mall yeah what did I say

2314
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
great American mall whatever it's one of those

2315
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
things I thought it was that

2316
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
by the way I should have mentioned this earlier

2317
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
by the way Nate you said you played the clarinet

2318
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
and you got to go to Disneyland for like being

2319
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
in a big world oh my god it was the

2320
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
bopper bowl episode of fucking Spongebob

2321
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
oh my god

2322
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
anyway the reason I say

2323
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
that Nate is because I also

2324
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
played the clarinet in band and I got to

2325
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
go to Disneyland for being in band

2326
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
so I live the exact

2327
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
same life that you did

2328
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
which is weird the munchie is a Spongebob

2329
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
is a Squidward so you wouldn't think they would

2330
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
play clarinet

2331
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I like to be thinking of myself as a Mr. Krabs

2332
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
racist and capitalist trippin

2333
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
just looking to

2334
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
how's Mr. Krabs a racist

2335
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
when he has a mixed race daughter

2336
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
uh

2337
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
well he's not racist against that race

2338
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
just a very particular one

2339
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
he fucked the whale as a meme

2340
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
it was a meme so

2341
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I think he all fucked the whale in college

2342
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
he's ironically raising

2343
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
his daughter yeah listen I'm not here

2344
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I'm not here to profile someone but can't you just

2345
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
imagine Mr. Krabs in a

2346
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
MAGA hat can't you just imagine him

2347
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
can't you just see him

2348
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
it would be a part of the show

2349
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
that's true we got a question on twitter

2350
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
from

2351
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
that's your cue Nate

2352
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
oh that's a cue I thought you were actually reading it

2353
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
okay alright here we go everybody

2354
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
question what's the one I was going to read before

2355
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
where did that go oh here we go

2356
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
okay this is from at lord light skin

2357
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
lord light skin everybody

2358
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
that's a good kind of skin to have

2359
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
that's what they say

2360
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
so tbcrasnators how would

2361
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
you want the world to end

2362
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
how would you want the world to end

2363
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
there's a lot of possibilities that are

2364
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
quite alluring I'd like

2365
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I'd like water to come up

2366
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
and then everyone to be in boats and then everyone to

2367
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
become pirates hell yeah

2368
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
so that's kind of

2369
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
like a positive like the world just changes

2370
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
kind of world ending because I was thinking like the world

2371
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
literally explodes yeah yeah

2372
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
meteor but I like yours better I like that

2373
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
well yeah

2374
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
people still live whatever it is I want

2375
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
it to be trumps fault because that'd be like the funniest

2376
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
scenario possible dude that would be so funny

2377
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
would the liberals be

2378
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
super smug about that though and they'd be

2379
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
yeah no they'd be funny

2380
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
but they'd be smug and I hate smug liberals

2381
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
they like the most annoying people in the world well yeah

2382
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
but I have a funny hat so I win

2383
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
fuck yeah dude

2384
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I think I gotta go with meteor to the planet

2385
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
maybe I'm just thinking too much of Final Fantasy 7

2386
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
but like I've always I've just got such a

2387
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
it would look so cool if I could see it

2388
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
if I could see that happening oh that's just for that

2389
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
reason alone you know just the whole

2390
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
maybe I'm thinking too much of Final Fantasy 7

2391
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
is the quote of your life

2392
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
is it not

2393
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
you're right dude you are damn right

2394
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I would like to think it too much of Homestuck

2395
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
when you said that yep oh jeez

2396
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
that there wasn't even a dramatic

2397
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
planet explosion in fucking Homestuck

2398
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
we're like yeah but a big rocks are falling

2399
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
yeah I remember

2400
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
meteors falling but the planet never blew up

2401
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
it was never like that

2402
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
it was on a thread of being blown up for a while

2403
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
that's true I think I think it did canonically

2404
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
like get blown up we just didn't see it

2405
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
oh wait I thought I realized the way

2406
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I want the world to end is for a

2407
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
hiveswap to come out and be good

2408
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
because it'll never happen and it's shit

2409
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
it's bad I actually

2410
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
no idea I just like

2411
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I mean really the best way for the world to end like technically would be

2412
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
we're already a galactic civilization

2413
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
a lot of utilitarianism whatever

2414
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and we're just sort of having a kumbaya over it

2415
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
as it descends into the sun in its final days

2416
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
like yep it was fun but it's

2417
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
dead now if we don't learn anything

2418
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
new about like physics or any of that

2419
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
shit which we probably will learn at least some things

2420
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
but if we don't like yeah like there's no

2421
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
way of avoiding like the heat death of the universe

2422
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
so we're all gonna

2423
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
it's gonna happen one day you know if we don't if we don't get our

2424
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
shit together and I don't travel

2425
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
you can fuck a lot of bitches in there

2426
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
the amount of time it will take for the heat

2427
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
death of the universe

2428
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
the patron lounge

2429
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
patreon.com

2430
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
something what is it

2431
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
the procrastinators everybody

2432
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
if you want to spend a buck to get into this smug little

2433
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
shitty chat room and talk to all these fucking

2434
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
bitches come on in you can ask us

2435
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
a question

2436
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
mccoolman wants to know if you had

2437
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
to body swap with any PCP member

2438
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
for the rest of your life

2439
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
who would it be

2440
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
and I should mention before

2441
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
anyone says anything

2442
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
there's a user called kalope

2443
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
or whatever and he says I would swap with munchy

2444
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
because he seems at least depressed

2445
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
well let me tell you

2446
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
it's all an illusion

2447
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I think the only answer for me would be mage

2448
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
just because it's like the mystery answer

2449
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
because I don't know what she looks like

2450
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
so I'm just gonna like cross my fingers and roll the die

2451
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
that's the mystery box yeah that's a fair bet

2452
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
that's not a bad choice

2453
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Tom I guess

2454
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I mean I don't like yourself

2455
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
just because he's like the tallest

2456
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
and I could fill out my frame and become

2457
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
a non

2458
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
a Lanclet God that's what I would do

2459
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
a Lanclet God

2460
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
yeah that's my answer

2461
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I'd go with myself and

2462
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
that's it

2463
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
boo

2464
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I'd go with his self as well

2465
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
excellent

2466
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
munchy alright

2467
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
nobody wants to be Ben

2468
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
you know what

2469
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
my second answer was gonna be Ben

2470
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
because Ben is genetically quite close to me

2471
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
so that's not so bad

2472
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
why even change then

2473
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
but you have to

2474
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
that's the question

2475
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
if I had to

2476
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I would probably be digi

2477
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
if I had to

2478
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I'd probably go into the body

2479
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
of hippo

2480
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
he is a powerful beast

2481
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
if we're opening up to stuff like that

2482
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
then I want to go into the body of the undertailer

2483
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
the most powerful man

2484
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I thought you were already one of the undertailers

2485
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
none of you want to be inside me

2486
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I definitely would pick hippo

2487
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
because I kind of dig the idea

2488
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
of being like small and skinny

2489
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
like hippo doesn't like it so

2490
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
if he switches with me I don't think he would mind

2491
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
my body as much as his own for some reason

2492
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
you seem to not like his body

2493
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
so there you go

2494
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
if I could choose myself I probably would

2495
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I can't choose yourself

2496
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
yeah that's the whole thing

2497
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
the whole body swap question

2498
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I don't believe that a consciousness exists

2499
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
outside of mind

2500
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
so if you transfer your quote-unquote consciousness

2501
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
into someone else's body

2502
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
then frankly you're just them now

2503
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
it's literally a brain transplant

2504
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
that works

2505
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I think I'd go with Ben

2506
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I think I'd go with Ben

2507
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
disgusting

2508
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
he's already me

2509
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I can know what it's like to rub my clit

2510
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
boys

2511
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
yeah that's fair

2512
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
that's not a bad choice

2513
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I want that mage

2514
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
clit baby

2515
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I'm sorry mage

2516
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
please don't listen to this episode

2517
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
okay

2518
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
what do we got here

2519
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
at Alan Oni

2520
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
says a thing

2521
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
imagine that for whatever reason

2522
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
you have to go and pick up a girl

2523
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
language isn't an issue

2524
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
and anyone can be your wingman

2525
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
imagine yourself boys

2526
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
where you have to talk to a girl

2527
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
what do you do

2528
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I would blow my fucking brains out

2529
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
that's the answer

2530
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
anyone differ from that

2531
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
would we all commit suicide

2532
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I would say

2533
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
hey baby what's shaking

2534
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
is it my penis

2535
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
yes it is

2536
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
you have to pick up a girl

2537
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
is it a date

2538
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
is he picking her up from the airport

2539
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
he's just lifting her up off the ground

2540
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
let's assume he means a seduce

2541
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
romantically express her interest

2542
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
also my wingman

2543
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
will be like a bird

2544
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
and that will be the pun

2545
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and she'll be like oh what a funny pun

2546
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
and that'll clinch it

2547
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
it'll be a combination of the funny pun

2548
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
and you asking her to

2549
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
see your shaking penis

2550
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
that will lose you

2551
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
you hit it with a one two punch

2552
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
first you hit it with a shaking dick

2553
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
then you hit it with a bird pun

2554
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
that's just the way you do it

2555
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
user the jam from the patreon lounge

2556
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
do you piss like an animal

2557
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
by unbuttoning your pants and pulling your penis over your waistband

2558
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
or do you use the zipper

2559
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and flap in the underwear like god tinge you to pee

2560
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I am unbuttoning your pants

2561
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
and pulling your penis over the waistband 100%

2562
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I never use the fucking flap

2563
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
in the other way it's fucking disgusting

2564
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and legitimately there's no reason to do it

2565
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
it takes too long and it's too much of a fucking hassle

2566
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
and it's just way easier to just whip it out

2567
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
and fucking spray

2568
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I agree with that

2569
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
the pressure from my waistband

2570
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
and my pants pushing up

2571
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
stops like the flow of pee

2572
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
so I have to do it the other way

2573
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
well I lifted up over the waistband

2574
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
the waistband is just like on

2575
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
my balls

2576
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I know what you're talking about but there's always a little bit

2577
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I actually mix it up

2578
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I basically undo my pants

2579
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
but then I use the flap in the underwear

2580
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
because that's the easiest way to do it

2581
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I'm in the middle

2582
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
but you have to unbutton it

2583
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
you have to reach in and find out where it is

2584
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
there's no button in my underwear

2585
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
there is a button on some of mine

2586
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
actually the ones I'm wearing right now

2587
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
underwear has a button on it

2588
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
it does

2589
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I don't do it

2590
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I didn't even get into it until like two years ago

2591
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
because I'd always seen it

2592
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
going through the underwear

2593
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
because I always knew that's what it was for

2594
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
but I never thought to try it until like a while ago

2595
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
and I was like okay

2596
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
but the thing is

2597
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
the last couple of drips of pee would go backwards

2598
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I don't know how common that is

2599
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
that kind of gets on the pants if you're wearing the pants

2600
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
so I'm just like eh

2601
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
but I still do it if I

2602
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
am listening to something in my ear buds on my phone

2603
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
and I don't want to stop while I pee

2604
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
and if it's in my pocket

2605
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
it's going to have to go all the way

2606
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I don't want to mess with it

2607
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I don't want to stop

2608
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I just stick it out

2609
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
if I'm listening to something on my phone

2610
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
okay actually you guys

2611
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
this was a test and you all failed

2612
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
because what you all described was that

2613
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
you are all doing the virgin pee

2614
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
that's what you're doing

2615
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
whereas I walk into the bathroom

2616
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I take my pants and underwear completely off

2617
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I stand at the urinal

2618
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I make eye contact with both people

2619
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
surrounding me at the same time

2620
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
and I piss a fucking ocean into the urinal

2621
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
guys that's a lesson fun

2622
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
but here I'm about to introduce you to the green piled

2623
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
pee

2624
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
this is for green pills only when you've aligned all your chopper

2625
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
the Jill sign pee

2626
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
this is the second dip

2627
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
double dipping or whatever it was called

2628
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
here's what you do

2629
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
you walk into the bathroom and you go inside of the stall

2630
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
and then you sit down to pee

2631
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
that's the secret jujitsu that fucking

2632
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Donald Trump doesn't want you to see

2633
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
he doesn't want you to know

2634
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
that you're able to do that

2635
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
if you go in the stall at least stand

2636
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
and piss into the toilet

2637
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
why do you have to sit on it

2638
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
those are both embarrassing

2639
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
the ability to pee standing up

2640
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
you can pee standing up in a stall

2641
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
but you just look like a bitch

2642
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
why are you taking up a whole stall

2643
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
if you don't have to know

2644
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
your urinals are full of shit

2645
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
if the urinals are full

2646
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
it's fine that's no problem at all

2647
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
but if you choose to pee into a toilet

2648
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
first of all you're wasting more water

2649
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
that's not grim tell

2650
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I will look down upon you as a man

2651
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
you are not a man

2652
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
what if you're a shy peer

2653
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
and you just can't go in a urinal

2654
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
well that's the thing this is a manliness test

2655
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I want to watch you pee

2656
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I want to see you pee and study you as a man

2657
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
and know if you're worthy of my respect

2658
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
but if you go into a stall you're a coward

2659
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
and I don't respect you

2660
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
in recent years I haven't gone on the urinal

2661
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
but I still perceive myself as a person

2662
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
who goes into the stall

2663
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
most of the time

2664
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I don't usually pee alone

2665
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I usually pee with poop as well

2666
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
understandable

2667
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
understandable

2668
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
what if it's like just a trough

2669
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
and you don't want to pee in a trough like a pig

2670
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
those aren't real

2671
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
they are real

2672
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I was watching the screen junkies

2673
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
and they went to the Emmys the other day

2674
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
like the pre-Emmys not like the big important one

2675
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
and the fucking bathroom at the Emmys after party

2676
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
is a trough

2677
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
you know you would expect something more extravagant

2678
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
for this crazy big party

2679
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I go in the stall

2680
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
but it's not because I don't want people to

2681
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
see my pee-iness

2682
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
it's just because

2683
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I mean it's more privacy

2684
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I don't know

2685
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I have too many

2686
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
piss triplets afterwards

2687
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
and there's no toilet paper at the urinal

2688
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
that's really my reason

2689
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
that's really my reason

2690
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
the toilet paper isn't a thing

2691
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
can't fault you for that

2692
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
okay

2693
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
what's the next question here

2694
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
whenever I'm at a urinal

2695
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
and I have to shake my dick to get all the driplets out

2696
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I'm just afraid it won't seem like I'm jerking off

2697
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
into a urinal

2698
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I want them to think I'm jacking off into the urinal

2699
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
you ever hear the phrase

2700
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
that when a man walks into a room he takes his whole life

2701
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
with him

2702
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
that's what I think about every time I walk into the bathroom

2703
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
everyone witness my science

2704
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
witness my performance at the urinal

2705
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I'm a fucking man

2706
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I have trained myself

2707
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I've studied actual literature

2708
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
about how to pee properly at a urinal

2709
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I know the score

2710
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
and everyone who is not up to my level

2711
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I consider beneath me and a worthless human

2712
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
see that makes you seem more self-conscious than the people

2713
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
who just go in the store

2714
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
cause you actually researched it to make sure you're doing it right

2715
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I don't give a shit

2716
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I just do whatever I want

2717
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
yeah do whatever you want

2718
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
hi you coward

2719
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
charlotarianism

2720
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
look donky go

2721
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
okay here we go next question everybody

2722
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
at hazelcracket on twitter asks

2723
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
what would you consider a good gift

2724
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
what are your parameters for a good gift

2725
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
is that bullshit about

2726
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
wanting someone to like the heartfelt

2727
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
or like oh you made me a picture that all you could have made

2728
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
or blah blah blah

2729
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
if you're gonna give not money then I want to be like

2730
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I want to be like something that you like made

2731
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
that's what I want

2732
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
don't buy me like a thing

2733
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
or give me a thing that you made

2734
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
or give me money

2735
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
or give me something that you could buy

2736
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
but it's like a specific thing that you could buy

2737
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
the question is what would you consider a good gift

2738
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
but feel free to talk about bad gifts either

2739
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I mean for me it would be

2740
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
me and sheep over are watching through

2741
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
oh go ahead

2742
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
something that would be very very useful

2743
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
for a very long time

2744
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
but would never be able to like get around

2745
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
to buying like justifying the expense of

2746
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
like my parents for Christmas

2747
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
several Christmases ago got me like

2748
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
a waterproof bluetooth speaker

2749
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
so that you can like listen to like music

2750
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
or podcast while taking a shower

2751
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
and it is fucking awesome

2752
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
and even if it ever breaks down I'll buy a new one

2753
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
in a heartbeat but when I had the idea that

2754
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I have one I was like I don't know if I'm gonna use

2755
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
that enough I just don't know

2756
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I don't want to drop the money so someone

2757
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
breaking that damn like

2758
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
violating that inertia for me was like great

2759
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
the great thing about the gift thing

2760
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
is that it's a certain amount of money

2761
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
that like will be spent and you just get

2762
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
to decide on what you have to spend it on

2763
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
so it really gives you license to like

2764
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I mean if you can get like I do this with my parents all the time

2765
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
like they ask what I want like for my birthday

2766
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
whatever and then they'll buy like I mean a couple years ago

2767
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
for Christmas they got me like the camera that I use

2768
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
for like every video now and like

2769
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
that was like I paid for like half of it but like

2770
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
we worked out a deal just because like they want to get me something

2771
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I actually care about and like

2772
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
so like that really emboldens you or kind of

2773
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
forces you to purchase things that you are maybe on the fence about

2774
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
that's honestly how I think about you know what

2775
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
and also I never give gifts to anyone I don't have to

2776
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I have a real answer

2777
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
the best gifts are gifts that are

2778
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
not given on birthdays or holidays

2779
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
because I realize I always get excited

2780
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
surprise gifts I always get excited

2781
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
not even like a surprise just something

2782
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
like you know we're at a store like

2783
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
oh that thing looks cool I'll buy it for you

2784
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
really oh my gosh acquaintance of mine

2785
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
or person who I know and love

2786
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
it's like I don't know they didn't always feels

2787
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
correct that how that's how giving

2788
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
feels like it should feel to me

2789
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
whereas the obligatory holidays

2790
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
they never feel right to me

2791
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
yeah I was going to say

2792
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
something along those lines where

2793
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
like a birthday or something

2794
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
it feels like I'd be expected but when you get

2795
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
something randomly from somebody it means

2796
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
a lot more to me and I was saying

2797
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
that me and sheep over started watching season one

2798
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
of true detective because she hadn't seen it

2799
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
and I pointed out

2800
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I pointed out that

2801
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
the big hug mug that

2802
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Matthew McConaughey is using as an ashtray

2803
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
was like a meme on 4chan

2804
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
for a while and then like

2805
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
three days later one shows up in the mail

2806
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
and she's like oh yeah I bought one for you and I was like

2807
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
oh well fucking shit and now I'm drinking out

2808
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
of a big hug mug right now

2809
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I'd rather get it randomly than on my birthday

2810
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
because then it's like well I guess you had to get me something

2811
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
that's true I just never

2812
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
expect kindness from anyone so

2813
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
you know the way I

2814
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
feel about stuff like that is that I would like

2815
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
to be a person who gets gifts

2816
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
randomly for people and

2817
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
and doesn't have to do birthdays but that's not

2818
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
how it works because they always expect it

2819
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
so I feel like

2820
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
to be a person who's that generous

2821
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
you just need to give gifts

2822
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
way more and I'm not like that

2823
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I'm not evil I don't

2824
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I never buy gifts for anyone that I can avoid doing it for

2825
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
you know why would I I don't get it

2826
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
it's not my thing it's still not about that life

2827
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
and so I can't expect it to be done to me

2828
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
oh yeah I never want gifts no one ever

2829
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
get me a gift it's not it's not good but see

2830
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
like the people who do like the with the

2831
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
P.O. Box I'm doing like they're getting something in response

2832
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
they're getting like my the their

2833
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
presence in the video so like that's an equivalent

2834
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
exchange going on I think so

2835
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
yeah there you go

2836
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
alright any more questions

2837
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
from there or shall we take another one from here

2838
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
no there's no more no okay

2839
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
there's none on Twitter or on

2840
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Patreon we're all done

2841
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I'll at least suck

2842
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
okay here we go here's one last question

2843
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
J.H. The Hurricane

2844
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
asks aliens

2845
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
find us and lay siege to our planet

2846
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
they'll destroy us unless we bring them

2847
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
the best YouTube video

2848
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
ever what's that video

2849
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
the Japanese Juggalo Episode 1

2850
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
the aliens will be like sitting like like

2851
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
contouring super hard and they'll be like show me

2852
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
your greatest piece of work

2853
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
and then I'll like scurry off and I'll come back

2854
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
and then they'll be like like put on their headphones

2855
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
and they'll be anticipating there's complete silence

2856
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
and then and then quaking

2857
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
from inside of their fucking headphones

2858
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I'm all fed

2859
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
it is me

2860
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
D and their ears

2861
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
fucking burst and their minds

2862
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
blows and then they're all dead

2863
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
instantaneously

2864
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
you know what I do in this situation I would just lean over

2865
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I'd cock my eyebrow knowingly and just say

2866
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
have you ever heard of a little guy called

2867
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
leafy that's where I would go

2868
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
yeah that's this one

2869
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
he is here

2870
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I would say

2871
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
digi brony off to dark

2872
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
there it is

2873
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
there it is

2874
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I tweeted that the other day

2875
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
it was like a scary ghost

2876
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
that wasn't a boo it was just a ghost sound

2877
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
it's the ghost of digi

2878
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
in the past when he actually made

2879
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
brony content and it was good

2880
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
unlike his new bullshit

2881
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
garb I don't know what he's done to the editing

2882
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
but like all the anime videos

2883
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
editing that shit it's awful

2884
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I don't know what he's done to the videos

2885
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
like now instead of like having

2886
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
point characters on screen it's all just like humans

2887
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
now and they're all like

2888
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
they don't look too short

2889
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
they didn't even leave because I said that joke did he

2890
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I have no idea who knows

2891
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
man we'll fight out one day

2892
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I think there's no way

2893
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I mean it's way funnier if it was

2894
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
just coincidentally he

2895
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
dropped out

2896
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
just so you know I've never actually

2897
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
watched the digi videos so

2898
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
my criticism doesn't stand because I don't know

2899
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
if the editing is shit

2900
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
no no no don't backpedal we know

2901
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
we know your secret

2902
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
