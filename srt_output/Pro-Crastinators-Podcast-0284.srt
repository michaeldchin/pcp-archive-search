1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's get fucked. Is that what it says? Wait, is that the actual lyric? Or did I just trick myself?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't know, but what is it? Is it Beyblade?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Something in the backseat? Fuckin' in the front seat.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sittin' in the backseat? Oh wait, Sittin' in the backseat? Sittin' in the front seat? Party and party and yeah, fun, fun, fun, looking forward to the weekend.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's a major pop hit of our generation.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey, ho, let's go, it's, hey you, no, not hey you Pikachu, it's the Pikachu movie, short film. Hey, ho, let's go. There's a bit in the Pikachu movie.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, I didn't fucking see that shit.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah you did, it's the one, the 2000, the fucking Pokemon 2000, or maybe you didn't.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Er, I don't know if I watched Pokemon 2000. Is that the one with Lugia? I don't know if I watched it.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Alright, I'm using all my words wrong. The one with Mewtwo in it, the first movie, has a fucking Pikachu short film that starts earlier.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, it's Blitzkrieg, okay, it's a song by the Ramones, it's Blitzkrieg Bop, okay, I'm stupid, I never knew that.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I could swear there's a bit in the soundtrack, it goes, hey ho, let's go, and then it cuts through the next scene.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Maybe there is, but it's either an homage to the Ramones, or they just put a classic rock song in the movie.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, whatever, welcome to the Procrastinatus podcast where we don't know what we're doing.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We don't know about classic music institutions of our culture, and we gotta Google and go, what's that song where the guy says like,

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that it's like, there's eight days in a week, what's that song called?

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have no idea.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Welcome to the Procrastinatus podcast. New bonus episode, I said the new bonus episode is going to be out for the last episode,

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
but it is out this week, I put it out this week. It's very funny, it's the fun facts challenge where we find the funnest fact.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We compete to see who finds the funnest fact, and boy, is there fun and facts along the way.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There sure are, they're so fun and so factual that I've forgotten all of them.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I need to go and subscribe to the Procrastinatus Patreon so I can find out.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I remember many of them, yes, and then as we say in that episode, leave your own fun facts,

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
not on that bonus episode where no one will see them.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Leave them here in the main comments so that other viewers will be confused and feel like they are missing something.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They'll be confused to see comments of random fun facts, even though we're saying explicitly do that.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They'll know exactly what the context is.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, because those will be the people who have been checking back for a year and a half now to just see,

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
is Nate or Trixie or Jesse back on the podcast yet?

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh no, they're not, okay, but I don't actually watch the podcast, so I don't know that there's literally no reason to be doing that,

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and I'm wasting my time, but I'll be back again next week, again.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Those will be the people who will be stymied.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That'll be the entirety of our viewer base.

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Just a bunch of people who click on the thing and say, is there, oh, we get the views anyway.

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Suckers.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Suckers, thanks for the click.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thanks for the click, suckers.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wait, wait, no, we need the watch time.

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, please don't go, oh.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We should start doing a thing where we promised that we'll reveal Nate at the end of the show,

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and we keep promising that, and then we don't do it.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The return of Nate will be the, it will basically be like the end of the world, it will be the apocalypse,

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it will be like the return of Christ in the book of Revelations.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You think you want it, but it heralds the end.

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
By the way, I'm looking in, okay, I wasn't sure how to pronounce it, but apparently the word is pronounced stymied.

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Although, oh wait, British pronunciation is the same.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay, I've never seen this before.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Did they just add this thing to Google Translate?

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm gonna put this in general.

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now, when I look up the pronunciation of the word, now there's this mouth,

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and when I play the word, like the mouth moves to show, I've never seen this before.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Google something pronunciation, and you get this little, you can see the mouth move.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's so weird.

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I guess it's cool.

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not getting it.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're not?

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, I'm getting a video about how to do it from YouTube.

60
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Maybe you need to go to Google proper.

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Maybe.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is in my search results.

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is right above people also ask.

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Maybe if I type in exactly stymied.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Stymied pronunciation.

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It does come up.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Maybe it's only words that people often ask how to pronounce.

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, it's probably certain words.

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I mean, somebody had to make this little animation for it.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So, yeah.

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Fascinating.

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Practice and get feedback.

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They want me to record my voice.

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What?

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let me click on it.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Use my microphone.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ah, no block.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, I don't want that.

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They'll give them an inch.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They'll take my splinch.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We'll take a mile.

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We'll take a mile.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, okay, a thing I got to talk about.

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Clarissa, chapter three.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The finish of what I had already drawn for the Tezuka Award show,

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
the last bunch of pages,

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
will be out by the time you're listening to this viewer, listener,

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
on Gibbentake.site.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Clarissa Gunsmoke.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The Bandit King.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's cool.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's epic.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Have you been reading it, Ben?

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I have not yet.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I know.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Listen.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's just how I am with everything.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I just don't watch things and I don't read things.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I will, I will, I will.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You said this is the last update.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is like the last of it you got to upload.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, for the time being.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And then I might...

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, then I'll have no excuse.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I might stream more drawing of future pages soon,

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
if I have the time.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is just sort of like in between

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
waiting for Lord of Ghost stuff to get ready,

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
which is closer.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I have been, I have been working on the Lord of Ghost.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I got, I got, I think I only got one page done today,

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but it was another one that I spent a long time on

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
because it was a big like background,

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
two big background landscape shots.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Dang.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I hate, I hate doing them.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I hate doing background landscapes.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're really good at them though.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You obviously have like a very clear vision in your head of like,

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
okay, well it has to look good.

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, yeah.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It has to look like this and then you'd spend hours on it.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I did spend, yeah, the first desert,

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the first desert shot I spent hours and hours on

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and then I spent even longer on like the,

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
the aerial shot of Cowtown over the hill.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I just, yeah, I had a very particular vision

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and I just was like, I probably could have done it faster.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I probably could have gotten away with less lines.

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I sometimes fall into the trap of zooming the image in too far

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and putting any detail that is probably not strictly necessary.

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think I fell into that a little bit on this one,

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but the end result is good.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I mean, my backgrounds are, when it comes to like,

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Kazin and Clarissa, there's a shot where you see the town from a distance.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm like, okay, well, it's in the distance.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So I'll just give the illusion of rectangles

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and then people will assume there's a town there.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I mean, that's what you should do.

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's what you should do.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Like, yeah, like the further away something is, the less detail.

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It really doesn't look like much if you zoom in

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and being like, oh God, there's no drawing here.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah, but that's okay.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Like as long as it suggests what it's meant to suggest, you know.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, my, I had originally, yeah, I asked you how you felt about me

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
putting like another eye tower in Cowtown

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
because, you know, there's one in New Los Angeles City

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and this war, of course, and there's one in New Big and by the sea.

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And you said, no, that's like a lower thing.

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There shouldn't be one in Cowtown.

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Originally, yeah, this, I don't know if you are looking at the image,

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but the church, the big church on the horizon,

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I mean, I guess I'll post it.

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The big, the big, don't show the audience.

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is secret.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is secret content.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Secret.

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All these are.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The big church on the horizon was like huge.

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It was like way bigger and it had an eye in the bell tower

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
instead of the bell.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But I was like, okay, no, I'll just make it a normal church.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So I made it like, I mean, it's still really big,

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but it's just, it was regular big.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And it should be given a bell tower.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The, the, the, the, the perspective on the town,

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
it's a little weird.

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I sketched it like this and I followed my sketch pretty closely.

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I mean, it was a rough sketch, but like the curve of the ground

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
on like the left side, which is kind of flat and the right side,

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
which is just kind of like tilting off the, the, the side.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's pretty weird when you think about it,

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
but I was just like, eh, whatever.

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's all right.

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's got, yeah, it looks, looks all right.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It works.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's got depth.

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's got a really round hill.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Like I made the ground like a big round sort of bump.

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And then I don't know if you notice, I don't know if you notice,

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but if you zoom in, if you zoom in past the building

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
with the big tall cowboy hat veneer, just to the right of it,

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you can see on the seashore, there's the cactus on the cow town sign

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
where Lord of Ghosts crawls out of the sea.

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Ah, that's cool.

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes.

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I was, I was wondering if you would like study what I had drawn.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I did.

195
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Like, I, cause I, cause I drew this, I drew this sign on the, on the road.

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And then I went back and I looked at the thing and I was like, oh shit,

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that's not what the cow town sign looks like.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But then I thought, wait a minute, but he, but, but Lord of Ghosts doesn't come by road.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Lord of Ghosts comes by sea.

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So he comes in from like the other side.

201
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So then I was like, okay, so I got to put, I got to put a little,

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
a bit of sea in the background, you know, because, because he crawls out of the sea

203
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
to get here.

204
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So sea in the background.

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And there was a little gaff.

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was like, okay, if I put that sign there, it's like, that's like, yeah,

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
the other side.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And also, yeah, the building that he comes in next to, yeah, on the right of that,

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
you can see there's the saloon that you drew.

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And to the left of it is a little piece of the, of the blacksmith.

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So, you know, continuity, continuity.

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Epic.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I didn't, I didn't ask you to do any of that, but you did it.

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No, that's just, you went above and beyond.

215
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's called being a professional gift.

216
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You should try it sometime.

217
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, I love doing that with my own stuff.

218
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But I'm like, oh wait, I drew this here.

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And then like, I have to 3D, like 3D print in my brain, a map of the area.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Or 2D printed with paper.

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I mean, what's the point?

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What's the point of a comic if you're not like, you know, with what you're drawing

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
is not like consistent with the story that's been told thus far, right?

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah.

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah.

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The point is to make a narrative, a world.

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So, yes, I just thought that would be fun.

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I thought that would be cool.

230
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And for all you people at home who can't see anything that we're talking about,

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
you have to have already pledged to the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.

232
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And maybe there'll be plenty of comics left for you to purchase afterwards.

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Perhaps.

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Perhaps.

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't know yet.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I guess I should open up the floor for people who want to buy a comic

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
before I send off for the final print.

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I will do that.

239
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Probably.

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Probably.

241
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah.

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Because I'm like making, oh God, how many?

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
There was a number.

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I know the number somewhere.

245
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Speaking of printing, yeah, I have to go.

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I've ordered the final, the next printing of the Roger Radcon.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I ordered 100 new copies just because 100 was not much more expensive than 50.

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I feel very stupid that I didn't think about that we should just print it all in one go.

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It ends up being a little more expensive because we only printed the first amount

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and then I had to print again.

251
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But it's not actually that bad in the grand scheme of things.

252
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's just like, ugh.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Ugh.

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Like less efficient.

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Probably like two or three hundred dollars more expensive doing it in two batches.

256
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But oh well.

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah.

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So yeah.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But yeah, I will have plenty of copies left over though.

260
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So reminder for anyone who might be listening who wants a copy of Roger Radcon.

261
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm going to have extra copies.

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So contact me one way or another and I can have those.

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Honestly, I will probably have them for a while.

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't see myself selling out of them.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But if you thought I was going to run out, I will not.

266
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So I'll have those for people.

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Buy it.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Please buy Road to Radcon.

269
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I have Dwarven Gold Madness.

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Please give me money.

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Also, drawing the...

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't know what you looked at for references for drawing the buildings in Cowtown.

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I looked up...

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I googled pictures of Tombstone, Arizona and I drew buildings from that place.

275
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah.

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I looked up a few Google images of western towns.

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I didn't want it to be like a Hollywood set.

278
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I think I saw some real shit.

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Tombstone, Arizona is a real old western...

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's a real old western town, but it has sort of become a tourist trap.

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There's a main drag that is very much deliberately playing into the old west vibe and they put on shows and stuff.

282
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So it's somewhere in between like a theme park of itself and the real deal.

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's funny though because I don't know anything about the old west outside of Hollywood movies of westerns and stuff.

284
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've seen maybe one YouTube video walking around like an actual wild west preserved ghost town.

285
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And it's like, oh yeah, seems about right.

286
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But I don't know much about how these buildings and all of this stuff actually came about.

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I just know how it's depicted.

288
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
A lot of bear wooden boards.

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So many of them seem to have the thing on the front.

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:38,000
A lot of them have a sloping porch covering in the front and also a flat stand up portion over the front with a billboard space.

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Looking at almost every building on the main drag in Tombstone, Arizona has the pieces of wood built up over the front entrance way into what amounts to billboard space.

292
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I guess because it's all businesses.

293
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, the high street would be like that.

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You ride through it on your horse and you're like, where's things I need?

295
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Exactly.

296
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I just thought that was interesting.

297
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

298
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's like you watch the cowboy movies and they've got the high street where the saloon is.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They've got the motels or the hotels or whatever.

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Or the Holiday Inn.

301
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, they stay in the hotel or they go to the ranch and they get the cows.

302
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh wow, cool.

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But like regular people, where the hell do they live?

304
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What do they live in?

305
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
How they're building apartment buildings?

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Or is it just like individual houses and huts?

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I gotta assume that they all live in little ranch houses that probably are a little bit more dispersed around the main drag.

308
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I gotta assume that there's the main street and then around it there's a lessly densely developed area of a lot of like,

309
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
probably some farmland, probably a lot of the houses have a little bit of like ranching land or whatever.

310
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The idea of Manifest Destiny, go west and like government handing out free land to people who can claim it,

311
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
was to encourage people to just make claims and build cities and towns and stuff.

312
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So the western town archetype isn't really a town in like a normal European sense.

313
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's sort of like there's a bunch of farmers like laying claims all over the place and they need some place to like consolidate trade and business and like train and travel back to the east.

314
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, and they just set up little shops or places of business like hotels or whatever on heavily traveled areas and other people are just like,

315
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
well I guess this is kind of the place to be and they set up shop there too and that's how a town forms.

316
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I guess most of the people...

317
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well there's people living here, gotta build a church and then they do it and then...

318
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes.

319
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's how they do it.

320
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The people living there probably all live in the business that they run, right?

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Probably for the most part, yeah.

322
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, probably.

323
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And then maybe there's just accommodations nearby if...

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Because you never really see that.

325
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You see like, yeah, hotels.

326
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Mmm, mmm.

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I was trying to search that like a while ago, like what the hell do they live in?

328
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I couldn't really find much so I guess that must be it.

329
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's just not really one of those types of towns.

330
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Until it was...

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I mean, you know, over the hill there's like some range houses or whatever.

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I mean probably the town would just be like the main drag and like, you know, the businesses and then...

333
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I mean the surrounding area might technically be the town but like, you know, that's like just, you know, where people live.

334
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I assume, I don't know.

335
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I should read a book about this because I want to like...

336
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
When I think of like world building, when it comes to art and stuff, I'm like designing settlements and towns and castles and whatever.

337
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'd like it to be informed from reality more or so than just like icons of like, oh, a castle.

338
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's like a big brick and it doesn't really make sense when you think about it in a lot of like media, a lot of video games.

339
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They build it for a video game gameplay and not so much for like actual...

340
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Like why would they build it like this?

341
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Reasons.

342
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I like to figure out or at least learn about that sort of stuff.

343
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Speaking of reading a book, I've sort of been reading a book.

344
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The book is called Diplomacy by Henry Kissinger.

345
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And the reason why I'm reading it is because somebody left it in my last apartment, the temporary apartment that I moved into between my old apartment and my current apartment.

346
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
In that temporary place, someone had just left this book and so I just read it in like one page excerpts when I'm taking a shit.

347
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So I've read like maybe a dozen pages of this book that are not in any kind of order, just totally randomly.

348
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Thanks Kissinger.

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll just open it up to a page.

350
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I guess I kind of am finding it entertaining. I'll open it up to a page and it'll be like, what was the one I just read?

351
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It was about like, you know, after the Munich conference, you know.

352
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Hitler had accomplished his goals and yet he, like those around him, said he was morose because war had been averted.

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And war was like, you know, his end goal and because it was involved, all his public speeches, you know, described, you know, a war hawkish attitude for the future of Germany.

354
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He had used up all the goodwill from, you know, Britain, you know, Churchill had agreed to a peace but had, you know, also begun a rearmament program at the same time.

355
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
All the goodwill that he had garnered from the guilt of Versailles had worn out by this point, which is, you know, I don't know.

356
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I guess it's kind of interesting. It would probably be more interesting if I started at the beginning and read through.

357
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's a very big book though. It's very thick. I don't know if I want to commit to actually giving it a full read.

358
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But I mean, I guess I could. I got a book here. I might as well read it. I don't know.

359
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Might as well increase my brain. What if there's a fun fact hidden inside?

360
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Shit. There's even one fun fact. It would be a crime to leave it undiscovered now, wouldn't it?

361
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's like you troll the library, read every book, trying to find the funnest fact so that you can impress people at parties.

362
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You can say, hey, did you know?

363
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,000
My entire life is just one big fun fact challenge when you really think about it.

364
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Why else does anyone do anything for the discovery of fun facts?

365
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I found, I saw a woman, crazy, I know, but I saw a woman reading a library book on the bench the other day and I was like, wow, what a concept.

366
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I felt bad. I felt guilty that I don't read books much. I felt like...

367
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Flashback to Vapors Chapter 2.

368
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah. I felt like maybe I should be going to the library and reading books.

369
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You know, I should be doing that as well. There's a library not too far from here.

370
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
There is a library. I didn't even know there was a library because I hadn't looked for it, but yeah, there is a library.

371
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's maybe like a 15 minute walk from my, maybe a 10 to 15 minute walk from my house.

372
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I had to go there the other day because of my taxes. I had filed for a tax extension, but my extension period was up.

373
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So I had to file it on October 15th and I did.

374
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And I went and I looked around for places where I could print it.

375
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I had to fucking print some physical shit and send it in the mail. I thought I could file it electronically, but they wouldn't let me.

376
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So I had to go find a printer and send the shit in the mail.

377
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And I went to CVS and Walgreens asking if I could print something there, but they all were like, no, we only print on photo paper.

378
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We can't just print documents for you. It was like shit.

379
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So I went to a cute girl at the Walgreens counter who was totally into me, by the way.

380
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
There's no doubt in my mind.

381
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
This gave me very, gave me directions to the local public life.

382
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Listen, she was dedicated. She pulled out her phone. She was like, here, I can look it up on my phone for you.

383
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And then we did. And then we talked about what we saw on the screen.

384
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So that's the connection.

385
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm looking at my phone. What are you looking at? I'm looking at my phone.

386
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
No, we were both looking at her phone.

387
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Oh my God.

388
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We were using this. Yeah.

389
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Dude, that's second base. That's third base, basically.

390
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That's like, that's an indirect kiss right there.

391
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So that's indirect eye contact.

392
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Both of our eyes are looking at the same thing.

393
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So right, she told me about this public library and I went there and did you know that at the public library,

394
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
they let you use the printers for free? You don't even have to pay for it.

395
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Wow.

396
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I thought they would charge me like 10 cents a page or something.

397
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And I would have to pay like a dollar.

398
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But no, they were just like, no, I use it.

399
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
No, I pulled on my wallet and I'm like, should I?

400
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And she's like, no, it's all free.

401
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I was like, oh my God, but that's communism.

402
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And I pulled out my gun.

403
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And I pulled out my phone and I said, hello, victims of communism Memorial Center, please.

404
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I have someone to report.

405
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And then the cops showed up and they blew it away.

406
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
They burned it down.

407
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And America was safe for another day.

408
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So that was pretty neat.

409
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And then I had to rush to the post office because I realized like, actually,

410
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I made small talk with a librarian and I was like, oh yeah, kind of a life saver.

411
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
My taxes are due today.

412
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And she's like, oh, no, are you going to mail it?

413
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Do you need to send it to the post office?

414
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Do you have an envelope?

415
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And I'm like, no, I'm envelopes at home.

416
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I got to go home and write the address.

417
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And she's like, oh, you know, you might want to make sure you got it sent.

418
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
No, she asked me how I was going to send it.

419
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And I said, I'm going to pop it in a mailbox.

420
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And she was like, oh, you might want to send it from the post office because they'll,

421
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
they might want to see that it was postmarked today.

422
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You know, and she dropped it in the mailbox.

423
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
They won't postmark till tomorrow.

424
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I'm like, shit.

425
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I said it out loud to this nice lady.

426
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I said, shit, you're right.

427
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So then I had to fucking sprint to the nearest post office, which I did.

428
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And it all worked out fine.

429
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I got there like half an hour before they closed.

430
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It was, it was very exciting.

431
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But I did it.

432
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I did it.

433
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I got my taxes filed.

434
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I got my taxes filed.

435
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And then I filed for an extension to the payment.

436
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So now I don't actually have to, I got, I got the, I got the filing deadline extended

437
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
from May all the way to October.

438
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And then I got the payment deadline extended all the way to December.

439
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So I don't actually have to pay it until December.

440
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So, you know, that's a, that's a fucking W if ever there was one.

441
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I'm going to try, I'm going to try, I'm doing this.

442
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm doing it all.

443
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm trying to delay it because I want to get, I want to get a business credit card.

444
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I want to get another credit card, a business credit card that won't put me under 524.

445
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And I want to have a bunch of things to buy, to spend on at the moment, at that very moment

446
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
when I get it.

447
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And I'm trying, I need to spend, I'm going to need to spend like $4,000 to get.

448
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Have you considered giving takes Patreon?

449
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
$4,000 directly to give and take Patreon.

450
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah, but I get that sign up bonus.

451
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And I'm going to have to spend like $4,000, maybe less because then I'll have like five,

452
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
if I use it for everything, I'll have like five months to do it.

453
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So, you know, my regular expenses will add up.

454
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But I need to find maybe about like $3,000 worth of extra stuff to spend it on.

455
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So, taxes are some of that.

456
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And, you know, I think I got to pay the artist.

457
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Edward D. Al has been working on the Radcon dojin.

458
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
That is, he's falling a little bit behind, but he's still working on it.

459
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So, whenever he gets done with that, I got to, I got to pay him.

460
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And I got to do the next printing of, oh yeah, and I got to pay for the printing of Road to Radcon.

461
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Of course, that's going to be like, you know, 300 and something, maybe 400.

462
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And then da, da, da, da.

463
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So, I'm trying to get all these expenses, pay them at the same time with the same new credit card to try and hit that minimum spend.

464
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And then if I am struggling to hit the minimum spend, my last ditch option, if I'm like, oh shit, I'm like $1,000 short,

465
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and I'm not going to get the sign up bonus.

466
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
My last ditch option is just dump anything I need to spend into like Instacart credit, Instacart gift cards for myself.

467
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So, I'm just pre-paying for my groceries.

468
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But, you know, if I just dump $1,000 into that, like, you know, I'll use that eventually.

469
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's not actually a loss.

470
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So, that's my panic button if I need to spend something right away.

471
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I don't know if I'll need to do that though.

472
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Oh yeah, I'm strategizing.

473
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm strategizing my churning techniques.

474
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah, it's like a whole operation.

475
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It is like a whole operation.

476
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You're going to have to start hiring employees at this point.

477
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah, just to manage my payment strategies.

478
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'll pay them in, I'll pay an accountant in like share of the cash back rewards.

479
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Like, I won't actually pay them a salary, but I'll promise them like you can have like 25% of whatever I get from credit card sign up bonuses for managing my finances.

480
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
No, no, no, no, you should pay them in JPEGs and say, hey kid, get yourself an NFT.

481
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh god, do you want to talk about NFTs and how fucking dire, how fucking dire the situation on Twitter is?

482
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's equal parts like gut-bustingly embarrassing like hilarious, but like also like God, why do people, why are they like this?

483
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Why can they become like this?

484
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I know what it is, I know what it is.

485
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's the same phenomenon that is the reason why people, remember we did the episode about MLMs?

486
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Multi-layer Mario?

487
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Multi-level marketing, the like basically pyramid schemes, but it's not technically pyramid schemes.

488
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah, kind of.

489
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's mostly women that get into multi-level marketing, not exclusively, but a lot.

490
00:31:49,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So, you know, a lot of these women that get into multi-level marketing, it's basically a scam to trick people into, you know, signing up for the business,

491
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and then, you know, they have to make a personal investment in the business before they can start selling product, and then they start moving product.

492
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
If they start moving product, maybe they can make a profit, but most people just sign up, make the initial investment, get the product,

493
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
don't actually move any of it, and then, you know, the company just takes their money.

494
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But then, you know, because the real way to make money in multi-level marketing is not actually by moving product,

495
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
it's by convincing other people to sign up to be salespeople.

496
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes, it's exactly the same NFTs.

497
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes, that's the NFT mindset.

498
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's mostly like male tech bros that think they're getting in on the ground floor of some shitty new technology.

499
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
They're doing the same thing.

500
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
They're out there, you know, posting about how great it is, you know, posting about like, oh, yeah, you know, this is revolutionary.

501
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You know, this is like, you know, this is a novel way to support artists.

502
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You know, this is like, this is new, and it's totally not a scam, and it's, you know, it's just like multi-level marketing.

503
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Like, it's not a pyramid scheme.

504
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
They reassure you over and over again, and then they'll post about like, oh, I work from home.

505
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You know, I'm so, I'm so happy and grateful to have this opportunity.

506
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You know, now I make so much money without even doing any work, and it's so easy.

507
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And like, the point is not whether it's true or not.

508
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The point is to convince people to get in on it, because that's how you make money is by scamming them.

509
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So NFT people are out there just posting about how great their fucking NFTs are with the exact same, the exact same reason.

510
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
They're just trying to fucking, they're trying to sucker someone else into buying their NFTs for more money than they sold them for, or than they bought them for.

511
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's the same fucking scam.

512
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I saw this one guy in the wild who was, I think it was in like a reply to a tweet about Steam saying no to NFT games, which is, you know, that's alright.

513
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Based, I guess.

514
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Pretty based, I guess. Probably not for a good reason, but it's not, you know, it says fuck you to NFTs, so that's good.

515
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And then there's a bunch of NFT bros in the replies or all going like, ah, Steam, you're really lost to yourself a gamer, you know, all that sort of like stupid, stupid like seething, coping stuff.

516
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But then there's this one guy who's like all high and mighty about it.

517
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And he's like, oh well, you just got, I should, I would recommend you look into this because you're really missing out, you know, like just trying to be nice and civil about it.

518
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
He's not actually coming across.

519
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah, he's not, he's trying not to come across as a snarky person.

520
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He's trying to come across as like, I know more than you do, but that's okay.

521
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'll tell you how.

522
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And, you know, but like it's, it's so clear that like he has no like information.

523
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I was waiting for him to like, like if he was replying to people like, okay, so what are the benefits?

524
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Like what is the actual thing?

525
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
He just says, oh, no, just look into it.

526
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Just look into it.

527
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Just trust me.

528
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Trust me that everything is good and that I'm smart.

529
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I have a feeling that probably the market researchers at Steam did that.

530
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You know, I have a feeling that they have someone who, who looks into this kind of thing.

531
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Ah, it was just, it was just, it was so like, he said at some point like he had bought his like monkey leopard.

532
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
He bought his, he bought his D's nut.

533
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah.

534
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
He bought his one of those for like $300.

535
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Of course.

536
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So, so like somebody was saying, oh, what are you, you paid for that with your car?

537
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Idiot.

538
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And he's like, actually I just played $300 for it.

539
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So, you know, it's relatively cheap.

540
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It was a deal.

541
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's, it's only going to go up and it's like, okay, $300 for an avatar like that.

542
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Um, you know, okay.

543
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It, tell me, it makes, it makes me sad.

544
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I don't know what, what, which, which is more sad.

545
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Like the, you know, the fucking, the lazy shit, like the, the lazy lions and like the, the D's nuts and like, you know, the, the, the, the pixel punks and whatever.

546
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Like the ones that just obviously look like shit and a bunch of like, and a bunch of like, sick of, sickos.

547
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Like, you know, they're like posting, there's their avatar and they're posting around about how great it is and how cool it is and whatever.

548
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I don't know if that is sadder or like, like real artists that make like a good piece and then like sell it as an NFT because that, that seems like more of a waste.

549
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You know, like, like something like, obviously the lions are like an incredible fucking racket and just everyone involved is being scammed and it's, it's funny.

550
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:52,000
When, when someone is like a real artist and they make a piece and they sell it as an NFT, it's like, ah, there was something good here, but it's, but it's tainted now.

551
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's, it's weird.

552
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I was, I think with, with a lot of the, like, you know, the, it being a scam and everything and people being stupid with their money.

553
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That's funny. But like, the, the problem that I have that makes me sad is that the, the environmental damage that it causes that people just don't really seem to give a shit about.

554
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Sure.

555
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And well, you know, like, oh no, but they donated some, they donated like a few thousand bucks to like a charity or whatever.

556
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So like, actually.

557
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I donated an NFT to a charity.

558
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah, I donated them one of my line of a hundred thousand, you know, identical JPEGs that are all worth, you know, a, you know, 0.1 ETH a piece.

559
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So that'll, that'll help, I think.

560
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Like there was that one talking point that, oh, Ethereum is going to go carbon neutral.

561
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So really it's fine if I do it right now when it isn't carbon neutral.

562
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And I've not heard any news of it trying or succeeding to be carbon neutral as a cryptocurrency.

563
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Probably saying that it will is enough.

564
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah, like that's just enough for them to not think like, oh, I'm not doing anything bad because eventually it'll be good.

565
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But like, I feel like if they want to like convince people, their tactics seem to be just, I don't know, stupid, like, ugh, you fucking normies.

566
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You're never going to make it.

567
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You're NGMI because you're not in on it.

568
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You're not, you don't know.

569
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You're a fucking right-click site.

570
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah, not NGMI.

571
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You're never going to make it.

572
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, that's a thing they say apparently.

573
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
If you don't own fucking NFTs, you're never going to make it.

574
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You're never going to make it if you don't own NFTs.

575
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
What does that fucking mean?

576
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's so straight.

577
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's just sort of like insult tactics, but it's like clearly people have problems with NFTs and crypto and all that.

578
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And it's a lot of it is like the energy consumption.

579
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Surely they should try to like solve those issues in order to make people more interested.

580
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But they don't have like the brainpower to like think long term about how to get people interested in the scam.

581
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:14,000
They're just sort of like it's both, it's both like so ridiculously bad for everyone, including themselves.

582
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And they have no way of like actually making a scam.

583
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's like a scam that doesn't even work.

584
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's not going to propagate much further than it already has, I don't think.

585
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:34,000
No, the way it's going, the people that are at the head of like the big fucking NFT rackets have already made their money.

586
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And have either already fled or are going to flee soon or maybe they set it up in a way that they don't actually need to flee

587
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
because it's not technically, they didn't do anything illegal.

588
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But you know, they won't be delivering on whatever it is these fucking rubes think they're going to get out of owning this shit.

589
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Because why would they bother?

590
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Tragically, fucking devastated to report looking now that you know last week I said that I was sad that I had not bought the dip in Bitcoin.

591
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Well, I'm even sadder now because it has kept going up.

592
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It has passed 60k again and that is, that hurts.

593
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:26,000
If I had bought when I was thinking of buying, if I had bought when I was briefly entertaining the thought of buying, I would have made 50%, I would have made a 50% return in the last like three weeks.

594
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So please mourn for me, viewer, please fuck.

595
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Right now you want people to not care about crypto so that the value goes down.

596
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I mean, I do want that, I do want that.

597
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It has not passed its previous high, which was achieved in April, but it is close.

598
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It is fairly close and if it continues like this, it will shortly pass its old high, which will be very upsetting for me.

599
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It will be very upsetting.

600
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But I guess we'll see.

601
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I guess we'll see.

602
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm completely gone from that.

603
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Please lie and go down, please lie and go down.

604
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I mean, I care in that I really want it to fail.

605
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I really want it to die and go away.

606
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'd be happy to see it fail, but I would be tempted.

607
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I would only be tempted if it goes really low and I've said that before, but like every time it dips, I feel like it's nothing enough for me.

608
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm not even talking about buying, I'm just saying, I just hate it.

609
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
On the larger scale, when I can't conceptually, it's not good.

610
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I can't help it, but when I was into crypto for a little bit, it was neat.

611
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I've seen the number go up.

612
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Even though I knew it was like, this is dumb, but it's slightly more money than previous.

613
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Slightly more money than previous, Ben.

614
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That's true.

615
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's very exciting.

616
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's hard to completely discount that.

617
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I understand the intoxication of when you're invested and you see number go up.

618
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You feel a completely unearned sense of superiority.

619
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Like you knew something.

620
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Like you knew something when, of course, you didn't.

621
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You just got lucky.

622
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Roops for old roops.

623
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I mean, for the most part.

624
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Yeah, that's true.

625
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Speaking of, that guy mansplaining NFTs.

626
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I saw some amazing mansplaining on Twitter.

627
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It was the funniest shit I've ever seen.

628
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There was a, you know, that guy who was doing the impersonation of Robin Williams

629
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
that everyone said was really good or whatever?

630
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
No.

631
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Did you not see that?

632
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Some guy was doing like a tribute impression of Robin Williams.

633
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Supposedly he does a really good Robin Williams impression.

634
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Anyway, a bunch of people sent the clip, sent the video to Zelda Williams, his daughter.

635
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And she posted like, hey guys, I'm only posting about this because I don't think it will stop unless I say something.

636
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Please stop sending me the video.

637
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:19,000
The guy is very talented and all, but it's really weird to watch this ghoulish impersonation of my dead dad.

638
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Thanks, goodbye.

639
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And she said something about, in some part of it, he acts like,

640
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
she said something about him on his saddest day.

641
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And I don't know exactly what day she was talking about,

642
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
but there's some part of it that is like a sad day for Robin Williams that he does an impersonation.

643
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It is part of the impersonation.

644
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And this guy responds to Zelda Williams and being like,

645
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
actually Robin Williams was not just a comedian.

646
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
He had a full range of emotions.

647
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
He had his sad days as well.

648
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And it's part of the tribute, actually, that it includes that to his daughter.

649
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
To his daughter.

650
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Man-splaining her dad to her.

651
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Please tell me they didn't know it was...

652
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I mean...

653
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Oh, that's so bad.

654
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It was the worst.

655
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Okay, I got really upset seeing it.

656
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And I typed an insulting comment and I replied to him.

657
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I don't remember what it was. It was a fuck you of some kind.

658
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And like, yes, obviously it's really bad.

659
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's like complete psycho behavior.

660
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But then I stepped back and I was like,

661
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
okay, wait a minute, wait a minute.

662
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yes, it's terrible. It's a terrible thing this person is doing.

663
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
This person has royally fucked up.

664
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
But already, like, 500 people have told him,

665
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
shut the fuck up buddy, you're awful.

666
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And also, this is a guy with like 50 followers

667
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and Zelda Williams has like hundreds of thousands.

668
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And like, I don't need to dog pile this person any further.

669
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yes, what he did was wrong.

670
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
But it's not necessary for me to protect Zelda Williams from this random guy.

671
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Right?

672
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So eventually I was like, what am I doing?

673
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And I replied because like, it's stupid.

674
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Why even fucking bother?

675
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I don't know.

676
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But what a thing to see.

677
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I could not believe it.

678
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That was some next level shit.

679
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Wacky.

680
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah, wacky.

681
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That was my week on Twitter, I guess.

682
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah, I guess my week on Twitter is a new corner.

683
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
New corner, my week on Twitter.

684
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Just the sounds of Hellfire, because that's usually what it is.

685
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Although it was quite good for me.

686
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Whatever, Tober has been going well.

687
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah.

688
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Been drawing a little drawing.

689
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I really liked the drawing of...

690
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Is it scraggy-aggy?

691
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Scraggy-aggy.

692
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Scraggy-aggy, yes.

693
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I really liked the drawing of her and Pumpkin.

694
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
They're like, you grew over there.

695
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I thought that was so cute.

696
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yes, I love that.

697
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I was tired and I was like, oh shit, it's 1 a.m.

698
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I haven't drawn today and I did that.

699
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Lore.

700
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's great.

701
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
She's just like, cool.

702
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That's why I grew.

703
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
That's what, yeah, true.

704
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You know what, Pumpkin is cool.

705
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Good job.

706
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Pumpkin is so fucking great.

707
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Is scraggity like her mom, sort of?

708
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
In my head, she's like a...

709
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,000
What's the word for like a not relative, an aunt?

710
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
A babysitter?

711
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
There's a word for it.

712
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Oh, an Onesan.

713
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yes, the Onesan.

714
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
She's the scarecrow of that Pumpkin patch

715
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and so she knows all the pumpkins that grow from there.

716
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And Pumpk was, you know...

717
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I guess she sees him as like an auntie or something.

718
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Right, yeah.

719
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Makes sense.

720
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Kind of was like, oh wow, she grew in a patch.

721
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Well, I guess why not?

722
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Where else would she have come from?

723
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
If you think about it.

724
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
All the pumpkins, they grow.

725
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Some of them, they go to the flower kingdom

726
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
where they're normal and other ones.

727
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
This is a secret lore, I'm telling you now.

728
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Oh my God.

729
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Secret, secret lore.

730
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Some of them go to the flower kingdom, some of them.

731
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
The flower kingdom?

732
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Yeah, where all the flowers from, the flower heads from there.

733
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Oh my God, it's all connected.

734
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I was like, that must be where flower heads from, right?

735
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Oh, okay.

736
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
All right, sure.

737
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And then some pumpkins, they get stabbed in the face,

738
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
they got their face cut out.

739
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
They become a jack-o'-lantern instead.

740
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Damn.

741
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That's what Pumpkin happened.

742
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
The two evolution routes that a pumpkin can take.

743
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah.

744
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Very, huh, very cool.

745
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Didn't even think about it.

746
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Love it.

747
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I love lore.

748
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yes, I've thought a long and hard about the world-building

749
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
of how to connect all of my comics together.

750
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And it's really funny and really epic.

751
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The kind of rules, actually.

752
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Good job.

753
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Pumpkin people is a very, very big part of the future.

754
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Oh.

755
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh my God.

756
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And then, of course, Cowtown is nearby something town.

757
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That's the same desert.

758
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Something town?

759
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah, from Clarissa.

760
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Oh, right, right.

761
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Which I haven't read yet.

762
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Which I haven't read yet.

763
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You didn't even know.

764
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
You didn't even know about that one.

765
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
No, I don't know.

766
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't.

767
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Okay.

768
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
It's all coming together.

769
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And even more reason for me to finally read it then.

770
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Hmm.

771
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Hmm.

772
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Hmm.

773
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yeah, I'm excited.

774
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That's kind of exciting.

775
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I like it a lot.

776
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah, I'm excited to write Belle Jape II.

777
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It probably won't be called Belle Jape II because it has nothing to do with jail

778
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
or vaping it.

779
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Unlike the first one.

780
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Yes.

781
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Bape, Bape, Jape, Belle, Bape, Jape.

782
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Once she kept making it, saying it wrong, but I can't say it the way he said it.

783
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
What does he say?

784
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Did he say jail, Bape?

785
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Jail, Bape, yes.

786
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah.

787
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Great.

788
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Wait, now I forget what the actual, it's actually called Belle Jape, right?

789
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Belle Jape.

790
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah, Belle Jape.

791
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah.

792
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Because they're in jail and they should be on Belle.

793
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Wait, but they don't.

794
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And there's Jape-ery going on.

795
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But there's no jail.

796
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Oh, but they're out on, they're out on Belle, from jail.

797
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Well, maybe there should be Belle, but there is, maybe there's no Belle and they gape their

798
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
way out of jail.

799
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Really?

800
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Right.

801
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
The title has no sense to it, but it's fun.

802
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
It sounds like what the story is.

803
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It evokes the mood.

804
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
That's one way to look at it, I suppose.

805
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yes.

806
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I gotta stop looking at this Bitcoin chart.

807
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It's making me sad.

808
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
No more.

809
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
No more.

810
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
No more.

811
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You absolute buffoon.

812
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yes.

813
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
True.

814
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
True.

815
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Oh, one more thing about NFTs that sucks.

816
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I mean, there's lots of things that suck, but Steam said no.

817
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But because Steam said no, Epic Games stepped in and said, hmm, we might consider it.

818
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Of course.

819
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
We're going to counterculture stupid fucking idiots.

820
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Nice.

821
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So now, look forward to fucking NFTs in Fortnite.

822
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I don't doubt that could happen.

823
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That's the coolest thing.

824
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That's the coolest sentence anyone's ever said.

825
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Damn, first they put Martin Luther King Jr. in Fortnite and then they put NFTs.

826
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Like, how much better can it get?

827
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Now that is Epic.

828
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Oh, no.

829
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I liked Epic Games only because they gave me loads of free shit.

830
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Every week, free games.

831
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Like, oh my god, I'll simp for this company because they gave me free shit.

832
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But now I can't because they're NFT fucks.

833
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
They're NFT scum.

834
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
They'll still get that free shit.

835
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Yeah.

836
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
That's a...

837
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, that's tragic.

838
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yeah.

839
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah.

840
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I mean, when is a company not tragic?

841
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
True though, true though.

842
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
God.

843
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Well, what else?

844
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Okay.

845
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Here's a funny thing.

846
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Here's a funny thing that happened this week.

847
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:09,000
In my fucking disgusting rat-infested, raccoon-infested parking lot

848
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
behind my apartment that I live in,

849
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
they have fucking been backhoeing.

850
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,000
There's been a giant backhoe in there all week doing construction work and digging,

851
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
and they have successfully dug out a giant square pit

852
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,000
into what I assume will eventually be a basement for a house or building of some kind.

853
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And there's just a giant pile of rubble and rock and dirt on the other side of the parking lot now.

854
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I can see it through my curtain.

855
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's pretty hideous.

856
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It's pretty funny.

857
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The other thing that's been going on is that, like, okay, there was Columbus Day this past Sunday.

858
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
This past Sunday, they were all fucking day.

859
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
No, no, it was Monday, right?

860
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Because they had the day off.

861
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah, it was the day they had off for Columbus Day or Indigenous People's Day.

862
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And they're partying at this house.

863
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
This house is constantly throwing parties or some kind of frat house or something.

864
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I don't know.

865
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
They're always throwing parties.

866
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
They sound huge.

867
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And then, this past week, fucking my property manager,

868
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:33,000
my weirdo fucking gunnut freak of a man who is in charge of this property for the landlord or whatever,

869
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I've just been hearing him screaming out the window at this fucking other house,

870
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
just like screaming at them to, like, turn the music down, turn the bass down.

871
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
The worst one I heard was he's screaming at them.

872
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
He's like, hey, turn the bass down.

873
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Hey, you fucking, what do you think you're fucking doing?

874
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Hey, turn the fucking bass down.

875
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And then, like, I think they try to yell something back and he's like,

876
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
no, you can have your music.

877
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You can have your music.

878
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I don't give a fuck.

879
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
You can have your music.

880
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Just turn the fucking bass down.

881
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's like, okay.

882
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And then, he immediately pivots into yelling at some child,

883
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
but in a friendly way.

884
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
He's yelling down into something.

885
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I don't see any of this, but I can hear him yelling at, like, a child.

886
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
He's like, he's asking, like, hey, what do you, hey, what do you got there?

887
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Hey, you're riding, you're riding your bike.

888
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Hey, that's nice.

889
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Hey, tell, hey, you know, take it easy on your mom or whatever.

890
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It was like.

891
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
It was like he realized he was being, like, aggressive and then there was a child.

892
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's like, oh, I got to act nice in front of this child.

893
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I got to scream pleasantries at this child from my fucking, from my balcony

894
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
with the fucking POWMIA flag or whatever.

895
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Hey, you're walking there.

896
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
That's great.

897
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I'm giving him, like, a New York accent because I don't know.

898
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
When I imagine someone screaming at partiers out of their apartment balcony,

899
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
it seems like a New York thing to do.

900
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But no, it's here in my own backyard.

901
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah.

902
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Boston.

903
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
He's a, I fucking hate that guy.

904
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I don't know, although I hate the party house just as much.

905
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
So honestly, I don't know who I'm rooting for in this, in this, in this conflict.

906
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Maybe they'll take each other out.

907
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yeah.

908
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:24,000
We mutually annihilate one another.

909
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
What else did I do?

910
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Oh, Crack's birthday was yesterday.

911
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Crack.

912
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah.

913
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
World-famous creator of Endless War and well as the world, as well as of,

914
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:41,000
isthereanrvyet.com and many other, and many other famous projects.

915
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Turn 30 yesterday and I went and hung out with him for that.

916
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And we had Indian food.

917
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And I bought, the most, the most exciting thing for me was buying,

918
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I bought a bunch of, I bought a bunch of weird cakes from my local Russian bazaar.

919
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
For, for, for Munchie's birthday, like a month ago, I bought some weird cake

920
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
that was called Smetanik.

921
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I think I mentioned this.

922
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And that was okay.

923
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That was okay.

924
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I bought so much of it.

925
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I bought a more modest amount this time and I still had leftovers.

926
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So I made the right decision.

927
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I bought a more modest amount and I bought an assortment of various things.

928
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I bought a cake called Rizik and I bought a different cake called Spartak

929
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
that were kind of similar, but they were, they were different too.

930
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
They had different flavors in them.

931
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And I bought, oh, okay.

932
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
This is a deep cut.

933
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Long, long ago on the PCP, Mage was talking about Lithuanian desserts.

934
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And one time she mentioned something called bird's milk that I was very curious about.

935
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Oh, yeah.

936
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And, and, and miracle of miracles, they had bird's milk at the bazaar.

937
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And I bought it and it was okay.

938
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I didn't love it, but it was, it was pretty good.

939
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
How would you milk a bird?

940
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Well, well, the, the idea is that it's like, you know, it's not something that...

941
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Like an egg and a milk inside.

942
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Well, it's like birds don't give milk.

943
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
So to call it bird's milk is to suggest that it is something incredibly rare and like precious.

944
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Right?

945
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh, I see.

946
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
But it was just okay.

947
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It was okay.

948
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I mean, I liked some of the other stuff, but yeah, it was kind of like a marshmallow-y.

949
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It's sort of like a spongy kind of marshmallow.

950
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It's not really a cake.

951
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It's like a marshmallow-y thing that you cut slices of.

952
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
They had another marshmallow-y thing called a white zephyr.

953
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And the white zephyr, you, it was like in a ball.

954
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It was like a swirly ball.

955
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It looked like a, like a meringue cookie, but it was spongy and you would slice off slices of it.

956
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And it tasted kind of like, it was like fruity actually.

957
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I thought it would be like vanilla because it was white and puffy, but no, it tasted like apples.

958
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It was a little bit tangy and had like an apple flavor to it.

959
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And then the other thing I got, okay, the best thing I got by far was this, it was called a, it was called dulce de leche waffle cake.

960
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And it was like crunchy.

961
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It was kind of crunchy.

962
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It was sort of like one of those, those like waffle stick bars.

963
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I don't know.

964
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
There's a kind of cookie that is like waffle sort of and it's, they come in little sticks and they're layered.

965
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It was kind of like one of those, but it was full of some kind of wall nutty dulce de leche goo.

966
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It was so crispy and also so gooey and had such a delicious nutty walnut flavor.

967
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
That shit was an insane.

968
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
That shit was great.

969
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It was so, that was so good.

970
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
The other stuff was pretty good.

971
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
The rizik was okay.

972
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It was very soft.

973
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
It was very tender, creamy.

974
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It was better.

975
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It was a bit better than the, than the smetanic.

976
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
The spartak was even better than the rizik because it was basically the rizik,

977
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
but it was also like chocolatey and coffee kind of flavor, which was even better.

978
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And those were good.

979
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Those were just kind of cake in a good way.

980
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But this crispy gooey fucking waffle cake, dulce de leche waffle cake, I can't believe it.

981
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's my new favorite dessert as wild.

982
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Did I just spell that?

983
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I think it, I'm not sure if I'm saying it right, but it's D-U-L-C-E.

984
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And then it's three separate words.

985
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Dulce de leche, L-E-C-H-E.

986
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It means, it means like sweet of the milk.

987
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So I assume it's milk.

988
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yeah, I know, leche means milk.

989
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah.

990
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Dulce de leche.

991
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It means milk, milk sweet.

992
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Caramelized milk or milk jam.

993
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Milk jam.

994
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Prepared by slowly heating sugar and milk over a period of several hours.

995
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I usually think of it as like a Mexican thing, because the name is Spanish,

996
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
but I'm sure they probably do it in all kinds of cultures,

997
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
but I'm sure they don't call it dulce de leche in Russia,

998
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
but probably they just called it that because the concept would be more familiar to Americans

999
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
by its Spanish name.

1000
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It is from Latin America, apparently.

1001
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
That's cool.

1002
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I would believe, though, that Russian cooking had a similar thing you could do with milk.

1003
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yes, those Russians always be drinking milk.

1004
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
They always.

1005
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I mean, that's where white people countries is where milk drinking happens,

1006
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
because white people develop the gene for lactose tolerance.

1007
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The makes the skin white?

1008
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
No, this is a thing.

1009
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
White people are way less likely to be lactose intolerant.

1010
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Non-white people are much more likely to be lactose intolerant,

1011
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
and it's because just geographically, where white people came from,

1012
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
there were more cows and more access to dairy food.

1013
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Lactose.

1014
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And so white people just kind of evolved to be able to tolerate lactose better.

1015
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Interesting.

1016
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Yeah.

1017
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Hell, yeah.

1018
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Phrenology.

1019
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Race realism.

1020
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Fun facts.

1021
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
That's a fun fact about milk.

1022
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Hey, I'm just saying fun facts, okay?

1023
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I'm just saying fun facts.

1024
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
John Tron just wanted to say some fun facts.

1025
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That one time with Destiny, he just wanted to share some fun facts he thought

1026
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
or might be true.

1027
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Hell fucking, yeah.

1028
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
How long have we been going?

1029
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Okay, we're over an hour.

1030
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Pretty good.

1031
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I've exhausted my list of topics,

1032
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
although usually I tend to think of some stuff last minute.

1033
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You got anything else going on?

1034
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
The only thing is that I've been using my new tablet,

1035
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
which I got from the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter stretch goal to get a tablet,

1036
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and I got one.

1037
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Right.

1038
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I think I may have mentioned it on the PCP already.

1039
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I don't know how to say it.

1040
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I think you mentioned it.

1041
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I think you might have mentioned it.

1042
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Canvas 13.

1043
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It's the first tablet I've had that plugs in with an HDMI

1044
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
and is a screen as well as a pen,

1045
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
and it's got buttons on the side, and it's all very nice and sleek.

1046
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
It came with a funny glove.

1047
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Is it your first tablet that has hotkey buttons?

1048
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Yeah, otherwise I'd use...

1049
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I guess I did have the iPad though.

1050
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That was all the finger gesture stuff.

1051
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
That's exactly what I said, but this is bigger and it's cooler,

1052
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and it works with my PC.

1053
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
How big is it?

1054
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
13 inches, because it's the 13, maybe?

1055
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Let me measure it.

1056
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Oh yeah, the iPad you have to draw on separately,

1057
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
and then you would have to send the file to your computer, right?

1058
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Yeah.

1059
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Yeah, that sucks.

1060
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah, this is 13 inch, so bigger than my iPad.

1061
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Hold on.

1062
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
13 inch tablet.

1063
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I want to see how...

1064
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I can't imagine it in my head.

1065
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It's not the biggest, but it's good and better than...

1066
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Is it roughly iPad size?

1067
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I mean, my iPad was kind of a small one,

1068
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
so maybe I don't know how to judge sizes.

1069
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah, okay.

1070
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It's like a sheet of A4 paper, or thereabouts.

1071
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
We don't...

1072
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Fuck, we don't call it A4.

1073
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Do you know...

1074
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Europeans and their fucking A4 paper...

1075
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Sick.

1076
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
What the hell do you call normal paper?

1077
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Nine and a half...

1078
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
We call it eight and a half by eleven, like sensible people.

1079
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Is it even the same measurements as A4?

1080
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Hold on.

1081
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Is it? Let's find out. A4...

1082
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Well, okay, regular printer paper is eight and a half by eleven.

1083
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
So if A4 is regular printer paper, then yeah, it's the same size.

1084
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I assume printers are the same, so yes, that would be the same.

1085
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Okay, eight...

1086
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I'm going to paper sizes.org to find out...

1087
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Oh, wait a minute.

1088
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Oh, right, because you guys don't...

1089
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Oh, is it not quite?

1090
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Okay, I'm looking it up, and A4 is...

1091
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It's 8.3 by 11.7 inches.

1092
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
So yeah, it actually might be slightly different.

1093
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
You're using inches we're using millimeters.

1094
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Yeah, but...

1095
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:02,000
So ours is exactly 210 by 297, and yours is 215.9 millimeters by 279.4 millimeters.

1096
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
This is the metric shit.

1097
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So it's almost...

1098
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I'm actually shocked.

1099
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I'm actually shocked that we don't just use the exact same size of paper.

1100
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That fucks me up.

1101
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
That's a little...

1102
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Your paper is a little shorter and a little wider.

1103
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Just like us.

1104
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Just like you.

1105
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Just like our population.

1106
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Fucking LeMau.

1107
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Well, okay, so basically...

1108
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
It makes sense, because I see on printing sites for a lot of ghosts or other,

1109
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
and I'm like, you know, you've got all these normal ones I understand,

1110
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
and then the U.S. letter.

1111
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It's like, what is...

1112
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Huh?

1113
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Why would I do that?

1114
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Because we do it in fucking Imperial.

1115
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
We do it in Imperial units.

1116
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Imperials.

1117
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Those were the bad guys in Star Wars.

1118
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
They were the bad guys in real life, too.

1119
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
But now we're the bad guys.

1120
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh, my God.

1121
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yeah.

1122
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Did you know that Star Wars is based on a real shit?

1123
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's called war.

1124
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It really happened.

1125
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Did you hear the stormtroopers were a thing in real life, too?

1126
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Oh, what the fuck, dude?

1127
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Stormtroopers were a German soldier thing, I think, actually.

1128
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I don't know if they were...

1129
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Hitler's stormtroopers, but they were in German.

1130
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I think they were...

1131
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Were they called like the Sturmwaffe or something?

1132
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I know they use the phrase Sturmendrang,

1133
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
which was like...

1134
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Sturmendrang is like...

1135
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Is that like...

1136
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Wait, hold on.

1137
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Sturm und...

1138
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Okay, I know that the final bad guy in Advance Wars

1139
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
is named Sturm after Sturmendrang.

1140
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Oh, Sturmendrang...

1141
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Oh, sorry.

1142
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
No, this is wrong.

1143
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Sturmendrang is a literary and artistic movement in Germany

1144
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
in the late 18th century,

1145
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
characterized by the expression of emotional unrest

1146
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
and a rejection of neoclassical literary norms.

1147
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Okay, so that's not actually what I was thinking of.

1148
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Okay, the term Sturmabteilung...

1149
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I don't know how to pronounce...

1150
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Oh, wait.

1151
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
We can do the pronounced thing.

1152
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Google.

1153
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Show me what mouth shapes to make.

1154
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Oh, I think it's Sturmabteilung.

1155
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I think it's Sturmabteilung is probably how you say it.

1156
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Right, British...

1157
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Let me...

1158
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Sturmabteilung.

1159
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Okay, so the Sturmabteilung...

1160
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And then it says...

1161
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Sturmabteilung.

1162
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
The first official German stormtrooper unit

1163
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
was authorized so much second 1915 on the western front.

1164
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
So they called it stormtroopers in Wikipedia.

1165
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Okay, well, Wikipedia says it's literally storm detachment.

1166
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Sturmtrippen.

1167
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Oh, really? They have Sturmtrippen?

1168
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Sturmtrippen were special soldiers of the German army

1169
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
in the last years of World War I.

1170
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Yeah, I think I learned that years ago.

1171
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I was like, oh my God, Star Wars.

1172
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Oh my God, it was just like Star Wars in real life.

1173
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
This reminds me of when I learned the translation

1174
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
for the Sailor Scouts, the Sailor Senchi,

1175
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
how in English they call them Scouts,

1176
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:25,000
but really the term Senchi just means soldier or warrior.

1177
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh, yeah, but they're women, so they could possibly be proper soldiers.

1178
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
They're just merely Scouts.

1179
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I'm not sure if it's like they were women,

1180
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
or it's because it's a kid's show

1181
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
and they didn't want to make it about soldiers, warriors, or whatever.

1182
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Maybe they thought that was too military,

1183
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
or guardian I think would maybe be another way to say it.

1184
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Sailor soldier.

1185
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yeah, most literally I think it would be a soldier in an army.

1186
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But I think in England they call them,

1187
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
or in English in the West they call them,

1188
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I think they might have switched up a little bit over the translation,

1189
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
but yeah, they usually called them,

1190
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
in the show they were called the Sailor Scouts.

1191
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And I think they translated the title

1192
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
as I think it was like Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon

1193
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
instead of like Pretty Warrior Sailor Moon.

1194
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
That's neat.

1195
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That's just an interesting quirk of translation

1196
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
that I find very funny.

1197
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Pretty Stormtrooper Sailor Moon.

1198
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Stormtrooper Sailor Moon, yeah.

1199
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Stormtrooper Sailor Moon.

1200
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Yeah, in Germany that's how they translated it.

1201
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Sailor is kind of like an SS officer if you think about it.

1202
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Ah, geez, Rick.

1203
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Ah, shit. Ah, fuck.

1204
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
But yeah, about the tablet, it's good.

1205
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Yes.

1206
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I draw, and it's got all the buttons on the side.

1207
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I can do like, I can set one of the buttons to be

1208
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Control V.

1209
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yes, back.

1210
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Control V.

1211
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
No, what's the backwards one?

1212
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Control Z.

1213
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Control Z.

1214
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
How do you not know that it's Control Z?

1215
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Because I've been using that button so long I forgot

1216
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
what it is that I do.

1217
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
What the fuck? Okay.

1218
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I don't even look at my keyboard when I'm actually drawing.

1219
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
That's like forgetting what Control C is.

1220
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
What about when you type?

1221
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
What about when you type like in a word processor?

1222
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Don't you Control Z to undo?

1223
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yeah, but I don't look at it.

1224
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I just remember it from muscle memory.

1225
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You were out of your fucking mind.

1226
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
You're not even human.

1227
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
What do you mean?

1228
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I don't need to look at it.

1229
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Yeah, but you just know because people talk about it.

1230
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
People talk about Control Z.

1231
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I do know.

1232
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Ben, I just made a mistake just now.

1233
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
No, it's not just a mistake.

1234
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It's over for you.

1235
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It's over.

1236
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
That's it.

1237
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
There's no more.

1238
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
You're going to jail.

1239
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I'm sorry.

1240
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Okay.

1241
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
The buttons.

1242
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Thank you.

1243
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
The buttons.

1244
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I turned the buttons.

1245
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I set the buttons to be one of them.

1246
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Control Z.

1247
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I think that's why I tripped up.

1248
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I would say Control Z, but then you'd say,

1249
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
how British?

1250
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
And I'm like, oh, no, I've made fun of,

1251
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I've made fun of few people enough for one day.

1252
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Oh, good.

1253
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
The point has been made.

1254
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Fuck yeah.

1255
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Yeah.

1256
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
No more bullying.

1257
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
No more bullying.

1258
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Yeah.

1259
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Cool.

1260
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
All right.

1261
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Fair enough.

1262
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And then there's like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1263
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Is that eight?

1264
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Yes.

1265
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Eight buttons.

1266
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
All right.

1267
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I'm going to do all these different things like eraser and fill tool and lasso makes things

1268
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
quicker.

1269
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I like that.

1270
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Quick is good.

1271
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Quick is good.

1272
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Oh, wait, not to derail, but speaking of quick is good.

1273
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Did you see that thread on Twitter of the guy saying that like,

1274
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Oh, I did.

1275
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Yes.

1276
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
About the speed.

1277
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Like so many of the radical left are speed runners because like speed running is an exercise.

1278
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's like it's like demonstrates like a lack of work ethic because it's about doing.

1279
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Yeah, it was very confusing.

1280
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I tried to read it like three or four times to understand what his point was.

1281
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I think it's just sort of the left is lazy.

1282
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's like the left is lazy and speed running is also lazy because I know that it takes

1283
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
a lot of work to get the speed run down, but it's all work done in service of just beating

1284
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
the game, which is what a normal player would accomplish in less time.

1285
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
You know, it's about it's about doing it.

1286
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Yeah, it's about doing it fast instead of doing it right.

1287
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And that's lazy.

1288
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
And that's lazy.

1289
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I just I just really love.

1290
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I love his the way the thread continue like goes and he every so often he's like, and

1291
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
obviously this means like something completely stupid that no one would ever think.

1292
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Some some weird fucking like Jordan Peterson, Carl Young like weird heroes, heroes journey

1293
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
symbology shit that doesn't fucking mean anything.

1294
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
But he thinks it's like he thinks he's really on to something.

1295
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
He's like he says Petersonian.

1296
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
It's Peterson.

1297
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Yeah.

1298
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It's genuinely I cannot tell if this guy is joking or not.

1299
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I mean, it's it's it's funnier and I like it more if he's not joking.

1300
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Yeah.

1301
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And then there was a bit where it's like, oh, let me find it.

1302
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Let me let me read it.

1303
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Type in weird.

1304
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Oh, wait, you've replied to it.

1305
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I'm looking I'm looking at it right now.

1306
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Of course, of course, he has to he has to make a reply tweet saying, oh, I sure did trigger

1307
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
a lot of libs in with this comment.

1308
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
He's not even he's not even well, he doesn't say lips.

1309
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
He says left is because he calls himself center left.

1310
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So he's not a conservative per se, but he is like an anti woke center left, whatever

1311
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
that fucking means.

1312
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Okay, this is the part like number 10 to number 11.

1313
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah, where he's sort of going.

1314
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
All right, I'll just read it.

1315
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
In other words, there is a connection between sexuality and creativity that we see throughout

1316
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
time as Peterson points out with the Tiamat and other examples.

1317
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Yes, Tiamat, the multi headed dragon, of course.

1318
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
In the sexual marketplace, which archetypes are simultaneously deemed the most creative

1319
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
and value the highest?

1320
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Next tweet.

1321
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
The answer is obviously entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and others.

1322
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Of course.

1323
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Like obviously is Elon Musk.

1324
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Obviously that's the answer.

1325
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
The most sexually creative person of all.

1326
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I know what you were thinking when I asked that question.

1327
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Obviously you were picturing Elon Musk as the most, most highly valued in the sexual

1328
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
marketplace person that I can imagine.

1329
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Yes.

1330
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
It's just it's it's like every stereotype of this sort of person.

1331
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
It's great.

1332
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And then.

1333
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Okay, the shit about the sexual archetype is so is that I genuinely I genuinely don't

1334
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
even know what he's talking about.

1335
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I have no idea.

1336
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I think he starts off with.

1337
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Yeah.

1338
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It's it's it's a Jordan Peterson line of talking.

1339
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yes.

1340
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Jordan Peterson generally for a lot of people seems to be like letting, you know, young

1341
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
men know that they're smart and they're Rick Sanchez.

1342
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And that makes them better for society if they're buying a book.

1343
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Sort of.

1344
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Sort of.

1345
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Sort of.

1346
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So like.

1347
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I think that's what that's what some people take from it.

1348
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Yeah.

1349
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I don't know.

1350
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I have not read Jordan Peterson.

1351
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So I have no idea what he's actually getting at.

1352
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
There's a lot of stuff that he's sort of implying and assuming that everyone knows

1353
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
his fact.

1354
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yeah.

1355
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And he's not explaining it in the context of speed running.

1356
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So I don't know what his actual point.

1357
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I don't think he makes a point.

1358
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
He says.

1359
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Okay.

1360
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
For he started.

1361
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think he does.

1362
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
He starts up really strong.

1363
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:01,000
His first week ends with the reason is to elevate alternate sexual archetypes in the

1364
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
marketplace.

1365
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Parentheses quote fastest Mario.

1366
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
So he's saying.

1367
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Okay.

1368
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I don't get this at all.

1369
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:17,000
He's saying that fastest Mario is a alternative sexual archetype in the sexual marketplace.

1370
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I.

1371
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I don't even.

1372
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I don't even know what he's getting at there.

1373
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Like.

1374
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I can only assume that like it is a it is like a something.

1375
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It is something you can do to be like sexually valued by your peers is to be the fastest

1376
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Mario and like that's that's hot to some people.

1377
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I suppose that's what I can gather from like the sexual marketplace wording being like oh

1378
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:47,000
well if you want women to fuck you sexual marketplace you need to like win in the sexual marketplace

1379
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,000
like you can be an entrepreneur billionaire like Elon Musk or you can be the fastest Mario.

1380
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
The left wants everyone to be the fastest Mario instead of being a creative individual

1381
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000
like Elon Musk a generative rich guy like Elon Musk.

1382
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
This is just so wacky.

1383
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:12,000
His his point at the end he says I'm not saying speedrunning is bad but rather that thinking

1384
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,000
about the talk the topic philosophically there are dangerous elements within it elements

1385
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:25,000
which he describes as leftist and doesn't I don't think he elaborates on why the leftistness

1386
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
of it is a bad thing.

1387
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Okay.

1388
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Okay.

1389
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
This is this is the part they okay and explaining the sexual argument.

1390
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Okay he says they are aiming to make a new sexual archetype based upon speed rather than

1391
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,000
doing things right and refuse ownership of what few innovations they can provide to their

1392
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
own scene denying creativity within their very own sexual archetype.

1393
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:57,000
It's like okay so I what like I get I would understand what he means if he were saying

1394
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
like they value speed over doing it right like obviously that's stupid because like

1395
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
if you're speedrunning the right way to speedrunning is to do it fast.

1396
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:11,000
This this guy is he just values he thinks that just playing the game the way you're supposed

1397
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:18,000
to play it like a casual player would is like just just a priori either as good or better

1398
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,000
than speedrunning it and like that's just a given fact and like to do to do otherwise

1399
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,000
is to like pervert the you know the natural order.

1400
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
It would be it would be something very vague that he couldn't actually explain because

1401
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:43,000
like if if if speedrunning is a meaningless pastime because you could complete the game

1402
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:52,000
quicker without practicing the speedrun then he's therefore saying that time saved is like

1403
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,000
the most important aspect of media and therefore you don't need to do any of it.

1404
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You don't need to see any musicals play any games at all.

1405
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
You could simply you could simply not play the game.

1406
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:10,000
You could simply I don't know breed your wife or work an extra shift or work an extra shift

1407
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,000
at the Shake Shack and get and get some money to pay for the child you will eventually

1408
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
sire with your with your with your God.

1409
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Mario DNA.

1410
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Yes.

1411
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
But I don't know he calls it a sexual archetype and I don't know.

1412
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I don't know what he means.

1413
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Is he just saying like a I imagine he means a a a sort of way of of valuing other people.

1414
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I think that is based on speed where it's like in his like in his mind the way things are

1415
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:50,000
is that people are valued for quote unquote doing things right doing things the right

1416
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:57,000
way which is I guess what Elon Musk and his mind and the left is like no that is bad doing

1417
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
it fast is better instead of being valued for doing things right.

1418
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:07,000
You're valued for doing things quick and that would be bad for him because he does things

1419
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
right.

1420
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
There's so many assumptions like just the assumption that yeah the right way to Elon

1421
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Musk is a paragon of the right way to do things whatever whatever that is Elon Musk we know

1422
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
we know for sure that Elon Musk is a paragon of it right that much there it can be no debate

1423
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
on.

1424
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I just it's funny someone pointed out in the comments that like boy if you think if you

1425
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
think this about speedrunning wait until you hear about the sport of real running which

1426
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,000
is also just about going from one place to another as fast as possible and spending your

1427
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
whole life training yourself to do exactly that.

1428
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Literally you could say the exact same thing about sports I don't know just a just a complete

1429
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:09,000
fucking skit so I was totally deranged individual very funny very cool loved every second of

1430
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
it.

1431
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Oh I guess the last thing that I have wanted to mention is the funny bit in the in the

1432
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
latest void gazers you don't have to talk too long about this but the funny bit in the

1433
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
latest void gazers where Trixie says that she would quote unquote forgive me if I commit

1434
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Harakiri and kill myself I didn't watch the video but I Simsie time stamped for me the

1435
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:51,000
part where she says that and it was very very not as funny as it sounds because it was very

1436
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:59,000
awkward and sort of uncomfortable and to watch her like fumble like literally fumble and like

1437
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:09,000
fuck up and drop the mic as she's it's it's the last thing it's literally the last thing

1438
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:18,000
they say in the video is Trixie telling me to kill myself check it out I guess check it

1439
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,000
out if you want link in the description to the time step you know what yeah fuck it link

1440
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:33,000
in the description to the time stamp wait hold on I'll find it from my server but the bug

1441
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:41,000
scroll back a little bit they posted it they posted it now before that now before that

1442
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:50,000
no here we go here we go copy link posting that right on the server time stamp for your

1443
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:00,000
convenience do you like Pokemon oh yeah no there we fucking no no no no I don't like

1444
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Pokemon I don't I kind of don't in a way I was thinking about this the other day I was

1445
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
thinking how sad it is that like I think I'm just I think I'm probably never going to buy

1446
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Pokemon game again because I genuinely no longer believe that the Pokemon company actually

1447
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
wants to make their video games good I genuinely don't think yeah I mean I don't know

1448
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:27,000
about caring I'm sure individual artists want to work and make things good but like

1449
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:35,000
ultimately doesn't end up being sure something that looks like people care it looks like

1450
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
thrown together thing every time which it would be okay if I couldn't tell in the final

1451
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:48,000
product but like I can tell in the final product it's just insulting but we've but we've

1452
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:56,000
talked about that we've talked about that over and over plenty of times before yeah I

1453
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,000
don't know anything else before we move on to voicemails no just make sure to check out

1458
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:35,000
wait Tuesday yeah you said sorry cool I will check it out then I am a little distracted

1459
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:42,000
because all right this is hard to explain but so you know you know how on a computer

1460
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:48,000
you've got like windows and they like open and they move or you move them around

1461
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:57,000
mm-hmm the the window the in the chrome window that I have open that has the speak pipe links

1462
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:04,000
in it I oh there it finally went I've been clicking on it for several minutes and it just

1463
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
has not been like moving it has just been staying behind all the it just didn't it was

1464
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,000
like no you can't click on that okay I have issues like that sometimes it's still happening

1465
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,000
where because I'm clicking on a different tab and it's not switching tabs it like doesn't

1466
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,000
care that I click click click sometimes okay it okay it went okay it went sometimes for

1467
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,000
some reason like a full-screen application will it be visually there but I can't click

1468
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
on it I would click on whatever window is underneath and I have no idea why that happens

1469
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
and how to fix it sometimes I just need to minimize it and maximize it and then it works

1470
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:46,000
again yeah a thing a thing that happens a thing that keeps happening to me is that I

1471
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:52,000
will have multiple chrome windows open and one of them will pop to the front like one

1472
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,000
that I'm not using it will just randomly pop to the front and then I will I will try to

1473
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
okay like click on the other one that I want to be using to get that to the front but it

1474
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,000
doesn't work I can't click on it I have to click on the one that came to the front first

1475
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and then it will let me re-click on the other one that I want to be and then and then it

1476
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
will come to the front and it's a small annoyance but it happens like multiple times a day and

1477
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:25,000
every time I'm just I'm stuck like why like why why did you do this like what what would

1478
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:34,000
cause this and will you please stop I don't know are you are you there yep okay I heard

1479
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:42,000
a beep I wasn't sure if you just connected yeah so for oh my god fuck off I'm getting

1480
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:54,000
mad just let me switch tabs just let me switch tabs okay thanks shit sorry right the first

1481
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:04,000
voicemail of the day is called delta rune not isekai and there it is three two one go

1482
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:15,000
in delta rune they come from a fantasy world it's not an isekai an isekai you need to come

1483
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:23,000
from the real world a world based off of our reality in delta rune they come from a world

1484
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:29,000
full of monsters and bullshit you fool I mean where does it say that whereas I mean all

1485
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
what do you mean where does it say that there's a there's there's oh you you mean where does

1486
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
it say that it has to come from our world not where does it say that the world of delta

1487
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,000
rune is full of monsters and and and while while we're at it all anime looks completely

1488
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,000
different from real world so like how based is it in reality if people's eyes are that

1489
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
maybe that's a weak argument but that's pretty it's definitely the world of like sword art

1490
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:03,000
online is obviously supposed to be the real world the delta rune world okay okay I don't

1491
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,000
know I think this is kind of an interesting objection it's it's really just sort of like

1492
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:15,000
the a real world right like I feel like it's that doesn't have like oh I wouldn't have

1493
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:22,000
America they don't have references to real countries it's all just sort of things that

1494
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:29,000
would exist in our real world like cars and houses and trash cans and stuff cafes and

1495
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
but there's just happens to be monsters there but there's no countries okay to the like

1496
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:43,000
no actual named similarities to low real life locations so where where is it so here's

1497
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:49,000
a thought I think I actually kind of agree with this guy because if you if you what I'm

1498
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:56,000
trying to say okay if the if the definition of an isekai is just that like the character

1499
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
like goes somewhere or goes on a journey or goes to a different place even in a metaphorical

1500
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:06,000
sense then like every story is an isekai because that's like that's literally like right in

1501
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
like the hero's journey like you start in like the initial like place of safety and

1502
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
childhood and then you you know something disrupts the order and then you have to go

1503
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:21,000
on some kind of journey in order to like Delta Rune return with the moon or whatever

1504
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:29,000
but it's not like a location that exists in like it's it's a magical not real reality

1505
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
that they travel to I think I think I know what you're saying and I think okay yeah I

1506
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
think the distinction for me is like yes obviously obviously the the world of Delta

1507
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Rune has these like creatures in it but the question yeah if you start in a fantasy world

1508
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:52,000
but you go on a journey that is I would say that's not an isekai I'm like okay yes well

1509
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,000
it's not just a journey I consider a journey to be like a physical like a like a you know

1510
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:04,000
a trip like a car ride or whatever yes but but but there's like it's a fantasy within

1511
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
a fantasy world because like the dark world when they stop playing at the end of chapter

1512
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:16,000
one they're in a room with symbols and icons that represent all of the people that were

1513
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:25,000
in the fantasy world yeah so that so that fantasy world doesn't isn't real in the same

1514
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:33,000
way that the world they're in then is real the I would say that if I wanted to call Delta

1515
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Rune an isekai I think my argument would have to be that like yes elements elements of the

1516
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,000
world as the real world as it's portrayed in Delta Rune are not the same as our own

1517
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
you know yes there are monsters and stuff there are animal people and maybe there's

1518
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
other stuff that I'm forgetting but like it's it's nevertheless meant to be it's

1519
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
nevertheless meant to be you know analogous to the real world in the way that like it

1520
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
still counts as the real world like it's still like you know a town like a regular town

1521
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
even if it has like monster yeah there's no there's no experience points and fighting

1522
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,000
battles and RPG mechanics in that world that's just you go to school you go to work

1523
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:21,000
there's money it's physically equivalent I think I think that's a I honestly I think

1524
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
this guy has a point but I feel like that would be my argument I mean I never really

1525
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,000
calling Delta Rune an isekai in the first place if I wanted to say that Delta Rune is

1526
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:37,000
not an isekai I think my argument would have to be that like the yeah the world that they

1527
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
go to is not even a real world it's they're like it seems like they're just making it

1528
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:48,000
up in their imagination or something yeah like magic works in the dark world and it

1529
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
doesn't work but then again I guess the world I guess the world that they go to in

1530
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Sword Art Online is not a real world it's just a computer simulation so maybe that

1531
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:05,000
argument doesn't hold any water okay is Sword Art Online even an isekai I think

1532
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:11,000
almost everyone would call it an isekai because that's like because it's about going

1533
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:17,000
from the real world to a fantasy world even if it's a video games I don't think

1534
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:24,000
yeah I feel pretty confident in calling it one I mean I'm it's interesting because

1535
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
like it's a but by that logic I guess an imaginary world also counts as another

1536
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
world yeah an imaginary world or a dream like fucking Freddy Krueger or something or

1537
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:39,000
or like Freddy Krueger an isekai is nightmare on 13 on Elm Street an isekai

1538
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:46,000
and I'm gonna say no for that one yeah so I feel like one I feel like for me

1539
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,000
the distinction needs to be the laws of physics are just different and there it's

1540
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:58,000
it's it's just could not the stuff that exists in that world could not exist in

1541
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,000
the real world which does work with Sword Art Online even though that's a video

1542
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,000
game yeah and so it's a simulation it's not literally happening it's bits and

1543
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
bytes simulating it in all of the people's brains who are hooked up to the

1544
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
machine that's playing the game so like there's there's some way to distinguish

1545
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:28,000
it but I don't know if I would hello hello no I don't know Jesus did you hear that

1546
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I heard a shouting person was that the shouter yes that's the shouter asking me is

1547
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,000
that my shopping cart no it's not my fucking shopping cart leave me alone

1548
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
this is the first this is the first time that he has that anyone has knocked on

1549
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:49,000
my window thankfully I hope it never happens again he's outside the window

1550
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
well I'm on the first floor like he's just standing in the parking lot oh okay

1551
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:03,000
yeah yeah that was that was awful I hated that I was gonna say I was gonna

1552
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:11,000
say Isekai Sword Art Online Sword Art Online oh I think our headset I think that

1553
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:16,000
a key part of the the Isekai genre is it's not enough to merely go to another

1554
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:22,000
world I think the tone has to be like it has to be like a wish fulfillment

1555
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:29,000
like wouldn't it be cool to go to this world like I mean it's all it's meant to be

1556
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:35,000
like heart huh I mean are there stories where you go to a world that sucks well

1557
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:43,000
how about Silent Hill um I feel like Silent Hill is like basically every in

1558
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Silent Hill you are a guy living in the real world and then you are transported

1559
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:52,000
to this other world where crazy shit happens which is the definition of an

1560
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Isekai but it's not an Isekai because it's not a wish fulfillment like wouldn't

1561
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
this be cool it's like oh my god it's so scary this this other world is like a

1562
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:08,000
reflection of my nightmares and guilt and that feels like an important part of the

1563
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:14,000
genre I guess I'm trying to think of like because like there's no such thing as

1564
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:20,000
an Isekai that's all good because then there's no story well it's a it's a tone

1565
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:26,000
thing if wish fulfillment obviously there will be little timmy thinking like I

1566
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
wish I could fucking use a sword and kill people and he goes to an Isekai he gets

1567
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Isekai and I'm like yes now I can do it this is great but there are challenges

1568
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:42,000
with with swords come fighting and war and it's like oh shit true though so I

1569
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
yeah okay yeah that works so it but if but if someone plays Silent Hill and they

1570
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
don't think it's scary and they think it's cool like oh I wish I were fucking

1571
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
wandering around in the fog that would be so sick that then it becomes an Isekai

1572
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:01,000
for them yeah hmm hmm but you people get transported to a new world and for

1573
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:07,000
each individual person it could be an Isekai or not depends yeah it's up to

1574
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:15,000
the individual whether it's an Isekai yeah that works for me I guess another

1575
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:23,000
thing is is the Sword Art Online being a video game as a viewer of the art the

1576
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:30,000
you know the show we're getting we can see it as an Isekai but for them they're

1577
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,000
just playing a video game like yeah when you play and VR game it like on stream

1578
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:42,000
on twitch or whatever are you getting Isekai into that video game right then

1579
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,000
when you're when you're watching someone stream on twitch no when you're streaming

1580
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
what when you're like put on the VR headset and you're in half-life Alex are

1581
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:58,000
you Isekai in that moment or is Isekai only an art form genre trope thing I

1582
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:05,000
mean I think I think the the the the boring answer is yes it's just a

1583
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:11,000
literary genre art trope thing but it's funnier to say that yes you can Isekai

1584
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
yourself in real life if you get really grossed in a game you play Minecraft for

1585
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
40 hours then you become Isekai into it absolutely 40 hours straight that is I

1586
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:29,000
choose I choose to believe that that is the case yes alright next voicemail is

1611
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:02,000
next voicemail is called interview I saw this week three two one go

1612
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:09,000
last question mr. president is there any person you just hate yes there's one

1613
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,000
person I hate his name has been saint he hosts this podcast where he's Mr. Obama

1614
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
to dozens of listeners he's contributing to the dissolution of rational discourse

1615
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,000
particularly on platforms like tiktok in my space he's the kind of leftist we

1616
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:29,000
need to fight because frankly he makes us look stupid can you tell me what show

1617
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:38,000
he on it's called digi's anime podcast what show he on mr. Obama mr. Obama with

1618
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:48,000
all due respect you're a fucking bitch sir mr. president mr. president what are

1619
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
you gonna do drone strike me what he he will he joked about he joked about

1620
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:59,000
drone strike and his daughter's boyfriend that one time so oh yeah why

1621
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:06,000
why not I guess he's gone fucking mad with power so strong even now he's

1622
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
insanely powerful he is he's just overflowing he built all of this

1623
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:17,000
drones himself he I would say with his hive mind brain I would say that he

1624
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:24,000
embodies the sexual archetype based on doing things right and on a crewing

1625
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
accruing power in the conventional way is very highly valued in the sexual

1626

1641
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:15,000
parts I have no idea hmm I've never really looked into it it could be possible

1642
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:22,000
that'd be really funny really funny if that could happen it seems it seems like

1643
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
it would be possible but I mean what the I don't fucking know anything so who

1644
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:35,000

1645
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
chest off in order to put the breast on I feel like there's so many things that go

1646
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:44,000
wrong well I mean yeah sure but I mean that's that's that's surgery for that

1647
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,000
surgery medicine it is fucking scary holy shit

1648
01:44:49,000 --> 01:45:03,000
oh okay next voicemail is called 770 is it is called it's Gines it's Gines

1649
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:13,000
3 2 1 go I want to have a similar work ethic as Trixie, Alice Jess, and Davies

1650
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Jesus so I need you guys to shame me so I don't end up going on social media every

1651
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:26,000
few minutes instead of being focused on the things that gonna make me happy in

1652
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:32,000
the long run learning and creation way better than entertainment

1653
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:40,000
right just gotta be focused on the things that will make you happy true and

1654
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:46,000
of course do is doing as I do doing as I say and not as I do in that way is very

1655
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,000
good because I am very prone to distraction and spending time on social

1656
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,000
media so I'm glad you're not taking a lesson from my actions it is somewhat

1657
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
amusing that they say Trixie, Jessie, and Davoo

1658
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
three people who have made nothing for a very long time

1659
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:07,000
three yeah three yeah like yeah I don't know what's up with that I almost don't

1660
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:13,000
I know what they mean though like the heyday but like I don't know

1661
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Davoo didn't I mean Davoo

1662
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Davoo did a lot of editing work I guess is what they're talking about

1663
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:24,000
this is stupid stupid examples but I understand the point you're trying to

1664
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:33,000
make yeah focus is good distraction is bad I am guilty of it much myself get

1665
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:40,000
cold turkey it's so easy yeah pay it like costs like I don't know 20 bucks and

1666
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
you have a program that can block you from this distractions you don't even

1667
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:49,000
need to try you just set it up so that you can't undo it and then you're like

1668
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
fuck no I can't go on Twitter how about then you forget about it after an hour

1669
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:58,000
how about you set yourself a challenge we're like okay I will I will voluntarily

1670
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,000
not go on anything that is a distraction and then the punishment you set for

1671
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
yourself is if I fail if I fail to not do the things I said I would not do then

1672
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I will force then I will have to buy cold turkey I will have to spend that $20

1673
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,000
and I don't want to spend that $20 so I'm gonna make myself not do it with will

1674
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
power and the punishment for not doing it you gotta buy cold turkey yeah I mean

1675
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
you have to do you have to follow through though if you don't follow through

1676
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,000
and buy cold turkey then then you'll never yeah if you tell yourself I will do

1677
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
this thing and then you don't follow through it you're gonna then you're

1678
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
gonna know then yourself is going to learn that you are a liar and you will

1679
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:41,000
not be held held held them responsible for the thing their promises they make

1680
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:46,000
and that's a fucking that's a road that way lies madness you'll you start you

1681
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
start you start you start dropping responsibilities like that and you

1682
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:57,000
will you will fall find yourself deep in the pit of missed opportunity so

1683
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:06,000
watch out next voicemail is called did I already put it there I think I did

1684
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
yeah the next one is the next one is called ideas five months late three two

1685
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:17,000
one go in episode 260 you talked about self-diagnosing autism and gender dysphoria

1686
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,000
coming to the conclusion that autism is probably too complicated but that gender

1687
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
dysphoria is just being sad about your gender I've got two counter ideas first

1688
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
pretty much all mental illnesses require the strange mental state to make your life

1689
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
or the life of those around you worse and for a long period of time just being

1690
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
sad about gender doesn't always meet that and secondly I think autism is a bad

1691
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
comparison talking about self-identified mental illnesses I put gender dysphoria

1692
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
in the same camps of depression and anxiety disorders having a negative

1693
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
emotional state for a long period of time so should we accept people self-diagnosis

1694
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,000
or for those conditions I don't know and have the answers discussing yourselves

1695
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,000
and by the way this isn't a defend true scum trans rights are human rights even

1696
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:04,000
without a doctor's note yeah I mean autism might not be the perfect one-to-one

1697
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:11,000
comparison I forget the conversation exactly but yeah I think if gender

1698
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
dysphoria can be self-diagnosed and it can because I mean once you feel it you're

1699
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:22,000
like oh you know I get it and then yeah really the proof is in the the

1700
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,000
transitioning and then feeling the gender euphoria when you when you do

1701
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:33,000
something completely different and then like it feels better than you would have

1702
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:38,000
expected I mean I feel like that's some sort of a proof it's like well it's like

1703
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I mean having gender dysphoria or or any I mean it's like how do you know that

1704
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:51,000
you're happy how do you know that you feel happiness well you feel it and if

1705
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,000
you feel it then you have it and I mean what what more is there to say about

1706
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:04,000
something like that autism is you know it's maybe more you may not you don't

1707
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:10,000
feel like oh I feel very autistic today you just you yeah yeah it's a completely

1708
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:17,000
it's a different beast yeah so I guess I think I agree with his point maybe

1709
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
something like depression and anxiety is more of I mean depression is like you

1710
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
know there's there's being depressed there's being the mood depressed and

1711
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,000
then there's having like depressive disorder which is like yeah I think the

1712
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:37,000
when it comes to depression I don't think most people know where the line is

1713
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:43,000
between the disorder and like feeling depressed yeah and I I feel like it

1714
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:49,000
doesn't matter most of the time hmm I think it matters in terms of treatment

1715
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:55,000
it matters in terms of like sure what what the prognosis is for your issue yeah

1716
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I mean talking about myself I've been depressed before but like I've never

1717
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
been diagnosed so I don't know whether it was like a chronic depression or

1718
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,000
whether it was depression via gender dysphoria which is lifted a little bit

1719
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:21,000
um how to know so you can you can you can you can know how you feel but you

1720
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:27,000
can't necessarily know something more like specific like you know you're if

1721
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
you have a chemical imbalance or you have like a you know an underactive

1722
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
like you know hormone receptor or something like you don't know those

1723
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,000
things those are more those are separate from the feelings that you have

1724
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:48,000
because of them right but I feel like it's a valid point okay yeah good

1725
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:54,000
next one is called the monopoly man three two one go

1726
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:02,000

1800

1802
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:14,000
okay next one is called Riley thinks Ben listens to void gazers birdstork cameo

1803
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:24,000
okay up there it is come on load okay three two one go

1804
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:46,000
so quiet I could barely hear it he said he's saying he's saying something about

1805
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,000
this part is for fans or for Ben saying and then bird says like just wait Ben

1806
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:55,000
saying and Riley says there are questions about him okay I didn't yeah I

1807
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:01,000
didn't watch the latest void gazers and I would never sit through an entire one

1808
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I did what I guess I did watch the bit I did watch the bit where they mentioned

1809
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
me because it was time stamp for me and it was like one minute long so I guess

1810
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,000
guilty as charged but I assume this is the part at the beginning of the because

1811
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
they're doing it like a Q&A section so I think this is Riley introducing the

1812
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:27,000
like the fact that they're about to do a Q&A no I'm definitely not going to listen

1813
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,000
to the rest of although I'm I'm a bit curious because I know they got questions

1814
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:36,000
about Trixie why did I pay you for a Blu-ray DVD and then you didn't give it to

1815
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,000
me for years even though you could have made it for me where are my Blu-rays

1816
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:45,000
I'm a little curious what her answer to that would be and I think she got another

1817
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,000
question about the Brony lecture too which honestly I'm not interested in that

1818
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,000
because I don't I know what she's going to say about that one well it's gone so

1819
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
it doesn't matter anymore yeah it also that yeah it doesn't matter because she

1820
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:05,000
she trashed it so oh well well okay cool thanks for the thanks for the voice clip

1821
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:17,000
next one is called $600 uploading it right now yes $600 okay three two one go

1822
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:33,000
wait what it's so quiet put your phone closer to the speaker voice Miller why

1823
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:47,000
you fucking suck so bad at this I'm sorry again yeah me too okay I think he

1824
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,000
she's saying she's saying getting Ben to make oh this must have been about the

1825
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:56,000
the Blu-rays and something about getting Ben to make cover art for the Blu-rays is

1826
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:02,000
not well I mean yeah I did say at one point in the distant distant past that

1827
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I was going to make Blu-rays but it's not like she has I don't know if she's using

1828
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,000
this as an excuse like oh I can't make the Blu-rays anymore because I would have

1829
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,000
to pay Ben Saint to make the cover art obviously that's not true and I don't

1830
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:20,000
remember what I I don't remember $600 I think I maybe asked for like maybe 200

1831
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,000
maybe like one for each of the two covers I feel like that's more like what I would

1832
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
have asked for but whatever either way it literally has no relevance at all so I

1833
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,000
don't know why it's even being mentioned but I guess this is part of the part of

1834
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:38,000
the coping and excuse making about why did I why did I Trixie the Golden Witch

1835
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:43,000
except you know hundreds and or thousands of dollars from fans for a Blu-ray

1836
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,000
that I then deliberately never fulfilled my obligations to make and I guess it's

1837
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:53,000
all that darned Ben Saint I guess I guess it's my fault that she didn't do that

1838
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:02,000
for some reason make make sense to me next voicemail is called

1839
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:09,000
