1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Starting now.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Routy.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Fuckers, top killers.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That was so bad then.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is such an inauspicious start.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The start of the new era that is

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
RCK is exclusively live action now.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm in the room with you.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm tucking your leg right now. How's it feel?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm on the inside of your leg right now. How's it feel?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Can you describe what I'm doing to you?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh my god, can I stick my finger up there?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh let's see.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You made me scream and that's bad.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's bad and rude.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Listen, we gotta start this intro right.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's by cracking open a new energy drink.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To ward off all these serpents.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I just want to say that Rockstar Exdurance

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
is one of my favorites.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And we found, we're at the store.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And we found

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the new marshmallow flavor.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Which fucks me right up.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're opening up marshmallow.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I just want to say what you said.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
All of these have the exact same caffeine level.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My worry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My worry is that it's just going to taste like cotton candy.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All these have the exact same caffeine level.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But this is exclusively the marshmallow flavor.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We want to emphasize the fact that it has

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
300 milligrams of caffeine

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
for some reason.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There's a hand.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Holding out a little crystal skull

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
from behind us.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There are various thoughts lying in the room right now.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We have to ward them off.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
By handing out some of our...

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No do this.

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We're all going to take a shot.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No wait.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't have a glass.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Whatever.

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
One, two, three.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's like nerds.

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It is very much like cotton candy.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think it just tastes like nerds.

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's bad.

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I wouldn't say it's bad.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But I don't like it as much as the cotton candy.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You know what it tastes like cream soda?

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It does.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I like it.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't like it as much as the cotton candy.

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's very low carbonated.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's very soft.

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's vegan.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sure.

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What does that mean?

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I just got a little bit of a bitter aftertaste.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm going to pour some more for the thoughts.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Dude it's vegan.

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do this.

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You gotta hang out every time.

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Drink some.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, it's for her.

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I had some.

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Are you done?

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Rockstar X-Durance.

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I really like the can design.

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's all white.

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's all start white except for the X in X-Durance.

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And the giant 300.

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
As in 300 milligrams of caffeine.

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
God.

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I love graphic design.

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why does anyone even bother with drawing or making art?

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When you can just do graphic design

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
for literally no effort and achieve 100% of the effect.

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You know what I do like?

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There are some energy drinks

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that are more of the high end variety

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
of the less just straight up.

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh we're playing cookie clear by the way.

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But that doesn't matter.

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It won't matter if the entirety of this.

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In fact we won't even commentate on it at all.

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But I like some of the energy drinks that are more like

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
soft to drink.

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The more refined, less just straight acidic

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
bubbly carbonated to hell.

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There are more like

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know if science was like that.

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I was in Michigan the other day.

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was eating onions energy drinks.

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And they were very very

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
refined drinks for like a sophisticated

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
man on the move.

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Guys you can't talk

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
when we're recording an audio only show.

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You can't just pretend as though

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the audience can't-

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I love to like that.

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You out.

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Get out.

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I totally cook gonna give cookies.

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was literally trying to get her to stop talking.

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm not kidding.

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,640
But we can't be having parallel conversations.

113
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,800
That's why I said, shh.

114
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,520
I closed that shit.

115
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,080
You can come back later.

116
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,920
No, you can't.

117
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
You can.

118
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,680
No, I think your guys are welcome.

119
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,640
I can't sustain an entire show on my own.

120
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,240
Well, I'm leaving in half an hour.

121
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,880
So I can be on the first half hour of this episode

122
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,000
and then leave.

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
Why are you leaving in half an hour?

124
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,440
Because I want to make dinner and do some work to do.

125
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,920
OK.

126
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm fucking around like you guys.

127
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,280
Listen, this isn't fucking up.

128
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,640
This is a historic moment.

129
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,200
This isn't fucking up.

130
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,680
This isn't going the wayside.

131
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,520
This isn't, you know, veering off God's path.

132
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,080
This is exactly what's in accordance with God's plan.

133
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,120
Ben, it's crazy, right?

134
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,840
God's plan?

135
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,280
Dude, I love that wisdom.

136
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm here.

137
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,080
I'm here in Boston.

138
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,240
I will be here forever.

139
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
I've moved here.

140
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
There's nothing I can do.

141
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm a surf shackled to my land.

142
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm legally bowed to my land.

143
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm not able to move away.

144
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm going to die 30 feet away from where I was born, Ben.

145
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,840
That's the system we live in.

146
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,680
That's the dream.

147
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,560
OK, how do you feel about all that?

148
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,040
Great.

149
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
Doesn't that feel like just yesterday?

150
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,080
Did you just get mad at me if you're going to college?

151
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,840
It feels like it was such a far away dream.

152
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
But now things have progressed so fast.

153
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,200
I mean, I'm just, we've, OK, PCB HQ, right,

154
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,040
talked about for like literal years.

155
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,800
I mean, depending on how you want to count it,

156
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,520
PCB HQ could be its first thought of a prelude to it.

157
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,600
It was just going to be Tom and Digi.

158
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Like 2013, 14 at latest.

159
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,480
Like fucking so, like a half a decade of the promise

160
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,720
of that kind of group of getting together.

161
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,680
Me and you, we don't give a shit about any of that.

162
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,360
No, in fact, I hate them.

163
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,600
We're RFCK and we don't need any fucking one.

164
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
We don't need anyone.

165
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,840
Let's, we're going to burn all the bridges.

166
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,560
This is going to be a repeat of Ben's stream from yesterday,

167
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,760
temporarily, late to us, however, not related to you.

168
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,920
I have no idea this is going to come out.

169
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,160
That's what I do, just shit on everyone.

170
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,600
That's my thing.

171
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,640
Everyone sucks.

172
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,840
It's, it's glorious.

173
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,280
It's literally fantastic.

174
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,240
Hey, you know who else we saw?

175
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
You know who else sucks?

176
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,080
Well, you and me.

177
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, well, the combination of, you know,

178
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,880
who else, and also who we saw in person early

179
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,400
when we were at Burning Con.

180
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,160
All of you who are listening to this, probably most of them,

181
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,920
a little bit of them, we've got such a spirit.

182
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,000
Our entire audience was there.

183
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,320
It felt like, didn't it?

184
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,200
It felt like we had like a mass of people.

185
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,160
Sit back a little bit.

186
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
You're, you're, you're noticeably louder than me.

187
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Okay. Well, then I will get back.

188
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,640
So we can fix that by just you not leaning in.

189
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
And I think it'll be fine.

190
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
Okay. It felt like at Burning Con,

191
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,960
like just a tidal wave of people showed up

192
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,120
that we're just coming over to see RFCK.

193
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,600
People I didn't genuinely believe were real.

194
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Yeah. There were a bunch of people like from all,

195
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,480
like across the spectrum of like old veterans

196
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,000
who you would like, you know, you hear the name

197
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,720
and you shudder and your ass whole quakes

198
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
and you just want to receive back in the recesses of your mind.

199
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
You're too scared of the girth and impressive mic

200
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,920
they may have and like fucking, you know, literally who's.

201
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
That's right.

202
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
And it was a great time.

203
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
It was so nice. I want to shout out.

204
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,920
I have them right here.

205
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,560
I want to give Levy Jevy a shout out

206
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,840
for giving me these sweet communist pins.

207
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,680
I haven't had a chance to wear them out in public yet,

208
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,520
but it'll happen.

209
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,200
I don't know if this is like private information,

210
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,160
but you know what? I don't care.

211
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,480
Slimehouse, which is what the Airbnb was called,

212
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,000
where all the RFCK guys hung out,

213
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,040
all the RCK fans hung out.

214
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,960
Quote unquote.

215
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,240
Quote unquote fans of quote unquote RFCK.

216
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,840
They're thinking about like moving here to Boston as well,

217
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,240
like getting a house together to live together.

218
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,400
Boy, how wacky.

219
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,880
That would be insane.

220
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,680
Like it would be insane.

221
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,240
Everything related to RCK.

222
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,880
I've said this before,

223
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,360
but my house is literally that.

224
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,920
My house was,

225
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,600
my house that I live in was formed by a bunch of guys

226
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,760
who knew each other from an internet forum.

227
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,440
RCK is just like PCP, but good.

228
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,360
That's all it is.

229
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,400
That's all it's ever been.

230
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,960
That's all that will ever be.

231
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,080
The absolute astonishing raid that has gone from like,

232
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,040
you know, just like these fans,

233
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,840
like just got so like into RCK

234
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,960
that they were able to, you know,

235
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,080
convince themselves to go across the country

236
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
and wherever they fuck they lived.

237
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,720
Go to Baltimore to go to Bronicon and to live together.

238
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,440
And now they're still like submitting

239
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
with the idea of living together

240
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,800
from like a fucking weekend.

241
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,600
They're just like actually thinking about moving here.

242
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,440
We smote them.

243
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,840
And this isn't just like a ha ha funny idea.

244
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
I mean, obviously it might not happen.

245
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,040
You know, nothing's been signed.

246
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,960
Nothing's official.

247
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,440
But like they're looking at houses.

248
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,400
They're genuine about it.

249
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
They're genuine about their interest at least.

250
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
And it's fucking crazy.

251
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,160
You leaving?

252
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,960
Oh.

253
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,800
Am I leaving the house?

254
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,480
Oh, I thought you were coming in here to say something.

255
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,920
No, I just came in to see what you were talking about.

256
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,760
Oh.

257
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,640
Do a slime house.

258
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,960
Do a slime house.

259
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,400
If you live in a hellhole and you hate it.

260
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
Yeah.

261
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,480
Then leave.

262
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,400
Then do it.

263
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,240
You have people.

264
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,280
Try just being richer.

265
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
Have you tried?

266
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,400
Have you considered picking yourself up

267
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,720
by your bootstraps, you fools?

268
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,920
Who seems like they could like support,

269
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,400
they can help support you.

270
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
Not like you're mooching off them.

271
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,760
But who seems responsible?

272
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,600
It's not your parents.

273
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,440
It's not your friends.

274
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,280
It's not your church.

275
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,120
It's AJ Xu.

276
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,960
It's AJ Xu.

277
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,800
Yeah.

278
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
You should definitely leech off of AJ.

279
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,880
It's AJ Xu up in a frame.

280
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,720
You can't get the door open.

281
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
We're screaming.

282
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,400
You can't do this.

283
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,240
Sorry.

284
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,360
You could close the door.

285
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,200
Yeah, you could.

286
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,320
Can you talk it?

287
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,160
She's going.

288
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,040
No, that's AJ Xu up in a frame.

289
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,160
I trust you.

290
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay.

291
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,560
Not me though.

292
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,400
I don't.

293
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,240
Who we trust?

294
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,080
We don't.

295
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
That's not our endorsement.

296
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,120
But it's just so crazy to think that like,

297
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,400
it's magical, right?

298
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
It's fucking magical.

299
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,600
I don't want to have any reservation, my voice.

300
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,840
I want to have anything that is an absolute hubris.

301
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,240
RFCK is like the best thing to happen to anyone.

302
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,400
To anyone's life.

303
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,600
To anyone that, it doesn't even know where RFCK is.

304
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,760
Their life's just been tangentially benefited

305
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,040
from us existing.

306
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,080
Think about all the, okay, listen.

307
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,800
People like Conman, they're going to shoot up a school.

308
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,480
Listen, they were so impressed when they met RFCK.

309
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,720
They were so like on the verge of so,

310
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,080
like they were like acceleration-ness before they

311
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,160
went to New Los Angeles to be educated and Milwaukee.

312
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
Where it's all, things have already been accelerated.

313
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,040
Yeah, it's the end of history.

314
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,520
Yeah, the philosophy is not even needed

315
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,680
because it just is the case constantly.

316
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,920
You put it into practice.

317
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,080
And we made them normal.

318
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,360
And by normal, I mean bloodthirsty,

319
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
slime-thirsty gangsters who roam the streets

320
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,160
looking for children to kill.

321
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,440
It's incredible.

322
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,280
It's incredible.

323
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,480
We've done so much good for the world.

324
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
Dude, we fucked that shit up.

325
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,160
High five.

326
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,000
Dude.

327
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
High hoof, bro.

328
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,640
It hurts.

329
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,360
It hurts me.

330
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,080
Dude, BronyCon was so cool.

331
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,920
It was pretty good.

332
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Hanging out with, you know, okay,

333
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,520
I've said before I've said it again,

334
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,920
RFCK has like the best fan base,

335
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,280
like I've ever been a part of.

336
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,000
Like, out of like, out of like, even real ones too.

337
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
I mean, a part of it is like-

338
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,400
Which I was a fan.

339
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,280
You know what?

340
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,560
How good would it be to like sit back and, you know,

341
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,800
do nothing coast on the victories of me and you, Ben,

342
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,600
and just, you know, pretend as though they have

343
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,240
some semblance of ownership to the game.

344
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,240
Oh, they populated, they talk a lot.

345
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,680
Nah, they'd be so fucking easy.

346
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,520
Sad.

347
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,360
Literally.

348
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,960
Disgusting.

349
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,160
Sounds like the life.

350
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,840
But anyway, again, I fucking, like,

351
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,080
part of the benefit of RFCK is that it's so like,

352
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,040
small of like an endeavor, right?

353
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,840
So it's like you're almost forced to like, be cool,

354
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,160
or also be expelled and cyberbullied

355
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,880
for how bad of a person you are.

356
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,680
And it's great.

357
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,280
It just breeds like, genuine people who I think are like,

358
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,840
I would actually consider my friends.

359
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,960
Be like a coffin of frame.

360
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,800
Like, I love those guys.

361
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,160
Like, I actually like them, you know?

362
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,640
They're cool and I like them.

363
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,480
So, Bronecon, like everything related to Bronecon

364
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,920
was a nightmare and I kind of like hated it

365
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,080
and it was a nightmare.

366
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,160
But like Slimehouse, just like going away from the con,

367
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,080
you know, not dealing with like whatever fucking,

368
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,360
you know, autistic shit was happening over there

369
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,400
and not having to walk around in the blistering

370
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,960
Baltimore humidity.

371
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,840
Just being able to go back to Slimehouse,

372
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,760
hang out with people, talk, you know,

373
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,080
maybe party for a day, maybe just real talk for a day.

374
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,000
It was glorious.

375
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,440
It was absolutely incredible.

376
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,480
And I've never felt so at home in a community.

377
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
And you know what?

378
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,600
It's beautiful.

379
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,160
And I'm really, I'm really ecstatic.

380
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm so happy for RFCK, like in all the ways.

381
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm so excited for the future, Ben.

382
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,280
I'm so like, we're together.

383
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,120
We're together.

384
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
We're together.

385
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
I can't believe it.

386
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,440
It's fucking gay too.

387
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,400
We've overcome like, like, listen, you know,

388
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,240
the Revolutionary War, that's like pussy shit.

389
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,360
I could do that in my fucking sleep.

390
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,560
We PSP HQ, fucking throw it in the trash.

391
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
It doesn't even matter.

392
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,520
Who do we need other than me and you?

393
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,840
Who am I gonna talk to Digi about?

394
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,680
I don't even think it's like, it works with you.

395
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,080
It sounds like a disaster.

396
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,240
Not that I wouldn't have liked him to be here,

397
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,040
but you know, other plans, you know, whatever,

398
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,880
it doesn't matter.

399
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,920
The point is, is that like RFCK is the only thing

400
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,720
that I can think of where like being in person

401
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,480
would like, like benefit in like a real way.

402
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,320
Cause you know what?

403
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,080
RFCK has always just been about like,

404
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,760
not being like, you know, overly,

405
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,800
what's the word, produced, you know, not about quality.

406
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,640
It's not about being.

407
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,960
In fact, it's about the opposite.

408
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,680
It's not about being fucking, you know,

409
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,040
all prim and proper,

410
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
and about being like a real funny less way.

411
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,400
Like, oh, ha ha, did you see that funny?

412
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,560
Did you see, wow, these cookies?

413
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,440
Well, what's the deal then?

414
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,080
Why, why, why do you, when you click a cookie,

415
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,000
do you get more cookies?

416
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,480
Ha ha, that's so strange.

417
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,040
It's about being real shit.

418
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,040
The interpretation you should have

419
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,120
is that you're literally right here next to me

420
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,280
and Ben right now.

421
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,440
And it's been a long day.

422
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,000
We've been fucking talking all day.

423
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,920
And now we're just sitting down

424
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,480
to play some video games late at night.

425
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,800
You know, the ideal circumstances of you listening

426
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
to any of these episodes is late at night,

427
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,560
you know, you want to go to bed, but like, ah,

428
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,920
but I like, I drank like a fucking bang or something

429
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,760
and I can't go to sleep.

430
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,400
Shit, I just drank a marshmallow ex-durance.

431
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,560
Oh, God, I just had, I just had a spike energy,

432
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,880
which is actually just a supplement.

433
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,840
And I'm going to puke up my 15,000 times

434
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,200
by a daily dose of vitamin B. Oh God.

435
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,720
I am, I just can't get over my disappointment

436
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,640
with marshmallow rockstar.

437
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,960
It's just not, it's just not quite there.

438
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,360
It's exactly what I feared.

439
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,120
Frankly, I think you're like, the look on your face

440
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,080
and like the sheer shock when you were at the Korean store

441
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,320
was like, there was no way I could have lived up to it.

442
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,360
No, no, it's just, there's no way.

443
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,840
The promise of the can, the promise of,

444
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,800
the promise of a can that's pure white.

445
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,240
It's like, this is like, like you thought you knew

446
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,640
rockstar ex-durance before.

447
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,320
This is a pure white can,

448
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,000
promises like the apotheosis of everything

449
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,800
that the product here too far was meant to be.

450
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,360
That's what it screams to me.

451
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,720
And I believed it, like the fool that I am.

452
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,320
You know what this is?

453
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,440
Levy Jevy, going back to Bronicon,

454
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,840
every time we go into a convenience store,

455
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,760
he would look for like a stay dead bang.

456
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,440
He would look for like a very like, you know,

457
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,680
ghostly energy drink.

458
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,520
I think this is it.

459
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,160
I think the marshmallow ex-durance.

460
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,880
Absolutely, it is white, black and red.

461
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,960
What's more stated than that?

462
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,200
It absolutely is.

463
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,480
Yeah.

464
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,720
I don't think it existed like a week and a half ago.

465
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,320
Wait, how long has it been since Bronicon?

466
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,480
Oh God, what, like a week or two?

467
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,520
God.

468
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,600
Wait, has this been over a week already?

469
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,520
Yeah, man.

470
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,360
Oh Jesus.

471
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,680
It's a 13.

472
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,280
Is it Friday the 13th?

473
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,200
Feels like it.

474
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,320
No, it's perpetually Friday the 13th, you're with us.

475
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,120
Oh, okay, okay.

476
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,960
My entire life, this is like,

477
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,680
it's gonna be like the most like first world complaint

478
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,520
like ever, like ever since I've been like,

479
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,360
I just like this summer,

480
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,240
I knew it could be like my last chance

481
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,000
to do a lot of stuff with like my friends,

482
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,080
my offline friends at home,

483
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,320
and like a lot of chance to do a lot of things.

484
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,480
You know, I'm gonna be in fucking college

485
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,880
and we put on my nose the grindstone doing that shit.

486
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,200
And like basically my last chance to do a lot of like,

487
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
even just online stuff.

488
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,320
Like, it's not like I'm quitting the PCP

489
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,160
or anything related to that,

490
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,800
but like, you know, just the mechanics of

491
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
where I'm gonna find like a place

492
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,480
where I can record and be loud,

493
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,800
not my dorm probably.

494
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,240
So I'm gonna be decreasing my internet presence.

495
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,680
So this summer is gonna be like my last message

496
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,920
of a lot of the things I have become accustomed to

497
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,640
for like literal years previous.

498
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,920
Like, you know, the ease of being able to like,

499
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,240
call out my friends whenever I want to be like,

500
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,160
hey, you wanna hang out?

501
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,400
Like I would do so much for granted

502
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,600
that like I didn't do it,

503
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,440
even though I liked my friends,

504
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,880
it was just so much of like a,

505
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,040
ah, I can do that whatever.

506
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,160
And you know what?

507
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,320
I regret it because this summer was so nice

508
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,480
because I was enforcing myself,

509
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
like do all the things that I was taking

510
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,520
for granted and not like doing.

511
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,080
And so I had so much jam-packed,

512
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,480
like action-packed fun,

513
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,080
that like my brain is like fucked right now.

514
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,280
Like it feels like, it's funny, right?

515
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,920
Because we're doing, or well,

516
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,720
things are happening in the city outside of our control.

517
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,040
And it's very strange that things seem to be progressing

518
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,960
in almost like alternative reality experience.

519
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,480
You know what I'm talking about, Ben?

520
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,520
You know, that smile that's just wrinkled

521
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,320
on your dimples and your strength.

522
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,440
You'll be a lost being.

523
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,840
I'm afraid I don't follow.

524
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,720
But anyway, and that's been like kind of going to a crawl

525
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,400
and so people will be like, oh, what,

526
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,640
what have you been doing?

527
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,080
Fucking sucking in your own dick.

528
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,280
And yet it's great you ever tried it.

529
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,560
But yeah, I've just been-

530
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,680
I don't kiss and tell.

531
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,960
I've been going all over the place with like,

532
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,800
I've just been fucking going from Milan to Minsk,

533
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,920
if you know what I'm trying to say.

534
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,280
So totally, dude.

535
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,440
We've all been there.

536
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,640
And it's been like, it's been great.

537
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,840
This is really the only way to like,

538
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,840
into something like this, like an error of your life.

539
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,160
Because for like, I don't know why I'm

540
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,440
feeling like a mile a minute right now.

541
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,880
I haven't like, been able to say anything.

542
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,840
This is fun.

543
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,120
I have nothing to say.

544
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,160
Okay, I'm just going to bounce off you

545
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,600
whenever I feel the need to.

546
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,120
You'll have to excuse my enthusiasm,

547
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,480
because I'm just fucking ripping and run right now.

548
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,800
And I'm like, I feel like not screaming,

549
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,400
because then Ben's roommates will want me to die.

550
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,480
They already do.

551
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,720
Wait, wait, Ben, why do you have an image of cough

552
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,360
on your desktop right now?

553
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,440
Oh, well, he asked me to, he said he wanted a,

554
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
what do you call it?

555
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,040
Like, he said he liked my color filter on the stream.

556
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,280
And then he was like, I want to make one like that

557
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,760
of my face, of this picture.

558
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,520
And then I was like, I'll fucking do it for him.

559
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,080
Retire.

560
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,920
But then I did.

561
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,760
And like, by the time I had done it,

562
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,160
I think it was Connor had already made him one.

563
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,840
But I think he liked mine better.

564
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Mine had a brighter pink, so get fucked Connor.

565
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,680
We should be on that guy.

566
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
We should kill that guy.

567
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,520
What was I saying?

568
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,160
Oh, my entire life proceeding this summer,

569
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,880
and I guess sort of to a lesser extent last summer,

570
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,880
but like for the past like couple of years,

571
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,040
I'm sure I've talked about this before,

572
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,280
but like after middle school,

573
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,480
some like personal shit that I don't really want

574
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,600
to discuss because I'm important to the story went down.

575
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
And I started going to online school

576
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,560
for like my high school life.

577
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,400
And it was fun.

578
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,120
It was good because I was able to like pursue

579
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,160
a lot of online stuff and I was able to become

580
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
the man that you see before me today.

581
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,120
And I don't regret a moment because you know,

582
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,840
when you regret life choices and you're like,

583
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,680
oh, I should have done this.

584
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
Ah, well, you, you would have been a different person.

585
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Well, it doesn't matter.

586
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,320
Point is, is I lit a very stationary life.

587
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,600
And in a moment, I thought it was fun and cool.

588
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,080
Because you know, I was hanging out,

589
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,480
I was rubbing shoulders with a Digi Bro

590
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,040
and it was really nice to be cool.

591
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Can you imagine?

592
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,160
And I was doing this very show

593
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,600
where I was working on this one.

594
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,440
I was doing all these sort of things.

595
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,120
And it was a gale at the time.

596
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,880
But, oh, is that a frenzy?

597
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,720
Oh.

598
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,640
Oh my God, my brain, like why even have anything

599
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
that's not this game?

600
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,040
My dopamine is just rushing through my body right now.

601
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,520
Couldn't tell you, dude.

602
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,960
I'm like pissing out dopamine.

603
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,800
I have too much of it.

604
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,240
Like it's, I'm just letting it go to waste.

605
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,960
The thing about, the thing about cookie clicker

606
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,280
is that like 100% of your cookie production

607
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,400
comes from frenzies.

608
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,240
Yeah.

609
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,120
Like everything else is stupid and doesn't matter.

610
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,160
Have you ever done, you know, cookie clicker strats?

611
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,320
Do you know any?

612
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,040
Yeah, I know that the, I'm deliberately not doing them.

613
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,960
But I know that the actual strats are download an app

614
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,520
that tells you what the most efficient next purchase is

615
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,960
and then download another app

616
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,760
that automatically makes it for you.

617
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,560
The most efficient way to play cookie clicker

618
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,880
is not to play it.

619
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,600
But, oh yeah, but I just been living such a stationary life

620
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,320
and such like a fucking like, oh, I'm in my room exclusively.

621
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,280
And that's been one of the things I want to accomplish

622
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,840
with like going away, you know, going to a new city

623
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,320
and having to deal with all the ramifications

624
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,840
of going to college and doing that.

625
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,960
It's just cause I want to like, I don't know,

626
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,560
to fucking live because I have never done it before.

627
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,280
Basically, you know, I,

628
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Ah, pathetic.

629
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,160
You, you've been, we're such a huge inspiration.

630
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,320
I mean, not just in this way, but in a lot of ways,

631
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
but it's specifically like,

632
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,040
you going on your fucking like adventures across Europe.

633
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,440
I mean, that's crazy.

634
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,080
That's crazy stuff I could have never imagined

635
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,840
before like this summer where like, I, you know,

636
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,360
I've been to more places and I've been way more independent

637
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,000
than I have, you know, in past my life.

638
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,760
It's felt so exhilarating and great.

639
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,560
And I'm now at the end of this long line of fucking God,

640
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,600
okay, all right, listen, all right, listen to this, Ben.

641
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,560
This is crazy.

642
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,240
This is crazy.

643
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,160
In 30 days, I went from San Diego to London, to San Diego,

644
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,440
to LA, to Monterey, to San Francisco, California,

645
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,040
back again to San Diego, to Baltimore, Maryland,

646
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,200
to BronyCon, to Michigan, to Boston.

647
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,440
Oh, and New York City is also in there.

648
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,880
New York, we spent like three hours in New York City.

649
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,720
That's right.

650
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,440
And we got McDonald's in Times Square.

651
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,280
And stuff like that.

652
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,120
And we smelled the track.

653
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,680
We smelled the scent of the gutter.

654
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,400
I'm so privileged that I was able to like,

655
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,560
even like afford to save up that much money

656
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,800
to do something like that.

657
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,320
And like, I was able to like, you know, be able to,

658
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,280
it's a privilege lifestyle, obviously.

659
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,760
And I'm super thankful for it.

660
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,600
And it's just such a, it's indescribable,

661
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,280
this feeling of just sheer like,

662
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,560
a crescendo of so many things that have been building up.

663
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,400
So many like ideas that have been fostering on my mind.

664
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,040
The ending of so many like things

665
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,600
that I've wanted to do online.

666
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,200
Like like this, this slime score of stuff

667
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,480
that's been going on lately.

668
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,440
You know, a lot of people are finding, you know,

669
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,280
don't really care about it.

670
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,040
And a lot of it hasn't really had the impact

671
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,920
of stuff that's happened previously in this work.

672
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,760
That's fine.

673
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,560
Cause it's something that I've wanted to do for a while.

674
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,200
It's something that I've been really like excited to do.

675
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,320
And the idea of it, it's not like over or going to be over

676
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,160
by the time I start school.

677
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,760
But like, that's like the last vestige of my old life,

678
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,400
of my old like thing that I'm gonna be doing.

679
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,640
Obviously I'm gonna keep doing it this morning.

680
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
And keep coming back over here and do R2K with them.

681
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,600
But like, I've done all these adventures,

682
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
I've done all these travels.

683
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,560
I've said goodbye to all my friends

684
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,080
that I've known all my life.

685
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,720
So goodbye to the town and the city

686
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,020
that I've known all my life.

687
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,120
I've said goodbye to all of it.

688
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,560
And I'm finishing up all the work that I've wanted to do.

689
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,240
You know, obviously there's still projects

690
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,520
I could have done, but like all the ones that, you know,

691
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,600
I actually wanted to, you know,

692
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,400
slime corporate is actually started working on this for,

693
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,160
doing all these new things I have done before.

694
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,800
I mean, just early today, even though like I'm really bad at it,

695
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,320
it's really embarrassing and sucks.

696
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,280
I've been working out with you,

697
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,080
which I've never done before in my entire life.

698
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,600
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

699
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,520
Sick and cool.

700
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,000
Should we talk about getting swole?

701
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,840
Dude, we can't.

702
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,160
Should we talk about Baramunchi?

703
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,040
We can't talk about Baramunchi,

704
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,440
but just to finish this off,

705
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,280
like now I'm away from all those trips

706
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,320
and I don't want to go on anymore.

707
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,960
I don't want to get another plane forever.

708
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,400
And I'm here in a new city.

709
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,440
I've all, like it doesn't, part of me is like,

710
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,760
it doesn't feel like anything changed.

711
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,240
You know, I've been to Boston so many times before.

712
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,040
I've been for so many extended periods.

713
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,120
I've been in this chair before,

714
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,920
doing Arpsichia live with you before,

715
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,720
but now it's just the beginning of so much more.

716
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,960
And it's so weird to say,

717
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,120
because none of the ramifications of this

718
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,720
will be felt by like the people watching this, right?

719
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,160
Like there's been so many, like in the PCP,

720
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,600
there's been so many like, oh, okay, new shifts.

721
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,720
Like, you know, Hippo has been doing his new,

722
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,280
or not new necessarily, but like been doing all the way,

723
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,320
but it feels like a new era of Hippo goodness.

724
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,360
It feels like a new like rejuvenating of things.

725
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,120
Nate's been starting his, you know,

726
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,760
he went full-time YouTube.

727
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,840
He's doing that for a while.

728
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,360
There's gonna be new things happening in the PCP right now.

729
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
And as for me as well, but like,

730
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,560
none of it is gonna be like,

731
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,000
oh, new things that you can produce.

732
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
In fact, it's gonna be like the exact opposite

733
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,560
where I'm like, no longer here, you know?

734
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,400
Hell yeah, dude.

735
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,440
Hell yeah, that's what everyone wants.

736
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,640
But yeah, you're gonna pull a Jesse, just disappear.

737
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,600
Uh, that will be kind of,

738
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,560
I don't know what to expect honestly.

739
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,840
I don't know what things will be like with my schedule,

740
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,880
because it's not like I will want to do it any less,

741
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,520
but like it will just be like,

742
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
like I can't do it almost.

743
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,720
Like, I'll be able to record with you

744
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,080
because I'm here in your house right now, right?

745
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,200
Like I can come over on certain days

746
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,720
and we can record together and we'll be fine and good.

747
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,200
But like, I'm not gonna like, like, hey, Ben,

748
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,600
I wanna be in the next PCP.

749
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,160
Can I come over with you and we record together?

750
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,240
That would be, the answer would be no.

751
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,080
Yeah, yeah.

752
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,240
Get the fuck out.

753
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,800
Oh, dude, you're watching Defuntland up there?

754
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,640
Yeah.

755
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,040
Defuntland's so good, but pull up,

756
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,320
which one are you listening?

757
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,160
This was,

758
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,160
I just kind of have the playlist going.

759
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,760
This is Disney's best coaster,

760
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,400
Space Mountain from the Earth to the Moon.

761
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,240
When did you get into Defuntland?

762
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,960
Oh, I mean, I knew about them before.

763
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,240
I mean, I've seen them before,

764
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,360
like as of probably like two years ago

765
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,880
or a year and a half ago.

766
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,360
And I don't know, I just,

767
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,040
you, that feel when you just,

768
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,440
that feel when you just need something to listen to

769
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,000
and you just listen to the entire fucking playlist

770
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,440
and then it's done and you're like,

771
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,080
well, still need something and you just start it again.

772
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,000
Defuntland, like riled up in something to me

773
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
that I had never like felt before.

774
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,760
And I got into Defuntland like when they like

775
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,880
first kind of blew up.

776
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,080
Like, I forget what video it was,

777
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,040
but there was one video that like went viral

778
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,480
and then like it was like one of the very first ones

779
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,720
and I got into it there.

780
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,280
And it was cool.

781
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,800
I feel like they've got like pretty overproduced now it is.

782
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,360
Like they're pretty like,

783
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,800
there's like a bunch of editors

784
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,880
and like there's like two writers now I think

785
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,040
and it's like a lot of like extra blow

786
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,640
and I don't think he adds anything.

787
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,160
And he's sort of just become like Wikipedia guy

788
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,960
where at the beginning I feel like he was like,

789
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,800
almost like personally enraged by a lot of them

790
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,880
as opposed to like,

791
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,080
What do you mean by enraged?

792
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,240
Tell me about that.

793
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,200
Because one of the things that I don't,

794
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,960
the thing that I don't like about it

795
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,360
is the sort of inherent way

796
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,160
that it like fetishizes commercial endeavors.

797
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,600
And sometimes I don't feel like that.

798
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,840
Sometimes it feels like he's mocking a thing

799
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,680
and I like that.

800
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,520
But sometimes he'll get like a little sentimental

801
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,960
about something being closed

802
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,520
and it makes me feel pure disgust.

803
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,320
That's the, that's where I want.

804
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
That's the reason why I want,

805
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,760
why just because like it's Disney

806
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,160
and you don't think that anyone should be,

807
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,760
you know, attached to what they create.

808
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,080
Yeah, absolutely not.

809
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,400
It's horrible.

810
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,320
Like, like these things are just inherently evil.

811
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,120
No, they're inherently evil.

812
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,160
They are. That's insane.

813
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,320
These things are like, these things are wild beasts.

814
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,280
These things are behemoths that will turn on you

815
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
and kill you in a moment

816
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
if it will profit them even a bit.

817
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,160
Hi.

818
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,560
Hey, let's go ahead.

819
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,280
Don't, I'm not here.

820
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,400
I was just...

821
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,640
No, come on.

822
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,560
You guys, you guys, come on in.

823
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,520
The one condition of you being in here

824
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,120
is no parallel conversations.

825
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,760
Yeah, that's what I was trying to avoid last time.

826
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,840
Okay.

827
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,560
But that's not, that's not to say that,

828
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,880
it's not that you can't talk.

829
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,720
Okay.

830
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
Okay, yeah.

831
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,400
No, my bag's downstairs.

832
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,240
Okay.

833
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,080
What's going on?

834
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,920
Hey.

835
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,760
We're playing cookie clicker.

836
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,600
We were talking about defunct land.

837
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,680
This guy doesn't think that there's any artistry

838
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,520
in like a theme park.

839
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,360
I didn't say it.

840
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,200
That's not what I said.

841
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,040
Yeah, you're right.

842
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,880
That's not what I said.

843
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,720
That's not what you said at all actually.

844
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,560
I didn't say there's no artistry.

845
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,400
I said that it's evil.

846
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,240
Well...

847
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,280
Oh, you want more?

848
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,120
Do you actually want more?

849
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,960
Yeah, I like it.

850
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,520
Wait, I want to see what color the liquid is.

851
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,360
Is this just clear?

852
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,200
It's clear.

853
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,400
It seems like a bunch on manufacturing, I would imagine.

854
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,240
Did you like it?

855
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,080
What do you think of it?

856
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,920
Yeah, I like it a lot.

857
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,080
I like it?

858
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
It's just that the cotton candy

859
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,840
is like the same thing, but better.

860
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,680
I don't know.

861
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,520
Does it kind of taste like

862
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,160
if you mix melon soda with grenadine?

863
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,120
I don't taste melon.

864
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,280
It kind of just tastes like cream soda.

865
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,120
No.

866
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,960
I taste it a lot.

867
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,200
Now that you say that.

868
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,040
Wait, give me a second.

869
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,000
No, it's cream soda.

870
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,040
It's just cream soda is what it is.

871
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,160
No, it's not just cream soda.

872
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,040
There's more new ones to it than that.

873
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,920
It's got a whole flavor profile

874
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,200
that you're just ignoring.

875
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,880
It tastes like something I've had before my childhood.

876
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,040
It's cream soda.

877
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,320
I just realized it's cream soda.

878
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,640
Close that door, but we can continue.

879
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,600
Oh, yeah.

880
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,680
Oh, wait, what time is it?

881
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,120
I gotta keep an eye on the time.

882
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,480
Well, I set my alarm to go off before the bus gets here

883
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,320
and before I have to leave,

884
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,160
so I can hear what time it is.

885
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,200
I have no idea what time it is.

886
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,720
Oh, it's almost 10.

887
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,640
Okay, I have to leave in a couple of minutes.

888
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,520
It's because the bus comes at 10 o'clock and I

889
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,880
have to get out of here at 10 o'clock.

890
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,280
Ben, I don't even disagree with you.

891
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,440
I need your reaction, which didn't need to happen.

892
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,680
Then I thought you were saying that you weren't.

893
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,920
Why don't you be like Neil deGrasse Tyson

894
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,360
and be purely logical?

895
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,680
It's a giant corporation.

896
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,840
It wants your money.

897
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,520
It's evil, but it's also, art's also artistic.

898
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,000
There's multiplicity in art.

899
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,680
I mean, a lot of, okay, I will stand by this

900
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,640
till the day I die.

901
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,480
And a lot of renaissance, at least.

902
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,200
I don't really know a lot about early Disney

903
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,600
and I'm sure there were a lot of varying stuff.

904
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,200
I don't really know all about Walt personally, honestly.

905
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,040
But I know for a fact that in renaissance Disney movies,

906
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,520
there was genuine passion from a lot of people

907
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,800
who genuinely wanted to create a good artistic product.

908
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,760
And I think they did it a lot of the time.

909
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,480
There was definitely, like it was not just

910
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,280
a soulless crank out for money.

911
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,920
Obviously it was obviously Eisner wanted money, obviously.

912
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,320
This is not to my point.

913
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,160
No, I know it's not.

914
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm just saying.

915
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,320
I become a profitable thing in a legit career move

916
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,200
that people's parents and family didn't ostracize them for.

917
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,400
To be an animator for many, many years

918
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,720
was just like, what the fuck are you doing?

919
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,200
Like that was like the mom on the YouTube

920
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,880
were now of like, you know, what early...

921
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,840
Did Snow White make a lot of money?

922
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,400
Oh, dude, fuck yeah, yeah, I did.

923
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,800
They went on the massive debt first, though, didn't they?

924
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,760
Well, yeah, they did it for Cinderella.

925
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,800
Or was it Sleeping BlueDee?

926
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,520
I think it might've been Sleepin' BlueDee.

927
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,840
Sleepin' BlueDee.

928
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,680
Oh wait, Google search reconorder right now.

929
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,520
No.

930
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,360
Google search recon...

931
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,400
I'll look up reconorder.

932
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,240
You leaving?

933
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,080
She's getting her problem.

934
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,320
All right.

935
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,360
The problem is not.

936
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,240
My problem is not that the artistry of these things is bad.

937
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,640
My problem is not that they are not artistically crafted.

938
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,320
My problem is that whatever else they might be,

939
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,040
they are commodified.

940
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,480
Yeah, okay, you're not wrong.

941
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,200
And I have no problem with that.

942
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,080
And I just really hate it when a little bit of...

943
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,480
I hate it when sentimentality creeps into the way that like...

944
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,360
Defunctland isn't really that guilty of it,

945
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,280
but like Company Man is way more guilty of it.

946
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,840
When sentimentality creeps into it,

947
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,880
when they're talking about a commercial venture,

948
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,440
as though we should pity or hope for the best

949
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,120
for these entities that absolutely would not do the same for us,

950
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,360
these things would fucking slit our throats for a nickel.

951
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,840
Well, okay, hold on.

952
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,720
I cave that the door is open.

953
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,560
You're right.

954
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,280
The reason I think there's a difference there

955
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,200
is not just the host of the show being different.

956
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,960
Company Man is very like...

957
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,760
Company Man is a very weird person.

958
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,640
He's a very weird host.

959
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,320
I think that...

960
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,040
I mean, I don't know about the guy personally.

961
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,680
I think that it's somewhat inevitable

962
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,800
because I feel like when you're talking...

963
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,440
You have to make an emotional arc.

964
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,200
Yeah, it has to have an emotional arc.

965
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,200
You have to make a story out of it.

966
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,240
And the protagonist of the story has to be someone

967
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,640
that you feel something for.

968
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,080
So you have to anthropomorphize these behemoths.

969
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,280
What I was going to say is exactly what I was saying earlier,

970
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,920
just about...

971
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,520
Company Man talks about a fucking target,

972
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,920
which is nothing but business.

973
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,280
It's not as though that's a controversial stance,

974
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,640
like it just is a business.

975
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
It's what it is about.

976
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,440
Cassie Snap is leaving the building.

977
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,280
Bye.

978
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,320
Sorry to interrupt your conversation.

979
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,160
That's fine.

980
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,080
If Company Man, if Defunct Land made a video

981
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,400
that was about Disney, the ups and downs of that or something,

982
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,440
about the ups and downs of Disney,

983
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,360
that would be stupid too.

984
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,200
But it's not about Disney as a company.

985
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,800
It's about these specific rides,

986
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,920
which, while the infrastructure of the music part

987
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,480
is solely a business,

988
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,760
it's like these rides, again, have artistry in them.

989
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,600
I'm not saying that you're not saying that.

990
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,600
I'm just saying that he gets attached to not like...

991
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,320
It's weird to get attached to Target

992
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,320
because what is the experience of Target?

993
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,200
Like you pay money for items that you get and then you leave.

994
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,320
But the experience of riding, especially at Disney theme park,

995
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,400
there's a lot of levels there and a lot of artistry

996
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,680
and a lot of things to appreciate in it.

997
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,080
So it's not just like,

998
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,040
I'm sad that I can't give Disney money more.

999
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,760
It's like, I'm sad that this piece of genuine history

1000
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,240
is not being preserved in any way.

1001
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,040
The experience of a roller coaster, or any museum park ride,

1002
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,040
is the exact same thing as like a stage musical,

1003
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,760
where it's so finite and limited of a thing,

1004
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,400
even more so than a stage musical because there can be the reruns.

1005
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,320
But the original production of a musical,

1006
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,920
in the same way as a music park,

1007
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,120
just happens and then leaves and gone

1008
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,600
and there's no way that even can experience it

1009
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,720
in the way it's meant to be.

1010
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,400
You can record it, but it's not the same thing.

1011
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,880
It's not the experience of being in there in the theater theater.

1012
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,160
There is something particularly tawdry to me

1013
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:44,400
about a roller coaster as a commercial object.

1014
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,400
In the way that it is like literally just a mill

1015
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,920
where people line up to be loaded into it,

1016
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,640
run through it, and then ejected,

1017
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,720
there is something like particularly...

1018
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,520
Okay, well...

1019
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,400
And I get that like, yeah, you're paying for this.

1020
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
It's about the experience.

1021
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Like, it's not the...

1022
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,080
It's not that I don't even understand the appeal.

1023
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,800
I do.

1024
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,680
There's just something...

1025
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Like, if I...

1026
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,800
Okay, I kind of want to qualify this.

1027
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,480
Like, I could probably go to a theme park,

1028
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,200
pay some money, and have a good time.

1029
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,880
I'm not saying that I'm incapable of that.

1030
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,840
I'm just saying when I see it, right?

1031
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,000
When I see it in a video of like people like,

1032
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,840
oh, look, a load of like 30 people

1033
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,000
is being loaded into this thing and chatteled around

1034
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,840
and then spat out.

1035
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,640
And then like the worker is just like sad

1036
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,920
and just like doesn't care.

1037
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,960
Then they're talking about like,

1038
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,240
oh, yeah, like fucking, you know, four million.

1039
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,400
Change this to Benson.

1040
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,360
I miss the...

1041
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,200
I miss the cookie.

1042
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,040
I'm so fucking...

1043
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,880
I miss the cookie.

1044
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,040
Change this to RFCK.

1045
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,760
Okay.

1046
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,160
Did you forget like what?

1047
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,040
I'm trying to think of something good.

1048
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Bennett goes to look at his keyboard,

1049
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,080
looks at his keyboard for like a solid second.

1050
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,440
Like his hands hovering over the keyboard,

1051
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,800
like unable to spell RFCK.

1052
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,720
Polly slime.

1053
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,000
Wow, that's...

1054
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,320
Didn't even capitalize the C, dude.

1055
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,280
Yeah, that's right.

1056
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,200
We're off-brand.

1057
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,040
That was the worst experience of my life

1058
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,760
was watching that happen.

1059
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,680
Cool.

1060
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,040
Well, you get ready for plenty more.

1061
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,200
Plenty more of that came from.

1062
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,040
Okay.

1063
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,360
I don't even like have anything to say

1064
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,200
to what you're saying,

1065
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,040
because I get it.

1066
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,400
Like I don't viscerally get it,

1067
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,080
but like there's nothing I can say to it.

1068
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,120
Keep it down a little bit.

1069
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,960
Sure, sure, sure.

1070
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,520
There's nothing I can like say to like comment

1071
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,680
in order to I really want to,

1072
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,800
because it doesn't really matter.

1073
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,840
But I will say that like,

1074
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
I feel that more worth like,

1075
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,880
the artistry and display is almost never,

1076
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,200
like in a Disney amusement park ride.

1077
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,920
You know, you're talking about artistry.

1078
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,760
I don't know.

1079
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,000
I know that like, okay,

1080
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,760
technical skill goes,

1081
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,880
I have a hard time seeing a roller coaster

1082
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,720
as a work of art.

1083
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,560
I really do.

1084
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,680
Ben, okay.

1085
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,800
I'm actually gonna say exactly that,

1086
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,760
that it's almost never a roller coaster.

1087
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,280
Imagineers, the people who make Disney rides,

1088
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,000
ha ha, funny name.

1089
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,560
We'll always say that making amusement,

1090
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,720
making roller coasters is always the hardest thing,

1091
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,640
because the experience on a roller coaster

1092
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,680
is exclusively like you go fast,

1093
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,240
and it's fun because you go fast.

1094
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,080
And there's very,

1095
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,960
like if you look at side by side,

1096
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,200
it's something like Thunder Mountain,

1097
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,560
as opposed to like another ride,

1098
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,720
like the Haunted Mansion,

1099
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,360
way less theme and way,

1100
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,400
not less effort,

1101
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,480
but like way less of like an overarching artistry.

1102
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,440
In the Haunted Mansion,

1103
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,000
it's not a go fast thing.

1104
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,760
And this is where like the sort of stuff

1105
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,840
where like Disney artistry really comes into play,

1106
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,280
because it's not just like they've spruced up the queue,

1107
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,160
and then like the roller coasters painted a different color.

1108
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,480
That's not all I'm talking about.

1109
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,160
I'm talking about how the meticulously,

1110
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,800
how they went to every step of that ride.

1111
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
That's such like a weird,

1112
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,960
like I don't describe it like multi-media ride.

1113
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,200
It starts with a walking session,

1114
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,640
and then there's like an elevator sequence.

1115
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,680
Which ride are you talking about?

1116
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,520
The Haunted Mansion.

1117
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,360
Have you been on it?

1118
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,760
Oh, I've been on the Tower of Terror.

1119
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,240
Not completely different.

1120
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,400
I'm not sure if I've been on the Haunted Mansion.

1121
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,040
I've been to Disney World a couple of times.

1122
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,000
So I feel like probably, but I don't remember.

1123
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,040
But like, it's not like a fast like thrill ride.

1124
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,920
Almost none of like the truly incredible artistic rides

1125
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,440
are usually thrill rides.

1126
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,920
Those are very hard to make.

1127
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,240
But the Haunted Mansion,

1128
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,240
just this like meticulously designed and crafted house,

1129
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,520
just even the exterior of the ride being like,

1130
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,520
like that you have to perfectly recreate.

1131
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,440
I'm not talking about Disneyland right now

1132
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,560
because I'd never been to Disney World.

1133
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,320
But like, and also it was first,

1134
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,320
the lawn that they have to maintain

1135
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,360
and like the outside, they have to perfectly met.

1136
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,160
First of all, make it fit in with the surrounding areas

1137
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,440
of New Orleans Square.

1138
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,840
The section of the park it takes place in.

1139
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,200
And then they have to make it look dilapidated inside.

1140
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,280
And they have to do all of these things

1141
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,040
in the queue, in the ride themselves.

1142
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,960
I mean, if you were to just like,

1143
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,600
Google search Haunted Mansion right now

1144
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,920
because you'll see that it is like, okay, fine.

1145
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,120
But it is like a very like,

1146
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,480
I mean, I would describe it in another way,

1147
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,040
like just meticulously crafted artistic experience

1148
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,640
that you would have to be,

1149
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,400
at least somewhat passionate making.

1150
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,240
And I know that because there's interviews with the guy

1151
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,440
who may not ever get his fucking name because he's famous.

1152
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,520
I don't disagree with any of this.

1153
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,520
I know that it's all about crafting an experience

1154
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,360
or whatever.

1155
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,320
And it's not, it's not just like,

1156
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,680
how do we make this the funnest thing?

1157
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,840
Like there's like lore.

1158
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,400
There's like heaps of fucking lore for a ton of rides.

1159
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,840
There's like genuine like, like intrigue

1160
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,000
with like the creation of rides.

1161
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,880
And there are some fucking rides that didn't get it.

1162
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,720
What do you mean?

1163
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,560
What do you mean by lore?

1164
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,400
What do you mean by there's lore?

1165
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,240
Okay, okay.

1166
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,560
Well, I mean, I know that certain rides

1167
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,920
have like a sort of narrative to them that like,

1168
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,920
you know, you're waiting in line and you see stuff.

1169
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,040
And then you get, yeah, I get that.

1170
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,600
I'm talking about like genuine fucking like,

1171
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,880
you have to like environmental gameplay

1172
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,680
if you pick up to understand some things.

1173
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,080
I'm gonna talk about one that wasn't actually made,

1174
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,920
but like was like the magnum opus of this idea.

1175
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,400
And it sort of spread to the part

1176
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,160
of the most emblematic thing.

1177
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,400
The idea of, are you trying to...

1178
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,240
Gay, yes.

1179
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,960
I'm trying to think about how to explain this.

1180
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,760
In Dingland, in Frontierland,

1181
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,560
there is a section where you can ride

1182
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,080
a big Thunder Mountain, which is a roller coaster.

1183
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,920
Is that the one?

1184
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,320
Does that end with like a water flume?

1185
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,000
It does in like, do you mean in Paris, I think?

1186
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,280
Okay, then I'm not sure if I've ridden it.

1187
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,960
I haven't been to Disney World in probably like 15 years.

1188
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,800
I've never been to a world.

1189
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,160
I want you for the bad way.

1190
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,000
Oh, I've never.

1191
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,360
Right, you're a fucking West Coast slime ball.

1192
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,720
So I'm talking about Disneyland.

1193
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,920
Yeah, I've never been to Disneyland.

1194
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,000
I've only been to Disney World.

1195
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,920
So okay, yeah, there's definitely gonna be rides

1196
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,600
you've been on that I have never been on.

1197
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,480
Oh, they would have the Haunted Mansion,

1198
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,400
but anyway, it doesn't matter.

1199
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,240
Probably.

1200
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,080
What was I fucking saying?

1201
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,760
Oh yeah, okay, Big Thunder Mountain.

1202
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,360
There was gonna be a plan, because historically,

1203
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,880
there's always been one big spot of Disneyland

1204
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,680
that has not been used.

1205
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,520
And it's always been a question like,

1206
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,360
where are they gonna put that?

1207
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,400
What kind of rides, what kind of land are they gonna put there?

1208
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,120
And so there's, I think it's Tony Baxter.

1209
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,080
No, that's an animator.

1210
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm retarded.

1211
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,760
Tell me about James Baxter.

1212
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,600
Oh yeah.

1213
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,440
God, what's this fucking,

1214
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,480
I can't remember, it doesn't matter.

1215
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,480
A famous Imagineer was going to make an entire section

1216
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,440
around Big Thunder Mountain called Big Thunder Mesa.

1217
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,760
There's gonna be a bunch of rides there

1218
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,840
that will all tie in to this one central idea

1219
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,320
of this Wild West town that would be made.

1220
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,200
And there was gonna be lore about,

1221
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,960
there was a really wealthy owner of a mine who died,

1222
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,160
and that would tie in to, I think,

1223
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,880
the Haunted Mansion in some way,

1224
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,640
or maybe it was gonna tie into Big Thunder Mountain about it.

1225
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,800
He was a spear that was compelling

1226
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,640
via the mine carts to go out of whack,

1227
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,240
and that's why they're really fast and stuff.

1228
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,640
But there was just this large, elaborate fucking section

1229
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,360
of land that was gonna be plotted out to foster

1230
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,120
this narrative of this town, this Wild West town,

1231
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,600
that was gonna be meticulously made,

1232
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,920
and just like the craftsmanship on me

1233
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,000
that would have to not only just the technical skill

1234
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,960
of achieving the rides that he wanted to,

1235
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,800
but also just like the sheer imagination

1236
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,120
that he would have to have come up with

1237
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,120
in the first place in some of the rides.

1238
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,040
There was just gonna be a whole bunch of shit

1239
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,920
that was gonna go in there.

1240
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,120
There's gonna be fucking, again, more lore.

1241
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,960
I can't write it off the top of my head, but.

1242
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,200
You're Google.

1243
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,040
Hold on.

1244
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,200
No, no Google.

1245
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,040
Okay, fine.

1246
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,640
What are you doing right now?

1247
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,160
I'm grabbing my fucking boomer pills.

1248
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,000
Boomer pills?

1249
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,840
Yeah.

1250
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,680
What?

1251
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,680
Wait, are these like memory pills?

1252
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,000
No, no.

1253
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
It's just caffeine.

1254
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,240
Oh.

1255
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
There's some right here too.

1256
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,080
Sick.

1257
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,920
Oh, is there?

1258
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,760
I mean like, okay, I'm almost out.

1259
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,600
Oh god, wait, it's a frenzy.

1260
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh my god, I gotta capitalize.

1261
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,720
I gotta capitalize on this frenzy, dude.

1262
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,680
Oh, do capitalize?

1263
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,040
This doesn't sound very insane of you.

1264
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,480
Shut the fuck up, I'll fucking kill you.

1265
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,040
I mean, I have to seize the means of this frenzy.

1266
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,520
But yeah, anyway, stuff like that,

1267
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,600
where it's like, this one guy has an idea

1268
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,120
for like an entire fucking simulated town

1269
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,560
experiencing what he wants to manufacture

1270
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,040
in this theme park with all this well-thought-out things

1271
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,400
about the people who would live there

1272
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,600
and the sort of people who would affect it

1273
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,320
over the course of it, it's like a fantasized reality.

1274
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,520
Like, okay, strip away rides,

1275
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,520
like rides not being experienced,

1276
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,760
like not being a thing that exists.

1277
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,400
Disneyland is still an artistic marvel,

1278
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,240
just the way that it uses sightlines and smells

1279
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,160
and sounds and visualizations of like,

1280
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,200
just mainstream, just mainstream USA,

1281
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,280
about this crafted experience that Disney wanted,

1282
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,360
Walt Disney wanted to make from all the things

1283
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,640
that he had experienced in his childhood,

1284
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,400
all the good vibration that he had seen

1285
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,200
living in like rural America.

1286
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,680
He wanted to bring that to this theme park

1287
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,480
and he like sculpted these fucking buildings

1288
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,600
and they look incredible and they look masterful

1289
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,120
and he used, people always like, are like, ha ha, oh dude,

1290
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,800
Disneyland uses smells, like hack your fucking brain

1291
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
and brainwash you and they're like thinking

1292
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,840
what they want you to think.

1293
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,680
And they brainwash you into thinking

1294
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,360
you're enjoying yourself, but it's just a trick.

1295
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,200
It's like, that sort of thing is genius.

1296
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,320
They're like, they're like completely crafting

1297
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,520
your actual, this isn't a video game,

1298
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,440
this isn't anything like that,

1299
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,120
you're really there in real life.

1300
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,520
There's a crafted experience, it's incredible.

1301
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,520
Yeah, I mean, you're not, you're not wrong,

1302
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,520
you're not wrong.

1303
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,520
I forget the point I was making.

1304
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,640
Yeah, I guess I love theme parks now.

1305
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,920
Me and yours point was like completely separate

1306
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,200
and it wasn't even related to one another.

1307
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,880
Yeah, it wasn't even like a discussion,

1308
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,040
it was just you said something and I said it too.

1309
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,880
I'm just like, isn't capitalism bad?

1310
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,280
And you're just like, yeah, but isn't creativity cool?

1311
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,120
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1312
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,360
I guess, maybe there's a room in this town

1313
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
for the two of us.

1314
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,400
Ha ha ha, never mind.

1315
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,560
I was watching the, you know, I said on the PCP,

1316
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,480
you weren't on this week's PCP, right?

1317
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,320
You didn't.

1318
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,160
No, I was.

1319
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,000
You were.

1320
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,840
Oh yeah, I was talking about,

1321
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,480
I was talking about defunct TV.

1322
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,800
And I said on that the defunct.

1323
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,640
Oh, I don't remember that.

1324
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,120
I brought it up, I brought it up defunct TV

1325
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,360
and I said that defunct TV is just a series

1326
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,280
about the Muppets.

1327
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Turns out I was wrong.

1328
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,880
Most of them are about the Muppets,

1329
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,920
but some of them are about other TV shows,

1330
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,440
most of which involve puppetry of some kind.

1331
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,800
I don't know if that's deliberate or just a coincidence,

1332
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,000
but, you know, it's like a good,

1333
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,960
like informative narrative about like the life

1334
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,680
and times of Jim Hansen, right?

1335
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,800
Like it's cool.

1336
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,800
Jim Hansen's pretty good, I guess, and stuff,

1337
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,120
but I just can't get over,

1338
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,680
I just can't get over that it's all funded by capital.

1339
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,080
It's all in service of capital, it makes me mad.

1340
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,320
It makes me fucking mad.

1341
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,800
Isn't that all art?

1342
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,640
Like all that?

1343
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,480
What is it?

1344
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,520
Yeah, isn't it?

1345
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,520
Like any TV show, any comic book.

1346
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,600
All art, you say.

1347
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,360
All art is funded by capital.

1348
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,880
Not literally all art, but like almost all mainstream.

1349
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,120
Commercial art, mainstream art, yeah.

1350
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:58,960
Sure.

1351
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,800
It is.

1352
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,520
And I hate mainstream art, I hate everything.

1353
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,880
Do you feel that way when some talks about like anime shows?

1354
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,320
Yes, absolutely do.

1355
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,160
I hate it.

1356
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,880
I can't fucking stand any of it.

1357
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,200
It's all fucking poison.

1358
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,000
It's all corrupt, it's all evil.

1359
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,480
It's all in service of devils.

1360
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,560
Oh poo.

1361
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,680
No, not oh poo.

1362
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,520
Oh poo.

1363
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,560
Oh Ben, why can't you just,

1364
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,000
why can't you just lighten up?

1365
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,120
Why can't you just lighten up?

1366
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,120
Just turn your brain off.

1367
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,960
Just learn to enjoy it.

1368
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,800
You don't have to turn your brain off.

1369
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,840
Yes you do, I literally feel like to ignore the fact

1370
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,920
that everything in this world is corrupt and evil.

1371
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,760
You have to turn your brain off.

1372
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,840
You don't even have to ignore it.

1373
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,920
You can think about it while you're talking about it

1374
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,680
constantly, but like it doesn't mean that it's,

1375
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,280
like the art that itself is any less valuable

1376
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,320
or that it's any less.

1377
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,400
I kind of think that it means that it's less valuable.

1378
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,720
Hot take.

1379
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,960
That's my hot take.

1380
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,560
It's just, I don't know man.

1381
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,880
Just hate everything.

1382
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,520
I can't stand it.

1383
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,040
I can't stand existing in this world anymore.

1384
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,520
Well, everything's bad.

1385
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,640
Everything's bad and corrupt.

1386
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,080
Listen, it's Cougar Clicker version, the current year.

1387
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,280
You know, I mean, this game's pretty good.

1388
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,760
Cougar Clicker is the only thing, like simulation,

1389
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,400
it's similar to being like a robber bear

1390
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,640
and like lords over the people.

1391
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,160
I'm like Mav's mind.

1392
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,200
Yeah, but I mean, it's all in good fun.

1393
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,040
You know what I'm saying?

1394
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
Everyone's gonna say there's something.

1395
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,680
Oh, oh, defunct plan.

1396
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,360
Fucking, Cougar Clicker doesn't matter.

1397
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,360
Go back to defunct plan.

1398
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,600
Go back to it right now.

1399
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,680
All right, fine.

1400
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,560
Go to the channel.

1401
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,800
What about it?

1402
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
There's a podcast that he has.

1403
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,280
I got defunct plan and I got way like fucking coolated

1404
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,560
into like the entire theme park YouTube sphere

1405
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,480
with Rob Plays and fucking Disney and Dan

1406
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,640
and yes to world like everyone.

1407
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,600
I get like, oh, people are right over there.

1408
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,200
Ha ha, that's funny.

1409
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,080
Here's the point.

1410
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,600
Here's the point, I'm trying.

1411
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,920
It's like, sure.

1412
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,840
I know that like to enjoy anything,

1413
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,120
you can't think about this stuff, right?

1414
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,040
And like by being mad,

1415
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,240
by being mad that all commercial art

1416
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,160
is created in service of capital,

1417
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,760
I am hamstringing my ability to like engage with

1418
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,080
and enjoy like most things.

1419
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:19,200
My question is, is enjoyment of those things even valuable?

1420
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,760
Is it valuable at all to be like, boy,

1421
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,600
I'd sure like to go to Disney World.

1422
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,040
Boy, I'd sure like to watch newest seasonal anime.

1423
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,760
I kind of think I'm happier

1424
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,960
just like dismissing all those things out of hand.

1425
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,600
I kind of, I don't want any of it.

1426
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,320
I don't want these things that are made to make me happy.

1427
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,360
It depends what you mean by that.

1428
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm fine, I'm fine without them.

1429
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,840
Thank you very much.

1430
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,080
It depends on what you mean by valuable.

1431
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,320
I mean, there are certainly going to be like TV shows

1432
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,120
that you would enjoy.

1433
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,200
I mean, depends on what you mean, what is it valuable?

1434
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,560
Not with my mindset, you know what I'm saying?

1435
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,200
There could be, if you were to, yeah.

1436
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,480
There could be, that it wouldn't be like,

1437
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,520
I'm trying to think about how to phrase it.

1438
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,880
Like it just, it wouldn't be a matter of like,

1439
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,240
you have to like calculate like,

1440
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,400
oh, is my enjoyment of this like equal to the morality?

1441
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,240
No, no, wait, I was-

1442
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,560
It's not even about morality.

1443
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,000
It doesn't mean, it's not even about

1444
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,840
the material consequences.

1445
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,440
Actually, I don't care, I'll just talk about it.

1446
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,800
There's a podcast that you do, Rob Plays,

1447
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,520
Kevin who runs to Funkland,

1448
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,760
which has my favorite expression

1449
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,800
of like a person, like, okay.

1450
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,360
You know that experience when you're in a group,

1451
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,080
a somewhat secluded, you know,

1452
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,480
sort of not ostracized group, but like a very niche group.

1453
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,720
And you come up with all these fanciful, funny ways

1454
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,680
to in-fight with the people who are very close to you,

1455
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,440
but just not cool and niche enough.

1456
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,040
Let this in-fight in a little bit.

1457
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,160
That's correct, yes.

1458
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,880
It had the most astounding version of that,

1459
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,800
like embodiment of that I've ever seen.

1460
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,240
Oh, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

1461
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,880
Oh, God, okay, well.

1462
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,640
I've ever seen Rob Plays and Kevin are talking about,

1463
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,840
it's a debate podcast, and they're talking about

1464
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,080
like the merit of removing rides over preserving rides

1465
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,760
and like how, you know, removing rides

1466
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,440
allows for new rides to be made, which can also be good.

1467
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,080
And Kevin's like, oh, no, you gotta keep

1468
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,120
all the history, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1469
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,360
The point of that doesn't matter.

1470
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,600
At one point, Rob, who's arguing to, you know,

1471
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,520
get rid of rides as long as new rides take its placement

1472
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,560
are also equally as good.

1473
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,680
Kevin, this is something legendary.

1474
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,520
So, Rob.

1475
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,880
Kevin is the defunct leader, Kevin Perger.

1476
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1477
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,400
So, Rob, you're not really accounting for theme

1478
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,920
in a lot of these debates, you say that just

1479
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,560
pure enjoyment is a lot of what it comes down to rides,

1480
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,080
you know, you're fine with replacing rides

1481
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,200
that may have historical, you know, thematic relevance,

1482
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,600
but you know, as long as the new rides are fun,

1483
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,440
you're fine with it.

1484
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,920
So, in a lot of ways, are you saying that you're not

1485
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,800
a theme park YouTuber, but rather an amusement park

1486
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,880
YouTuber, the employment that amusement parks are like

1487
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,480
dirt cheap e-fucks that are just like purely like four,

1488
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,120
like the enjoyment, like your brain.

1489
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,960
Hold the fuck on.

1490
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,800
Yeah.

1491
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,760
This is a, this is a lot, right?

1492
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,480
This is some galaxy brain, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1493
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,120
No, you're right, this is a lot.

1494
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,960
Yeah.

1495
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,240
I don't even know how to.

1496
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,800
Okay, no, it's so good.

1497
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,120
I guess it's so good.

1498
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,560
It makes sense, it makes sense in a weird fucked up way.

1499
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,680
Well, I have some questions.

1500
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,640
Sure.

1501
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,520
I guess I never considered it, but like.

1502
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,360
There's a difference, yeah.

1503
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,040
So I guess amusement parks and theme parks

1504
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,440
are not exactly the same thing.

1505
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,640
Okay, so is what makes a theme park, then,

1506
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,000
the fact that it has a theme?

1507
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,840
Yeah, that it has a theme that it's,

1508
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,320
and I imagine it's a very nebulous term that like

1509
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,920
the parks themselves would use very interchangeably

1510
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,360
because it doesn't really matter to them,

1511
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,120
but like on like a nerd level,

1512
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,760
like what determines a theme park is how much I think,

1513
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,840
you know, yeah, theme is put into like what it's described

1514
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,440
or what is inside of it,

1515
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,920
and also maybe the level of artistry

1516
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,680
would be sort of a nuanced way to take it.

1517
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,680
Like, for instance, Michigan's Adventure,

1518
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,280
I think no one could argue, like Google search it,

1519
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,680
is anything but an amusement park,

1520
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,200
because there's no theme to it other than the fact

1521
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,000
that I guess it's in Michigan, it is the theme.

1522
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,040
There's nothing to it, it just is a series of rides

1523
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,320
that all, you know, it just is rides,

1524
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,440
whereas Disneyland has very police of rides.

1525
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,000
I mean, so none of those...

1526
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,800
No, that's right, it's folks, right?

1527
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,320
Because they have names that have like...

1528
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,080
Some of the rides might have themes.

1529
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1530
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,200
Does the theme, does the park itself overall

1531
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,280
have to have a theme?

1532
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,200
I think it would, right?

1533
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,040
To have be a theme park, to have be a theme park.

1534
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,880
Yeah.

1535
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,960
I would have to think so.

1536
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,920
Because like, because I mean like,

1537
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,560
we go back to like the dawn of amusement parks,

1538
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,720
and I think all rides have like a name.

1539
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,560
Yeah.

1540
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,720
So I guess, I'm guessing that all theme parks

1541
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,760
are amusement parks,

1542
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,440
but not all amusement parks are theme parks.

1543
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,760
Yeah, that's a way to put it.

1544
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,120
That's a way to put it, I would think.

1545
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,800
But like, okay, the fact that he's so disparaging

1546
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,080
of amusement park YouTubers as like a lesser class.

1547
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,520
Like, they don't have to use their brain,

1548
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,360
they're intellectual,

1549
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,920
but they have all the artistry on display

1550
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,760
with theme parks.

1551
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,000
Dude, you fucking Kevin Bacon or whatever your name is,

1552
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,280
you are a mere amusement park.

1553
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,800
Like, you traffic in tawdry.

1554
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,960
You traffic in cheap disposable schlock.

1555
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,320
I am an art critique.

1556
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,640
Listen, when I go to Disneyland,

1557
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,480
I don't even ride the rides.

1558
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,120
I just spend five hours in the queue

1559
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,880
analyzing all of the various lore they've hidden

1560
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,200
in the tapestries that is the wall

1561
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,680
in Pirates of the Caribbean,

1562
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,840
that has Johnny Depp's hideous facade

1563
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,360
just etched in in stone on the side.

1564
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:35,360
Well, I smell inside the bizarre smells and perfumes

1565
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,960
that Disney puts into their rides,

1566
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,720
which entire companies have tried to profit on

1567
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,520
by selling perfumes that are scented

1568
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,640
like Disneyland wet rides.

1569
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,520
That's a real thing, look it up yours.

1570
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,080
Disneyland red wide perfumes are a real thing.

1571
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,000
That's something Jenny Nicholson would wear.

1572
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
That is pretty fucked up.

1573
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,160
And it's totally fucked up.

1574
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,440
That's pretty fucked up a little bit.

1575
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,400
It's a little bit like crazy.

1576
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,240
Yeah.

1577
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,920
But dude, it's great, right?

1578
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,400
Like, whenever I wanted to spare it to my friends,

1579
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,800
which I want to do all the time.

1580
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,640
Yeah, of course.

1581
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,880
What are friends for?

1582
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,520
You're acting like a real amusement park YouTuber right now.

1583
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,440
Like, I don't think you really have like the complexity,

1584
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,920
the clearness of thought to understand what I'm trying to do.

1585
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,920
Try appreciating nuance sometime, you fucking rude boy.

1586
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,960
Like the cool, okay, please.

1587
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,480
Make like a virgin Chad meme of like the amusement park

1588
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,440
YouTuber versus the theme park YouTuber.

1589
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,320
Like the idea of a theme park user, theme park YouTuber,

1590
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,560
be like an absolute literal like brain dead maniac

1591
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,480
who just like, I love to go fast.

1592
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,520
I like when the rides are big.

1593
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,760
I like to get flopped around on a fucking metal chair, please.

1594
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,040
Like smash cut to like a man, like a dark oak,

1595
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,040
like burning like a library in his fucking Playboy velvet

1596
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,360
of Bathrobe, you know, smoking a cigar

1597
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,840
and sipping champagne, you're like, hmm.

1598
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,040
They're updating the queue for Tower of Terror soon.

1599
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,120
I wonder who, what imagine they're going to apply to that job?

1600
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,120
Like, will the new queue videos,

1601
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,600
like will they finally shed light on like the origins

1602
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,440
of the haunting?

1603
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,440
Like when exactly did the bite of 83 take place?

1604
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,200
You know what I'm saying?

1605
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,200
Yeah, it's incredible.

1606
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,680
Boy, so.

1607
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,520
It's incredible.

1608
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,680
You may have a distinction like that for R2K fans.

1609
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,960
We didn't have like, we already have gameplay goons.

1610
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,280
So we didn't have some sort of like other equivalent

1611
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,840
for like the cultured thematic community member.

1612
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,380
Yeah.

1613
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,080
Like instead of players, it's community members, right?

1614
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,520
Where it's like dirty, filthy community members.

1615
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,380
No, no, no.

1616
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,100
Nurses players like, Oh, you just played the game, dude.

1617
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,040
You don't even engage, you aren't even inspired by like the setting.

1618
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,080
You haven't even made a contest entry?

1619
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,440
Yeah.

1620
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,620
What are you doing?

1621
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:01,040
The Virgin player in the Chad community member.

1622
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,240
Yeah.

1623
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,720
That's perfect.

1624
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,200
That's pretty good.

1625
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,200
Uh...

1626
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,700
Dude, were you talking about Jenny Nicholson just a second ago? You mentioned her.

1627
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,200
Yeah, hater.

1628
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,700
Bronycon.

1629
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,700
I've just, lately I've decided, you know what? I'm just gonna go whole hog.

1630
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,700
I don't really have-

1631
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,700
Just hate people for no reason.

1632
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:21,700
I don't really have a solid reason, but like, why mince- why- why go half ass with it?

1633
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,700
I just fuckin' hate her. I just- garbage. Terrible person.

1634
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,200
I- why? I don't- just a feeling.

1635
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:31,700
It was so funny at Bronycon. Like, there would be so many times where it's like, we would just be talking and be like,

1636
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,200
Yep. Like, I hate- I hate Impossible a lot. Just hate her.

1637
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,700
Yeah.

1638
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,200
Just like, mention it out of the blue.

1639
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,200
Yeah, and then you know what? All my preconceptions were confirmed when I actually talked to her.

1640
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,200
Dude, okay. And she was the worst.

1641
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,200
We talked about a few stories on the PC, but there were a few choice ones.

1642
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,200
Dude, let's have another frog fractions where we just dunk on Brony people.

1643
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,200
Dude, oh, that's what this is right now.

1644
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,700
Yeah.

1645
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,200
Uh, dude, okay.

1646
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Please, regale us with the story about how K.P. could try to get her- you into her discord.

1647
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,200
Because it's insane.

1648
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,200
It is insane.

1649
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,200
It is- I mean, it's not as insane as the story.

1650
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,700
It's as insane as the stuff Jesse said that she said, but I can't confirm the veracity of any of that.

1651
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,700
Well, it's not like, eventful, but just like, the gall of it.

1652
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,700
The unmitigated gall of what she's trying to like, do.

1653
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,700
It's just a shitty way of fucking being.

1654
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,700
It's- oh, oh, god. Is that a frenzy?

1655
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,700
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1656
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,200
Oh my fucking god.

1657
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,200
Dude, this is what I want. I want that temple, dude.

1658
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,200
I wanna buy that fucking temple, my other thing or my fucking-

1659
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,700
I hope it's easy to MopUp come from your floor pit.

1660
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,700
Cause I'm afraid that it's just been so-

1661
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,700
Nothing could be easier.

1662
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,700
Do it a-

1663
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,700
Do it a- or more reward.

1664
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,700
I do it for fun, honestly.

1665
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:36,780
I'm afraid I'm you're gonna have to carry this stream for a minute because I'm fucking focused on clicking as hard as I can right now

1666
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,460
That's fine. Listen, I understand the clicking frenzy

1667
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,020
But it only comes down once a moon that you may be into dude. We got the timer

1668
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,020
We've got more than half of this frenzy. I'm gonna get the temple dude

1669
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:47,900
I'm gonna get the fucking temple.

1670
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,500
The burning hole is so great because it was able to just like be so like it

1671
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,300
It was almost refreshing and a bizarre like twisted sense

1672
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:02,700
Which is like the human brain loves to have like like adversaries because if you don't have like a goal like something to

1673
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:09,260
Like do or people to hate then like your brain doesn't know what to do and it feels like bliss like oh enjoy me like just pure pleasure

1674
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:16,140
There's something wrong here. I'm not I'm not nature right now doesn't sound yeah. No. Thank you. Wait wait straight

1675
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:22,060
Yeah, so like it was a bizarre pleasure being around people who you hate like exclusively

1676
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,980
It was a weird like wow like it's a me against society

1677
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:33,900
It's me against the entirety of everyone around me right now. Okay frenzy's over. I can I can discuss

1678
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,820
It was it was weird just being around like

1679
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:43,140
Just a sea of just insane people insane people's only can describe it. Um, oh yeah, kpk

1680
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,500
So all right, so we're it's like the very end of the con

1681
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:52,900
This is like right before closing ceremonies and we're just kind of making one last walk around the the vendors hall and we walk by

1682
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:58,340
Some table somewhere and kp is there just packing up stuff

1683
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,140
And uh, I don't want to talk to her

1684
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,140
nothing

1685
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,620
There's nothing I would less rather do

1686
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,460
Um, but hippos like I'm gonna go say hi

1687
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:15,220
So he just goes up walks up to her. I'm pretty sure he reckoned. She I'm almost positive. No, no she did she did

1688
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:22,020
Yeah, yeah. Um, so, uh, and he says hi and she she like she turns to our group right me and uh, I think

1689
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,740
Kazi was there. I think was me Kazi and hippo

1690
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,860
I don't remember but she turns to like our whole group and she's after hippo says hi and she's like, oh, hey guys

1691
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:34,180
You want to buy anything last minute? Which is you know, yeah fair fair question

1692
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,700
And I think we're just like no we're we're no we're just you know

1693
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:44,420
Just saying hi or whatever and she's and she's just like uh jumps right to uh, are you guys in the fan discord?

1694
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,420
You should join the fan discord like

1695
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:52,020
Not doesn't even want to talk to us. Just wants to shill her fucking fan discord

1696
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,340
This is why this is why I knew it was a bad idea to engage

1697
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,660
And maybe it was I don't know. I know I know it's not a big deal

1698
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:07,540
But it's just like uh fuck this person. It well, it's a very like weird and like presumptuous thing

1699
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,060
like

1700
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:12,900
Oh, no, you know, I I think it's possible that in her in her mind like

1701
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:19,220
The horseshoe crew and then you just like don't really matter don't really factor into her perception of humanity

1702
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,740
Why would we yeah, sure

1703
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:25,460
And so I think to her probably just like, you know, just another person just like oh, hey

1704
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:30,900
You're you're someone who would be at brony con. Okay. Okay. Watch my stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I understand all that

1705
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:36,740
But like the fact that like that's her fucking thing. Well, it's bad. Yeah. It's bad. Yeah, it's yeah

1706
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:41,620
I'm not gonna excuse you because oh, well, like I'm just a peon. I'm not an I'm not an important person

1707
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:45,220
So why would I expect her to fucking engage with me like a human being? Sure

1708
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,740
It's fucked up man. It is fucked up. Dude. I cannot believe

1709
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,820
The disrespect that brony con dealt to us. We didn't get a panel

1710
00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:00,020
Everyone treated us like we were fighting too big. I wasn't surprised. I wasn't surprised to not get a panel

1711
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:03,220
Except that all the panels that I did see were such shit

1712
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:10,980
And but like they were like literally who it's weak shit, man. I don't understand like why were these people allowed

1713
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,980
To to exist. Why were they allowed to present their vision?

1714
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,140
What's fucking lame we could we you know what we could have done it

1715
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,820
Straber milk would have made the first public appearance since the frog fraction

1716
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,260
I mean

1717
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,420
I do you think maybe someone just dropped the ball like maybe someone meant to get back to you and then just like

1718
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:33,140
Okay, I wonder sometimes but like like I did like send multiple emails

1719
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,660
But I wonder if like I should just like really just fucking like

1720
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,300
Pressed into them if that would have done anything like

1721
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:46,260
If I just really should have just like stuck with it and just been like, hey, we're still here. Please respond to us

1722
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,540
I mean

1723
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:52,420
Surely someone would have read it and like well, I mean I'm sure there's someone already did read it and like you know

1724
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,740
I mean, you know, maybe persistence does

1725
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:01,380
Make the heart you'll find something is different sometimes being persistent like that can can get results

1726
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:08,340
I mean, maybe it's possible that someone did in in fact intend for us to have a panel and we just slipped through the crags

1727
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,380
I don't know. It's weird. It's really weird

1728
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:17,460
Dude, you know who we did meet though was past analysis. How crazy is that like that guy?

1729
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:22,100
I mean, is that really that surprising he was there? Well, okay, not surprising that he was there

1730
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,940
But from my perspective, it was and he like mentioned like he like

1731
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:31,460
Like played into this weird interpretation. I had with events and he also had it which was funny

1732
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,620
I did not really talk to him at all. I just kind of sat high to him once or twice

1733
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,700
Uh, it was funny these last

1734
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:44,500
To quote wreck it Ralph from that one uh commercial where where they couldn't hire jc riley

1735
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,940
To actually like a rip fries his role of a right Ralph

1736
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:52,420
So just some random guy who didn't sound like wreck it Ralph to quote him last we spoke

1737
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,540
Uh, me and past analysis were on like equal footing. He like far more

1738
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:03,380
Culturally relevant in everyone's mind's eye than I am what back in the pony dance back in the pony days

1739
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,020
Where me and we and me and him were both like, you know

1740
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:13,140
Jokey and Lee referred to as the horseshoe crew CMC, you know, we were like just peripheral wait. Were you was that a thing?

1741
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,940
That was a that was a real thing. Yeah, I totally forgot about that

1742
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:21,940
Yeah, the real thing it was funny and me and him were on like, you know, just equal footing in that regard and then like

1743
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:29,780
We like I see him now and I'm it's so desensitized to that idea of like, you know, it's just it's just it's just those guys

1744
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,580
It's just the pcp who would even care

1745
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,820
That's right. That's correct. And then he and then like one of the first things is

1746
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:42,180
Everyone on one of the first things like, you know, we're talking and he's like so like how would you get in the pcp?

1747
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,580
Like how'd you do like, what was your strat bro? How'd you do it? How'd you do it?

1748
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:53,380
I was just persistent and they had no standards. That's right. There's no trick to it. You just have to keep doing it

1749
01:02:54,820 --> 01:03:00,500
There's nothing that they know is really no trick. Well, I'm gonna piss but I want to talk about how weird I am

1750
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:05,940
Oh god, am I gonna have to carry it? Yeah, you're gonna have to do some work actually

1751
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,420
I don't have any energy. I've sapped all my I was I told you I was already fucking

1752
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:16,740
At zero energy before we we lifted and now we've lifted here. Oh my god. Is that a frenzy?

1753
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,500
No, it's a bunch of you talk about how good your deals are from Aldi and how they

1754
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,740
Dude, Aldi's got the best fucking deal on

1755
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:29,540
Here's my here's my here's the here are the things viewers that are the best deal at Aldi that I buy

1756
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,300
heavy cream

1757
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,660
cauliflower

1758
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:33,780
sausage

1759
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,820
bacon

1760
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,420
gridlock energy

1761
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,700
avocados

1762
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:38,900
chicken breast

1763
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,340
ground flags

1764
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,340
and mayonnaise

1765
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:46,100
Now on the contrary here are the things that are the best deal from costco

1766
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:50,420
And the theme of these is generally that like things you can buy in like big bulk, right?

1767
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,300
Like things that you get in like a large amount at a time

1768
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,900
So peanut butter get like two of the big jars like

1769
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:03,060
Tape together in like a fucking a lot of things from costco or like two containers taped together

1770
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,980
This is sort of a thing. This is true of peanut butter and the second thing on the list

1771
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,700
mozzarella bags of shredded mozzarella also big blocks of cheddar

1772
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,140
bags of almonds and my favorite almond flour

1773
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,820
Which is what I used to make my legendary keto pizza

1774
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,660
Which everyone agrees is the best on the block and then finally

1775
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,900
The things you can get from

1776
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,220
Wegmans, which are the best deal the list is short

1777
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,980
francs

1778
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,580
And pepperoni now the pepperoni is the best deal because they sell these

1779
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:36,020
Giant ass bags of it and all this is is um

1780
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,300
In terms of like cost per unit cost per volume, right?

1781
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,660
So pepperoni Wegmans you think costco would do it, but they don't

1782
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:46,740
Wegman sells the biggest cheapest bags of pepperoni by volume the francs

1783
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,740
They sell these this this kind of hot dog called bar s

1784
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:57,060
At Wegmans and they are dog shit. They actually have they have carbs in them. I don't know why they're fucking made with like

1785
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:02,580
They're made with some sort of like wheat germ fucking runoff or something. I don't know they're crap, but they are the cheapest

1786
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,780
It's like a buck 20 for a packet of hot dogs great deal

1787
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,940
But they're a little too carby

1788
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:12,980
They have there's an all beef variety, but those aren't as cheap and it's a fucking tragedy. Hey munchie. You're back

1789
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:17,300
I'm back. Did you just feel it just get about how could your deals are now you mapped out?

1790
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,780
I was just I was just informing. Yeah, I'm reading off

1791
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:23,380
I have a list pinned to my wall of like what the best deals are and where to get them

1792
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,700
Is that wf Whole Foods?

1793
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:29,940
Yeah, and and nothing is not yeah, I am because

1794
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:36,660
Okay, well because I was laying it all out. Yeah thinking that maybe some things would be a better deal at Whole Foods

1795
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:41,620
No, no, no, nothing. Nothing. Whole Foods, dude. Yeah. No, absolutely. Oh, that's so

1796
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:49,860
It's so funny that like you have these like well populated columns like very like like meticulously like Wegmans is a little sparse

1797
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:53,700
Sure, but whatever the point is that you've like gone like really troubled like like perfectly

1798
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:59,700
Calculate all of like these like the best deals at like a variety of stores and there's one column for Whole Foods

1799
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:05,140
Which just is completely empty. You know what the killer though is what the killer is that um

1800
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,580
Like a lot of the margin on some of these things

1801
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:13,460
Like on Costco, it's generally worth it. But like on like Aldi and Wegmans

1802
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,940
Aldi's looks so good

1803
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:21,860
If I'm like if I'm going there in person like if I'm taking the bus and not just ordering it on instacart

1804
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,980
Some of the margins are so small that like literally the bus fare offsets it and doesn't fucking matter

1805
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:31,140
Yeah, but if I'm or but generally these days I order it with instacart

1806
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,660
So whatever I'll save like a couple of bucks. I'll save a couple of bucks instacart

1807
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:39,780
I gotta get on that shit instacart is really great. It's it costs like 90 dollars a year

1808
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,340
for like free delivery

1809
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:49,300
And like that in terms of like time saved that absolutely pays for itself as far as I wait how much for your 90 dollars

1810
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:54,260
That's nothing bro. Yeah, no just in terms of fucking bus fare on like a year

1811
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,460
Yeah, that's crazy for a whole year. I mean

1812
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:01,140
You got to tip the driver. I mean you don't have to tip the driver

1813
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,660
But you should probably tip the driver at least a couple bucks. So it's not

1814
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,060
Okay, I trip for a while

1815
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:12,660
I wasn't tipping the driver and then I realized that these are fucking poor people in that like this is the

1816
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:18,580
You know, this is just fucking uber for groceries. This is like a fuck these people don't get benefits

1817
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:24,740
They are being this is like exploits. This is absolute. This is the worst kind of exploitation of labor and I was like

1818
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:29,620
If anyone deserves it these people probably fucking deserve a tip

1819
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:33,940
So I fucking so I tip them like they're recommended two dollars or whatever. It's not much. I don't know whatever

1820
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:35,860
so I pay that

1821
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,620
and then

1822
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,780
You know a fucking but other than that

1823
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:43,140
It's totally worth it. It's totally I mean a company like this

1824
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:48,100
I'm sure it lives and dies on people that like sign up for the service and then forget that they have it

1825
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:55,060
It's like a gym, right? Like gyms don't want you to use their services gyms want you to sign up for a membership and then stop going

1826
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,780
Yeah, that's there is actually that's what costco does too

1827
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,300
Oh

1828
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:04,660
Maybe the best thing about instacart is that they just have people with costco memberships that will shop at costco for you

1829
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,580
You don't have like the thing about costco

1830
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:12,340
You need a bizarre like membership card. They costco makes all its money on memberships

1831
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,100
They don't make money selling their products

1832
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:19,060
So now you can just go you can get someone else to go in there and buy your shit for cheap

1833
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,540
And you don't have to buy the membership like fuck you

1834
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,100
Oh, do you want to talk about this?

1835
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:30,020
Oh, sure. Yeah, dude. Oh my god. Okay. I I I just as I always do when ben's rallying off about god knows what

1836
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:34,420
I did my mind started to wander. Yeah. Yeah, my mind starts to wander. I just started looking around just how I just upgraded milk

1837
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:39,620
Dude, my milk just turned chocolate. Oh my god. Wow, ben. I'm so impressed. Fuck. Yeah. You want me to dunk the cookie?

1838
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:42,260
Dude, hell, yeah, I oh god

1839
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:50,180
Uh, that's fucking ridiculous and stupid. Did you get an achievement for it? Achievement unlocked cookie dunker

1840
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,700
That's insane. Yeah, right. I just literally is

1841
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:59,700
I started picking up things on his desk and once we see what a tiny little beautiful pen

1842
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:07,300
Of infinite jest. Yeah, the very one that vincent was holding. That's right. Vapors two. Do you want to tell me what's going on with this

1843
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,860
Pen? That's the pen for the Vapors two Kickstarter

1844
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:14,740
What there's going to be a kickstarter for Vapors two. I love that show

1845
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:18,820
I've I've been saying I've been every now and then I'll say like, oh, yeah, it's gonna happen soon

1846
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:23,780
It's gonna happen soon. I'm really trying to actually make it happen. Like actually soon like, um, I wrote

1847
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:29,700
I need the thing that I need to do is I need to write the vaporettes because I I need some fucking guest content

1848
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:33,620
And uh, I was writing I wrote half a script. Uh, yesterday

1849
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:38,420
Yeah, I'm hopefully after this is done. I want to try and finish writing that script before I go to bed

1850
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,060
Uh, mm-hmm

1851
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:43,380
Two things. Okay. First of all

1852
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:46,340
Vaporettes, you'll see some more art from me. Yeah, probably less

1853
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,540
Long, but if you liked my last one, then you're finally like this one too. And obviously Vapors. I mean

1854
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,420
You did go above and beyond and draw a lot of pages

1855
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,940
I mean, I would welcome as much as possible because like

1856
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:03,220
The thing about Vapors two is that it's actually quite a bit shorter than than uh

1857
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:11,380
This grandma's name is patreona and she's 101 years old. Well, they all have a they all have names. What the fuck?

1858
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:14,740
Yeah, I did not know that this one's name is dan heinous peanut

1859
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:21,620
Miss mischievous miss mischievous. Yeah. Yeah. Mima ivy. Okay. This is new. I didn't know about this

1860
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:22,980
Looky, looky, looky

1861
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:28,900
Frenzy. Oh my god. I can't talk about my business. I can't talk about the art that I created. Oh guys have to click

1862
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,980
I have to make I have to click things too

1863
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,220
Oh my fucking god

1864
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:38,740
But yeah, um, you know, all just as you were saying only poor

1865
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:45,140
Exploited, you know uber drivers and instacart workers all those poorer people with foreign accents and

1866
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,900
Fuck them hate them. Have got to go the fuck back to wherever it is

1867
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:54,740
They've all come over fresh on the boat from old country and they all start panning your door when the bin sing the vapor

1868
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,740
I need bin sing vapor god. I just wish they would go back to old country already

1869
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:01,940
I back in the old country. We do not have bin sing the vapor

1870
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:08,020
We cannot get that when will you release new bin sing vapor? Well, you motherfuckers you fucking foreigners get ready

1871
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,340
For this shit. It's gonna be so dude

1872
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:15,460
I I think you posted it in either on twitter or in the pcb chat or somewhere

1873
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,460
The the new cover

1874
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:23,540
Yeah, I posted it. I made a tweet where I showed the two books side to side back next week. Do you have the prototype?

1875
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,100
Yeah, you want to see it?

1876
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:31,780
This frenzy's almost over. Okay. Oh my god, dude. Hell. Yeah, I want to see that

1877
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:37,540
Yeah, I'm gonna I want to go out and like take some like funny pictures with it or something

1878
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,060
Um, it's gonna be pretty good

1879
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:44,340
I was thinking like a picture of it in a trash can the way that infinite jest winds up in a trash can spoilers

1880
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,060
Wow

1881
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:57,700
Let's watch this has red bin sing the vapor at least oh my god, it's beautiful. Yeah looks pretty oh my god

1882
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,660
Well, actually the language pretty inconsistent actually it's the first one. So yeah, so it's pretty bad

1883
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:07,220
Is it inconsistent? Well, it's just a different widths. Uh, simply well, I guess

1884
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,900
Uh, no, frankly, I don't see what you're talking about

1885
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:16,100
You have to but you'll have you'll have to buy the comic books and judge. Yeah judge for yourself

1886
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,580
I I thought this was the back cover for there. I'm gonna be really honestly. I should have

1887
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:26,580
It's a for the viewers at home. It's a flyer for the cablam. Which is just the printing service

1888
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:31,620
Um, I probably should have done that because they will like take money off. Okay

1889
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:36,820
Okay, so the thing about there's a lot of like filler pages in there that are just one page repeated over and over again

1890
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:40,740
Just to sort of make it because it's gonna be full of like guest content. Um

1891
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,620
Look at that

1892
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:49,300
Yeah, you should definitely go from a thing with like just flipping through these. This is so funny. Who made this?

1893
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:52,260
Uh, the artist's name is fennel ketanurix

1894
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:59,220
That person made a vaporite, which they all are probably aware of. Yeah, it's the one with the sword. Yeah, and um, it's just

1895
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:03,940
Be careful. Be careful. Be very ginger. Be very ginger. It's just that repeat from many a page

1896
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:09,700
It's just like a third of the book is just that page over into that one page vaporite over and over again

1897
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:14,820
Is this the same is this repeat from the this forward? Yeah. Yeah the forward is it's yeah

1898
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,860
What's it like trying to print something?

1899
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,260
um

1900
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:25,140
Stressful it's stressful. Just like getting everything. Um

1901
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,500
Because like to give you templates and it's it's stressful

1902
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,860
Just like getting all your pages like sorted and like

1903
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:37,940
Converted to the right file type and at the right resolution and like it's really stressful like before you send it in

1904
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:40,180
It's like, oh, did I did I do it all right? Like did I

1905
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:45,460
Did I have the pages all in order is like did I did I switch anything around to something upside down?

1906
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:49,380
It's actually kind of a nightmare for a pro tub like this. How much is it running out?

1907
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:55,220
Oh, just for the one. Yeah, I think it was like $11. Oh, that's that's not bad. No, no

1908
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,740
um

1909
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,540
And of course like it's cheaper the more you print. Yeah

1910
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:02,100
specific specifically the kablam

1911
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:07,860
Gives you a price break at like 500 dude. Well right here. It's just one one one. It's $11. Oh my god

1912
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:15,140
I didn't even realize it's $11 and 11 cents. That's crazy. Yeah, does that include shipping? Yeah, cool. Okay

1913
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,740
Yeah, well, there's there's the answer to your question. I guess that's insane

1914
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:21,380
Pretty good. I can't do it. Oh my god

1915
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:25,940
You've you've got such a you've got such an empire below your feet

1916
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:31,380
Then you've got such a like a wealth of comics and stuff that you're able to like print out with these cool ass

1917
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:38,420
Fucking four fans for for a hardcore vape heads vape heads to declubber up dude. This is fucking sick

1918
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:40,500
You're gonna sign them again. Yeah

1919
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:45,860
Oh, yeah, sure. I'll offer sign copies again. Uh, definitely probably at the same same. I'm just I'm

1920
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:50,020
I'm gonna just do it like it's gonna be the exact same as the last one

1921
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:56,420
But there's gonna be like additional options for if like you also want to get like the the original and you want to get like

1922
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:01,380
You know the the the book or the pin from the first one like that'll be available

1923
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,380
It's like a bundle thing if you want both

1924
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:09,140
If you missed it the first time or whatever and it's actually kind of um

1925
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:13,780
It's just kind of confusing trying to think of like price points and like how much should I

1926
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,740
God okay

1927
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:22,020
Picking picking how much deciding how much something should cost is horrible. You ever done it?

1928
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,700
No, basically never. It sucks. It's like you there's there's no there's no right answer

1929
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:31,300
You can't like look it up. You can't google like how much should I charge for this?

1930
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,860
There's like there's nothing to go on except got feeling

1931
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:37,940
Like you don't want to like overcharge because you don't want to fuck over your people

1932
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,700
And also it won't even sell that much

1933
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:43,300
Also, you want to undersell these, you know, it's your work and you don't want to fucking just you know

1934
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,820
Yeah

1935
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:49,380
Yeah, I mean the last Kickstarter was pretty successful. So I'm just gonna copy

1936
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:55,300
I'm just gonna copy over the prices from that pretty much. I feel like don't fix what isn't broken sure

1937
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:57,940
Now

1938
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:01,140
If we could talk business for a second here, I'm interested because

1939
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,340
I've always thought that the champion

1940
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:07,460
Makes the most sense as like you're sort of like

1941
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:09,460
Main

1942
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:15,460
Thing that you that you say like yes, I've been saying I'm making this web comic called the champion. It's very

1943
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,340
Good, but also kind of I don't know. She is

1944
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:26,420
Easily accessible because sort of mainstream in a way very like a lot of why that's sort of why I started doing it because I was like

1945
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,180
You know, I should think of a story that maybe has a little more obvious appeal

1946
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:34,900
Where's my fucking jewel dog? What did you do? Did you pocket it?

1947
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,980
Uh, I know you've always no, I know you've always coveted my jewel

1948
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:47,780
Wait, hold on. Oh god, what's this fucking fucking cookie? Okay, it's just the lucky. That's fine. Uh, your phone's over there. Uh

1949
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:54,180
You know the cotton the cotton I can't I can't I can't work like this look. I can't work under these jeweless conditions. Okay

1950
01:16:55,300 --> 01:17:00,900
I probably just like put it down behind here here sniff this been. Oh sniff a pen. Yeah sniff a pen

1951
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:05,380
That's that'll get me there quick. Look at me there. You know, look at me split

1952
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:11,940
Here here smoke this bro. Just just put this in your room. What happens all the time? I offered him a battery for those

1953
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,300
Uh, this happens every fucking day

1954
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:19,380
But I stand up and I look at the ground and I think where's my jewel

1955
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:25,940
I didn't I haven't left the right here right here. Oh, dude. Oh dropped it when I was uh going for the copy

1956
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:30,660
What was I talking about? I bet would you have the champion being more mainstream? Yeah. Yeah. I listen Ben

1957
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:35,700
Yeah, okay. So I just please lay out to me. Yep. What do you do right now?

1958
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,980
And this isn't like a oh, why aren't you making comments like like literally like I wanted this

1959
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:43,780
It ties into more things like so you do your comics. You do your streams. What else?

1960
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:46,660
What else would you consider like a thing that you do? Um

1961
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:53,140
Lately I've been I've actually been spending a lot of time like fucking around with um

1962
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:56,580
pins like rfc cape that for the like

1963
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,460
I've been I I've

1964
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,780
I sort of spent a long time

1965
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:06,580
Kind of fucking around with a slime coin design to make it to try and like get it

1966
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:07,780
You know

1967
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:10,900
Because like you can't fit too many fine details into a pin design

1968
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,700
So I've been like reducing the amount of detail to sort of make it more

1969
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,860
Ben if there's one thing that you do that is your greatest folly

1970
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:21,620
When you're making merch you get way fucking like

1971
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:25,540
Too into it and like yeah, that's you like

1972
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:30,500
Fucked around with like the shirts a lot with I spent like a week and a half

1973
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:34,500
Yeah, just fucking around with like the shirts in the storefronts. Yeah, I did um

1974
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:41,060
Kind of insane. Yeah, it was stupid. Well what I meant more broadly was just like what could you consider your ongoing products?

1975
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:45,620
They have right now. I don't know would you consider like pin making one of your main projects? I wouldn't think so

1976
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:51,220
Not a main project. That's not a thing that I'm planning to do for a long time. Sure. Well, okay, but your ongoing work

1977
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:58,820
Oh, I'm scattered. I feel it's I'm scattered and this is like my big problem is that I um, I can't I don't focus on one thing and I'm kind of

1978
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:01,140
Oh, okay

1979
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:06,740
Well, well, I was back to doing beast capades for a hot minute there, but then brony con happens

1980
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:10,980
I came back. I had sort of lost focus on it now what I mean

1981
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,980
I'm gonna go back to beast capades what I'm

1982
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:17,380
Okay, I'll tell you right at this very moment what I'm trying to focus on is getting the scripts done

1983
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:23,060
For the vapor ads and then starting up the vapors to Kickstarter and then while that's running

1984
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:26,740
I'm going to go back to doing beast capades. You misunderstand what I mean and

1985
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,900
Maybe easy to do so

1986
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:34,020
Specifically, like I don't like I don't mean like like like a to-do list of what you're like. Oh, I'm gonna do this

1987
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,220
This in this order

1988
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:40,100
I must have checked out this before on like an other rfck or maybe on a pcp or maybe just people in general

1989
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:46,180
But I think what has helped me so much with like work ethic is like

1990
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:51,860
Getting a clear sense of what I want to do like not just like what I'm going to do like oh tomorrow

1991
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:56,580
I work on this tomorrow. I work on this it will be just like like a list of all my

1992
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:04,580
Projects that genuinely care about and all the other bullshit can be just swept to the side because I'm focusing my efforts on like seriously like

1993
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,660
two or three

1994
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:10,580
Projects match. I can have like a little bit of like, you know, maybe a little bit extra

1995
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:16,980
You know side projects here and there but like my mind is focused upon a very small set of things

1996
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:19,460
And I want to because it does seem like you're very scattered

1997
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:23,140
You kind of like there's a lot of things that you want to do in various different like way

1998
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:26,740
You know to different levels of interest to you and your audience

1999
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:30,260
But I want to know I don't want to know like what you're going to do tomorrow

2000
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,660
I want to know like what do you in your mind? I was like screaming for some reason

2001
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:38,420
What do you in your mind think of as like your projects?

2002
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:43,620
What like to like if someone were to ask you what do you all do Ben? What like what do you do?

2003
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:48,900
It'd be I mean from my feel like you could probably answer this question

2004
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,940
I could probably answer this for you, but I think this is that complicated

2005
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,100
It's not common, but it's a helpful exercise

2006
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:58,660
I think too like maybe you might want to reduce things in order to become more focused on the stuff

2007
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:03,060
Because it seems like you are indeed scared so from my perspective as someone who doesn't you know

2008
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,620
Who follows your patreon?

2009
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:10,660
It was a pretty you know active into it you do your comics in sort of a you know

2010
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,380
Whatever suits your fancy at the moment

2011
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:18,420
Bases, you know it kind of bounced back and forth from a lot of things you do your comics you do streams

2012
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:24,740
And then I do do the stream and and then it gets kind of muddy where it's like you kind of make videos

2013
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,420
I guess

2014
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:28,420
I haven't thought yeah, I was gonna

2015
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:32,260
Oh, I said I was gonna make another video at some point

2016
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,540
I said I was gonna make a video that was gonna own the cuck servatives

2017
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,180
and I still

2018
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:43,140
And I would kind of still like to do that, but I sort of lost my nerve halfway through making it

2019
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:48,500
And like wasn't sure what I wanted the tone to be and just put it aside and never picked it back up again

2020
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,500
Uh, I don't know. I'm not thinking about videos these days

2021
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:57,620
Okay, so I mean that that's where it sort of gets my words like there's a lot of like things that you could do

2022
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:02,980
And there's a lot of like, you know like things you have done before but like what matters to you right now

2023
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:06,420
You know like what like what are the things that you want to like push as thing you're doing?

2024
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,540
Because you know

2025
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:12,660
Is it just streams and comics is that where you want to put all I don't want to push my streams like I that's not a

2026
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,620
That's not like that's not like something to like

2027
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:20,100
base my brand on but think about them. They're the most consistent things that you make

2028
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,460
And the most frequent

2029
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,340
And maybe the thing that people consume the longest

2030
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,060
uh

2031
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:30,580
Yeah, and

2032
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:34,020
I mean just because you know, like I'm just saying that they are like a big

2033
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:38,740
Part I mean in a lot of people's minds everything. I mean, there are a lot of my mind when I think about what does Ben do?

2034
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:44,980
Well, I know he streams a lot. I stream like once a week. Well, I mean very consistent. I mean, it's not bad

2035
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,580
It's not like oh, it's just streamer like I mean that kind of seems bad

2036
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,860
Like that's my goal is not to be a streamer. Well

2037
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:56,020
I mean, I mean part-time occasional like it's

2038
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,580
I mean, that's fine and all

2039
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,700
No

2040
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,660
That twitch is just a thing that I do on the side

2041
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:07,780
It's in no way is it meant to be like my main thing or even a main thing

2042
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,500
um

2043
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,660
So so there so there

2044
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:17,220
So there you have it. So it's all just you you just want to exclusively do comics

2045
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:19,140
I

2046
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,940
Wanted my main. Yeah, I wanted my main thing to be comics. Yeah

2047
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,540
um

2048
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:29,380
You say want it. Well, I feel like I haven't followed through on that but you know

2049
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:34,740
That's why like when you ask me like what do I want to do the answer is well one

2050
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:38,020
Vapors to Kickstarter then Biscuits

2051
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,220
After that, um

2052
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:46,420
Fuck I gotta buy this temple after that, um probably

2053
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:49,220
Uh

2054
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:51,380
I mean

2055
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:53,380
We'd have to see champion

2056
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,860
Yeah, I mean

2057
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:59,540
Biscuits will probably take a little while to finish like a couple months

2058
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:06,980
Um, so like I mean I could change my mind, but yeah, I guess tentatively the plan after finishing Biscuits would be go back to doing champion

2059
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:13,220
Hmm. Okay. Okay. Would there ever be a scenario

2060
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,100
under which like

2061
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:18,900
You release champion

2062
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,620
And it's not as though it's like

2063
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:26,580
You are switching off between vapors and bcpades and champion

2064
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:32,900
And then you release all all of three of those at like, you know in big chunks aside from basically is obviously which is you know

2065
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:37,620
More flea throwing there would be a scenario where it's like I could like say hey my friend ben

2066
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:43,140
He does the web account called the champion. He releases like every two weeks or something like a new page or something

2067
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:45,860
Every two a page every two weeks

2068
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:50,420
Uh, yes, would would you ever consider that as a thing you do? Yeah, yeah

2069
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:53,540
I kind of want to like finish Biscuits

2070
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:56,420
I don't have any like

2071
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:58,820
I don't have any like, um

2072
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:05,620
I think I've told you this before I don't have like a vapors for in my head. Yes, you have so

2073
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:08,260
Yeah, I guess the idea is like

2074
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:12,740
You know, I'll I'll keep like, you know kick starting like the physical prints of my old stuff

2075
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:17,540
But that's like kind of it's its own thing in terms of like what I'm actively working on

2076
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:24,340
Uh, I would finish Biscuits and then it would just be champion would basically be it unless like

2077
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,660
Something were to strike me and I was like, okay

2078
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:32,500
I want to take a break from this and like maybe go back for a minute and do another champion or another vapors thing

2079
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,180
but like

2080
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:36,180
Yeah, my my my end goal is

2081
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:41,860
To work on the champion. My end goal is to make the champion the thing that I do. Yeah. Yeah

2082
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,340
That's that that's that's good. I'm happy about that

2083
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:50,260
I feel that's I've always wanted maybe maybe the audience wouldn't feel the same way

2084
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:56,260
Where it's just a very clear idea of like what you're trying to push is like the thing that you do

2085
01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:00,980
You've been very you're but you've been a very renaissance man. I think that's even really a problem. It's just a very

2086
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:05,380
I mean you were you started like the Winnie the Pooh series and that was like the height of like

2087
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:07,620
Okay, like what is been saying

2088
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,620
Like what's going on here? Yeah, um

2089
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:17,860
Not even that they were bad. Like I just I just like I thought it would I thought it would get a big audience and it didn't

2090
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,900
um

2091
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,900
I don't

2092
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:27,300
I mean I think I mean my goal. I mean I want to grow my audience. That's what I that's what I want

2093
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:33,300
I mean, I think the way you do that in the way that would be best for you is just to yeah

2094
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:40,820
Just have like a main flagship comic series and you probably you know, no, you're probably right. No, no, you're you're right

2095
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:43,140
You're probably right about that. It's hard

2096
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:48,340
Uh, I don't know. I mean I want to you know, you see you got to try new things, right?

2097
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:50,980
Find out what works for you. I don't know

2098
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:54,340
Biscopades was like very different in tone and like

2099
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:58,420
I mean Maryweather tells me that like you gotta

2100
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,780
Like people are reading comics online. You got to do them

2101
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:06,980
You got to do comics in like webtoon format and like I think he's not wrong

2102
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,300
um

2103
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,300
I don't

2104
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:17,700
I sort of feel hopeless when I think about webtoons like when I think about like building an audience on like

2105
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:22,340
To pastic or or well, I mean to I think to pastic's dying but like um

2106
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:27,780
Webtoon or something that's just sort of feels like so Sisyphean and like I'm so behind on it

2107
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:30,500
Like it'll just never happen. I don't know. It's also like very like

2108
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:37,140
New and different from what you're doing, right? So it's very like it's sort of a new paradigm and like you would have to

2109
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:40,100
Maybe like not change like the core of what you're doing at all

2110
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:45,380
But like, you know, there'd be a lot of stuff like structural changes you have to make like it'd be like it's literally like a different format

2111
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,420
Literally like the images are displayed in a different way. Yeah

2112
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,180
but like

2113
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,300
I don't know

2114
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,300
I mean

2115
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:56,260
Honestly, it's probably just better in every way

2116
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:59,300
like formatting a page is kind of

2117
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,780
a hassle

2118
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:03,620
like fitting panels

2119
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,620
like webtoon you just fucking just

2120
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:10,500
Draw it one after another top to bottom like don't even worry about it. And I mean

2121
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:16,580
That's not I mean you can get creative with the layout of a webtoon. You like you absolutely can do that. Um

2122
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,540
Uh, you know

2123
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,940
It would kind of suck to not be able to make books

2124
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,660
People like books

2125
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:33,140
Do they like books so much that it's not that it's worth hamstringing your online audience? I mean

2126
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,260
Maybe but probably not. Yeah

2127
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:44,900
I don't know like I'm not I don't I don't I'm not a purist or I'm not a

2128
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:49,060
I'm not married to any particular format. I think I've said this before

2129
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,700
I'll fucking I don't know

2130
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:53,700
It's sort of I mean the world

2131
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:59,220
It's sort of weird to think like oh chapter one of the champion would be entirely in like this page form

2132
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:03,300
And then like the rest would be in this like non-page like webtoon form, but like

2133
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:12,100
Who gives a shit? Yeah. Yeah, I don't think that would attract like anyone. I don't think it would fucking be a big deal really

2134
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:13,460
Mm-hmm

2135
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:15,060
People would probably

2136
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,060
If if everything worked out

2137
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:22,420
Well, and then like it got really popular or something then like people would just say like oh, yeah

2138
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:26,500
The first chapters in this really shitty format that like is really annoying to read

2139
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:29,460
But then it gets but then he fixes it

2140
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,420
Which like, okay, that's fine

2141
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:38,420
I mean at least there would be at that point there would be people who like are into it in that new way

2142
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,580
That's that's what matters, you know, yeah

2143
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:46,660
Um, it's it's in such a funny predicament that I'm in because it like on a whole lot of these are

2144
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:51,060
These on all of these rfck's it's always me asking you like what are you doing?

2145
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:54,820
And then the obvious question is like what am I doing? It's funny because it's like

2146
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:01,540
A secret what I'm doing to only the people listening to this way podcast. Is it a secret? Well

2147
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:07,060
No, what I mean by that is like to describe in detail what I'm working on right now

2148
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:10,660
Would be to give away the surprise of what's happening

2149
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:13,860
Like in the game in oh

2150
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:17,620
Oh, I understand. I understand what you're saying. Yeah

2151
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:22,660
So it's like it's it's in a funny like fucked scenario where it's like

2152
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:25,460
Like

2153
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:32,020
All of today I would like really ride very passionately about a thing that will be released and like a new sort of

2154
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,420
section of

2155
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:39,300
The slime corp stuff that'll be released soon and like I want to talk about it

2156
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:44,980
But it's also like well like I'm only hurting the people who it's for like on the pcb

2157
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:49,380
It might even be different where it's like I would talk about like more general kind of broad details

2158
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:54,420
But like it would only be like bad for like the people who this

2159
01:30:55,140 --> 01:31:01,060
Show is targeted to and like that these are the people that you want it to be a secret from

2160
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:04,420
Exactly. Yeah, sure. And like I'm like

2161
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:11,620
I mean everyone maybe probably scoff because you know, I have been so inactive lately because of the month

2162
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:16,180
I've just had but like I mean you've been you've really had a lot of real life stuff going on

2163
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:20,180
Yeah, like genuinely you've had like you just moved across the country and all that

2164
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:25,460
Oh, well, they don't care about that. All they know is that they aren't getting I care about that. I understand

2165
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,860
I understand

2166
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,660
But yeah, it's it's just like funny

2167
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:35,060
Because I'm like exclusively working on like in this war as like the thing that I do now

2168
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:38,100
Which is cool and great and like I'm excited about it

2169
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:42,260
But it's also like, you know, I had kind of weird to talk about I had the kind of in like awkward

2170
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:47,460
I hate I hate this. I kind of hate talking about this. I kind of have to stop doing that because it

2171
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:51,780
Wasn't making me money. Yeah, nobody was like and the people that were

2172
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:57,380
The people that were giving me money on patreon like that wasn't what they were doing it for and like

2173
01:31:57,860 --> 01:32:01,380
My patreon has dipped a bit and it really

2174
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:06,660
Man, I don't know how to say that I want to sound I want to say this as diplomatically as possible

2175
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,900
It really stresses me out

2176
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:12,180
I don't want to say this in a way that's like you you viewer

2177
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:16,260
You person who maybe someone unpatriated me who's listening right now

2178
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,900
And I don't want to say like fuck you

2179
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:24,900
What's your problem? It's fine. I'm grateful that you ever supported me at all

2180
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:29,540
But like oh man the fact that it's going down really fucking gives me the fear

2181
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,180
Yeah, you know what I mean. Yeah

2182
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,140
Yeah, it's

2183
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:38,100
I mean we were talking about this like off air talking about like

2184
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:44,740
Monetizing writer first coplers and we both agree that like it first and foremost is like an art project that we just like I mean

2185
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:46,340
like

2186
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:49,860
I think going back to the start we wouldn't like stop doing our

2187
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:55,780
In this war knowing that it would make money. I mean obviously we would try and make it so that it does but like

2188
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:00,660
We're really happy with the way that it's turned out. We don't want to like gouge out anyone

2189
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,060
But also is a consideration that like, you know

2190
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:08,820
With you and with me we're both going to have like me like with school and you just now

2191
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:13,540
Are going to have things that are like far more demand our attention that like have more like

2192
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:19,780
Not just like even the monetary rewards, but just like are maybe even just more fulfilling in a lot of ways

2193
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:24,260
And it's like how can we justify doing endless war in some circumstances?

2194
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:31,460
And I'll always like you can because like it makes so little money and like, you know, it's kind of like slimy

2195
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:35,060
It's a little bit gross a little bit dirty to talk about but like, you know

2196
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:42,820
We do it anyway because we care and we like it a lot. I don't think anyone could like question our like interest in it

2197
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:46,500
I mean in the beginning. I mean you were just going fucking crazy

2198
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:51,620
I mean you would dedicate your entire life to doing this for uh pretty pretty much

2199
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:57,300
Yeah, and me with all the recent story arcs and all the updates and stuff. I mean

2200
01:33:58,820 --> 01:34:05,700
It's it's we love endless. All right, but it just is like wrong for us to do so

2201
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,460
like

2202
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:14,420
We've got a no sort of pragmatic sense. Yeah, like like we've gotten no benefit from it. I mean

2203
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:20,900
Yeah, I mean a lot of the time people seem to just like hate it like at least I don't know how

2204
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:24,020
Well, okay, I mean

2205
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:31,220
Your your volume like gradually creeps up so occasionally I'm gonna be like hey you crept up creep it down

2206
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:33,940
We gotta wind down by like I have to leave soon

2207
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:38,420
Oh, do you have a time limit? Yeah, I do it feels like we just started it's in two minutes

2208
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,140
Really? Yeah

2209
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,900
Don't worry guys, this is gonna happen way more often. Let's just like just do this like again

2210
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:48,180
Like why not just like the part this is part one of a thing

2211
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:53,380
Why no part two will come back. Okay. Well next time we'll have the dramatic conclusion. Will

2212
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,100
Will I be able to afford a wizard tower?

2213
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,980
Find out next time. I just want to say that like

2214
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:01,380
Oh god, what was I fucking talking about? I was thinking about oh

2215
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:08,020
For me like I come in and the game just feels like everyone is like unhappy with like everything that's happened

2216
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:11,940
Oh, I mean, yeah, it was always like yeah, honestly, I feel like it's less like that now

2217
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:14,420
I mean there were there were like crises points were like

2218
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:19,620
I mean you remember you remember the times when the game was just completely broken

2219
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:26,580
And like especially in the in the beginning this this this really weighed on crack. I think like all the like that there was a lot of

2220
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:32,340
Criticism there was a lot of like oh this this part of the game sucks like this part of the game is not good

2221
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:36,180
Uh, and like I mean it was probably mostly true

2222
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:43,300
Uh, I mean, you know, it's it's perpetually a work. I don't think that anyone was like wrong for doing so

2223
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:45,300
You know, I kind of like

2224
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:47,620
That it is sort of a little bit janky

2225
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:53,140
Oh, that's not well. Yes, but that's not what I was gonna say. I really kind of like that it has become

2226
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:58,500
Something that is sort of not like open source, but something that like a lot of people work on

2227
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:04,580
Yeah, that it's like the creation of the game itself has sort of become like a community project in a way. Yeah

2228
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,740
Yeah, I

2229
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:08,260
That's just

2230
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:10,420
I think that's great. That's like what

2231
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:13,460
That kind of feels like how it should be

2232
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:17,140
What is that? Oh, it's a cat's millionaire or something. Oh

2233
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,380
weird

2234
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:22,340
Yeah, fuck fuck you. I guess uh

2235
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:27,140
What what are you gonna get it's cat's millionaire? Nothing. Okay. I don't care

2236
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,140
uh

2237
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:31,780
But yeah, it's it's it's funny because it's like

2238
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:33,860
A

2239
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:35,860
Hot stove top that I really love

2240
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:39,540
Like I love like like I love

2241
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:45,940
Endless war in all ways the setting like the game itself and the community around it

2242
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:51,620
I love it and then like I I wake up in the morning and I go to I check the discord messages

2243
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:56,660
It's all people saying that the game sucks and they hate me personally and I'm like, yeah, I love this

2244
01:36:56,740 --> 01:37:02,100
And then she's my big counter and she's plummeting just going just nowhere because I'm spending all my time working on this war

2245
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:07,940
I'm like, yeah, I love this and it's just like it's so funny of a particular event to be in because like I'm not gonna stop

2246
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:14,420
I mean even in college like I think the one thing that it will continue to do is be in endless war because I just love it so much

2247
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,380
But it's like so like, you know

2248
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:20,580
It's not like

2249
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:24,420
It's not good for me pragmatically as you said. This is um, this is I've been

2250
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:27,220
Yeah, I mean, um

2251
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:30,020
He's been been stressing lately about

2252
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,420
feeling like I'm

2253
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:36,580
Going nowhere in life. Dude. Okay an endless endless as much as I love endless sports

2254
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:42,340
I don't want to say it's going nowhere. It's not going it's going places. But like is it where is it taking me? Yeah

2255
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:46,260
You know, I mean, I mean, that's the whole reason. I mean

2256
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,500
been like

2257
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:56,100
Metaphorically and like literally in a long ways can't afford to be the non absentee father he used to be, you know

2258
01:37:56,420 --> 01:38:01,460
It's not a matter of like he doesn't care dude. Okay, bin. I'm just gonna fucking suck your dick for a second here

2259
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:04,180
Please

2260
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:06,580
Wait, where's the next one?

2261
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,740
Where's

2262
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:13,300
Oh, this whatever keep going cookie chains dog shit. Okay, uh, it

2263
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,700
Oh

2264
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:21,220
People will always like fucking like oh ben's never here. Ha ha ha. It's like fucking bad for the game. Whatever. Yeah, okay

2265
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:24,020
Ha ha very easy for you to say this motherfucker

2266
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:30,740
It's not a matter of interest level because he'll spend so much time just fiddly around with the most useless shit

2267
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:34,260
About pens and he like styles his own

2268
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:40,020
Personal stream to be that of endless wars aesthetic. He awfully cares about it

2269
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:46,260
When it's when it's endless war related like when i'm doing when i'm drawing slime wards or or drawing like doing the cop killer

2270
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:51,140
Top killers image. Yeah, I fucking make it and and he gets into it and you obviously fucking care

2271
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:53,460
I spend so long. I spend like

2272
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:58,900
A long time just fucking around with color filters. I don't know. There's something really compelling about it to me

2273
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:05,780
This I should have just been a graphic designer because like fucking around like fucking around with images and like fucking around with color filters and stuff

2274
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:06,740
is like

2275
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:08,740
Really fun and gratifying

2276
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:11,060
It's so like

2277
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:14,020
Obviously the passion is there from both of us

2278
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:21,140
And it's like you specifically like you love endless war so much and I sure do

2279
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:26,820
Have you seen my walls? Yeah. Yeah, dude. Okay, right now. I'm looking at a flag of new los angeles city like the city fight

2280
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:30,420
And I turn around and I see the giant cop killer flag and I look over the side see the

2281
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:35,540
I gave it to you at rfckcon one like this in this war like city image that I made

2282
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,180
And it's just like all around here is endless more stuff

2283
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,340
It's just a matter of like

2284
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:44,420
It doesn't benefit you in like a living way. You know

2285
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:51,940
Like you need to live you've always been like a person living on like the fucking edge in a way margins of society. Yeah, like it's so like

2286
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:56,340
We love it so much and yet it hurts so so it's it's it's

2287
01:39:56,980 --> 01:40:04,340
It's our prodigal son. But anyway, you gotta go. I gotta go. You gotta down the rest of that marshmallow rocks our ex-durance

2288
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,500
Oh, you done I

2289
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,380
All right, dude, well, I guess I'm gonna end the stream then okay

2290
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:13,220
I'm ending the stream

2291
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:15,860
I'm ending this dude. Look at look how slimy this is this is pretty slimy

2292
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:22,660
This is this will either be like one big video or like several small ones. We'll see whatever see you soon. Fuck off
