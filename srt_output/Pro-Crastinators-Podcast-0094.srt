1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,600
Welcome everybody to the PCP!

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,480
Guys, it's time we addressed the elephant in the room.

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Which one?

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
Dumbo.

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
Get out of here, Dumbo.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,480
Your film was racist.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,480
That's the best guy I ever joined.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,480
They won't pay me back the $20 I lent you to go to fucking five guys.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
You messed up my order.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,480
This is the last time I'm trusting your Dumbo.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,480
Go back to Anthrocon Dumbo, you piece of shit.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Joining us today is the best guy I ever.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Hello.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
That's me.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
We've got Tommy Oliver.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Yo.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,480
We've got The Hippocrit.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
Snort.

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Ben Sain.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
Um, I am Pickle Rick.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,480
And Munchy.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Watashi wa Munchy, seksu no tegesu.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
It's a fucking full house.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,480
It's six whole motherfuckers here to talk about PCPHQ.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,480
The myth, the mythical legend that people have been like, like strung along hearing about for years.

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,480
And they're just like wondering when the fuck it's coming.

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,480
It's spoken about in hushed language around the campfire in the wee hours of the morn.

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Wondering what is it?

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
When is it coming?

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
Is it even real?

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Well, folks, today we're going to reveal all.

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
I've been really excited to talk about this topic for a while.

33
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Like it's no secret that the PCP has been like a cagey mess recently.

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
And I really want to try and be open as possible.

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Like that's my leader agenda.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
That's my unique unit.

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
The no bullshitter.

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,480
Plus 15 combat strength.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
We're not being a little bitch.

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
That's me.

41
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
No, no, guys, this is all great.

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,480
But we have to say, first of all, this episode is coming out in the context of when this comes out.

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,480
We are two weeks into our current Radcom 3 Arena Kickstarter.

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Everybody, please, this is the most important thing.

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,480
If you're a patron, you know, and you only got so much money, allocate those funds to the Kickstarter because we need that thing to go.

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Oh, man.

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,480
They have a Red Cross like a mini prototype of everything we're going to discuss here.

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
Indeed.

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
That's right.

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,480
All y'all need to say is if you pledge $50, you get a t-shirt.

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
That's right.

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
It's a good t-shirt.

53
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
That was enough to get.

54
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
It's going to be a dope t-shirt.

55
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Don't pledge too many, though, because then I have to make all of them by hand.

56
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Oh, no.

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm a weak-willed little boy.

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
He's weaving.

59
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,480
But they'll be handcrafted with love each and every one of them.

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Put Tom to work, everybody.

61
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,480
And they will all be a randomized, like, still from the gift that is the logo of Armour Tree.

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
But you see, this is a beautiful thing to make.

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
That's great.

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,480
The first Radcon had, like, a static logo.

65
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,480
And then Radcon 2, we had everybody make logos because we couldn't decide on one.

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,480
And now we have kind of encapsulated our one logo is many logos.

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
It's self-contained.

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,480
It is actually pretty cool that all the, you know, you don't know which one of the colors

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
you're going to get.

70
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,480
But the way you said it is, like, the t-shirt will have a randomized gift on it.

71
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
It just sounded so terrible.

72
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
It's got an LCD screen.

73
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Well, we're all going to have one, right?

74
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Absolutely.

75
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,480
So if you want to match the cool kids and fit in with their click, you know, like, if you're

76
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,480
one of those kids who, when you're at school, you see all the skater kids and so you just

77
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,480
start dressing like a skater kid so they'll talk to you, like, you know, just saying,

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
wear a Radcon shirt around us.

79
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
There's a good chance you're going to start a conversation.

80
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
You know, when you walk into the high school lunch room and you see all those dark emo

81
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,480
kids sitting alone in their own table and you think, what are they fucking conjuring

82
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
over there?

83
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
They must be up to something special.

84
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480
That's what you're going to look like if you wear these t-shirts.

85
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,480
You may have come to Anthrocon alone and friendless every year up to this point in your life,

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,480
but if you strut in there wearing a Radcon 3 t-shirt, let me just say your life's going

87
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
to change.

88
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
That's all I'm going to say.

89
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,480
For those who don't know, Radcon is a gathering of us.

90
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,480
If you didn't understand, we didn't mention that at all.

91
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Everybody, please click the link to the Kickstarter.

92
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
There's a link in the description to the Kickstarter.

93
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Read everything.

94
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
It's big.

95
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
It's going to be exciting.

96
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
We've done Radcon 1 and 2, of course.

97
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
It's great.

98
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
This is extremely linked to HQ.

99
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,480
And everybody on this episode right now is going to be there.

100
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,480
I love our advertising method of, like, pretending we're extremely desperate but in, like, a

101
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
skeevy.

102
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Like, we're all trying to, like, jokingly manipulate people into buying the shirts.

103
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
That's the advertising strategy.

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Isn't that how advertising works in general?

105
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
It's all about manipulation.

106
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
But we're showing them our cards.

107
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
We're showing them the method.

108
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
You hit them in the brain and you hit them in the heart.

109
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
You play all fronts.

110
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
That's what a PZPR is like so far.

111
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
It's just a skeevy monster mix.

112
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
That's all that we are in it.

113
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Talking about.

114
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,480
It's the worst parts of real-life advertising and internet advertising combined into an amorphous

115
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
beast.

116
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Hey, can we talk about the actual fucking reason we're doing this episode today?

117
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Can we actually talk about the actual...

118
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
What are you doing?

119
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
The Urban Dictionary definition of PCPHQ.

120
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
I'm doing it right now.

121
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
I'm doing it right now.

122
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
It's loading.

123
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
It's loading.

124
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
I did actually find that already.

125
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,480
A place that seems to get further and further away as human scientific knowledge improves.

126
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,480
About 100 years ago, PCPHQ was right above our heads.

127
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Humans started flying airplanes.

128
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
It wasn't there.

129
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
So it moved right above the atmosphere.

130
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Finally, we send people in the outer space into the moon.

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
It wasn't there either.

132
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,480
So now PCPHQ is past Pluto somewhere.

133
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
What is this?

134
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Where did you get that?

135
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
We gotta get there.

136
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Yeah, we gotta get there.

137
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
That's what fucking Radcon's about.

138
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,480
We gotta send space probes there to get PCPHQ.

139
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,480
I also looked up, just for other people out there, alternate definitions.

140
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
First of all, here's the definition of PCP.

141
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Oh, oh boy.

142
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Human as angel dust, probably the scariest of all drugs, was used as a horse tranquilizer.

143
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Makes the user hallucinate because it's extremely violent and not feel anything.

144
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Which is what the PCP does.

145
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,480
I gotta say that it's a little ironic that we would name our show after what initially

146
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
started as a horse tranquilizer.

147
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Oh my god.

148
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Oh shit.

149
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Holy shit.

150
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
How has this connection ever been?

151
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
It ended in that GIF.

152
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Now listen to this.

153
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,480
People have known, have been known to do horrible things to the Selms while under the influence

154
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
of PCP.

155
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Do not use PCP.

156
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Do not.

157
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
It will ruin your life.

158
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Head over to the Kickstarter to fund Radcon.

159
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Things like not go to college.

160
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Here's another PCPHQ definition.

161
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,480
A fiery place as overcrowded with jihadists and terrorists besides the traditional politicians,

162
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,480
tax fugitives, bankers, traders, lawyers, and CEOs.

163
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
That's Radcon.

164
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
That's Radcon.

165
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Three years before.

166
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Real talk.

167
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Real talk.

168
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,480
How unlikely do you think it is for a PCP fan to get a college degree?

169
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,480
What do you think they beat over under?

170
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
I know.

171
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,480
I know they're out there doing their studies.

172
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,480
I feel like we encourage people to drop out on this show.

173
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
We do.

174
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,480
If someone asked me about college, I would absolutely tell them not to go unless they're

175
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
going into a certain specific field.

176
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Yeah.

177
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,480
I would never tell anyone to not go to college.

178
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm very consistent on this point.

179
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Have a plan.

180
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Whatever you want to do.

181
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
I know, man.

182
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
If you need to go to college, then do it.

183
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
If you need to go to college, then do it.

184
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,480
The numbers prove that it's increasingly a waste of time and money.

185
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Well, then do the not.

186
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,480
I've been real hard on college a lot in my life.

187
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
Recently, I've started to rethink that.

188
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,480
I think I've wasted my entire life doing this instead of actually going to college and

189
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
getting a degree.

190
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,480
I've been keeping myself every single night for that for the past two months.

191
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,480
We're forgetting the real reason we don't want anybody who watches the PCP to go to

192
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
college.

193
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
What is that money instead to fund PCPHQ?

194
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
PCPHQ.

195
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
That's right.

196
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,080
Now, I got one last thing here, guys.

197
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,480
Listen to the definition of just the word headquarters from Urban Dictionary, aka HQ.

198
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
One, a central place for a group or organization.

199
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
That's number one.

200
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,480
And number two, slang for PC shop where people play World of Warcraft, Dota, and other gay

201
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
ass games.

202
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Dude.

203
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
That's what it says.

204
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
I can't wait.

205
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
That's exactly it.

206
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
That was the plan all along.

207
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
That's what we're going to do.

208
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Your definitions are what we want the PCPHQ to be and what it's inevitably going to devolve

209
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
into.

210
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
All right, guys.

211
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Let's get into it.

212
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,880
Let's talk about the basic broad concepts.

213
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,380
What is the PCPHQ?

214
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
Let's start there.

215
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,480
For all the uninitiated people who don't even know what's going on.

216
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,520
The PCPHQ, just to go over the bear facts, is you should check out our Patreon page.

217
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,480
We talk a little bit about it on there, but what it is is it is the magical dream realm

218
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,640
place that we all imagine of the members of the PCP being able to live in proximity and

219
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,880
then come to the HQ to work together, to make our collaborative projects similar to what

220
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,680
happens with the ride con stuff.

221
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,180
Of course, that's a different animal because we all gather and kind of live together.

222
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,840
Well, the ultimate goal is basically to make the red letter media set up because those

223
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,000
guys are a bunch of like 35 year old filmmaker buddies who have a similar sense of humor and

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,080
style so they all moved into the same place and rented out a studio and that allowed them

225
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
to make much higher quality products than what's typical on YouTube.

226
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,040
And since we all like to be quality over quantity type of guys as much as we can, YouTube kind

227
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,920
of necessitates you to fucking just churn shit out, but like, you know, red letter media

228
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,440
has got like a real fucking successful Patreon and real healthy view counts off of like putting

229
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,440
out a video once every couple of weeks, you know, because they can really go all in on

230
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,600
making the quality maximized and we think we are people with like strong enough personalities

231
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,640
and chemistry to carry a show.

232
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Obviously we can do this show, but like this shows growth potential is nothing compared

233
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,000
to what could be if we could raise our production quality and really attract people to this

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,760
this motley underground niche crew, you know, so again, in layman's terms, PCP HQ is all

235
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,600
of the PCP members living in proximity, like in the same city and having some sort of space

236
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,560
where they can record, you know, studio type stuff and do new content that couldn't do

237
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
over the internet.

238
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,480
Real quick, I don't even want to give people the impression that like, because whatever

239
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,400
we say that red letter media stuff, I feel like people imagine it's just going to be

240
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,760
the plebe in the weave or like other half in the bag, you know, rip off or like a fucking

241
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,840
best of the worst rip off shows.

242
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,680
But I also think of it as like, all right, you know, like when Seth Rogen and James Franco

243
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,480
and they've got like all their friends and they all just live in Hollywood, so they make

244
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,320
movies together just because they all live in the same place and they're all comedians,

245
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,640
like that's also what I see PCP HQ as is like any random funny idea that we just can't do

246
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,320
by ourselves and we need like one other funny guy to be nearby, like it's real convenient

247
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,760
to have some stuff like that for say, if you've seen the collabs that me and Nate did when

248
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,440
I went to your house, I'll talk to a workout training, it's just like, it's like a little

249
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,480
four minute comedy video, but like the way it's filmed and the idea of it, like it couldn't

250
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,080
have been done without both of us being there and like this specific combination of senses

251
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,880
of humor, even body type, you know, like is all plays into the joke of that video, you

252
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,320
know, so it's like something that couldn't have happened with either of us alone.

253
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,120
One of the big strengths of having the HQ is going to be able to like increase the ability

254
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,200
to make spontaneous spontaneous content, because like if we have an idea, we can just do it

255
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,840
as opposed to me like, well, I want to do this idea with Digi, I got to track him down,

256
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,800
we got to plan our time, we actually do something together and blah, blah, blah, like it's just

257
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,920
like, you want to do it, man? Yeah, we'll come on over and then that's it.

258
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,560
You serves don't understand how much the fourth dimension adds to content, like like the ability

259
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,840
to be in the same room as something, someone automatically alters how the content flows.

260
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:07,480
I, even though like, like I don't think I act any differently online than I do offline,

261
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,960
it's inevitable that just, that just is the case. It just is the case. I don't know how

262
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,960
to stop it, it just is the case. And I think, you know, in all the degradation types, you

263
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,320
know, digital links and like, you're in all the sort of stuff like there, I think, I think

264
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,160
I, I think I have a certain flow in my, you know, natural unscripted live action sort of

265
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,080
stuff that I just can't replicate online because that's, you know, it's just hard. I'm not

266
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,920
in front of people. I can't gauge things. So just being live action will really benefit

267
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,680
like all of us and I mean, just look at the reaction of people to the lectures, the PCP

268
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,320
lectures, which are a shining example. That's the biggest proof, I think that it's there.

269
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,240
I, I, that it's worthwhile. Like, look at the thing about those. They're huge.

270
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,680
That they were obviously got a huge response and imagine if we could do those anytime we

271
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,080
wanted. Imagine a PCP world without the fucking Sanchu lecture or the fucking

272
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,160
declination lecture or the Kingdom Hearts lecture. Like those are two fucking or three

273
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,280
insanely influential pieces of fucking work. They are, they are integral to the PCP lore

274
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,800
and they're all like, you couldn't fucking have a lecture of declination. It would not

275
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,760
be the same. If I wasn't there pacing back and forth for two hours and people falling out of

276
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,520
their fucking chairs thinking about Jace, that would not be the same. You could only have that

277
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,640
sort of stuff in person. I think there could be no debate that there's a lot of content that we

278
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:30,040
can only make in that situation. And here's my main pitch to people. People don't always think

279
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,160
about this, but if you want to make your, if you want to find yourself in a place where you're

280
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,600
making like interesting or unique content, you have to set yourself up in a position where you

281
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,920
can succeed doing it. So like we could, you know, continue to like slave away on like projects,

282
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,680
just doing exactly what we're doing forever. You know, we could always do that. But like

283
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,440
the amazing thing to me is I like to think back to a moment in the Kingdom Hearts lecture that I

284
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,760
never, ever could have planned. I never would have thought to write this joke, but the way it

285
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,720
just emerged from this, you know, emergent gameplay of the lecture of playing off the people in the

286
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,480
audience was amazing. And it was when, when Jeff asked the question, and I was talking about like

287
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,840
Nominee and Rokus and Sora, how like they're all the same person. And he just said like, Nate, so

288
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:19,000
okay, or Mr. Best Guy. So if they were to fuck, like what percentage of masturbation would that be?

289
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,160
And then just, you know, I immediately respond, for me, 100%. And it got a gigantic, like it was

290
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,480
the funniest moment in the whole thing. It's amazing. I watch it back all the time. And I never

291
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,760
could have written that joke. And it works in the context of that setting. So well.

292
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,320
You watch back the moment that you really nailed it over and over again, just like reliving the

293
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,280
glory of the times. You're literally, you're masturbating to your masturbation.

294
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,440
It's his, it's his ringtone now.

295
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,800
I feel you hard. I feel you hardcore. The new lecture was completely unscripted. And I had no

296
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,680
idea what I was going to do when I fucking got up there. And I just thought, well, might as well

297
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,880
just go as hard as I fucking can. And there's that catchphrase, that catchphrase, that legendary

298
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,840
phrase was fucking born out of the ashes. That nigger has not gotten up off the ground.

299
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,160
He's still there. He's slam. He's part of the fucking soil at this point. He's decomposed.

300
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,520
I mean, I don't, I don't know what else there is to say. Like just the fact that, like, because none

301
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,640
of that, all this was like an 18 minutes into the podcast date. I don't know what else there is to

302
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:35,560
say. Well, I'm on this front. I just mean, because I think that really sums it up just in terms of

303
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,680
like the tangible benefits right there. Well, no, I think there's another, another tangible benefit

304
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,160
is because we're talking about like all this extra content we can do. But I think another good thing

305
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,200
to point out is that even the base PCP will increase dramatically in quality because so much of like

306
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,080
conversation and like interaction is nonverbal. So being in the same room, if we all recorded

307
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,800
in person, there'd be a whole other dimension to the conversation that'll just like subconsciously

308
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:08,600
one of my favorite podcast is the sleepy cast and they record in the same room. The audio isn't

309
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,320
great. But like the energy in that room of them just fucking around and talking about bullshit

310
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,040
is just so it's like it leads to so much more funny moments. The fucking energy, man. It's the

311
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,960
energy. When you're on the computer, it's too easy to like, Oh, look to the side. What's that bag of

312
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,880
pretzels doing there? Look to the side. Oh, there's that glass of milk that I haven't taken downstairs

313
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,280
now to house mold all over the top of it. Well, you're in person. You can't do that. You have to

314
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,000
keep focused on the person you're talking to. And it creates a, you know, a more natural dynamic

315
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,360
conversation. It's like, it's like when we did tbap, like, like all the energy in tbap was because

316
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,120
we were doing it live. And I remember like when we didn't live in the same place, like we didn't

317
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,240
want to keep doing tbap because it wouldn't be the same to record it. Yeah, literally call or whatever.

318
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,920
Literally remember tbap, like, like, not as you don't think about it for like a second.

319
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,040
Hey, speaking of which, you pledged $9,000 and $1,000 to the Kickstarter,

320
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:08,120
hashtag maxrevive tbap. Those stretch goals suck. I mean, we had a moment just now where

321
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,480
six people tried to talk at once. And that's the exact reason that this should be done live.

322
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,720
You know, like, that doesn't happen when you're all live, because you can all see each other

323
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,840
gearing up to speak, you know, when someone's getting ready. Here we've got a delay so we

324
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,720
can't even tell until after someone has decided to start speaking that they have begun speaking,

325
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,360
you know, it's a lot harder to manage flow in a conversation, especially on like a laggy

326
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,120
discord server with six people on different parts of the fucking continent, you know.

327
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,720
So yeah, think about all that and also think about the fact that the rain reason we don't do

328
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,080
face cam is that sinking six fucking face cam videos would be a pain in the ass getting everybody's

329
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,160
quality consistent, you know, and like also it's kind of sucks to be held accountable for two hours

330
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:02,760
to not like play with your dick, you know. So, but when you're surrounded by everybody else,

331
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,080
then you can't touch your dick. You can touch each other's dick. Yeah.

332
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,960
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

333
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,680
First like. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So that appeal for real. The appeal of having great

334
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,480
higher g content that that's all good and well, and I know all of our fans would love that. You

335
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,040
guys just listen to the rad con stuff, all that impossible to do online. So that's all squared

336
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,320
away. That's all, you know, obvious that that's all incredible. But here's the thing that also

337
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,240
like, like, you know, the PCP is about content, right? Well, the other flip side of the PCB is

338
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,840
that we're all friends. And we never see each other ever. None of us ever like fucking like like

339
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,960
culture shock, intellectual alarm clock blasting your fucking ears listener, the PCP don't talk

340
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,040
to each other and they don't hang out ever. And PCP you will hopefully fix that. I hope please.

341
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,800
I definitely want to hang out with everyone more. Yeah. Do like, like, you know, let's plays,

342
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,720
but not like for a video. Just just having a place to go and be like, Yeah, what are you

343
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,160
working on? I'm working on my video over here. Exactly. I imagine it being like a combination

344
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,840
of red letter media with the big room where we film things. And then maybe some small I have no

345
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,200
idea what we're like, what we could afford. Like, super fucking cool. If like, for example,

346
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,840
we're all in the same place. And maybe like hippo, you're just like, Hey, I'm working on the next

347
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,360
hypocrite video. Like, look at what I got so far. What do you think? Yeah, things like that. We can

348
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,040
all influence our content as it's being developed. Because there's one thing that I've had like

349
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,520
ideas and I've been told by like Digi, at least, that I could send like my scripts to people to

350
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,920
see what they think. But it's it's, I don't know, it never really feels right to send a script that

351
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,480
I'm working on even when I'm stuck to anybody. But when I'm like, I'm because it's like, it's more

352
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,280
in the delivery and stuff. It would be so so dude, it is 1000 times. Let me tell you, this is

353
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,120
something I've gotten personally, because I've been living with with my fiance now, because she

354
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,160
left her job to work for me. And like, reading a script out loud to somebody else, like, you

355
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,680
could just ask them, like, is that the right word? Like, is that the word I wanted? You know, or like,

356
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,240
is that funny? And then they can go, Oh, yeah, that was funny. Or like, you watch them, you can see

357
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,720
them laugh. And you're like, Okay, that's funny. I'm leaving that in the video. Like, I have definitely

358
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,880
been using we both have like, whenever we make something, we just look at the other person,

359
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,560
like, which parts of this are good, you know, and I think with PCP, with all of us having like,

360
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,080
you know, pretty similar senses of humor and holding each other to a pretty high standard,

361
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,720
having critical eye, you know, I think, if maybe I could watch one of, you know, Nate or hippos

362
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,240
videos over their shoulder, right before they publish it, I could be like, that joke is real

363
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,560
funny. That one I would cut, you know, and then you can look at my video and be like,

364
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,560
This is fucking boring. You should make it funny. And I'll be like, Okay,

365
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,000
let's do that.

366
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,480
Let me paint a picture for the viewers here. So imagine all of the PCP are like nice castles

367
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,080
on a hexagon grid in the in the middle in the middle of all these kingdoms is a barren desert

368
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:29,080
wasteland. That is our discord chat room. And all communication must go through this desert

369
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,080
wasteland. This is like fucking Sahara, you have to put on your turban and you will have to get

370
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,200
your fucking slaves. You have to venture across this barren wasteland, get to the other empire

371
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,560
to fucking talk to the other king there. That's what that's what talking online is like. If you

372
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,400
fucking help us get PCB HQ, we can just walk over to each other's houses and we won't have to

373
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,960
fucking toil endlessly under the hot blistering discord sun. Now I do just want to put in here.

374
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,680
I don't want to feel I don't want to like make it sound like just give us money and this will

375
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,600
happen like real fast. I want to add just a little bit of a damper to this whole fun conversation

376
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,720
just to say this is a long term goal that we're all working on and obviously if we're talking about

377
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,000
the lives of like at least six people here that have to be like you know financially economically

378
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,440
you know housing situation has to be resolved and all that stuff takes like a lot of money

379
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,320
and a lot of effort. So in no way are we saying this like just get us to like right now on the

380
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,440
PCP Patreon we say like give us five grand I think it's like per episode that we release

381
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,560
and like we will start to make PCB HQ happen. That is start it will not like officially be fully

382
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,560
realized at that point. We're definitely not going because like we're doing a Kickstarter for

383
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,600
the Radcon 3 and that's like a temporary like oh we want to meet up we want to jump together and

384
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,640
just do some stuff and like make more content to like impress you all but like the actual getting

385
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,480
over and everybody getting situated and you know ordering a studio that would never be like that

386
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,160
won't be crowdfunded it will just be like when we all have enough money in order to support ourselves

387
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,160
when we have income that we can rely on that's when it will happen we just need you know to bolster

388
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:15,080
our own and and the PCP and all that. It makes perfect sense it takes five thousand dollars to

389
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:21,400
fund PC for to fund Radcon and that's for a week so if we release a video every week and it's five

390
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,400
thousand a video then that means it's a Radcon every week. Oh my god. You know what I'm saying?

391
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,760
Basically check it out. You're blowing your fucking minds. Just keep in mind that this entire podcast

392
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,440
is speculative and not at all like a promise. You're hearing the first real murmurings of this

393
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:43,480
nationalist ethno-state movement live on air. Yeah. Well one of the main reasons we decided

394
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,120
even to do this episode is like we've been talking because we haven't had set down and had a super

395
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,760
constructive conversation about this anyways. We've tried. So it's just as much for us. It's too far

396
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,520
out. It's too far out. Well hold on. I think okay you guys are bothering me with this. It's too far

397
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:07,320
out. It's no reality. Look I'm moving to Boston in June that's happening so PCPHQ starts June 1st

398
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,520
when I moved to Boston. PCPHQ is real until two PCP guys live in the same place. Whoever shows up

399
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,640
after me that's it's officially HQ. The second that there's two people that Tom's already there

400
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:25,880
so me and Tom can already have PCPHQ. If it takes a month for the rest of you to show up Tom's

401
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:35,240
going to be living in my garage by that point by the by. So you know the PCPHQ will be me and Tom

402
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,240
and Pantsu party over here fucking making vlogs until everybody else shows up. Whoa what the fuck

403
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,800
does Pantsu party have to do with PCPHQ dude. Let's put a stamper right now on that shit.

404
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,200
Just saying that's what it'll be until the rest of you guys show up. What the fuck is everybody.

405
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,680
That's all good well and put up in there. We should come back to that but that's nitty gritty

406
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,640
shit and we should probably keep this abroad still because I still want to. My point is everybody

407
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,280
stop trying to make it less hype by making it sound like it's too far away because then the

408
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,880
audience isn't going to give us all their money because they're going to be like I don't care

409
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,040
about like you know when they release those like teaser trailers for a movie that comes out in like

410
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,760
a fucking year and you're like I literally will not remember that this movie is supposed to come

411
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,320
out like I don't care enough about any movie. Well on the other hand you don't want to be a final

412
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,480
fantasy 15 and promise something and then take 10 years to deliver something that's way shittier

413
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,480
than it was initially promised. You don't want to be Kingdom Hearts 3 and buy like two consoles for

414
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,240
a game that. No we don't want to be any of that stuff we want to be a game that announces it's

415
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,720
going to be released six months beforehand and then comes out and everyone loves it that's what

416
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,000
we want to do so let's just let's just tell everybody it's happening in six months and then

417
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,680
do it in six months. But the complexity involved like am I going to be ready to literally quit

418
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:54,600
my job in six months. Make it that way. Make it so it's that way. Well I think I mean I think what

419
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,880
it is is that like PCP HQ like like the ultimate like the ultimate hypothetical form of it where

420
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,720
like all of us live together is like maybe far out and it's complicated but like it doesn't have to

421
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,880
be it's not black and white like that like PCP HQ can start to form like yes that's what I'm saying

422
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,440
it's it's it's on a spectrum like I've always expected exactly I've always expected that me

423
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,080
and Nate are probably going to be the first ones to meet up because I'm I'm definitely moving

424
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,440
Nate's probably going to be ready to move before too long if we are all if we're all going to

425
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,560
wherever Tom already is then he'll be there so I'm thinking like you know there's we don't have to

426
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,560
wait for everybody else to show up before we start making videos you know like whoever's available

427
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,360
is going to be the initial crew of making like the live action content and everybody else is

428
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,240
going to still probably be in the audio only version you know and like I expect that to basically

429
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,960
exist until everybody shows up you know and it'll be like all right we don't need that to exist anymore

430
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,840
you know but like whoever's there will make content and you guys already know me and Nate

431
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,520
make shit together I went to your house and we made like 20 fucking videos so like you know as

432
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,960
soon as two of us are in the same place it's PCPHQ and then what that is can grow and evolve as

433
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:16,120
more people turn up and contribute to it there's one general broad thing that I would like to brush

434
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,440
up upon that's like that may not seem immediately relevant but I think it is extremely relevant

435
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:27,960
to HQ as a whole what is the PCP to everyone else maybe uh here I'll I'll I'll I'll say I'll say

436
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:35,800
what I perceive the PC to be to be to me it's sort of like a weekly world war like with each member

437
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:41,720
being like a mighty empire like each rich in culture in their own right banding together to duke it

438
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:50,440
out intellectually and physically each sunday to appease our suzerain 15 000 fold no one's main

439
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,640
identity should be like should be appearing on these podcasts like the PCP is like supplementary

440
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,040
material to all of our individual content that's how to say the PCP kind of isn't important all right

441
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and make a promise right now when PCPHQ happens if there is a live

442
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,440
action version of the PCP in any form physical fighting will be a part of it

443
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,320
it has to it has to end with blood physical violence will definitely be be a sponsored content

444
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,680
of the PCP you know another tangible benefit he'll throw me I mean it's kind of it's kind of part of

445
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,440
this whole situation but like right now Gibb does in fact live in another country and if PCPHQ

446
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,720
can form and become like a stable actual sort of business model then we could get visas for Gibb

447
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,880
to come work and live as a employee yeah I think that's the biggest financial goal like the the

448
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,560
reason that PCPHQ needs like the reason we need a kicker the reason we need a patreon for it you

449
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,240
know like why does it have to be a patreon goal with me and Nate could just move into the same

450
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,480
place anyways it's because we can't do that with someone like hippo who's you know not even from

451
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,800
this country like we need to have a real stable foundation for someone like him to come over right

452
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,560
yeah it's not because I looked into it a lot of times and checked and stuff and there's like two

453
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:14,200
main ways I could get into the US well three if I'm if I'm illegal but like two is like one is

454
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,800
like marrying someone from this country and the other one is being hired by an by a company

455
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:26,760
and if the PCP can become like a literal like LLC company thing I think that would be an avenue

456
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,600
that I could like like you can hire me in I could be on shows and be like haha and then I can have a

457
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,880
house and what if we kickstarted Gibb what if we kickstart Gibb and munchies wedding you know

458
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,760
they're mad down dude I keep telling you it's not a fucking joke I will gay marry you to get you into

459
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:50,280
America this is a full like my legs are spread just whenever you're ready it's so weird I can't

460
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,880
tell my parents that I'm getting gay married to a big fat Mexican lad that's like 16 real question

461
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,120
remember that movie now I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry or whatever it was about like two guys

462
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,800
like okay why what was the problem exactly why can't you just marry like is there do you have to

463
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,120
like prove you like love them or something like why doesn't that just work that was the conceit of

464
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,560
the movie I don't know if that's true in reality yeah I'm real curious I've never heard of like

465
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,760
because people get shotgun married all the time so yeah yeah or maybe they I think it was because

466
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,160
they had to be married specifically for some kind of grant that they were trying to get or some

467
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,880
ride I don't fucking know who cares well whatever I have no idea about it I I mean if it comes down

468
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:39,000
to that I just won't tell anybody in my family that I'm technically married to a man I will just

469
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,760
you're not married to a man you're married to a god

470
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,200
like we'll just we'll it'll just be munchy and the detail there will be no further details

471
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,120
yeah I'll just say I found God and they're like oh

472
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:00,520
became a christian and much is every gender at once so fuck respond to what I said by the way

473
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:06,760
what was that what what is the pcp to everyone I can answer that oh right yeah the pcp is basically

474
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:13,720
a virus or no no no more more accurate would be to say a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a paramecia

475
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:20,600
or a single celled organism with many nuclei and these nuclei inside control the main body

476
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,840
and stretch it and squish it however they see fit with the goal of expanding and and assimilating

477
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,640
more and more into the entity as a whole like we're all working independently but we're all

478
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,360
working to the shared goal of getting our big fucking blob body as big as it can get yeah

479
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:42,500
I'm all about my blob body getting bigger. We're just a big old blob. We're absolutely filled with goop

480
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,000
We're laden with it. Does anyone else share my adjustics my justice league interpretation of the PCP?

481
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:55,260
I forget the world war. I don't remember. I don't get it parry it to the justice league at all

482
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,160
Or like yeah, but the United Nations. Yeah, what I see it as is what is has always been

483
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,560
Like sans podcast is just a group of internet creators who are like intellectually cool and fun

484
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,840
And I don't hate them and they like me as well. So that's good and we can all make each other

485
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,960
Grow

486
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,200
Our penis is big because we like each other so much, you know, this has changed over time

487
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,520
But I certainly still think of the PCP when you know

488
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:36,080
I had the idea to start doing the podcast and the reason for it was because I just wanted to talk to you guys

489
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,800
And if not for the podcast that simply would not happen. Yeah, and you know it had and now it's actually making some money

490
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:48,040
Which is very nice and all these other things about wanting to move in together. It's helping facilitate that goal

491
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:55,040
so to me it's an excuse to continue talking to my friends continue collaborating with the very few content creators online or some of

492
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
them that I respect and

493
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:05,440
Yeah, it's just it's just a dream of like you you are the guys that I want to work with and I do and I hope to continue to do so in

494
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,440
New ways in the future and this is a unifying element

495
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,040
I do not put a I mean I love just talking at length as as obviously because I just like love doing the PCP in general

496
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,520
So for me, it's just a great way to just dump a bunch of bullshit every week on in a podcast and shit

497
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,240
But other than that, it's a great unifying element with people who I respect and want to work with

498
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,440
Yeah, that's what it is for me

499
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,880
The PCP is like a combination of both a collaborative and competitive effort

500
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,200
Because like we come together and we're all friends. We hang out we talk shit

501
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,240
And we just make a collaborative product, which is great

502
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,720
And it's an excuse to talk with all you guys

503
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:46,040
But at the same time the PCP is an enterprise is also a way for me to like keep tabs on what everybody is doing and

504
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,400
It kind of keeps me motivated because like I've talked before about how I feel like I have to earn my place here

505
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,520
So I definitely feel like there's like a bar that needs to be bet and that kind of helps keep me working harder than I might

506
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,760
Buy myself. I might like lose motivation. Can I just put out this thought on that? Okay, go ahead

507
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:11,080
Go ahead. Yeah, I've definitely felt like other groups of friends or people are not

508
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:18,280
They I don't it's it. They're not like hard on me enough like they don't they just say

509
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Yeah, that's great and like the Brody's like the Brody's it's it's it this group is like one part everything

510
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
I said before but then another part

511
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,360
It is yeah, it is competitive

512
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,840
It's like we're always trying to one-up each other and we get annoyed when one of us is like the the most popular digi

513
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
And we

514
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
But the rest of us are like vying for

515
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,600
We're also jealous of digi we all made a snow idol of him and murdered him

516
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:58,480
Like it's like it's it's good to have competition. It's like a friendly rivalry like like like it's like an anime like everyone

517
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,440
It's funny give that you mentioned the the the hard talk and stuff because I remember at one point like this time last year

518
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,320
I felt very isolated from the group and I approached you specifically about it and you straight up told me like your shit

519
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,480
Just hasn't been interesting and none of us have felt it's worth talking about and that like kicked my ass and from that point on

520
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,680
I was like I need to bust my ass harder. Yeah, but then they basically started making money and you cozyed up real

521
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,680
Above above all else as much as I like being a content creator. I like being a Jew so much

522
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,040
It's not bad and by the way, here's your dose of hashtag re-utilitarianism for the day

523
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,700
I literally believe unconditional love is immoral and I will never subscribe to it at any point

524
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,240
It has everything to do with this because if we were just friends who didn't criticize each other and we're just like supportive in everything

525
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,920
That we did there would be stagnation and at least within our relationship. I want to bring him my move. I see a PCP

526
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,360
Okay

527
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
There's something wrong

528
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,480
I've broken my brain, but uh, no, I I think

529
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,720
How I see the PCP is that everyone in this group is an artist who given the opportunity

530
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:25,560
Would attempt to make the greatest piece of art they possibly could and then attempt to one up at every time they made something new

531
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,200
Given the opportunity now right now

532
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,680
Everyone's in a position where they're trying to become financially stable through art in order to give them the leeway to do that

533
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,440
All of us are young as fuck. Nobody's even 30 yet. Most artists don't even really become big until their 30s, you know

534
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,440
Hello, I see us as a

535
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,320
I see us as a group of people with an insane amount of potential because everyone in here is so creative and has been doing it for

536
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Such a long time that they've kind of proven themselves

537
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,920
No one in here is like a flake. None of us were one success and then we quit YouTube

538
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,720
You know, we all tried to build multiple careers here and are still trying to grow and are still like hungry and I think

539
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,200
You know Nate is obviously somebody who wants to make really highly produced and epic videos

540
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,040
He might not ever put the like the like stupid amount of effort he put into some of them again, but like incorrect

541
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
It's stupid

542
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,960
But if you didn't have to make we Agua you would just focus on making those right

543
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,320
But but I do have to make we I want to succeed on YouTube. So I do

544
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,520
I only just recently got to a point where I'm able to take more of a step back

545
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,720
And even then I still try to I still try to put out shit constantly just because

546
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,320
There's some people who just want to hear my voice all day and I want to appease those people as well

547
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,360
And I have fun doing it. It's a good way to just constantly like throw every

548
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,400
Well, yeah, because we say one of those people is me is that we said yeah, oh, yeah

549
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,680
Well, I mean like you know something like Nate doing we Agua a lot of these are video ideas

550
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,800
And we all have this this all this happens to everyone in this group that we have way more ideas than we can actually fucking make

551
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Like the worst Nate there's no way Nate could ever in his lifetime make fully edited videos out of every idea

552
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,440
That's on we Agua. So there is a reason for that show to exist

553
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,000
And I'm sure you wouldn't just kill like that lower effort content entirely just because you were able to make higher effort stuff

554
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,160
But like you probably would be like hey, there's not gonna be a weekly show instead

555
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,960
I'm gonna make fucking movies that are gonna like you are never gonna want to stop watching this video, you know indeed indeed

556
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,920
And I think that's what everybody I think it's everybody in here would try to do if like they had the unlimited

557
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,200
Resources and and time, you know, I don't think anyone in here is somebody who if we had all the money in the world would be like

558
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
I'm never doing art again. We'd just be like

559
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:59,520
Masterpiece, you know, yeah, you know, I feel guilty even saying this but you know looking back on it

560
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,560
I got to say my respect for Aaron Hansen is

561
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:08,680
Coming back around as just a businessman and as a practical guy who was like this is what I got to do to succeed

562
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
Make game around great just grow it

563
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,640
I you know the more time that passes the more I recognize just what a mature and that dude could do anything

564
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,880
He wants now like if he wants to make an animation

565
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,680
He fucking I mean you I was just like first you get rich then you can just do anything

566
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,320
So like first get rich everybody just do it. Just do the day. I was looking at fucking kitty cat gaming

567
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
his wife's channel and like

568
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,560
He animated a full intro for that like just for his wife's channel

569
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,320
Just cuz he felt like it like he knew there would be no profit for him in doing that other than like

570
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,120
Hey, my wife will have a neat little intro animation, but like that. It's like a fully flat. Oh, yeah

571
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,480
But like, you know, I'm just looking at that

572
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,640
I'm like, this is what you this is a freedom you have when like you don't have to interrupt your schedule of like

573
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,880
I have to have an animation about a popular game done every month, you know

574
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,920
Like most people have to see what he just announced on game grumps or whatever like when they were doing game grumps touring

575
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,400
There was no production company that could handle like what they were asking for as youtubers

576
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,280
So they just built their own and now they're like looking for people and I was like goddamn

577
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,440
I want to sign up to this shit. I want to tour maybe I can work with the game grumps and do this shit

578
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
God, I'm so impressed by these people

579
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:24,520
Fucking they made a visual novel, you know, like these are the kind of things that if we I think at our group

580
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,760
If we all lived in one area and we didn't have the monetary concern of like I need constant videos

581
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,960
That's the kind of shit we would come up with I mean

582
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Just made a visual

583
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:45,080
I'm assuming we all have like a big project like it's somewhere in our minds that given no constraints we would do

584
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
I know I do yeah, of course

585
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,300
I've got a lot like I can't diss a but right now

586
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,080
I just got myself up to a point where I'm allowed to make like one video a month on the main channel

587
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,280
And that's enough for me to make something pretty big

588
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,360
But I've never been able to like oh I had to disappear for six months to make this piece of art

589
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,720
So, you know like in we all know, you know, our buddy the endless one did that

590
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,080
I don't know how well that worked out for him financially

591
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,960
But like that's how we got horseshoe finale is dude had to disappear for six months and make that thing because that's that's why

592
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,840
That's why it's a masterpiece is that it had that much time and some

593
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,520
Kind of focus, right? There's a concept called deep work, which it's a concept. I've been reading up about

594
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,360
Deep web. Yeah, the deep the deep web but like deep work

595
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:36,680
It's it's when because it was interesting was reading this book and was talking about how like social media is destroying people's attention spans

596
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,920
And it's actually like making making it more difficult for creators to do what's called deep work

597
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:49,480
Which is when you just spend like three four five six hours at a row without any inter interactions or interruptions just working on something

598
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,280
That's how I make all my videos. That's where the majority of like good work comes. That's like um, oh, there's there's a talk by um

599
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,880
Oh god, one of the one of the Monty Python guys

600
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,280
Who's the big one please? Yeah, John Cleese John. Yeah, there's a talk by John Cleese about like the

601
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,840
Like creative mode and like and how like you need like time to like let your mind enter the creative mode or something

602
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,000
sounds similar and

603
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,800
They're talking about how like with multitasking and stuff like when you like no one can actually multitask like your brain can't do it

604
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,200
You just do tasks switching and the interesting thing was like your brain when you switch tasks

605
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,040
You don't immediately just stop doing the other thing. It's still kind of lingering in your mind

606
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,080
So it takes a little while for your brain to completely switch off from one thing and focus on another

607
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,720
So if you're constantly going and checking social media or whatever else or like doing smaller things in the middle of your work

608
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:43,200
You never fully commit to it a hundred percent. Yeah, so it's like it's just a really interesting like how like the brain works

609
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,240
Oh, I'd love to be able to if you're someone who has problems with that fucking get like the stay focused app

610
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,920
You know that shit just blocks you from all social media for like a day or it gives you it gives you ten minutes

611
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,360
Of time every day, and then it'll just block the page

612
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,000
So you got ten minutes of Twitter today, and you better fucking use it spare you better use it right, you know

613
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,640
Or if you waste it all in the morning

614
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,040
It's like well

615
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,120
I guess you're grinding on your writing all night because you ain't open in that fucking way that better if you get out of the way

616
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,560
And sometimes I've been in cycles where I was doing like I would just do it all at the beginning and then not have it all

617
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Day sometimes I want like I need that little spice of like breaking away from what I'm writing for like just a minute

618
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,520
You know to look at Twitter and but I try to spread that out all night

619
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,120
You know I'm only allowed to look for 30 seconds because it's gonna cut into my 10 minutes

620
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,200
So like that's another way to kind of keep yourself on track

621
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,360
Yeah, yeah, man

622
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,000
Excellent, I feel I feel like

623
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:47,040
Like like coming back to to you know like like a piece of HQ and have and how that will affect us and how we'll be able to

624
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,520
Be better people because of this even even if you disregard any of

625
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
the you know business

626
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:01,160
Content-wise things again, just being together will in like like like you know

627
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,960
I just said you know remove content

628
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,720
But even just being better friends and just talking to other will you know influence our content and make it better

629
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:18,160
I know that like like being together will like fucking like pacify all of our dark mental urges and fucking like you know

630
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,200
Moderate our suicidal and and homicidal tendencies and try and make us into more productive

631
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:32,760
Moral people with a fucking backbone for once and so just being friendly with one other and being able to actually see another person

632
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,800
Every you know once every week or so instead of the zero time we all get to see that will be great

633
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,760
And that will be able to make us you know more functional fucking people and therefore better content

634
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:52,440
Let me make break out one of my favorite comparisons like fucking in the fighting game community like people who get big as like

635
00:44:52,840 --> 00:45:00,120
Fighting game players they have to play against other big players like you can't get good playing against like your local guys

636
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,800
Like even if they're really great like if you're not playing against a pro

637
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,520
They just know so much more that like just playing against them teaches you way more about the game

638
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,280
You know that's that's preparing you for an entirely different meta

639
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,460
Exactly and so like us living together is it or even working together all this time has always been that way like we've had

640
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,120
Everyone in the PC piece had a very massive influence on each other. I think that's pretty fucking obvious

641
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,360
Which is why why we all share a fan base because people generally you know can see the threads of each other's work in

642
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,400
and everything we do but like

643
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,480
You know living together just to kind of increases that it's I

644
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:44,120
One of the things about like that the reasons people recommend going to college is like they say you'll get experience just by like

645
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,680
Seeing things that you wouldn't have seen at home. You know and with the piece with with working with you guys

646
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,280
I've had times were like just watching someone edit you might like learn a whole new way to edit

647
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,000
You know or watching someone's workflow or just being around when someone's being creative gives you ideas about how to approach creativity

648
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,080
You know, I might have different brainstorming methods from Nate

649
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,880
But like maybe if I copy the way he takes notes, it'll let me make a different kind of video or something like my famous note taking

650
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,640
Yeah, I mean

651
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,080
I've been exploring all this because I'm helping my fiancee launch her channel and like we've been just watching YouTube videos fucking

652
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,200
Constantly and like taking notes on what everybody does, you know

653
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,360
So I've been in this constant state of like man being around youtubers is powerful

654
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,080
like being around people who do the same work you do like will really

655
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:37,280
Just like kind of reconfigure your mind to think of things in a different way and I've learned a lot from even just seeing like hippos

656
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,240
Writing style like how he writes the jokes into his fucking scripts, which I don't do at all

657
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,200
Like hippo like writes notes about how to deliver jokes in the scripts themselves

658
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:54,000
A lot of people might not have even thought about that and some people will probably just learn something just by me explaining that on this podcast

659
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,840
You know so like the more we learn from each other the more we can tell the world because like I might take for granted the way

660
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,880
I write but then one of you guys looks at it and goes oh fuck guys

661
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,480
Did you know you could write like this and now everybody knows, you know, you know

662
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,560
I just don't want to I don't want to get anybody to whipped up in a frenzy

663
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,200
But I just want to say like keep your eyes on what's going here if you if you like what we do

664
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,440
I don't want to make anybody give like us money or whatever to support a dream

665
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:25,420
That doesn't have a tangible benefit for them, but I think that we can offer that I mean, I mean there's no like there's no like

666
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,560
Yeah, there's no like fun for this, right?

667
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,760
Yeah, just the main PCP patreon, you know does include language saying like if we hit 5,000 goals

668
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,280
PCP HQ will become real now like we'll start to make it when we have the money personally to do it

669
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,800
We will do it

670
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:48,440
And it depends on whether we individually get big or the PCP allows us like we get an income from that right right

671
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,360
But it's not gonna be like yeah, we're not gonna fund it directly

672
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,200
Speaking of that Nate about specific things that we don't people get all riled up about

673
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,040
Let's talk about specific things that will rile people up

674
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:05,760
I think we've all talked about the general broad stuff. I think it's time to get the nitty gritty like what exactly we plan to do

675
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,640
Like can I give you my vision here? Yeah. Yeah, sure

676
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,480
Let me let me give you my general vision of what I see when PCP HQ becomes real in my mind

677
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,960
I see and this is just me other people might disagree and this will all be figured out in time when this sure starts to become real

678
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,120
But in my world there is a core unifying show perhaps weekly

679
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:30,360
That is something akin to a half-in-the-bag style show like live-action people sitting down talking about thing

680
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,160
They want to talk about with probably I don't know

681
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:39,080
I imagined some sort of we Agua style editing it'll depend on like who the editor is and what the workflow becomes for that sort of thing

682
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,840
Um and so and that's like the main core content on the channel and then aside from that

683
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,920
Probably just like relative or content that's currently relevant to whatever's going on

684
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,600
So for example something like the podcast me and digi did about

685
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,520
Like the era manga sensei like I imagined things along those lines appearing on there as well

686
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:07,380
Maybe live-action maybe not and I I do get inspired by a lot of what red-letter media does in terms of they'll just make like random videos

687
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:14,800
Like science man explains like transformer genesis or you terminate like whatever it is all that kind of shit like that

688
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,920
That's the hand boy winter war sort of thing well

689
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,800
That's the kind of stuff that it helps to have the studio set up for because like exactly they created

690
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,480
Oh, it's a different type of video

691
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,440
But like all they really had to do is swap out a few assets and like they already have the lighting

692
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:34,480
They already have the big cameras like everything is ready to go just swap out the basic props of like the set and

693
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,600
For us even just working individually

694
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,880
I'm sure this is true for all of you because we all fucking work in our bedrooms

695
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,120
They have to set up your whole fucking setup every time you want to record anything

696
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,160
You know see that honestly when I dream of PCB HQ the number one thing I dream of considering

697
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:55,040
I literally have to like construct my set every time I set up having a studio room where I just go

698
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,760
Flip some switches and I'm ready to record. That is my dream. That is my dream

699
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,200
I that was what we tried to do at the at rad con and with the set that was in my my old house

700
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,400
But like I never quite got the lighting good because it's hard to justify spending a lot

701
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,440
To make a proper set you're gonna have to drop a lot of money

702
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,360
But like if everyone was there and we were all using it it would be justified, you know

703
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,120
Like if we wanted to get real professional shit, you know, I think all of us

704
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,440
Understand that that's the next layer to go to but it's like there's not enough

705
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,960
There's not enough evidence that that will profit us to do it for just our own videos, you know

706
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,440
But like if everyone's working together, it's like okay

707
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:40,320
Well having a dedicated setup will mean we can like just churn shit out like you know pencil in what whatever

708
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:45,200
You're doing that day and let's fucking film the schedule, you know, yeah, yeah for sure

709
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,560
That's one thing I dream of in the meantime. I'll probably construct like some sort of home studio

710
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:56,120
I don't I feel like I'm gonna move pretty soon probably before PCB HQ becomes real and the most important thing is to get a room

711
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,360
Where I can just set up my shit, and I don't maybe get another computer just all that kind of stuff, man

712
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,920
I dream it every fucking day. God. I fucking hate sitting on my goddamn camera

713
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,120
I'm really glad that we're talking about like specific things

714
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:14,560
We're going to do because one of my main concerns with PCB HQ, you know before this a while ago was a

715
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:20,120
Well, we had like, you know, of course the obvious benefit of like oh, we'll be able to do things together

716
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,120
There will be new shows available

717
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:27,040
That's kind of where the conversation ended and there was no like fit like actual show like yeah

718
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,120
Sure, there would be a show if we were all together

719
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,520
But when we're talking about moving and putting people's lives on the line

720
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,520
It's better to have an actual show

721
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,040
Planned instead of just saying there will be a show eventually

722
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:49,000
The reason it's sort of vague when we initially came up with it was it's just it will be us talking about media like we do

723
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,200
Well, but there's like two of us instead of one or maybe just one like the reason

724
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,160
Like I I mean, I don't do we agile with style things

725
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:05,480
But I could but I'm just like not that good on camera generally and I have a really bad place to record but like um I

726
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:14,200
Doing like edited review things only really works with me when it's something that I already have a history with and I can sort of

727
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,240
explain and

728
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,040
And and do all that sort of like big editing long-form stuff

729
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:27,320
And if I wanted to do that for like my channel to get you know talk about new games and and get like new

730
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,680
Viewers and whatever like it would be way easier if I could just have somebody there and we say yeah

731
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,040
We played this game. This is what we think about it and that would be the show, but it would be great because it's like

732
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,800
It's it's just t-bap, but with a video game

733
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,120
Yeah

734
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,320
I

735
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:51,640
I've I've turned my nose up a bit at red letter media before but I've been watching it a bunch lately and

736
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:57,040
Thinking about it in terms of like like what if like what if the PCP had like a similar setup

737
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,680
And I don't know it's just really great. It's really exciting, right, right?

738
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,960
There you go. I mean just like you know this they have these props and they just do these fucking

739
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,640
Shit things

740
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:16,680
Up to succeed it would just yeah, they did and it would just be it's so much better than it would be if it was audio-only

741
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,040
Mm-hmm

742
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,760
Like if they couldn't do they couldn't do like any of the shit

743
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:26,000
They do if they didn't have like a studio at the very least their meme potential like two

744
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,920
They're big memes on TV just posting red letter media, you know like gifts and images and stuff like they are

745
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,640
They're kind of a cultural phenomenon in their own small way

746
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:41,440
Oh, they have a pretty big cult fan base, you know, like indeed like one of them a grown-up version of uh of what we got, you know

747
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,520
um

748
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,600
But I think the reason that it's been so nonspecific is that for me

749
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,200
I usually base the projects I do on what is at my disposal

750
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:56,560
So like the way I see it again, if it was only gonna be me and Nate for a few months

751
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,880
I would just invent a show that is for me and Nate and is meant to last a few months

752
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,640
You know until we get the next guy or like if it or designed to go on until it needs to be replaced

753
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,440
Or unless it's super successful in which case we just keep doing that show even after pcph

754
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,240
So like

755
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,320
Basically for me, it's just like all right. Who do I have? What equipment do we have right now?

756
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,080
What space do we have, you know?

757
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:25,280
If if me and Nate both move to the same place and we can't yet afford or justify the expense of a studio space

758
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,080
We might just do something in a home studio, but with both of us, you know, but there's a lot of potential there

759
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,000
So

760
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,880
Yeah, I think that's why it's been so nonspecific

761
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,120
But I just want to have the ability to

762
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,680
If there is an idea to do it like again with the otaku workout training video

763
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,520
And I realized that a lot of the stuff that I tend to cite as like what I want to be able to do more of is not necessarily

764
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,320
Like the most popular videos we do like

765
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:58,240
Obviously, I think all of us have been are most successful when we're critiquing popular media more so than like just trying to carry something on the strength of like

766
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,720
our personas, you know

767
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,360
I think that

768
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,040
There's a lot more room to explore what we can do with that

769
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,720
Whenever we do make a weird video like that like a comedy video

770
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,600
There's a crowd of people who's like this is my favorite thing you've ever made and I'm like I agree with that crowd

771
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,280
The passionate fans are the ones who will throw their money at you. They're the ones

772
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,160
They're the ones we should be worried about

773
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,320
I got a show idea

774
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:30,160
But I don't worry about I mean we should we should care about their opinion and not the and not the fair weather people who are just interested in

775
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,480
The popular thing we might be talking about

776
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,200
I I I got a show idea

777
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,080
All right, because like we've got all these like vague things like just uh

778
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,360
personalities put them together and talk about something

779
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,200
That's that's that's all good. We can make a billion different types of those sort of shows

780
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,280
But here's here's a specific one

781
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:53,120
It'll be we go. I don't know where the Walmart sells like a brick a giant bricks of limestone

782
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,440
But we go and get the

783
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,080
And then we bring them into a room and we get some hammers and chisels and we just learn how to sculpt

784
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,960
I'm definitely down let's sculpt let's sculpt

785
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,400
Let's sculpt me and native had a long long time plan to do some kind of show about learning Japanese

786
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,720
Uh, you spilled the beans, but it's true guys. We've had that plan for like a fucking solid year

787
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,640
And we like it obviously would get done way easier if we live, you know, what is it?

788
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,120
Okay, now that you've said it, let me just give everyone my dream

789
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,640
This is a project I came up with and I think it is literally the best idea of all time

790
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,760
It is a podcast

791
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,320
I mean it'd probably be live action if we if we get this shit together

792
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:39,600
But it is a a a like regular maybe weekly style show where we are learning Japanese beginning with the fundamentals

793
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,080
And like every week we'll make a new lesson learning more stuff

794
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,280
And the point of this is that one day when many episodes are made

795
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:51,760
This will simply be a fun youtube playlist podcast where you can just watch and if you like practice and do the lessons along the way

796
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,320
You will just learn Japanese as well. Is that not the greatest idea?

797
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,480
It's like our people for Japanese culture

798
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,800
There will and there will also be a competitive element to it and like lots of lots of dunking on each other

799
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,440
Like that's gonna be integral. You know, I love that idea. Get dunked on bro

800
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,880
Make a lot of money. We'll be playing the entire time

801
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,880
I'm gonna get on a train of thought and ben. I think I think you'll be interested in this

802
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,560
So please chime in whenever you feel necessary. Okay. I am not a video person

803
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,080
I do not create videos as my main thing. Of course, you know

804
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:32,160
The main thing I do now, you know, like like that people see not behind the curtain is videos

805
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,960
But you know, I don't perceive myself to be that I am a draw person first and foremost and in my heart

806
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:43,120
And so it like, you know, if I were to go to psphq, well, of course, I would benefit from studios and stuff such as that

807
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,160
That's not the main thing that I would be doing is, you know, creating new types of the main

808
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,360
I have I have types of videos that I would like to do. I would like to do a cooking show

809
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:57,280
I'd like to do literal fighting. I want I want to literally record fights. That's not a joke or a meme

810
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,320
I want to do that. I'm intensely interested in that. I like wrestling

811
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,400
Uh, and there's stuff that I could do and I want to do but I think even like even the, you know

812
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,200
Most individualistic sort of stuff like, you know dry and stuff just being around like, you know

813
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,320
This goes back to what we were talking about earlier being influenced if I was around ben or if I were around, you know

814
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:21,360
Any of the other draw boys hippo tom here, that would be great. That would be that would be a huge influence

815
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,080
That would be a huge rush. I I totally

816
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,600
Imagine being in the same room as one of those people and just like we are both just drawing together

817
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,680
Like we're not like being like, oh fair. Check out this draw. Check out this panel. How do you think about that?

818
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,040
We could do that, but I'm just saying, you know, in fucking silence in our in our cave. Uh, I got it

819
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:45,760
Let me pitch a show to you for when pcbhq happens that you and the draw boys all get together draw erotic comics

820
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,400
And whoever achieves the biggest boner for the audience is the winner. What do you think?

821
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,440
I like it

822
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,040
I'm gonna punch you. Let me tell you

823
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:58,720
I got a I got a notebook full of real creative fun drawings that ben st

824
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:04,000
Drew while me and devu pretended we knew how to draw next to him and it was it was a great time

825
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,520
You know, I remember those they're all like colored and shit

826
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,160
Yeah, you were just like fucking around with your markers and drawing like masterpieces while me and devu were just like

827
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,320
Like attempting to even make what we were doing like like visibly readable

828
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,440
I remember it was a great time. I'm totally I'm bored with you

829
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,760
Munchie because like I think just being around because there's I I live in a vacuum

830
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,680
All right, I have no friends. I have nobody who's creatively inclined around me ever at all

831
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,080
So I just do my shit and that's it

832
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,680
But like if I was like

833
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,920
In the proximity of someone who is doing shit that I want to do and doing it better

834
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,680
I'd be like I love you, but I want to fucking kill you and it would definitely make me more

835
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:47,120
More productive and better and I I I suppose the the piece of me podcast would probably still exist by the way

836
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,600
We'd probably just keep doing this shit. I forgot to mention that it would get better for sure

837
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,320
That's why I was saying having it be in person would have a whole new dimension to it

838
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:00,320
Because we'd have that like personal like real life interactive element to it by the way

839
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,680
So when you say something stupid, I can go over and punch you in the face

840
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,480
All about drawing said here here fucking fastball like like hit you in the fucking skull before you could even react

841
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:19,200
Tom hippo, let's have like a three musketeers live action show or you know something to that effect where we're all art people who hate ourselves

842
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,040
Yeah, that's good. That's the main that's the main theme here. That's the main theme

843
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:29,280
We should all just have a show where we just like shit on everybody else who does like reviews and commentary because it's gay

844
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,520
Yes

845
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,040
Okay, fucking tentative plans for for a bunchy patreon

846
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,560
The highest goal is I will never talk about another piece of media in my life

847
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,840
I will never comment or even think about other art in my entire life

848
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:49,040
You're wasting your time just create your own shit. The best commentary on media is to make better media yourself

849
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,360
Yeah, true very true

850
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,480
I have in my my brain this this imagery of like

851
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,640
The video like all of us drawing on the on the bottom of the screen

852
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,400
Like you can see the backs of our monitors and are like pasty white faces

853
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,840
Illuminated by the screens and then above of us is like like a recording of what we're drawing

854
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,040
And it's just like 10 hours of like complete silence of us drawing

855
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:16,160
And then above those as there's a there's a gauge for how self-conscious the artist is betraying

856
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,520
And with the more self-conscious they get the lower a noose from the ceiling

857
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,920
So

858
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,360
Yes, wonderful

859
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,760
And just to just to get just to get really real just to get really really really dark and real

860
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,160
You know, please tommy holla first going to be living in a car soon

861
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:43,600
And his main source of income is the pcp. So if you pay enough to the pcp tom might live

862
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,120
Yeah

863
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,800
You might I didn't I didn't want to go there. I don't want to put any pressure on anybody, but uh, yeah

864
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,400
That seems to be what's in the cards. Yeah

865
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,840
Get a fucking job if you if you want us

866
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,200
I do have a job

867
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,920
If you want us to be able to afford to just put tom up in a house somewhere

868
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:13,120
And like have him just like nominally participate in pcp content while he works on like his grand vision of 3d art

869
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,600
Support the pcp

870
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,720
That's can't wait. I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm my my my long-term goal

871
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,480
And I was gonna talk about this my favorite my favorite

872
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:26,560
I think about about the pcp being a big thing is not even so much the the collaborative stuff because that's gonna be great

873
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,080
I love that because I love doing

874
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:28,640
Shit with you guys

875
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,680
I can't wait to do stuff with munchie and hippo and art things and like all that stuff

876
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,760
But my number one thing is the the the time the ability that like oh, I don't have to

877
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:45,040
Squall and squander my day away doing all this bullshit that I don't actually want to do because my number one big

878
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,680
Goal is because I started sources loss and it got immediately in rewrite hell and I figured out

879
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,080
Just a few months ago like okay

880
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,600
I know what the story is going to be and now that I know 3d my long-term goal

881
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,600
And I'm going to announce it and I'm trying to hold myself to it. I'm going to learn all this year

882
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,080
Okay, please

883
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,680
Please tom take it from me. Don't announce your comics before they're done. Please don't yeah, I

884
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,200
I fucking beg you tom. Don't make this mistake

885
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,160
Is gonna be good

886
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,960
All right munch, I'll I'll I'll I'll be a I'll be a safe boy for you

887
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,440
Yeah, I'm fucking crying. Speaking of which, how's your comic going munch?

888
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,760
It's going great

889
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,000
I still I still want to see your sketches, man. I'm still waiting

890
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,960
I'll show you everything I have. I'll give you everything

891
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,360
I'll give you everything I have

892
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,640
I'm going to eat batteries for you tom. I'll eat batteries

893
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,600
I mean if you want, I wasn't I wasn't

894
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:54,720
Anticipating that but hey picture of the investor grader, which is like a great that's against much of space that he's like

895
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,280
Dining against daily, you know

896
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:02,480
It's just investigable Nate sunglasses on it's like that scenario before but instead of a noose

897
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,560
It's just a cheese grader on

898
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,960
It's like a grindstone that he's just slowly being pushed forward towards and he's desperately trying to draw

899
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,360
Yes

900
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,160
Beautiful god. I mean what else is there to say anyone got any other

901
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,800
specific ideas that want to share anything?

902
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,880
This is good. We covered a lot of ground here. I

903
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,640
PCP olympics. We'll try it. We'll do the long jump. We'll do

904
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,200
We'll do the the monkey bars. Well guys, you know

905
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,680
Here's here's a literal thing that I would like to make part of canon to like force me to do it

906
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:38,160
It's always been my dream since I played final fantasy eight and zeal like level one zeal

907
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,520
Did a thing in final fantasy eight where he did 100 pull-ups before the game even started

908
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:49,680
It has always been my dream to do 100 pull-ups just like zeal and final fantasy eight and also to run up

909
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:55,520
I think it's like 64 flights of stairs just like cloud and sheenra hq at the beginning of final fantasy seven

910
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,880
Those are my true fitness goals for my life if I can achieve those

911
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:04,880
You just need to find a tall building to do that second one. I'll get tired though. It takes a lot of energy though

912
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,800
No, no, no one on the cold opens of the live action pcp

913
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,360
We'll just do we'll be you doing 100 pull-ups and then you're just the show like you're just like getting like

914
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,160
All right, that would be the pcp podcast for a bunch of internet creators here today

915
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,320
I will do that 100 pull-ups is not even unattainable. Your average person can do it if they just work out and

916
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,520
That's that's how you know you succeed innate if you can do 100 pull-ups before the show and then immediately start and not be winded

917
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,840
Or anything that's well, I'll be winded but yeah

918
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,040
You got it. You got to get better, dude. And so you got to be not be winded

919
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,880
So I'll just put that out there my record right now in high school was 50. What is this?

920
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,520
How does the pcp hq help you with this at all?

921
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,840
Oh, well because I want to set this fitness goal and I kind of have some idea of like a fitness show in some way

922
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:51,840
I mean, I don't know exactly. I plan to be a hashtag fit boy by the time of

923
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,760
Of hq. So so we can do a fitness show together. Okay. There you go. That's what I'm getting to

924
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:06,160
I'm so excited to be the only fat pcp member. I can finally be the token fat pcp member

925
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,080
I can finally achieve my my ultimate goal. I can't wait. I can't wait

926
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,000
By the way, uh, this is not a new show

927
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:20,160
But I want to fully illustrate that stealing your dad's food was easy would be way better if it was in person

928
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,440
It would be like a show imagine filming it in a car

929
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,080
Like imagine filming it with a dashboard cam

930
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,840
Oh, yeah

931
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:34,960
By the way, by the way, digi, uh, I plan to do p, uh, stealing your dad live, uh at radcon 3 and I have a costume

932
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,920
Oh

933
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:45,280
Like like, uh, the the the the the the munchie that you see depicted on uh on the the like, you know

934
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:50,320
The thumbnail is an outfit that I have in real life. Now. I've attained it. I will be wearing it

935
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,560
I will wear a costume as well. All right. Yeah. So so yeah, just imagine

936
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,320
There's no echo and you can see us eating the food

937
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,480
Instantly triple is good instantly. Mm-hmm. It would be incredibly would be great

938
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,720
Yeah, like even if we just made the same content, it would just be better

939
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,120
Like it would just be better done live

940
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,600
And uh, and uh, and then like

941
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,840
In addition to that like the fact that it opens up more opportunities for new things

942
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,240
Uh

943
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:25,440
Okay, two things here. First of all, ben, I remember you and not unreasonably here

944
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,600
But I remember you being very poo poo of the pcphq idea

945
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,160
Has anything changed for you?

946
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:36,800
Um, if I was poo poo about it, it was probably well

947
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,160
I mean because like me and me and digi and divu all live together

948
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:46,000
When we were kind of calling it, uh, pcphq for a while, but we didn't really do anything because like

949
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,240
I don't know. It wasn't

950
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,320
Everyone's doing their own shit, you know, you have to really plan something. Yeah, we were doing our own thing and like

951
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,920
I don't know

952
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,480
So I just I don't think that was what it was going to be

953
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:04,880
Like that that we called it hq sometimes at the time, but in hindsight that was not pcphq like the the idea of what it actually is

954
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,960
I think is still cool. And um

955
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,560
If I was poo poo about it, it was probably just because I didn't think it was going to happen

956
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,000
Um, but if it did, um, hey

957
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,720
Uh, mom's the word

958
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:22,480
Excellent, okay, okay. Let's continue talking about, you know, exactly what shows we're planning to do

959
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,560
But also as well, I would like to talk about

960
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:31,440
Uh, where this thing will be held where we think like like if there is even a time frame like we talked about this digi

961
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:39,360
Digi spoiled this conversation topic. But yeah, let's let okay for a while as hardcore pcp fans will know

962
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:43,840
We were thinking that atlanta georgia would be pcphq

963
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,120
But uh, but uh, that may have changed

964
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:53,120
After after a meet-up that all the pcb guys did in boston famously documented on twitter where I

965
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,040
wore a basket on my head

966
01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:01,840
My jacket is a scarf and and a home stuck t-shirt only in a freezing boston weather gift by the way my god

967
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:07,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's the place where we did a basket. I thought it was like an actual hat. No, that was that was a basket

968
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,320
I thought you had a fez

969
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,560
Please see twitter to compare the physiques of andrew hussey and munch shit. Please, please

970
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,760
Uh, yeah

971
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,200
All right, so so so yeah, uh, I

972
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:29,680
I I guess I'll describe it the way I I like like my

973
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:36,080
the way I interpreted pcphq and the change from atlanta to boston I

974
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:45,040
From the very inception of the idea pcphq was like I'm ready to fling myself wherever this may be

975
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,920
Whenever it may be 100% like like instantly when pcphq is settled

976
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,280
I will I will migrate there like fucking moths to a flame and then uh, you know

977
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,320
It it was shaping up to be atlanta for various reasons

978
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,240
And so I uh, you know, like, you know, I want to see where I will be living

979
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,680
I want to see where it's like

980
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,000
I want to go to atlanta and then I went to atlanta to see ben and which was a great trip

981
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:13,200
And from when I saw atlanta, it was awful. It was the worst thing I've ever seen my entire life. It was dirty

982
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,520
It was mucky. It was fucking disgusting. I mean every level it was repulsive

983
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I would no wonder bend lids there

984
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,040
Um, I hated it. It was real

985
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,600
shit and uh, all right

986
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:31,680
And and and then for other reasons I found myself, uh, uh, like like a month or two later in

987
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,240
Or actually previous to this

988
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,080
In boston and boston was a fucking like it was

989
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,280
As close to nirvana as I could get after kurt cobain's death god rest his soul

990
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,240
It was fucking it was pristine. There were very little homeless people

991
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:53,040
You could actually walk places which which to a west coaster is very strange

992
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:59,200
We know it actually walked to a location to location. You fucking east coaster ticket for granted. That is pretty sweet

993
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,520
It it was great. And so I

994
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,720
In this boston meetup that happened during christmas

995
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,760
I launched because because I knew that uh, nat and digi were the high profile targets

996
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:15,440
I had to assassinate jfk style in order to get my whim of a pcphq in boston

997
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:22,240
So I set out I I I divided and conquered and I started to to convert digi to to my hellish religion

998
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,400
And I went on a three day hard sell to try and get him to move to boston

999
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,360
I was curious about this story because it just seemed one day digi was all of a sudden really into boston

1000
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,520
And I knew there was some involvement here, but yeah, go on. I want to know the details here

1001
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,680
Digi, how well did this work? I mean it was pretty simple because

1002
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:45,040
Munchie has like well catalogued what I like about cities and we basically have the same

1003
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,040
We're both like huge architecture nerds

1004
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:52,320
We're both huge fans of density in cities like of being able to just like go shop to shop

1005
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,040
And it's just like an endless series of things to do, you know

1006
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:01,600
And so munchie not only like told me that that was what it was like the night before we went out on the town

1007
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:06,720
But like we then went out and like he took me to the most dense place imaginable, you know

1008
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,040
So as soon as I saw that place, I was like, this is the coolest fucking thing I've ever seen. So I'm curious

1009
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,440
Place we were all the fucking market place. Okay

1010
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,480
Like it's just an it's like literally like 200 stalls of random

1011
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:24,080
Food and other crap in like the span of one block. It's fucking insanity

1012
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,880
And uh, I was I was real hyped for that and we we just walked around

1013
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,360
The city a lot like we just went to lots of different stores and shit and I was like this place is cool

1014
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:39,280
It's really easy to get around it feels really safe and people there are beautiful for some reason

1015
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,320
Everyone looks like

1016
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,040
Stock of DNA quality up there, you know, you know

1017
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:50,960
so, uh, yeah, I was just really excited about the city in general and uh, and then like

1018
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,880
You know munchie fucking like really sold me on it

1019
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,240
And then may was like I've always wanted to live in Boston and I was like, why didn't you never say that before like

1020
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:07,440
Fucking this place is cool. You know, so we both got real hype about it. And um, yeah, it's just there you go

1021
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,280
It seems like a cool place to live

1022
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,240
Well, that's your convenient for me. That was always my particular

1023
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,120
favorite place since my family lives like an hour away

1024
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,040
So I think I was always resistant to checking out Boston because you guys had suggested it

1025
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:24,000
but I had always kind of thought that a everyone was just suggesting it for convenience and uh,

1026
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,800
b

1027
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,320
That I didn't realize it was it's as big a city as it was like I didn't realize Boston's like huge

1028
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,880
You didn't realize Boston was amazing. It's like well relatively speaking. It's no

1029
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,600
I didn't realize it's like as big as Atlanta though

1030
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,360
Like it's as it's as big as it's like one of the biggest fucking cities in the

1031
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:47,680
Second or third city that your city is named after when you settle as America in civilization five. It's amazing

1032
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:55,440
Well, I think in my head boss, I like my vision of Boston is like a tea party like

1033
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,200
My vision of Boston was like a very flat place where everything's a tea shop

1034
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,240
Everything's a tea shop Jesus fucking Christ

1035
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,560
All this stuff Ben described to me about like living in Boston. He's like, oh, I take the train all the time

1036
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,640
And I go to hipster coffee shops and like that's

1037
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:22,400
You know the Boston tea party wasn't actually a tea party. We like said, fuck you British people in your tea dumped it all into the water

1038
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,880
We're like we're gonna catch you up on the floor. We could be more anti-tea if we tried

1039
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,920
I'm aware, but

1040
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,200
I just

1041
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,920
My whole picture of Boston. I could just imagine you just you hear Boston tea party

1042
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,800
It's just a bunch of people in triangle hats sipping on tea

1043
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,120
And you're like, that's what it must be now

1044
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,120
dude

1045
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,040
It just so happens I saw a tv show about a guy who goes on trains around the world

1046
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:59,040
And he was going around in on like the Boston trains and drinking tea and having oysters. There you go. There you go

1047
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,640
It looks cool though. It's apparently tinder dating explained it

1048
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,840
Was he tinder dating too? This is my vision of Ben going around Boston. It's just like

1049
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,400
In his fifties, he's an old man with a weird jacket and he's like, oh, yes. I like

1050
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:22,560
Incidentally, Boston is the 22nd largest city in the United States with a population of 673,000

1051
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:28,240
Yeah, at least it's not the thousand smallest dick Nate like you. Well, you got me there

1052
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,760
You just barely made the list

1053
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,360
For the record though, I uh, don't even care, uh, if we end up in Boston or not

1054
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:43,520
I will go anywhere because I have I have dedicated my entire being to becoming financially independent

1055
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,600
So I can do whatever is necessary to achieve my goals in life. So I will do whatever I have to do

1056
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,120
I catch my cold. I will go anywhere. I I just would prefer it to be Boston because Atlanta was gross

1057
01:15:53,680 --> 01:16:00,080
Sure. I yeah, I haven't been to like Austin, Texas the best I think because I kind of I'm still holding a dream

1058
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,280
A candle for a dream because I want to work with side live with side forever

1059
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:09,360
But also besides that like the anime like voice acting industry is there and I've always had a little bit of a dream

1060
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,400
You know ever since I was a kid to maybe get into that voice carry bro

1061
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,960
Oh, yes

1062
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,960
In the disney bros anime adaptation

1063
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:22,400
And you know what people keep telling me that I'm just like my voice is great and everyone keeps complimenting and I'm like, you know what

1064
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:28,160
People have convinced me. Maybe I am okay at this. Maybe I can do it. You just got to take the root of become famous

1065
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,240
And you can become a voice actor

1066
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,920
Well, and I mean he's a great voice actor

1067
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,960
I mean fucking like Ethan and ila got to do voice acting and fucking some what was it payday too?

1068
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:42,640
Like if you become famous, you could just fucking flex up just express interest in doing it and people

1069
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:48,000
Fucking total biscuit has like a like a starcraft 2 voice pack or like some shit like that. Yeah, that's yeah

1070
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:52,880
All that shit's great. Yeah, that's the dream. All right. Do we want to move on to questions?

1071
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,760
I picked out this time like five or a total dawn

1072
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,800
Anyone how?

1073
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,200
Conclusive statements. I've heard I've heard that boston is quite an english

1074
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:07,680
Styled city because it was like one of the first ones. Yep. Yep. Yeah, and they made it. It is not very well

1075
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,080
Yeah, which is why I would like it. It would be like, oh, there's I remember this sort of thing

1076
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,920
I remember being lost and confused. This is just like home

1077
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,640
It is the epitome of

1078
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,200
Yeah, east coast cities tend to be like a labyrinth much in the way that london is but like

1079
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,920
Yeah, it's definitely a cluster punk of cities

1080
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,080
What's so impressive about boston is that in spite of it being like sprawling and weirdly laid out and stuff like the trains

1081
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:38,480
Take you fucking everywhere. Anyways, like yeah, they somehow have snake them all around to make them work. Yeah

1082
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,520
All I'm saying is I would prefer a labyrinth than something like new york, which scares me

1083
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:49,120
It makes me feel like I'm on like chicago literally freaks like flying out of chicago freaks me out

1084
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,960
Because it looks like a giant grid for as far as the eye can see and it's fucking disgusting

1085
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:57,360
All I'm saying is there should be from softs next next game should be

1086
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,880
Patriot souls where you play in boston and you go around the town and you kill colonial people

1087
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:07,200
And you slay the redcoats and yeah, you use tea to restore your hp

1088
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,720
You drop tea to restore it if you drop it

1089
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,800
Find an ocean to hurl a box of tea into that restores

1090
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,480
Okay, all right day one purchase for me

1091
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:27,600
Just settle out of here. Uh, what is the time frame? Do we think I think did you say you're gonna be moving in may?

1092
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:34,000
I my lease goes up at the end of may so june 1st. I got to be out of here. So uh,

1093
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:40,000
Yeah, and boston's real convenient because it's a six hour drive as opposed to the

1094
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,480
18 hour drive that it would take to get to atlanta. It's closer to people

1095
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,200
Closer to families. So, you know, it's it's it's also convenient for me

1096
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,840
That's cool. I will I will say and I don't I don't want to like shut on anybody's prey

1097
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:59,120
But I will say the only the only negative thing about boston that we'll probably have to like consider is that if we do the bonus

1098
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,200
Yeah, I mean

1099
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:05,680
Depending on depending on who we can get there at the right time the right place by scheming it could be a good thing

1100
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,680
But um, no if we do like a legitimate business with a pcp

1101
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,080
I know that business taxes in the state are very high

1102
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,440
You know, I I specifically talked to my dad about this and I mean my dad's not like a genius

1103
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,960
He doesn't know business stuff across the world

1104
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:24,640
But he was saying that the the taxes there are relatively similar to neighboring states at least. I don't know whatever

1105
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,800
I mean, all these things will have to be accounted for the northeast is a relatively expensive area to live in in general

1106
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:36,320
I think compared to the south, but it's you pay for like you pay for what you get

1107
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,120
It's quality. Yeah, it's a good place to live, you know, so it's like worth it

1108
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:49,520
Um, all right. Well, anyway, all right, we're burnt out. I think I think I think the closing thing to say is just like like

1109
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:55,280
This is our dream. This is what we want with all of our fucking heart. This is what we're at least for me

1110
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,960
This is what I'm working towards. This is the goal in my life

1111
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:05,600
These are what like pcp is what all of my actions and and and and you know inspiration is leading towards

1112
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:13,840
This is my motivation is getting pcp hq off the ground and meeting up with you guys and being real life friends in real life

1113
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:18,320
To like so I can improve my artistic and personal, uh, you know life

1114
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,480
That's what I want with all my fucking heart

1115
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:25,280
I have as you guys know and no one outside knows because I rarely talk about it in public

1116
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:31,200
I spend so much time devoted to pcp issues and trying to work out problems and organize everything

1117
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,800
For the sake of making this come true and keeping everyone in contact

1118
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,440
Really like the the whole point of making the pcp was so that I could stay in contact with you guys

1119
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,200
So I could coldly and calculately use your artistic merits to you know, make my life better

1120
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:52,160
I mean that's that's exactly like at the end of the day. There's a great utilitarian reason for us all to hang out that like

1121
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:59,200
I want to make the best art possible and I want it to be not only the best but like I want it to be profitable and

1122
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,520
I see these as

1123
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:07,840
These people I'm speaking to as creative voices who like are not only capable of putting out

1124
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,560
Not better things than I can in some ways, you know, like you guys all have skills

1125
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,520
I don't have some of you are funnier than me. Some of you are better editors

1126
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,480
Some of you have more creative ideas, you know, or some of you can just draw and I can't even do that

1127
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,840
So like having you all around like obviously fills in gaps in what I'm capable of and so

1128
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:30,560
Like let's say I want to make a video that the strength is in the charisma of the host

1129
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,080
Maybe I'm gonna go straight a script for Nate. I don't know, you know

1130
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,000
There's a lot of possibilities in the future

1131
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,240
Maybe half the pcp fades into the background

1132
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:42,080
The other half becomes the popular people and we just go straight for you guys, you know

1133
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:46,880
Like whoever's got the prettiest face and becomes famous like I'm down to make this happen

1134
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:52,080
However, it's gonna happen, you know, imagine the munchie and nate pretty boy show. Yeah

1135
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:56,960
Oh, oh, yeah, the two most conventionally attractive pcp members there are. Hey, man

1136
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
All I'm saying is it's big boy season lazy

1137
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,160
Ladies get you one get you one

1138
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:06,240
I'm just saying that like when you look at the when you look at the game grumps or red letter media

1139
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:13,120
Like they've got guys on the payroll who aren't in all the videos, you know, they like red letter media's got josh

1140
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:18,640
He's always behind the camera and those other videos, you know, he's always there, but like I would give occasionally

1141
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:24,560
I would give anything to look at red letter media's like financial breakdown. How they operate behind the scenes

1142
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,280
God and the game grumps too. I want to study these things

1143
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,680
I'm honestly considering like taking business courses to like understand this shit more

1144
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:36,640
Dude, just get like a how to fucking get a business for dummies book and read it. You you read textbooks

1145
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,080
That's what yeah, yeah, I really should just like google and stuff

1146
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,760
But yeah, man, I want to cultivate all this

1147
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:46,240
So I'm capable of making my dreams real because I accept responsibility for making these things happen in my life

1148
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,640
No one's going to give it to me. I gotta I gotta make it happen

1149
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,600
Listen to go talk to Jeff for like hours. Yeah, he just had a chill properly. It's true. We need to know

1150
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,960
Uh, I'm I'm so glad I've started this journey with all of you

1151
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,040
And I can't wait to see how it ends up when we're all fucking dead in addition Africa

1152
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:08,080
And that's the bad situation we go from that's that's that's the the good end at the end of all this

1153
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,880
You don't even want to know what the bad end of this is

1154
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:20,400
All right, all right enough enough faffing around. Let's get to the fucking comment the questions

1155
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:27,840
Uh, I've got I've collected five that aren't shit. It was not easy. You guys need to ask better questions. Told you please always

1156
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,640
Uh, first one's from banksinator

1157
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:37,520
He asks do you think there's enough time left in your life to achieve all of your goals slash try everything you want to do

1158
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:42,320
I'm gonna add on to this. Let's let's let's say without the singularity

1159
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,560
Like without the singularity, let's say none of us gets to put our brains in computers

1160
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:50,880
Do we have enough time left in our life to achieve all our goals? I I'm 17 years old

1161
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,880
Well, I don't know how big your goals are. I mean, maybe you wanted to be like a Mozart and it might already be too late for that

1162
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:02,800
I mean, he's still alive. Could he still be alive? Okay. I'm sorry. Go on. He's trapped inside my 64

1163
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,640
I I think definitely like there's no reason I can't continue to be making art at 60

1164
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:13,840
Yeah, I don't I don't have any I don't have any goals that are like time sensitive

1165
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,440
Like my goals are just like spend my life making my stuff

1166
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,360
And that's it

1167
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,800
Honestly, some of my biggest heroes in life. This is gonna sound weird right now

1168
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:30,240
Our guys like Aaron Hansen and like jenke yuger in terms of how they just like created something like huge and just like

1169
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:36,800
You know, they just fucking built an empire and I kind of hope to do something similar to that the pcp is certainly

1170
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,720
First thing I want to do

1171
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:42,560
Or my first approach to doing so and I definitely think I can do it

1172
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,040
I definitely think I will let me be the first to say no

1173
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,080
I don't think I have enough time left in my life to achieve all of my goals and try everything I want to do

1174
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,240
I do think that as I get older

1175
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:57,440
I will have fewer like some of those are gonna fall off like some of the shit that I've always wanted to do

1176
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,520
I'm just gonna be like, I don't care anymore, you know, or it's definitely too late

1177
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,120
um

1178
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,120
Too late to become a porn actor

1179
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,720
You know

1180
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,320
I'm engaged now

1181
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:14,240
And uh, and I'm in my late 20s. So I don't know about that. I can never let you be

1182
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,280
Just gotta sit down and have a very serious conversation

1183
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:23,120
I can never be any kind of athlete not that I particularly want to but I I don't know

1184
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:28,240
Yeah, that's that's the thing though. Do you like there's loads of things like I like uh, like, no

1185
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:34,080
Wouldn't it be cool if I had done that all my life, but I don't actually give this there's definitely a part of me like

1186
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:41,600
Like I I like tennis as a sport like as one to play and I've always wanted to learn to play it just to do it casually

1187
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,840
Just to have a sport I play and like I've tried to get it off the ground a couple times

1188
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,880
It hasn't really hasn't really worked out. I'm really stuck, you know

1189
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,320
And I'm kind of feeling like if I don't get into tennis in the next couple years

1190
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:56,720
I'm probably just gonna shelf that, you know, so like that's the kind of the way I look at it

1191
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:03,040
You could be a tp hq tennis court. That's a stretch if you have if if you have a kid

1192
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:08,720
You could you could be a tennis dad and just beat them because I uh, I I'd be doing my my hero scooby 1961

1193
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,520
A disservice if I didn't say you can get fit at any age at least up to 60. Oh, no, no

1194
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,560
I'm not saying I can't get fit. I'm just saying I don't do I don't like actually want to go play tennis

1195
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,600
Like yeah, okay. I I enjoy the idea of it, but then I go out and do it and I'm like, well

1196
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,120
That was I guess that was the thing and we're gonna do this tomorrow

1197
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:31,120
Like how long is appropriate between tennis sessions like how

1198
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:37,360
How after how many days do you say? Oh, this isn't a thing. I'm really doing actively anymore

1199
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:43,920
Like do you have to do it once a week in order to say like oh, I play tennis sometimes in my spare time or like is once a month enough

1200
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,320
You know, is it like bowling you do it once a year and then you're like, oh, I don't bowl

1201
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:53,200
Well, it's a spectrum and and you can say it at any point on the spectrum

1202
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,160
But everyone above it who does it more than you will laugh at you

1203
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:00,000
Yeah, but you'll be legit to anyone lower than any that's true in any uh

1204
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:05,440
Did I did you I was gonna ask you, uh, how was the um

1205
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,320
porn manga going dude

1206
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:15,280
It's it's not not really going we've been busy with youtube instead of drawing and we haven't been listening to the stupid

1207
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,360
Fucking two-hour podcasts at all

1208
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,400
Um, yeah

1209
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,400
Turns out they're kind of mind-numbing

1210
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:25,520
Because it's like two hours of random topics and they work really well as digi daily videos

1211
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,880
But they do not work as well as like just listening to two hours of me just talk about random fucking shit

1212
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:37,360
Like did you I have never lost more respect or like like like like I've never like thought

1213
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:43,040
Like like I've never thought that someone's IQ has dropped as much as I thought when I heard you say

1214
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,160
We're going to listen to podcasts of me

1215
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:50,400
For two hours every day and and if we aren't good at art

1216
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:56,240
But after one month, then we are going to quit and we will realize that it's not what we want to do anymore

1217
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:00,800
I never thought of like a worse or ill-conceived notion than that

1218
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,600
Fantastic

1219
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,160
I'm glad you recognize it better than I did

1220
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,000
I just

1221
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,760
Well ben messaged me like oh, I watched your fucking uh one video your mokoto shinkai video

1222
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:22,720
It's an hour and a half long like five times while drawing and I was like, oh that sounds like

1223
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,080
I could do that because I listened back to my own shit, you know

1224
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:32,000
But that's that's you you you've like you've put the cart before the horse. I think

1225
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:37,920
Yeah, he's kind of right. Yeah, you confused you confuse the the causal order in which those things occur

1226
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,360
Because one listens to digi videos one develops

1227
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,120
You channel the skill

1228
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:04,480
When you equip weapons you gain skill points and then once you've equipped that weapon for long enough you've unlocked that skill

1229
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,880
That's what digi's podcasts are like just listen to them and you'll be unlocking skills at no time

1230
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,080
That's what you think

1231
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:19,520
Like a japanese shrine and he like channels spirits whenever it turns on a new digi video and the flavor of the video is how good he is at art

1232
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,280
Okay, oh

1233
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:31,280
Okay, someone is good at math confirmed for me like okay, wait, wait, wait, wait

1234
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,600
Never mind. Hold on

1235
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:39,520
It'd be 100 120 hours, right? Like if if it was two hours every day for 30 days

1236
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,600
It's 120 hours of drawing practice

1237
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,960
I think that would be enough to tell if you wanted to keep doing it or not, you know

1238
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,720
Yeah, that's 62 hours a day. Oh, what the fuck ever it's 60 hours

1239
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,000
Uh

1240
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,600
Point being 60 hours is longer than I would ever play of a video game

1241
01:29:53,840 --> 01:30:00,320
It's longer than I would ever do most things, you know, like drawing is a skill that you have to invest thousands of hours in

1242
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:06,240
No, I know but the problem is just to figure out if you like it enough to do to get good like sure

1243
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,880
Okay, when you are someone like me who you only really draw like once every six months

1244
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:17,040
You draw one time like you have no real way of gauging your skill or like how fast you could evolve, you know

1245
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:21,600
Anytime I've ever sat down and like consistently drawn for five or six days

1246
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,880
The pictures get better because you develop like the most basic skills just by like drawing at all you like realize

1247
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,920
Oh, if I want to convey this I just need to put a line here

1248
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,800
Like you didn't know that before you tried to draw that pose, you know

1249
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:38,640
So I think if you're trying to draw shit, and I mean two hours is enough time

1250
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,320
You're gonna complete multiple drawings

1251
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:45,520
So you're drawing multiple things a day every day you're trying out different poses and I drew some some pretty

1252
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:53,760
Daftly decent porn. I can't post anywhere because it's too fucking extreme. It's like a lolly getting like I've got like a gigantic drill

1253
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,720
Just like pulverizing some lolly's cunt and it's

1254
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,200
I've got a bunch of shit

1255
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,200
All right, we're going down

1256
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,200
I don't know where to put it

1257
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,200
Like depending on anatomy

1258
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:26,560
Like expression like poses all these things have to have mastery over to make even semi like

1259
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,440
Decent porn he's just gonna start with that immediately

1260
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:32,640
Drill in the cut and then work backwards

1261
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:39,920
That's my I mean most of the way I draw is just like I just envision something and I try to recreate it in in art

1262
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,920
You know, and I got sure I

1263
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,560
I study a lot like I

1264
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:49,920
When I look at pictures I like try to study how they did it, you know, like I'm someone who thinks about art

1265
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:54,720
I just have not practiced it, you know, I haven't tried to do it and like

1266
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:01,280
Because it's frustrating to be bad at something like it's frustrating to draw and suck and like but if you see progress

1267
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,360
That it alleviates some of that frustration

1268
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:06,560
You think like oh well the stuff I made at the end of the month the stuff better than the stuff

1269
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,440
I made at the beginning

1270
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,720
Does that make me feel good enough to keep going or do I feel like

1271
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:16,400
I don't actually enjoy this enough to make it worth making this slow progress because I'm gonna have to do this for years

1272
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,280
If I want to be good

1273
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:21,600
I think our art boys here would say you got to stick to the fundamentals. Did you stick to the fundamentals?

1274
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,880
I mean, I'm kind of that good at art

1275
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:32,000
But it just the the the you know drawing a stupid piece of shit drawing of like a stick figure is fun

1276
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:37,040
Enough for me to continue drawing occasionally. Oh, yeah, and I mean, I think I've been doing like, you know

1277
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:43,040
I did stick figure comics my whole childhood. I've done I've took every kind of design class like I know all the

1278
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:48,480
I know the art basics. It's just a yeah discord digiprody. That didn't involve any art at all

1279
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,200
You know

1280
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,800
But yeah, I mean

1281
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:58,080
I think that the main the place I'm at right now is the place where you need to practice a lot to have anything

1282
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:01,280
Competent come out, you know, and so to me it made sense

1283
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,480
I don't know why I'm trying to justify this so hard. Let's just move on to the next fucking question

1284
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,680
Okay, so the point is did you suck start? He'll never be good and let me also just throw out

1285
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:13,440
That I always wanted to be a scientist and one who uncovers the truths of the world to get back to the actual question here

1286
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,080
About things that we'll never end up doing I in my heart of hearts will always hate myself

1287
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,240
for like being a guy who's like

1288
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:26,080
Kind of like commenting on stuff instead of actually just making the tangible stuff and maybe one day that'll change

1289
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:31,760
I hope that'll change one day. It's time for a question that only you and maybe I can actually answer

1290
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,440
From horse power asks, how do I become more disciplined?

1291
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,520
Oh

1292
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,400
Okay, that is an interesting whip yourself from the back

1293
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:46,880
Here okay. Here's literally what I did like like things like me and mafava and uh, like weagua

1294
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:51,360
Require discipline to get done as well as like fitness stuff. Here's what you do

1295
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:58,480
Except look at yourself study your behavior patterns. This is what I did recognize your massive personality flaws

1296
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,840
And how you have failed at everything you've ever tried to do just recognize

1297
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:06,400
What's going wrong and then just structure your life in such a way that you cannot

1298
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:12,880
Not do the thing like so you completely go around these weaknesses like for me whenever there's like I've got a long deadline

1299
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,080
And I've got like a month to do it. I just won't do it

1300
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,960
I will fail and I always have my whole life

1301
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:23,760
So instead the fix was that to this was to recognize the times when I did manage to get things done

1302
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,680
And the answer was extremely clear

1303
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:30,800
Deadlines deadlines would allowed me to make tbap happen. I mean, you know, ben was involved. I just mean like it helped me

1304
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,840
Set yeah, well, it's true. It was true for both of us

1305
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:38,560
Be creative with your deadlines by the way because like my for instance

1306
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,880
I have a let's say

1307
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:46,880
The two weeks review a podcast I do for my patrons which comes out every Tuesday on well

1308
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:52,560
It's two alternating podcasts, but they come out on Tuesday right at the start of the day like midnight Tuesday

1309
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:56,720
So I haven't written on my schedule like Tuesday do this podcast

1310
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,880
But it's supposed to come out at 12

1311
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,160
You know, so really the deadline should be the week before

1312
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,000
It should be like do next week's podcast by this Tuesday

1313
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:11,680
PCP is recorded a week in advance for instance, you know, like the deadline for PCP to be recorded is Saturday

1314
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:14,560
And then the release is is eight days later

1315
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:20,800
So like I just think that's really important to achieving discipline is to make sure your deadlines are as

1316
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,600
immediate as possible like and if you think you can do with project in three days

1317
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:31,200
Set your deadline for three days and then try to get it done in those three days. Yeah, I I've had a problem with this

1318
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,600
because I

1319
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:39,440
Did like a month last year of a video every day and posting the video was the deadline

1320
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,640
Like I had to get it up before the end or like if it was like an hour like 10 minutes later, then that's fine. I'll just put it up

1321
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,800
um

1322
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,800
I've tried to do that again, but like

1323
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,880
Understanding that doing one video per day will kill me at the rate at the the the like

1324
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,520
Quality level I was doing him

1325
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,520
So I say all right two days

1326
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,640
But then then you start to slip even just even just two days

1327
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:08,720
Like spreads out into a week like sort of like it accelerates the amount of time you think you have

1328
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:15,120
To fuck around and I don't know how to well. How do I like give a deadline for two days instead of one day?

1329
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:18,560
It's okay to like make it to like try stuff like that and then fail

1330
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,680
But you got to recalibrate like for example you give you do heavy editing on like all your videos and stuff

1331
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,680
There it's just it's an unsustainable business model to say like okay in one day

1332
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,680
Like I'll get one of these Kirby videos done

1333
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:32,640
So like you just have to and here's the other really important thing

1334
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:38,560
Make your deadlines like either publicly available so that if you fail people will give you shit

1335
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:44,640
And you will feel bad and face financial and social repercussions if you fail you have to put stakes

1336
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,760
You have to do it. I yeah, I mean I could do that. It's just

1337
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:53,600
The the videos like I want them to come out weekly and I want to make them faster than one per week

1338
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,600
Which is unfortunate if I it doesn't work like that like if nobody sees that I finished it

1339
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,560
It doesn't feel like I have a deadline. I think uh,

1340
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:10,160
Unfortunately like the the reality of being disciplined is you just have to hold yourself to a high standard because like if you are letting

1341
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:15,760
It be the social standing and everything like you just said Nate like the problem is you have to care enough about that

1342
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:21,040
Like I have a lot of daily shows that come out late all the time

1343
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,720
Like you know or like weekly or none of my shows ever come out on time

1344
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:29,760
It's what I'm getting at everything's fucking late and it's because people just expect it from me at this point

1345
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,560
So like I've just got a low standard of like

1346
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:37,680
Being me like I don't I don't hold myself to a high enough standard to have discipline is basically what I'm saying

1347
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:43,360
But you you there is a social clout to doing that like people have more or less respect for you for it or trust in you and like

1348
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:48,240
You know that's the thing that's the thing you have to have something to lose if you don't do it

1349
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:53,120
I mean whatever that is for you like right now with we Agua we Agua has been kind of slipping later and later

1350
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:57,360
And like I just kind of like missed a week recently when it was just like I was just too

1351
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,800
But like I couldn't do it and I didn't even bother to announce it. I was just like whatever

1352
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,480
I'll just like get it out when it comes out

1353
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:07,360
Um and you know like this is me sinking into a bad pattern that I want to avoid

1354
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,040
And really the way to fix it is what I've been trying to do to like limit

1355
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:15,440
How much work I actually have to get done and you know like make the video shorter because they're way too long

1356
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:20,160
They used to be like the most popular we Agua by far has like 150,000 views or something

1357
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,080
And like it was like the easiest one to make

1358
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:26,560
I only talked for like five minutes about the actual topic and now I'm doing like half an hour

1359
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,600
Just like on the base top before I even do the other shit like what am I even doing?

1360
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:34,000
You got to recognize these things and calibrate yourself. You've got to take responsibility

1361
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:39,840
I also think people need to look out for the pitfall of the I missed one and now I don't care anymore

1362
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:45,760
Such as like if this is a big thing for the gym you miss a gym day and you'll be like, oh well

1363
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,840
I already missed the day so

1364
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:51,600
The whole schedule my whole schedule shot, you know, and then it's just you never go back to the gym

1365
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:56,960
And like then every two weeks you're like resetting like okay time to go back and then every time you miss a day

1366
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,120
It's like you just got to make sure you're in there every day

1367
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:04,800
Like you just got to make sure you got to plan your life around getting in there every day and forcing yourself in there

1368
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,400
That's what discipline is, you know

1369
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,760
It's it's easy to it's easy to lose lose perspective on something

1370
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,960
Like if you're trying to make something into a schedule and like you fuck it up

1371
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:17,920
Like you haven't really fucked yourself because you missed one like you just missed the one thing

1372
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,400
Right, like it doesn't have to ruin your schedule, but it's easy to let it do that for me right now on things

1373
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,200
I'm really trying to me. I'm working out pretty regularly

1374
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:32,240
But for me, I'm trying to fix my diet and like I'm doing calorie counting every day and like when I miss a date with that

1375
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,480
It's so easy to just like get out of the swing of it

1376
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:37,440
But yeah, I mean this whole thing is yeah, I couldn't agree more

1377
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,240
You got to you got to keep the momentum going keep the ball rolling

1378
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,680
And I think it's also about like understanding who you are and like setting realistic expectation

1379
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,880
Because like if you shoot for the moon right out of the gate going from like zero to a hundred

1380
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:55,280
You're never gonna let yourself down everything begins by understanding who you are and what you need in order to succeed

1381
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,880
You have to start one of the things that I that I just changed recently

1382
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,840
It's like I had a schedule for the last couple months where like I had like

1383
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:04,880
Monday I do something Tuesday do something else because I have a bunch of things

1384
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,440
I want to get done and I just I can't switch tasks like that

1385
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,880
Like I'm super unit task

1386
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,880
Like I have to just get one thing done

1387
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,520
Because if I don't if I if I because I had like oh, okay

1388
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:18,240
I'll do a drawing on Monday and that'll do 3d Tuesday and Wednesday and then I'll do a video on Thursday

1389
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,360
I'm like none of those things would get done in those one days

1390
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:25,920
I'd start something the next day start something else and so the next day I'd still be thinking about the task

1391
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,680
I didn't finish the day before so my attention just got divided and nothing got done

1392
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:34,880
So like this month I'm just like fuck it like I'm just doing one thing until it's done like yeah, even if

1393
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,560
Ideally like I'd get the exact same amount of stuff done, but just because I'm

1394
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,160
Not worried about something else now and I'm just focusing on the one thing

1395
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,280
Like it has a better chance of being and here's and a very good point

1396
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,480
And here's the thing that a lot of people miss about this whole process

1397
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:56,640
Be trying to do this be trying to stick to a schedule and then after sometime a month a couple months six months a year

1398
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,240
Look back at what you accomplished doing things the way you've been doing

1399
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:04,800
And really think about if it's getting you where you want to go you have to reassess

1400
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,440
And decide like that's exactly what I did before me in math

1401
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,320
I recognize this is not getting me where I want to go

1402
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:14,640
I have to change things and it's been a great success. So I recommend it's hard

1403
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,000
It's hard to change

1404
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:23,280
It's hard to change even if you want to but you just gotta put your priorities in order and decide like what's the most important thing for you

1405
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:29,120
You know like doing things the way you've been doing them or or something else that you need to change something in order to get to

1406
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,040
Tom on something similar to what you just said

1407
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:39,760
Let me explain to you guys the enemy of alligators. Like this is this is the reason gators taking so long

1408
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:45,360
It's what I like to call morally convenient procrastination. Oh boy

1409
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:49,120
Go on. Yeah, I rest in peace to boo

1410
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,160
Oh no

1411
01:41:52,240 --> 01:42:00,880
Um, I will be writing investigator and then and then you know, just just so like like just so happens

1412
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,720
I'll get a message from someone like hey, like I want to commission you're like, oh, hey

1413
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:11,280
Can you design my t-shirts or like? Oh, hey, can you can you make a thing for my Kickstarter? And I'll be like, yes, of course

1414
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,920
I would love to do that

1415
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:18,960
I would love that with all of my heart and then I can be like, well, okay

1416
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:25,600
I'm not working on investigator right now, but I'm doing this really cool epic thing for the walls my friends

1417
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,760
And so I can justify it to myself like oh, I'm not getting this work done. I'm getting other work done

1418
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,400
But that's how most of my vlogs come to be actually

1419
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:37,600
Yeah, all everything that's not investigator is worthless. It's much. Yeah. I'm so sorry

1420
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,040
This you know, this is a great point and it's like god. I don't know

1421
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Oh, fuck wait keep going. I lost track of my thought

1422
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:52,720
All right. Well, I was gonna give another motivation advice. Um, or what the fuck can we talk about discipline?

1423
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:58,880
One of the ways I disciplined myself and this is probably the most effective trick I've used on myself

1424
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,280
I'm obsessed with having a clean desktop

1425
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:07,120
Like I don't want to have more than one row of or one column rather of icons on my desktop

1426
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:13,280
So I just keep all of my project files on the desktop so that I have to do them to clean the fucking desktop

1427
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:18,000
Good idea. Like it drives me so insane if there's more than one row that I will literally like

1428
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:23,120
I'll sit down and I'll just get frustrated and edit like all the stuff I have there just to get rid of it

1429
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,360
You know, all right guys, listen, I remember what I was going to say

1430
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,800
This is where

1431
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:33,040
Objectivism comes into the picture and where okay when you look back on your life on your deathbed

1432
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:38,480
Only you will give a shit about how successful your life was how much you accomplished

1433
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,640
Everyone else isn't going to give a fuck about you

1434
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:46,320
Only you have the power to make your dreams come true and only you will have to live with yourself

1435
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,480
And what you accomplished when you're on your deathbed

1436
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:55,280
Do you want to look back on your life and say I fucking did it. I was a fucking pimp. I slayed queen

1437
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,120
I was the yas boy

1438
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:01,440
I did everything I wanted to do and I worked so fucking hard and I achieved great things in my life

1439
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:07,280
Because people will just placate you and lie to you and tell you that you're doing everything great

1440
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,680
And I don't care if you're a fucking 50 year old man

1441
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:15,280
You got like four kids if you want to be I don't know a fucking anime voice actor anything like yeah

1442
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,240
You could just say well, I gotta take care of my fucking kids. What am I gonna do man?

1443
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:20,240
I don't have time to make my dreams come true

1444
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:25,760
Only you will look back at yourself on your deathbed and say god damn it. I had all these kids

1445
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:28,240
That's cool and all but I never achieved my fucking dream

1446
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,320
No one else is going to give a shit

1447
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:35,600
You have to care about yourself put your priorities first people. I don't say to ignore responsibilities

1448
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:40,240
I'm saying literally sacrifice all sleep until your dream comes true

1449
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,680
If that's what you have to do

1450
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:48,000
Whatever it fucking takes because only you only have one fucking chance to make it real one shot the love of god

1451
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:55,040
Make it happen people to seize everything. It's 10 luck 20 skill 50 percent concentrated power

1452
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,560
Oh

1453
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,880
100% reason to remember the name

1454
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,560
Oh, that's beautiful and inspirational. Let's ask you to answer an equally

1455
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:10,400
Great question. Jayhawk DX asks a favorite flavored milk strawberry

1456
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,560
Oh, hey, it's it's famous sex havers strawberry milk on the show everybody

1457
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:29,680
Strawberry milk that was hit with a uh an accent twig

1458
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:37,680
Dude is an accent twig a.k.a. some dank weed

1459
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:48,320
Oh, yeah, I like I like skim milk. I like skim milk. That's all I let up slavered milk. You fucking asshole

1460
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:54,240
It's flavored like milk. That's me. It's everyone everyone shits on skim milk. Everyone says. Oh, it tastes like water

1461
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,040
I don't care, you know, like I don't mind that at all

1462
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:01,360
It's refreshing. I grew up on skim milk and it and then I switched to

1463
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:07,920
Vitamin D milk because I had a vitamin D deficiency that made me break my foot. So then you'll bend over. I'll give you a

1464
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:10,160
I literally

1465
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:15,440
I never thought this would be the case, but I literally can't go back like I can't go back to skim milk

1466
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,960
It's not it's not drinking whole milk as a skim milk boy

1467
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,800
Drinking a glass of whole milk is like drinking a glass of fucking whipped cream. I can't it's too much

1468
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:27,600
It's too much. I don't want that. I don't want my favorite flavored milk is benzane

1469
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:34,880
And and and all of you on the inside will know what that means. Yeah. Yeah the the benzane likes the you know

1470
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,440
You all know that's what it is

1471
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:42,720
Last question that I have from the patron discord if you didn't know that's where they come from

1472
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:47,920
We get our questions from people give us money and we answer their questions if they're not retarded

1473
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,880
Which is rare cygrus asks

1474
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:56,080
Realistically for how much money would you have gay sex with the celebrity of your choice on camera?

1475
01:46:56,320 --> 01:47:01,440
Your oh on camera. Wow. There's a lot of factors here. This question. It does. Here's the thing for me

1476
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,920
Uh, how I would answer this is like

1477
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:08,720
I mean, I would not choose to have gay sex with the celebrity just because it's for money

1478
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,520
Like like I don't think it's like

1479
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:16,320
Unappealing enough to me if I was desperate for cash, I'd be like I'd do it for like a couple grand

1480
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:20,480
You know like why not you need the money, but like I don't need the money

1481
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:27,360
I won't even like fucking run ads from anime companies because I don't need the money enough to fucking do it

1482
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,440
you know like so so

1483
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:31,120
You gotta give me a lot of money

1484
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:34,160
It's got to be like six figures for it to be like worth

1485
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:39,760
Breaking away from what I would normally do with my life just to like for just for money, you know

1486
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:44,080
Sure. Sure. That's that's fair point. I'll do it for pennies on the dime

1487
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,280
Pick your poison everybody. Um

1488
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:54,480
Yeah, fuck. I don't know. I mean, oh, is the right way to answer this to pick like the most effeminate guy

1489
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,560
You can think of is that like the right way to go

1490
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:00,560
He would ask what guy, but if you want to answer you go right ahead

1491
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,560
Oh, he just said how much money would you have gay sex the celebrity of your choice on yeah?

1492
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:08,320
I mean, that's the thing. I'm already financially solvent. So it's really not much of a motive

1493
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:11,840
I mean, I'd be sure maybe for like a billion dollars. I'd fucking like why not I guess I'll do it

1494
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,320
But who's who's the guy who played call drogo?

1495
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,480
Oh, dude, that guy will tear you apart, dude. I don't know if you want to go

1496
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:22,800
That guy, what is it? Are you pitching or catching in this scenario? That's an important question

1497
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,200
You know

1498
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:32,160
Fucking hippos like five feet tall and like 70 pounds like the bunch of fucking raping cal drogo

1499
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,200
Oh boy, aren't right now. Please

1500
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:41,440
Oh guys here would make for great tv

1501
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:47,840
That that question gave me a riddlin injection and now I can't think I straight

1502
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,120
So here I'm gonna ask you guys an even better question a legendary question

1503
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:56,000
You will pray to this question day and day out at night

1504
01:48:56,720 --> 01:49:04,160
How can our viewers support this show and the dream of achieving pcphq?

1505
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:10,720
How can they do that? Well, let me tell you what the number one way to do is right now head over on to kickstarter people

1506
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:16,640
Radcon three arena link in the description click on that shit the radcons are our demos

1507
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:21,360
They are the future a proto exactly the right way to prototype demos and you know how well that turned out

1508
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,120
Damn, right. Damn, right. Uh, it was incredible. Uh, I I we will literally make undertale two

1509
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:36,560
Sign up right now. That's a fact now. We have to make a video called undertale two

1510
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:41,120
A whole show of like downplaying it be like I don't want to make any promises like

1511
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:48,320
I promise we will make the most financially successful video game that has ever been made

1512
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,600
$9,002 toby fox comes to radcon three

1513
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:59,520
Guys, we should make some sort of undertale skit where I play torio. That's a fantastic idea

1514
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:03,840
And then you fuck everyone because that's what that's what she does in my in my head

1515
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:08,720
Okay, but seriously the link in the description people the Kickstarter, please fund it as of recording

1516
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,520
We are 50% like 51 or 52 funded

1517
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:15,200
We need money if you want to see the pcp grow and go to the future stuff

1518
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,680
Of course go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators

1519
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:22,720
But for the meantime at this moment the best thing you can do to support the show in our future endeavors together

1520
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:26,160
Is go to our Kickstarter and fund radcon three. You will

1521
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,560
If you got inspired by any of the stuff we talked about today

1522
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,920
Is your duty to support this because this is because support radcon is the only way this will get done

1523
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,280
Because radcons are what this is all built right? It's all a prototype to see what it's like to be in person

1524
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:45,760
This this is the light blood. This is what it's good. This is the spark that will ignite the fucking uh fire that is uh

1525
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,160
pcphq, this is the only way to fucking do it

1526
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:52,480
Or it's all hype and you'll be disappointed in us for the rest of your life

1527
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:59,440
Oh, no, but hey, you know what you know what there was actually a question on the patreon discord that said at noise bandit

1528
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:02,000
Who whose question was if radcon three fails?

1529
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:06,320
What will you guys do which I think is a great question. It's the kickstarter fails

1530
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:09,680
Well, there's a bunch of ways if the kickstarter fails, we will be very embarrassed

1531
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,920
But we will soldier on as always we'll keep doing what we're doing if we fund it

1532
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:17,360
We're just gonna blame we're just we'll just blame the fans because it's the fans who didn't give us money

1533
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,040
So it's their fault

1534
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:25,840
Blame arm retrieval uh con the go fummy for siphoning all the hardcore fans away. Very true. Very true. Um

1535
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:33,040
The the point is it could fail and if so you guys have the ability to hold us accountable by immediately

1536
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:38,160
Unplugging, you know, I I want you to hold us accountable to what if it fails. Nobody pays anything

1537
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:43,040
Well, I mean if it's funded and then we just like make a bunch of bullshit like everyone's mad or whatever like we

1538
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:45,200
We totally don't I mean that won't happen

1539
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:49,120
But if it did you guys still have power over us, which I think is a great thing

1540
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,720
I want you guys to be in control. I mean, that's that's that's the case all the time

1541
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:58,240
Like I would expect if we started putting out like consistently shitty episodes. We'd lose all of our

1542
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:02,320
Patrons like that's how it works. Very true. Very true. That's the dream

1543
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:06,960
The axe is constantly over our heads ready to drop and we have to dance for you guys

1544
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,240
Effectively every week

1545
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:13,520
The pressure is on this is the rare chance for you the viewers

1546
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:16,880
For you serfs to become the sultan

1547
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:24,240
If we do not create quality content, we will be sent to jail kickstart or jail

1548
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:27,120
We'll be sent to the the high security prison

1549
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,200
Also, we'll be fucking sniped literally

1550
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,440
Bedtrap and we'll be shot every time we respond in our bed

1551
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:37,040
Let's just say obama didn't shut down guantanamo bay and it was a big conspiracy

1552
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,720
But he knew there were a couple of boys that just had a spot to serve for them, you know

1553
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,360
He had to prepare for all contingencies

1554
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:48,000
And uh, let me let me read one last question here from xylevich. This is a personal one

1555
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,120
I'm I'm I'm just hijacking the pcp. Is this from the twitter or from uh, this is from the twitter. This is from the

1556
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:59,360
Oh, Hannah's xylevich. How do they twitter? How do they twitter question us? Oh, uh, you hashtag ask pcp everybody

1557
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:05,120
Uh, and here here we go. Uh, and of course we record on saturday pity question. Here we go. It's nat

1558
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:08,160
I'm a philadelphia sports boy. You're a patriot scum

1559
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:12,400
What do you think of the chances that the eagles win their first super bowl over new england?

1560
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:16,320
This is assuming you watch sports. I am up to date. Uh, this is the worst question

1561
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:20,640
Okay, that's why I said this my buddy john will not be listening to this

1562
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:25,120
But if you ever hear this john, who is okay, this has been a big thing. He's an eagles fan always has been

1563
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:28,000
I'm a patron's boy. I've been lording over him for decades

1564
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:33,840
Oh god, we were just talking about losing patrons now. We're talking about sports. We've just alienated our entire fan base

1565
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:36,640
We're accessing a whole new demographic right now. We're pulling them in. Yeah, okay.

1566
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:43,280
Listen, john at the very end of our piece, the patriots have a zero percent chance of losing this fucking game

1567
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:47,600
It's not going to happen. We will destroy the eagles for all time. There will be no recovery

1568
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:54,080
There will be no more eagles after this fucking super bowl, but then who's gonna play hotel california?

1569
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:58,480
I want to hear my hotel california

1570
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,880
Oh god, thank you

1571
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,960
I'm so sorry

1572
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,720
You're so kind
