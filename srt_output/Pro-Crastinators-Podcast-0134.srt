00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,760
Hello everybody and welcome to another amazing high-octane-action episode of the

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:53,360
Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:06,640
How's it going, it's me, he's on the podcast, Ray, it's me, Garfield, here to bring the

4
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
mood down for everybody.

5
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,000
Fantastic, I would expect nothing less.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,400
We have the Paladin of Purple, Lethal Aurora Mage.

7
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,040
How am I a paladin if I'm a mage?

8
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,640
I don't know, you're multi-classing, like in Final Fantasy XI, the best game in the

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
series.

10
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,200
But I specialize in purple magic.

11
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,920
Yeah, purple magic is magic done for your deity, purple, so you're also a holy mage,

12
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
so you're a paladin.

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
It's fine.

14
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,680
Okay, acceptable, acceptable.

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,720
We have Nate, the Starfleet boy who's been through to some strange issues with the holodeck,

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,320
is now in this desolate wasteland with no resources and no idea what to do.

17
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,360
You can't tell, but I am dabbing.

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,800
I don't think that, I think it's against Starfleet regulation.

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,000
That's absolute.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,040
We have the Energetic Scrapper, Ben St.

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
What?

22
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Oh god, he's lucid.

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,040
You'll pull something together eventually, I'm sure.

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
What?

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,040
And we have the Desert Overlord himself, Munchy with Tiny Hats.

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,600
Listen, the channel isn't growing, PC pinny socks are on the low, they're down 6% since

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,800
we started this episode, everyone's going fucking crazy, they're all in a panic.

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,520
And I know what we have to do, we have to do a major rebranding project and we're going

29
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,320
to change ourselves from the ProCrastiners podcast to the Pimplecrushing podcast.

30
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:52,120
Listen, my mom signs into my YouTube account on fucking daily and watches Dr. PimplePopperMD,

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,880
some fucking Zitcrushing videos.

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,760
And I think if we can tap into that niche mom market who just love to see pus fly every

33
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,600
which way, then we can jack our subscriber number up and rake in that fucking superchats

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,920
as we do live Shekels for Heckles, except we've rebranded it, so now we pop each other's

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
pimples.

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,840
And I've got like 6 episodes worth right fucking here for you, so let's just get on with that.

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,320
Imagine our new idea, the PCP, the only YouTube channel by moms for moms, I think that's the

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,280
direction we need to head.

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,840
Munchy, would Shekels for Heckles be rebranded Pimpin' for Pimples?

40
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,320
Oh fuck, this shit rites itself, dude.

41
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,040
This pimple popping phenomenon, it's kind of like a, I wouldn't even call it, it's like

42
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,240
ASMR adjacent, it's like parallel in the sense that it's not like ASMR that like relaxes

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,640
you through like voices or whatever, but it similarly relaxes like Michelle, like Michelle

44
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,520
is into it and loves pimple popping videos, it makes me want to throw up.

45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,160
Mom, can you have your own account?

46
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,760
Stop using my account, it's in my recommended videos, mom.

47
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,240
Do you guys not, do you guys not at least on some level understand the pathos, like

48
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,200
I get it, I do get it, not the pathos, what's the word for it, not the shot in Florida?

49
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,200
It's like getting the long piece in a Tetris thing, it's like you know, it's like setting

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,320
up a Tetris thing and then having like an L block or something at the perfect right moment

51
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
to get the Tetris.

52
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,080
Yeah, yeah, the catharsis of the pop, like I get it.

53
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,160
I understand it, but like, okay.

54
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Forget about the pops.

55
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,080
They take it to like the extreme, well there's like, okay, there's videos that are like more

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,080
like more like deep level surgery, like where they slice up on the back of like a dude's

57
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
head.

58
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, not into those, not into those one bit.

59
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,160
The pimple popping videos, that's baby shit, I could do that, well I could do that if I

60
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,280
ever had a pimple in my life, but unfortunately I was cursed with perfect complexion.

61
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,720
But you know, anyone, anyone who's greasy and disgusting enough, I'm actually in diamond

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,920
form, it's an Emma Frost thing, it's actually, yeah, it's my second mutation, but you know

63
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,080
most people can pop pimples, but what I just want to see someone go into the doctor with

64
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,720
some fat abscess like hanging off their neck and someone's got a poke at it with a scalpel

65
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,280
and like they got to like take a syringe and like draw the shit out at first and they

66
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,120
just like, they like make an incision and it just like explodes like a volcano, that's

67
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,400
not a volcano that's erupting, a volcano that is like boiling over with like the hot chunky

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,900
fucking lava spilling out over the side, so, it feels like victory for me, I'm feeling

69
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,760
it like vicariously, that victory through that person, getting rid of that monstrous

70
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
abscess.

71
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Guys, since we started talking about the rebranding, our picture is up $500, we have to keep going.

72
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,040
Oh no, we gotta keep going, we gotta keep going.

73
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,360
The thing about the cyst is that they don't even give good catharsis because like, they

74
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,480
cut open the skin, they go in with like you know a spade or a shovel or a trowel or something

75
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:21,580
and they like scoop the abscess out, but that's not the end because what then must happen

76
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:28,020
is they have to go in with tiny little scrapers and scissors and cut out like sort of the

77
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,940
sort of sac or skin or membrane that contained the cyst and that part is one, a bit gruesome

78
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:42,060
and two, it's just boring, so it's like the emotional arc of a cyst video is just, it

79
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,000
sort of slowly peaks early and then trails off to nothing and then stays down really

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,920
low until the very end, the cutting out of the sac is extremely unsatisfying.

81
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,920
I haven't had the pleasure of watching this on a live human, but I have had the pleasure

82
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:06,320
of watching it on a digital acclamation, like a 3D animation on YouTube of a transformation

83
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:14,440
from a penile to a vagin, and the process of going trans, it's like going ghost but

84
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,380
going trans, is the most like brutal thing that I can ever do.

85
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:29,080
I watched Ranma one half, sure, it's so terrible, it really just freaks me out.

86
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,020
Remember when Ranma would say, I'm going trans whenever water, time or that.

87
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:42,420
I like to think of the human body as like, I know this is wrong, but it's like good,

88
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
it's like good.

89
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,160
Oh, it's so wrong, it's fine, it's fine, but then with this pimple popping shit and general

90
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,020
all surgery and stuff, it's like, oh my god, just the human epidermis is so fucked up and

91
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:02,900
so disgusting and filled with pores and like, what even is a zit, what even is a zit and

92
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,820
how does it get so fucking big?

93
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,780
That was always my answer, when I was a kid, that was always my question to the adults

94
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,540
who tried to tell me that God exists and that we were created in God's image and even as

95
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:24,060
a child I was like, have you seen people, like we get like fucking like zits and like I've

96
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,020
had like ingrown toenails before, like what the fuck is that, you have to go to the doctor

97
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,660
and they have to like slice open your toe to fix it.

98
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,460
Because you just grew wrong by accident, sometimes like one day you wake up and like you're like

99
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,220
25 which is supposed to be like your prime, that's the sequel to grow up and grow home

100
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,340
is grow wrong, yeah, grow wrong, like you just wake up one day and like all of your bones

101
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:50,060
are just dust now and they don't feel good ever again once you're like 20, yeah, or I

102
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,300
mean they're just cancer in general, just like just grow right, stop growing wrong cells,

103
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,620
what the fuck, what even tell triggers them to grow wrong, I don't know, I have no idea,

104
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,660
I will, I will, I will, I will put too much of that dank weed man, I'll, I'll posit a

105
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,020
new theory though, I know what causes cancer, it's all that aspartame I'm drinking, Conrad

106
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,460
Collins aka Digi Bro, I can't wait for you to never hear this but if you did you'd freak

107
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,740
out because every time I say that it pisses you off and I find it hilarious, well you

108
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,020
know that's, you know that's the leading cause of aspartism, yeah, yeah, that's, why do you

109
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,700
think Digi drinks Diasoda all the time now, I mean I applaud him, I applaud him, it's better

110
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,980
than sugar in my totally uneducated opinion, I mean pick a poison, do you want to become

111
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,940
retarded or do you want to die of cancer, these are your two choices, it's, it's, it's

112
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,940
do you want to die of cancer or do you want to become fat, you either die of cancer or

113
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,860
live long enough to see yourself become the retard, hey, hang on, doesn't being fat cause

114
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,380
cancer, doesn't obesity lead to cancer as well, I think everything leads to cancer, it can,

115
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:58,660
it can, it even worse, it leads to death, right, true, sometimes by that mechanism,

116
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,100
that's a weird thing, I want to, I'm going to draw a Garfield comic where, where John

117
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,380
just leans in like Garfield's like in his little box bed and John leans in and says,

118
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,180
you know obesity can cause cancer Garfield and Garfield just looks like at the viewer

119
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:24,460
and is like Mondays, there's John, John leans in and whispers in Garfield's ear, you know,

120
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,500
even with seat belts on, people die in car crashes all the time, I just thought that

121
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,420
was interesting, there's a John, you know Garfield, you can have an aneurysm at any

122
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:40,220
time in your life, no matter how healthy you are, it can just happen and you'll die, there's

123
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,140
a giant, giant sign at my Starbucks and this is, this is not like a, like my local Starbucks,

124
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,060
this is just like every Starbucks in the area in California, there is like a, a piece of

125
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,020
legislator in, in the California law code, they have a piece of the local legislator

126
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,660
hanging, they have a local legislator's ear that they sliced off, they're holding it

127
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,380
ransom if they don't enforce coffee policies, it's, it's just this like copy and pasted

128
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,980
on like every restaurant they could think to go to, like every piece of fast food or

129
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,900
just normal sit down restaurant, it's all this little plaque near the door that just

130
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,820
says, this like, like food distributed here has been known to cause cancer by the state

131
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,420
of California, like have a nice day, so you can't eat anywhere, like seriously it's ranging

132
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,660
from Starbucks to like fucking Whole Foods to anywhere, you go and then it's just like,

133
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,540
oh this causes cancer by the way, I'm like, well I want a fucking green tea for appuccino,

134
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,780
so you know what, I'm getting cancer and I'm gonna love it, yeah.

135
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,660
I mean the odds are everyone in our generation is gonna die of cancer, we're just exposed

136
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,540
to so much carcinogens at this point.

137
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,100
Maybe the solution to cancer is mandatory death sentences at 35, so that you just don't

138
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
get old enough to.

139
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,380
That would definitely motivate me to start working even harder.

140
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,740
Yeah, right, there was a start to the episode about that, you get executed by the people

141
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,620
when you're like 65, cause they don't want to deal with old people, cause they're a

142
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,060
drag on society and I'm just saying it makes a lot of sense.

143
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,060
It's true.

144
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,660
My theory is that cancer was actually created in God's image and it was meant to be our

145
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,020
natural predator and we're not supposed to be here and cancer is the flood that's gonna

146
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,020
take us out.

147
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,980
Yeah, God I hope so.

148
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,900
I have a, speaking of obesity, speaking of obesity, speaking of obesity, I have a boring

149
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,100
announcement to make, are you excited, are you excited, gents?

150
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,140
I hope you have obesity, I hope you have obesity, I got the test results back, I'm positive

151
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,140
for obesity.

152
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Woo!

153
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,140
Yeah.

154
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:49,940
No, I hit my record low weight the other day, I was 167.5, I couldn't believe it.

155
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,300
And all you had to do was chop off his head, the least useful part and then I lost.

156
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,660
Anyway, pretty stoked about that, I went, you're gonna say 175?

157
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,660
No, 167.5.

158
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,140
Oh, that's pretty damn low.

159
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,060
Pretty low, pretty low, still it's weird, everyone tells me, everyone tells me like

160
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,380
Ben, you don't look overweight at all, like you can stop that, and I'm like, well according

161
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,220
to BMI, I'm still like two or three pounds over the line to overweight, so I'm just gonna

162
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,220
keep going, thanks.

163
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Right, I agree completely.

164
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
Well, muscle mass affects that as well.

165
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,700
Yeah, yeah, which I'm probably lacking in.

166
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,980
Anyone who tells you you're not fat wants you to be fatter than them, that's the truth.

167
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
Yeah, that's right.

168
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
Yeah, I agree.

169
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,980
A hundred percent agreed.

170
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,420
Definitely, definitely do not trust anyone who says anything nice about me, they definitely

171
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,460
have an angle, there's no question.

172
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,860
I have a very similar thing to say, this is my main thing I wanted to bring up, I've

173
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,460
instituted a policy, so I'm going to Hawaii for Christmas for Michelle's family and just

174
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,860
to be in the best place in the world again, I highly recommend it, and so I'm instituting

175
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,180
a policy because I hate how my fucking love handles are disgusting and fat and I want

176
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,460
them dead, so I've instituted a policy that I'll be doing in perpetuity at least until

177
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,380
I go there in like a month and a half, and I'm beginning another one of my famous wacky

178
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:15,620
acronyms, it's Redouet, Redouet, R-E-D-U-I-H, run every day until I'm hot, that's my plan,

179
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,180
I'm starting it today, and I'm not going to stop until I'm hot as hell, and that's it.

180
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,940
Literally, try keto, that's my recommendation, also, just incidentally, I went four days

181
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,300
without eating this week, almost by accident.

182
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,100
Like, ever since that fast, you don't need it anymore.

183
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,020
I, okay, it was on the day of the stream, you've been de-shackled from the ties of human

184
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,020
consumption.

185
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,580
On the day that we streamed, on Wednesday, on, you know, on Roddy Fricker's cop killers

186
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,580
on Twitch, I woke up kind of early, didn't eat, you know, I don't usually get hungry

187
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
in the mornings.

188
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,060
Well, like, I just, don't you love that fuck is censored, but cop killer is just fine.

189
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,180
Yeah, cop killing cops is fine, but the F word is not cool, it is not cool, guys.

190
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,180
Well, we gotta bash the fash, but let's go on.

191
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
Fash the fash.

192
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,260
Fucking left, left wingers on Twitch, ah, fucking millennials.

193
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,220
They, they, so yeah, so that day, you know, we woke up, stayed up for a while, you know,

194
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,740
stream happened, did that, it was night time, I just never got hungry, went to, didn't get

195
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,900
hungry at night time, went to sleep late, I'm not hungry, so I won't eat, woke up the

196
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,740
next day, the trend continued, by day four, I was just like, I might as well keep going.

197
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,540
But then, I, then I told someone, some people were like, just die, people were like, why

198
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,540
are you, why are you fat?

199
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,860
Like, there's no health, there's no real health benefits of going that long, like the benefits

200
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,020
of fasting don't continue for days and days, and I was like, yeah, fuck it, four days is

201
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,500
fine, I don't need to make a thing out of this, so I just ate some shit, I just ate some nuts

202
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,900
and cheese and whatever.

203
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,260
I mean, imagine, just, just for a second, Ben, and everybody, imagine if your hunger

204
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,500
mechanism stopped working correctly, and you just didn't get hungry, maybe through, that's

205
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
what was happening, I did not get hungry at all until day four.

206
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,780
But there you go, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're actually getting the right or

207
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,580
best nutrition, just because one doesn't experience it.

208
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,580
No, no, not necessarily.

209
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
Okay.

210
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,340
Like two, I was thinking I would just go another week at that point, because I was like more

211
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,620
than halfway there, but then I was like, well, it's, it would, like there's no actual point,

212
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,940
it would just be a numbers thing, it would just be an arbitrary, like, hit that number

213
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,940
goalpost, so whatever.

214
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,020
And you know, you know, to Ewan and Munchie's point as well, I am aware that like, running

215
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,820
every day is not enough to just be, to get skinny.

216
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
You die at that point.

217
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
My point, what did I say?

218
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
It's an important thing.

219
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,540
Oh, you know, maybe you might have just been, Ben, I'd just say, just go keto, which is

220
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
the perfect point.

221
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,540
All I said was try keto.

222
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,540
Okay, okay.

223
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:43,900
Well, fair enough, I should do that, and I intend to, but this is, it's so much easier

224
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:50,220
for me to institute, I've noticed this about myself in a huge way, I need binary switches,

225
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,620
on off choices, that if I do that, I can get things done.

226
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,500
And if I don't, I fuck it up every time.

227
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,220
You mean like, you mean like you have to go all or nothing?

228
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Yes.

229
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,100
To have flipped the switch of I will now run every day is almost easy to do.

230
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
It's easy to do that.

231
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,260
It's easier than being like, I'll run three days of the week, any three days that I want

232
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
to.

233
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
Way easier, way easier than that.

234
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
I get that.

235
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,780
You have less wiggle than to fuck up.

236
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
Decide.

237
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,540
The wiggle room is how I find excuses to fuck up.

238
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
Exactly.

239
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,860
If I gave myself, if I gave myself, look, you know, one day a week, I can eat, you know,

240
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,340
one carb thing or something, then like that one thing would hang over me all the time.

241
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,260
And I would constantly be debating like, should this be the thing?

242
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,260
Should this be the thing?

243
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,900
Maybe I'll eat this and then I, you know, but if it's like, no, none, then it's not,

244
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,980
it's not hard because like, I'm just like, oh, I see, oh, that's, that pizza, I just

245
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
can't eat it.

246
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,540
Well, like it's out of, it's out of the question for me to eat that.

247
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,180
The idea of fixing my diet has long plagued me, because it's a far more complicated overall

248
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,080
thing than to be one easy switch.

249
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
I know I need to fix that.

250
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
I'll work on it.

251
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,000
Diets are so hard, there's so much conflicting information.

252
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,960
I get, I get, yeah, it's like, you can, you can read two different books on the subject

253
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,240
and come away with completely different answers to what is a healthy diet.

254
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,680
It's interesting we're talking about diet, because that was what I was going to bring

255
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,080
the table and say that I'm sorry, Ben, but I'm abandoning, I think I'm going to abandon

256
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
keto.

257
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,160
I think I'm pivoting into paleo.

258
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,680
I think I'm, I'm continuing my bio-happiness family.

259
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
I love paleo.

260
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
I don't even do anything.

261
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,200
Paleo is just about feeling better than other people.

262
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Is that so?

263
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,240
But, but, but before we move on completely.

264
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,440
All diets about that though, really?

265
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
The best diet.

266
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,160
I mean, I like paleo in the sense that it discourages bulk grains, which I don't believe

267
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
in.

268
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Absolutely.

269
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,480
I don't know if this will sound cruel or not, Nate, but I don't mean in such a way.

270
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,720
But I kind of forgot that you were like, yeah, you're like the fitness guy, I guess.

271
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
I forgot about that for a while.

272
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
That's fine.

273
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,800
For a while, that was like your characteristic is that you were the fit person who, you know,

274
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,840
did anime reviews, I guess, but I kind of forgot about the fitness part until just now.

275
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
Well, that's perfectly acceptable.

276
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,080
And I mean, I think what that really speaks to is not really that I've gotten much worse,

277
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,360
because I'm actually on an upswing currently.

278
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,000
But it's a, it's that everyone else is up to their game.

279
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,920
So I stand out less by comparison.

280
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,840
And while that's unfortunate for me, it is good overall.

281
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Yeah.

282
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,340
But I'm switching.

283
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,620
I like Keto a lot.

284
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,620
I lost a ton of weight.

285
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,900
I'm down, I think 15 or 16 pounds in like five weeks, which is pretty good.

286
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,260
So why would you stop then?

287
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
Okay.

288
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,700
Because I feel sick constantly.

289
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
That makes sense.

290
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,340
Ever since I've started Keto, my stomach has felt an agony.

291
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,940
I've had like heart palpitations all the time.

292
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Don't really want that anymore.

293
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Well, that's just life, man.

294
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,380
Listen, Tom, listen, Tom, you're 30 now and that's, and happy birthday, by the way.

295
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,620
That's just, that's just the rest of your life.

296
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,300
I tried Keto for a while and it hasn't really worked for me, but I think it might be due

297
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,100
to the fact that I don't have a gallbladder.

298
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,100
So I can't really process the fat too well.

299
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,900
I read that, like, you know, you can't do Keto.

300
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
I don't know what gallbladder does.

301
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
I don't think so.

302
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,220
Well, and it produces the thing, it produces the thing that helps you digest fat, I think,

303
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,220
or something like that.

304
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
I don't know.

305
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,340
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a, I'm not a biologist, but I read that you can do Keto without a

306
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,580
gallbladder, but it's kind of different.

307
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,540
I don't, I don't see why you wouldn't, although I guess you'd probably have to ask a doctor.

308
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,860
My understanding was that the gallbladder was, was a thing that helps to digest, like,

309
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,980
fibrous stuff and plant matter better, that is harder to digest in the body.

310
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
I, I could be wrong.

311
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,580
Wait, are you thinking of the appendix?

312
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,060
Oh, I'm thinking of the appendix, yep.

313
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,060
My bad, my bad.

314
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
Okay, okay.

316
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:37,220
The appendix is like, someone, I read that, like, the, what the appendix was for is back

317
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,300
in caveman times, when you would have a pile of berry, like loose berries on the ground

318
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,580
and you would scoop them up along with like dirt and rocks, and you would eat it all at

319
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,580
once.

320
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,980
Your appendix would secrete some kind of substance that would coat the rocks that you ate along

321
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,820
with these precious berries with some kind of goo that would prevent them from tearing

322
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,820
open your anus on the way out.

323
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
Or something.

324
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,820
It's funny, it's funny.

325
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,660
Yeah, but we don't need it anymore because we don't eat rocks anymore or something.

326
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,540
The last, like, 30 seconds, the call just cut out and started like nothing but gibberish

327
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,660
and then immediately cuts in and it's, and then you say anus on the way out, just anus.

328
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,660
I don't know what I missed.

329
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,660
Out of context, out of context.

330
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,660
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,460
This is like, silence, silence, signus, tear your anus open on the way out.

332
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
Yeah.

333
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
I was like, okay.

334
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,380
Yeah, this is a horrible nightmare.

335
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,100
If it sounds like we're interrupting each other, it's because everyone's speeding up

336
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,380
and slowing down and cutting out randomly at an unheard of time.

337
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,900
I am also getting that, yeah, it sucks.

338
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Clean.

339
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
Hey.

340
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,500
If anyone's got a...

341
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Wait, wait.

342
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,460
Nobody heard my Garfield-ism that I threw out there in the middle of that cacophony.

343
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,500
I said, the best diet is depression.

344
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,220
And then fucking Garfield stands up from his bed box and he's emaciated as fuck.

345
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:59,980
And then he looks forward at the viewer and says, Mondays.

346
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
That's how they all end.

347
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
They all end the same way.

348
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,540
So, Jesse, are you just going to make better Garfield comics now?

349
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,060
Is that like your new role?

350
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,180
Because you've already had like three good strip ideas just in the last 20 minutes.

351
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
Yeah.

352
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,780
Well, I'm imagining like they end on sort of a Ren and Stimpy-esque hyper-detailed

353
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,100
close-up of his face saying Mondays.

354
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
This is good.

355
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
I don't know.

356
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,780
Well, I just realized that I am Garfield and that's literally who I...

357
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,020
I mean, aren't we all Garfield on some level?

358
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
That's his appeal.

359
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,740
He speaks to all of us in a way.

360
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
Yeah.

361
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,940
All of our worst instincts.

362
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:43,260
We're all just trapped on the window of a moving car down the fucking highway to hell.

363
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,260
And it's Monday.

364
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
And it's Monday.

365
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,260
Fuck.

366
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,500
We're all trapped in these bodies that will eventually decay and die and get fat first.

367
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,020
What is that noise?

368
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
Whose fucking dog is janglin'?

369
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Yeah, what's a jingle jangle?

370
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,900
Sorry, it's Odie again.

371
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,900
I'll just get him off the fucking table.

372
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,020
It could be my cat's bell.

373
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,900
He's hungry and I cannot go and feed him at the moment, so he's going to be a nuisance.

375
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
Oh, when he's hungry, he's just going to bring a bell.

376
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,900
Cats hunt for themselves.

377
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
No, he has a bell on his neck.

378
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
Oh, okay.

379
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
On the collar.

380
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,900
Is it like a choker?

381
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,900
Like an emo choker?

382
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
No.

383
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,900
He's got a thought collar.

384
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Yeah.

385
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:28,260
You know, this has bothered me for years.

386
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:35,380
And I've never said it out loud, but I'm finally going to own up to it.

387
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,580
This might make me unpopular to posit this controversial thought.

388
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,660
It bothers me that Odie's retarded.

389
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:49,340
Well, here, I mean, the thing about that is all your people are being poorly represented.

390
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
No.

391
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Oh, got him.

392
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,740
And this is me talking, not Garfield, even though I'm sure Garfield feels similarly.

393
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,940
Because there's other dogs in the Garfield universe and they're not stupid.

394
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,780
So why is Odie stupid?

395
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:09,100
I was going to say, is he retarded or does he just have different priorities than Garfield?

396
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,300
He's almost always depicted as extremely retarded, though not always.

397
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
He's a mute.

398
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,580
Like all the other animals at least can communicate with each other.

399
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
But Odie's just like-

400
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:23,140
My favorite piece of Garfield lore is that Odie is not John's dog.

401
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,300
He is Lyman's dog.

402
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Oh, yeah.

403
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
Who's Lyman?

404
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,340
Lyman?

405
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,340
Okay.

406
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,860
It's like in like pretty early on in the comic, John's friend Lyman moves in with them for

407
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,980
a while and he is this mustached dude and he brings Odie with him and he just is there

408
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,420
for a while and then he eventually like goes off to join the Coast Guard of the Navy or

409
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,220
something and no one ever hears from him again, but he just leaves Odie and now Odie

410
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,220
lives with him.

411
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
But no.

412
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,260
Odie is Lyman's dog.

413
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Look up Lyman.

414
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,300
You know, John coveted that dog so much.

415
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:03,900
He's so coveted, a companion for Garfield that one night he snuck into Lyman's room

416
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
while he was sleeping.

417
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,660
And like stabbed him to death and buried him under the floorboards and said, oh yeah,

419
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,460
he just, he went off to join the Navy.

420
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,460
Yeah.

421
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,060
Someone comes to ask about it and he's like, oh no, this is my dog.

422
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,060
I've had this dog forever.

423
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
This is my dog.

424
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,060
Yeah.

425
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
He's all-

426
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
Oh, yeah.

427
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,780
Odie's like, where's Lyman's John?

428
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,540
You know, you can see it in his eyes.

429
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,420
And like, you know, where am I going back home?

430
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,780
And John just looks at the camera and says, you've always been here, Odie, you've always

431
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
been here.

432
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,780
And then da-da-da-da.

433
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,780
Zoom in on a fly.

434
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,660
And then slow zoom in on John's face.

435
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,220
Slow zoom in on John's face.

436
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,900
You've always been here, Garfield, music sting.

437
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,180
Slow zoom in on Garfield, Mondays.

438
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
And so-

439
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
Cut to black.

440
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,180
Roll credits.

441
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,140
Better to make sure that Odie doesn't rat about what John did to Lyman.

442
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,420
John gives Odie a lobotomy, and that's why Odie became-

443
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,580
Oh my God, it's so stupid.

444
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Yeah.

445
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,300
So the dog doesn't rat him out.

446
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,860
Yeah, you know, really, John was the one who was truly Odeous.

447
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Oh.

448
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Welcome, full circle.

449
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Welcome, full circle.

450
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,540
Oh, and also he baked Lyman into a lasagna and he fed it to Garfield.

451
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
That's also a thing.

452
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
Oh, sure.

453
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:28,500
Hey, hey, you would get so many lasagnas out of the meat of an entire person.

454
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
That's all I'm saying.

455
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
That's true.

456
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
There's very little meat in the lasagna to begin with.

457
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,180
You would have to be- you'd have to be some meaty lasagnas, they're just going to take

458
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,180
you along.

459
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,660
You're going to have Lyman in the freezer for quite some time.

460
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,500
I think Garfield found like a finger bone or a toe, like halfway through the lasagna

461
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,660
and realized, but he just loves lasagnas so much and he just-

462
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,660
Yeah.

463
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,660
He already had that taste.

464
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
He's shoveling it in.

465
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
No, he loves lasagna.

466
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
He's like this, right?

467
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,380
John knew that Garfield loves lasagnas so much that he would find the finger, eat it

468
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,100
anyway, and then be so consumed by guilt that he would now feel complicit in the murder.

469
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,820
So he would never say anything.

470
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,060
Oh my God, John.

471
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
Makes sense.

472
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,060
He's smart.

473
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:11,300
If there's one thing I miss from being a brony, it's all of the shit, terrible, gore, creepy

474
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:16,780
posse to fan fiction that you could read, and there was just a whole library full.

475
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,740
There was just a whole fucking boatload.

476
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,620
There was a library of Alexander worth of pure knowledge that you could just unearth at any

477
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,620
moment.

478
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,620
Take you back to the rainbow factory, duckball.

479
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,620
Exactly.

480
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,780
Take me back to fucking Party of One, take me back to that shit.

481
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
Yeah, Party of One.

482
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,780
No, Party of None.

483
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,780
Sorry, Party of None.

484
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
Right, right.

485
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,340
So there's even less than one now.

486
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,980
At the end of the day, that was pretty much the thing about My Little Pony was just how

487
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,980
active and just how prolific the fan base was.

488
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,060
In fact, I would say, tell me if you agree with this, Munchie, that pound for pound,

489
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:57,300
per capita, the only fandom that is as prolific as My Little Pony might just be Endless War.

490
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:06,500
Well, okay, okay, we have to adjust for inflation and for how long they've been alive.

491
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:13,940
I would say you've got, okay, I'm talking per capita, like, like in terms of, in terms

492
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:19,380
of like, works, work, like fan work per person per second.

493
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,380
You know what?

494
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,380
Okay, I would agree with you.

495
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,300
The only rival there, and I think the true successor is Furries, though I feel legitimately

496
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,460
that Furries is Jean, because it's so decentralized.

497
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,180
It's not really a fandom of anything.

498
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,380
It's not like a, you're not a fan of anything, if you're afraid.

499
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,060
You're just a fan of being a freak, I guess.

500
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,900
That's your one calling, that's what you want to do.

501
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,500
The Furries thing is too much.

502
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,940
I'm calling for it to be over immediately, cease and desist.

503
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
I'm done with Furries.

504
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
I don't know, man.

505
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
That's got momentum.

506
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,220
That's got some like cultural momentum behind it.

507
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,660
The fact that it's like become a community and a subset of people, like a category of

508
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,140
human, upsets me.

509
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,780
Jew, Gentile, Furries.

510
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:12,020
Because now you can't joke anymore about like a cartoon animal character being attractive,

511
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,380
or else you're a furry.

512
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,340
Like it used to be, everybody made those jokes.

513
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,020
Everybody was fucking, oh yeah, fucking Lola in Space Jam is hot as fuck.

514
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,980
Everybody used to be into that.

515
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,780
Everyone believed it, but now everyone's afraid to admit it, because as soon as you say that

516
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:34,620
maybe Lola is fucking a hottie, well then, it opens the floodgates with the Furries come

517
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,460
out and they go, you're one of us now.

518
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,460
You're one of us.

519
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:43,460
And they fucking, they slap that big giant head on your head, and they push you down

520
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,580
a corridor, and they keep like adding parts of the furry costume as you're walking down

521
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,900
this corridor with no other way out, and they're whipping you with chains, and they're hurling

522
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,460
insults and throwing rocks at you.

523
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,460
Oh dude.

524
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
It's a gauntlet.

525
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
And it makes you one of them.

526
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
And it makes you one of them.

527
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,180
Remember the one where that like Marine is getting strapped into like his power armor

528
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,100
suit in preparation for Starcraft?

529
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,900
It's like that with a fur suit, and then it comes out, hell, it's about damn time.

530
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900
Yeah, it's like a prune.

531
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,980
I want to go to Furry Convention just to see what it's like.

532
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,660
I want to know what it's like on average races, and you know what will happen?

533
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,860
I'll go there, I'll get all suited, I'll get all tatted up.

534
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:28,460
Oh, brief segment, I'm actually writing a 400 page fan fiction.

535
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,540
It's been an AU slash sequel to the How to Train Your Dragon series, and it's just exactly

536
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
the same.

537
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,620
It's like dragons are actually metaphor for tattoos, and it stars Hiccup who's been

538
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,460
renamed to Tatlis at the beginning of the movie, and he has to overcome the sphere by

539
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,460
Baguina tattoo.

540
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,460
Anyway.

541
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,100
That was the most zoomer sentence anyone's ever spoken.

542
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
You know what?

543
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Anyway, enough of that.

544
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
That was all in parentheses just then.

545
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
I just figured out some men would hang out.

546
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,980
It's going to be the same as any other convention, it's just going to be like people just hanging

547
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,660
out, kind of being bored, being like, oh, what panel do you want to go to?

548
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,940
Nothing, I just kind of want to hang out, and then the other person's like, yeah, okay.

549
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,820
Furries, I don't think you're going to be that weird in person.

550
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,340
I want to go anyway, I want to see what it's like.

551
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,740
Only after, only behind closed doors.

552
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,380
Just now, while you were talking, I figured out the metric, the test of whether or not

553
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,260
someone is a furry.

554
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,740
So they made a Looney Tunes show a couple years ago.

555
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,900
It was like a sitcom update of the Looney Tunes.

556
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Oh, god, yeah.

557
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
This is exciting.

558
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
Clines and Daffy are like-

559
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
No, what was it called?

560
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,180
I don't remember the name, but I know the one.

561
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:47,460
But Lola Bunny was in that show, but they had updated her to be more contemporary and

562
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:54,580
more fitting with today's feelings on what a cartoon sexy bunny should be.

563
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:02,380
So they made her less overtly sexualized and less busty and buxom.

564
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,100
Lola Bunny in Space Jam is a dystopian nightmare.

565
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,100
She's the pinnacle.

566
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,940
You can say she's a nightmare, but she's definitely sexualized.

567
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
Well, not herself.

568
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
I don't understand.

569
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:22,220
But the way that she is just this sexualized token female who is defined by being better

570
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,820
at everything than all men, and all men are immediately get heart eyes and swoon and fall

571
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,620
over at their boners because she is present.

572
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,180
It's regressive, but it does have merit because she is hot.

573
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,180
Sure.

574
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,180
So here's-

575
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
So granted.

576
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:43,380
So in this new contemporary Looney Tunes show, they toned down her sexuality.

577
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:48,260
They toned down how hot she is, but they made her more of a character with a zany personality

578
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,180
to match bugs and daffy and stuff.

579
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,420
So I think the test of whether you're a furry is if you're attracted to Space Jam Lola,

580
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,580
you're not a furry.

581
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:03,700
But if you're attracted to the new Lola for her personality, you're definitely a furry.

582
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:09,980
Wasn't New Lola, in that version, wasn't she like a sort of neurotic, obsessive stalker

583
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,620
girlfriend or something?

584
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

585
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,620
Okay, gross.

586
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,220
She was like the attached girlfriend meme.

587
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,300
So I guess I'm definitely not a furry.

588
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,300
Okay, cool.

589
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,780
Yeah, I don't know if this is allowed to be shown, if we can link this safely in the

590
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,780
show notes, but I really want this T-shirt.

591
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,780
It caps me walking down the street with this fucking T-shirt on.

592
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
This is awesome.

593
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,780
She's crying.

594
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:42,300
It's so huge, and it's the entire body is taken up with that image.

595
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,780
Why is it on a T-shirt?

596
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
It's just so inappropriate.

597
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,180
Munchy, you need to buy this shirt and wear it to the furry convention you go to.

598
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,180
Oh my god, yeah!

599
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
I want to wear it.

600
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,460
I mean, there's nothing technically showing.

601
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,300
I think her cheeks are covering up.

602
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,060
Is that not her little bunny pussy showing?

603
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,060
No, she's wearing it.

604
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,380
I don't want to zoom it in to find out.

605
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,260
Well panties are clinging to it in a way that tech...

606
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,860
You know, it's a little hard to say honestly.

607
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,980
The geometry is questionable.

608
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,700
I'm going to post a link to anyone who wants to buy this below.

609
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,700
I'm going to buy it.

610
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,660
I'm going to use our Amazon affiliate link to buy this T-shirt of Bugs Bunny Spanking

611
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Lola.

612
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,660
Woo!

613
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,500
That's utterly expressed.

614
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,820
I guess to those who haven't clicked it, it's Bugs Spanking Lola sexually over his

615
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
knee.

616
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
I just said that on a T-shirt.

617
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,820
On a T-shirt.

618
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,500
That's a T-shirt that I would wear in a music video while having post Malone tattoos on

619
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
my face.

620
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
That's right.

621
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,660
Oh dude, there's another variant.

622
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,300
You'll see if you click that link where her ass is more red.

623
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,740
Like she's gotten more wax.

624
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,740
Oh, it's the sequel.

625
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,740
Yeah, it's the sequel.

626
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,260
It's like five different ones for each weekday.

627
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,660
It kills the question, we do a proper progression through the week.

628
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,300
You start with the first one of her just standing next to him, then the second one of her bent

629
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,300
over.

630
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,060
You pull down the panties, then getting redder and redder.

631
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,060
Progressively redder.

632
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:08,980
At some point, tears form under her eyes and it starts to be less hot, but it keeps going.

633
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,060
And then in the last one, she looks at the viewer and says, Mondays.

634
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:23,340
I'm like, where's the tat shop and get tatted up and they're going to be like, what kind

635
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,340
of tattoo do you want?

636
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,780
I'm just going to put on my sunglasses and not respond to them.

637
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:35,260
And just wait for me to wake up from my cocaine and do stupor and just wake up and then find

638
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,820
out how many tats I've got with this sick ass shirt because I guarantee they're going

639
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,740
to give me like five for free because they're so aroused.

640
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,660
I'm sure that's true.

641
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:50,260
Speaking of fandom in general, I just wanted to say that I played DeVoo's game, Autominus.

642
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,260
Oh, I want to stream that.

643
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,100
I want to stream that game myself playing it.

644
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
You should.

645
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
It would be good.

646
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Yeah.

647
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
It'd be pretty good for that.

648
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Yeah.

649
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,740
I just want to say, I honestly loved it and it was great.

650
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,380
So great job, DeVoo.

651
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,380
So here's my endorsement.

652
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,780
Everyone really should play it now that I have played it.

653
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
Took me like an hour and a half, maybe, or two hours or something.

654
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
I'm pretty intrigued.

655
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,980
I'm pretty intrigued by it.

656
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,260
I feel like I should.

657
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,860
I saw it and I meant to be like, jump on it.

658
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,860
I don't know.

659
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
But you know.

660
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
Life goes on.

661
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,340
The download link wasn't there when I first went.

662
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,340
But now it is.

663
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,340
So I played it.

664
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,340
I'm about halfway through it right now.

665
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,340
It's great.

666
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,340
I wanted to play it.

667
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,220
It was like, it looked cool and it's like, it's a DeVoo game.

668
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,060
So I'm like, I want to play a game about DeVoo.

669
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,060
He's my friend.

670
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,580
And so I got my stuff set up.

671
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,580
I was going to record it.

672
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,100
I was going to do like a let's play of it.

673
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,140
It's fucking, you know, ruin it for myself.

674
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,660
Like I do everything because you're fucking recording and you don't enjoy it as much.

675
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,620
But I was going to do that and I was fucking, I tried to download it and it wouldn't download

676
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,620
it.

677
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,060
Like set off my antivirus shit and I couldn't figure out how to do it.

678
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
Oh, wait.

679
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,540
I got the same thing.

680
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,540
Yeah.

681
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,540
Yeah.

682
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,660
Do you use AVG by any chance?

683
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,300
No, mine was a vast.

684
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,780
A vast antivirus.

685
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,780
Yeah.

686
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
I had to.

687
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Yeah.

688
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
I remember I got that.

689
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,820
I had to like go into settings and create like a specific exception for like this file

690
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,820
path or something.

691
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
I gave up.

692
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,820
Totally.

693
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,020
I went back to bed.

694
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,660
Like my, like it's fucking Mondays, dude.

695
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,660
Yeah.

696
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,780
Like I can do, I can do anything no matter how complex it is as long as you warned me

697
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,940
beforehand.

698
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,500
But like if there's one unexpected step, I'm done.

699
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
I'm fucking out.

700
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,300
Like don't make me do one thing more than I thought I would do.

701
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Get it.

702
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
I don't want to do it.

703
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,300
I'm going back to bed.

704
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,340
I'm getting back into my fucking anxiety blanket because that one extra step just fucking gave

705
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,500
me a mental breakdown.

706
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Oh, wait.

707
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
No, you know what I did?

708
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,940
I just, I just disabled my antivirus.

709
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
That's what you got to do.

710
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,940
That's what I tried to do.

711
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,020
You just got to turn that shit off for a minute.

712
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,140
Which Davoo should probably, I don't know if there's a way around that, but like if

713
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,620
we both have that problem, I couldn't even find like where to disable it.

714
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,460
I found a thing that says like put it on passive and like that sounds kind of disabled, but

715
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,460
that didn't work.

716
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,460
It still wouldn't let me play it.

717
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,540
I might be able to, hmm, if I, if I, so it's an EXA, right?

718
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,500
If I put it in a zip file and put it online, you might be able just to download that, which

719
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,700
I wouldn't be for everybody, but like I could easily probably share that with you guys.

720
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,140
That might get you past that first thing and then just unzip it and then it might work.

721
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,660
I do that at work a lot.

722
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,660
Yeah, maybe.

723
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,660
I don't see how that, aren't you just downloading the EXA directly from itch?

724
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,540
Well, I mean, I mean, whatever, they're having a problem getting the EXA, but if they're

725
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:30,380
just given like a Google Drive link to a zip file that contains an EXA, your antivirus

726
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,580
will miss that and not, uh, generally.

727
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,060
I mean, that's, I do that sometimes.

728
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,060
All right.

729
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,660
You know, okay, but in the furries, back on the subject of furries, I have more to say

730
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
on this.

731
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,860
The point of this was, Davoo, I loved the game.

732
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
It was great.

733
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,420
I had one huge complaint with the game.

734
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
A gigantic problem.

735
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,420
Is it a spoiler?

736
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,420
Should I cover my ears?

737
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,420
This is not a spoiler.

738
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,420
No.

739
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,420
Okay.

740
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,300
In very slight indirect terms, it kind of is, but not really.

741
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,300
It's that, okay.

742
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,300
So the game is great.

743
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,300
Love it.

744
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,820
Get all the way to the end and the thing is, at no point in the game is there any kind

745
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,300
of fail state.

746
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,660
There is a save game mechanism that you can use to save and turn it off.

747
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,020
And this game is, you know, it's like an hour to two hour game.

748
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,580
It's easily done in one sitting.

749
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,860
Okay, so when I'm playing the game, I saved it at the beginning just to like try out saving,

750
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,140
just to like see how it works, already going above and beyond.

751
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,460
But then I didn't, there was no need to save at any point past that end of the game.

752
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,740
At the very end, when you've done everything, there is something like sort of kind of a

753
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,700
final boss type event.

754
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,860
And the thing is, it's the only time in the game where there is a fail state, which brings

755
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,420
you, there's no do-overs.

756
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:46,060
You just get like kicked back to the main menu after restart from your save file.

757
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:51,860
But here's the thing, I didn't save the fucking game since my test at the very beginning and

758
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,180
I was not conditioned by the game to be taught that saving was necessary because there was

759
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,180
no failure states.

760
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,980
It should give you like, it should give you like a, it should save.

761
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,940
So I literally lost 100% of my progress playing the game.

762
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,580
It should give you like a, there's no turning back from this point.

763
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
Do you want to save?

764
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,220
Something like that would have been good.

765
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,220
Or even if there was just some sort of continue state, like a do-over of that final thing,

766
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,620
that would have been fine as well.

767
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,260
But no, I just got fucked.

768
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,820
And I, like, I want to do it again, but I'm like, Jesus Christ, I really liked it.

769
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,420
But do I immediately want to use another hour to get through the game again?

770
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,420
I don't know.

771
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,420
Yeah.

772
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,420
Probably not.

773
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,500
So I went online and okay, one spar, one spar is the only man in the world who's made

774
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,700
a let's play so far, so I could just watch the final cutscene because I'm already too

775
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,700
good.

776
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,140
I spent more time doing this.

777
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,700
One spar hasn't uploaded the final part of the let's play.

778
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,620
Just do it one spar, release the fucking video.

779
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,260
Who was once known as Wolfspar.

780
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,260
That's right.

781
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,260
That's right.

782
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,260
Okay.

783
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,220
So Jesse, actually I would have really appreciated a let's play.

784
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,740
So I need this let's play to exist so I can see the end and figure it out.

785
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,740
You know, I also, I think, you know what, I think, I think I'm actually going to stream

786
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,860
that tonight because I am streaming tonight as I do on Sundays for the ending on Twitch,

787
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,060
twitch.tv slash stcomics.

788
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,940
Go follow me.

789
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,580
And I will, so by the time you're listening to this, dear viewer, I will have already

790
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,580
streamed it.

791
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,940
It will be on my videos page.

792
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,940
Thank God.

793
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,940
Yeah.

794
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:26,780
I don't know if this is better or worse than the spanking shirt, but this one is like a

795
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:32,300
bad fusion of Bugs and Lola.

796
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,540
A fusion, you say.

797
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,540
This is the same one.

798
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,540
No, it's not.

799
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
Okay.

800
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,500
It's not showing the one I linked or the one that I clicked on.

801
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,060
Oh, there's like other versions.

802
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
Yeah.

803
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,060
There's a bunch of different shirts in there.

804
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:48,420
One of them is just, wait, well, oh my God, wait, I will figure this.

805
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,420
This is important.

806
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
Yeah.

807
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:57,340
There's a whole, oh my God, this one, that's just her face on like an R&D shirt and her

808
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,340
face blends into it.

809
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,340
It is really weird.

810
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,700
There's a lot of weird ones here.

811
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:07,060
Oh my God, this like dark purple one with like sort of a pink gradient on it has like

812
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,580
a really badly drawn version of like Bugs giving her a piggyback ride.

813
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,580
Yeah.

814
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Yeah.

815
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,580
Here we go.

816
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,060
I fucking, this is the one I was talking about.

817
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,060
Oh my God.

818
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,180
What the fuck is that?

819
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,980
What the fuck?

820
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,660
That's like more of what that's hot dude to me than the spanking shirt.

821
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,660
Like that is.

822
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,660
I put it on a t-shirt.

823
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,180
Unironically, that is somebody's fetish.

824
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,940
Like I would, no, and not, not a joke.

825
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:41,780
I would wear the spanking shirt because it's hilarious, but I can't, I can't conceive of

826
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:47,260
a reason I would wear this weird fusion shirt.

827
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,260
Not even fusion.

828
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,980
Like they're conjoined in this.

829
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,980
They're fucking.

830
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
Lola Bunny.

831
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:58,660
Lola Bunny is a weird anomaly of a character that just like popped up one day in Space Jam.

832
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
You know what it was?

833
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,260
It was like the Hollywood bigwigs who were making Space Jam were like, oh, we got to,

834
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,420
we got to get something for the, for the boys to watch.

835
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,660
We got to get a character that would be like what, but we got to make it a cartoon.

836
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,660
Okay.

837
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,460
Just, just make a fucking female Bugs Bunny.

838
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,740
But they didn't know the power they were dealing with.

839
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,540
They didn't know the, the power of the Chaos Emeralds they were toying with, they would

840
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:25,420
create this incredible sexual nexus of energy that was Lola Bunny that has been twisted

841
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,420
and perfected.

842
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,420
No, they knew.

843
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:33,540
I, I kind of, it seems like the next is Robin Hood, Robin Hood came first.

844
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Okay.

845
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,300
I thought, I thought it was Nala from Lion King, but I guess that is the perfect way

846
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,620
to describe Lola Bunny, a nexus of sexual energy.

847
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,620
It's true.

848
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,620
It's true.

849
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,060
She's like a blood-borne creature where like when you look at her with zero insight, you're

850
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,060
like, oh yeah.

851
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,060
I mean, okay, cute bunny.

852
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,460
And then like, as you start to look at more furry shit, like you, you start to get more

853
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,380
concerned about what you're actually looking at.

854
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:02,660
All that raw sexual power coalescing at the center of the universe, like a black hole.

855
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,860
It's like an ultra dense apocalyptic event.

856
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:12,380
These t-shirts is illegal or something because like, they're just taking fan art and putting

857
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,380
it on.

858
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,380
But what method of curation are they making these?

859
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,820
Are these like, they feel randomly generated.

860
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,860
They don't feel like they're even like, these feel like they were made by anything.

861
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,500
Who's really going to go to court to protect their drawing of bugs?

862
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:32,220
The same, the same supercomputer that churned out Spider-Man carrying pregnant Elsa to the

863
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,300
hospital in a wheelbarrow is churning these out.

864
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,300
That's true.

865
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,660
I feel like at the, when you, at the end of spore, we were all disappointed, you know,

866
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,540
you build up your universe, you acquired new civilizations, you obtain enlightenment through

867
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,660
whatever means, and then boom, you finally make your way to the center of the universe.

868
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,740
And originally it was just going to be Lola Bunny, the center of all power and commerce

869
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,340
and culture.

870
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,820
But they were like, the people aren't ready for this, the people just aren't ready.

871
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:05,100
So then you just start over and you continue the quest eternally.

872
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,940
I have a game rant, I have an angry rant about a video game, since you were talking about

873
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,940
another one.

874
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,860
Fucking, so I downloaded the re-release of Castlevania Symphony of the Night on PS4.

875
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,860
Yeah.

876
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,420
And we all know that game.

877
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,740
Oh no, I know where you're going.

878
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,860
Okay, all right, all right.

879
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:29,780
So everybody knows the dialogue at the beginning of Symphony of the Night.

880
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,300
Die monster, you don't belong in this world.

881
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:39,660
It was not by my hand, it was who was that fucking did the thing, and you bitch.

882
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,660
Yeah.

883
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,020
Enough talk, have at you.

884
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:48,980
They fucking changed the dialogue in the re-release, they re-recorded it, they rewrote all of it.

885
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,980
What the fuck?

886
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,580
This idea that the old dialogue is hokey now, or is it good?

887
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:59,260
Oh, hey, I'll bet the game would be way better if we changed this classic dialogue that everyone

888
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,460
remembers, everyone would appreciate that.

889
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:06,980
The new dialogue isn't even better, it's just as hokey in its own way, so there was no point

890
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,660
in changing it, it didn't make it better.

891
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,580
What was the new dialogue?

892
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,780
It's totally, I mean it's not memorable at all.

893
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,420
Is the original Miserable Pile of Secrets?

894
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,420
They changed that.

895
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,820
They changed it to be less hokey and trying to make it sound more natural in English,

896
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,180
but it doesn't, it just sounds weird in a different way.

897
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,900
But Symphony of the Night is where what is a man, a Miserable Pile of Secrets comes

898
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,900
from, right?

899
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:36,060
Yeah, they just made it totally bland, they removed all the soul and all the fucking fun

900
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,700
from it, they sucked all the fun out of it to make it more fucking good, I guess.

901
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,700
This is a total example.

902
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,660
Feels like they would just re-record lines solely to get some voice actors a paycheck,

903
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,860
you know what I mean?

904
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:55,380
I was just thinking, literally what is the motivation to redo this literally iconic

905
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,820
scene in video games?

906
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:03,380
I think it might be a friend of the developer or whatever, like a voice actor guy wants

907
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,220
a paycheck, let's re-record the lines and get him one.

908
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:12,300
I think it's worse than that, they probably think, and worse than that, they probably

909
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,540
think rightly so, that if they didn't change it, some snarky reviewer on some website

910
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:22,820
somewhere would be like, well the dialogue clearly doesn't hold up and it's fucking

911
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,180
bad now and it's all hokey and queer and gay, but they wouldn't say queer because you can't

912
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,180
say queer now.

913
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,100
But they'd, you know, in so many words, they'd call it queer and gay.

914
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,100
Yeah, of course.

915
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,660
Well it is queer and gay and I like it that way.

916
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,300
Yeah, and I love it.

917
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,300
And it's fucking...

918
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,300
It's fucking...

919
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,300
I don't know.

920
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,100
It would be one thing if like, when they remade Resident Evil they changed the dialogue and

921
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,900
that to be less silly, but that's because, you know, that was a remake, it was a full

922
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,900
from the ground up.

923
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,900
The whole game was...

924
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,900
I have to go feed my cat because he's gonna make noise the whole podcast when you're back.

925
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:03,580
Like the point of a re-release is supposed to be to preserve these works of art for future

926
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,540
generations or for the current generation that wants the convenience of being able to

927
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,540
play it again.

928
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:14,140
I could go into the other room if I wanted, take out the disc, plug in my PlayStation

929
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,460
again and set it up, but I'm already in bed, man.

930
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,860
I want something on my PS4.

931
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,860
I want the convenience.

932
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:23,300
I want something that I remember preserved forever and then I put it in, I paid twenty

933
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:31,540
dollars for it and it's not like how I remember it and I don't like things that have changed.

934
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,540
That's it.

935
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,940
That's my being mad for today.

936
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,020
But Jesse, just don't worry about it though.

937
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,540
Like it's for new people, right?

938
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,540
You just need to shut the fuck up.

939
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,540
It's the new generation.

940
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,060
Yeah, you idiot boomer.

941
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,060
The new generation needs to experience these classics.

942
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,060
It's not for new people.

943
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,060
Fuck the new generation.

944
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,060
It's for me.

945
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,060
It's all for me.

946
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,300
You know, okay, it's true.

947
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,060
That does extremely disturb me and make me want to kill myself.

948
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:59,220
But the good news is that I believe this repackage also comes with Rondo of Blood, which I want

949
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,140
to play so that I might do that.

950
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,580
Yeah, I played a little bit of Rondo of Blood and I'm like, it's too fucking hard.

951
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,060
I just want to play the game that I've played before a thousand times.

952
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,020
I mean, I love the, I mean, I'm a huge fan of all the MetroVanias.

953
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,220
I played literally all of them and love them.

954
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,660
Old Castlevania is fucking hard.

955
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:26,540
I mean, when I was making my Castlevania video, I was like, I feel guilty having never played

956
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,180
a single Simon Castlevania game making this video.

957
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,860
So I'm going to go do that.

958
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,260
And I did.

959
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,980
And it was really fucking hard.

960
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,980
And I could beat it.

961
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,060
Tom, Tom, when me and Munchy were over for for I Am Games and you guys were playing that

962
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,580
like, what was it?

963
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,900
It was like, the Castlevania kickstarter, but it was like the side project like like eight

964
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,900
like 16 bit.

965
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,820
Yeah, it looked.

966
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,540
Yeah, yeah, that game looked pretty fucking cool.

967
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,700
I mean, right.

968
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,020
Art looked really amazing.

969
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,300
I actually did almost beat that game for that game.

970
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,580
I actually did get to the final boss.

971
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,580
I've got it on switch.

972
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,940
I look, I meant to go back and beat it.

973
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:08,380
So in that way, I kind of have almost beaten like a classic Castlevania, even though it's

974
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,740
not a Castlevania.

975
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,220
It's a new fucking thing.

976
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,220
But that game is not a Castlevania.

977
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,780
No, it's it's by Iga or Igarashi, the guy who made Simply In The Night.

978
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,780
Oh, right, right, right.

979
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,780
He's a new boy.

980
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,780
He's a separate boy.

981
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:25,940
This talk of like re-releasing games, making them different and updating them has got me

982
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,660
thinking about Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, which released just like a couple of days

983
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,660
ago.

984
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,980
I've been seeing a friend play that lately.

985
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,980
What do you think, Lads?

986
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,980
Well, it's bad.

987
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:42,460
The fact that they think, I've said this a thousand times in its old hand, but they

988
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:48,940
think that for some reason, the new generation is just stupider.

989
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:55,180
The only thing they can think is that the new generation is stupider than what came before.

990
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:59,660
So this is a remake of Yellow, and everyone played Yellow as a kid, or all the millennials

991
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,660
did.

992
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,900
I thought it was just fun, and they got, and this is children who are doing this, children

993
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,820
who grew up with, you know, the anime.

994
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,940
They play Yellow, and it's a fucking fine time.

995
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,980
No one rides in streets.

996
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,380
No one's like, um, but how do I get past the search?

997
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,020
How do I find the batteries in the trash can?

998
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,020
I don't understand.

999
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,020
Because Pokemon is fucking too easy.

1000
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,020
It's way too hard.

1001
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,820
Even if you continually lose against a gym leader, you'll still gain experience if you

1002
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,460
kill any of their Pokemon, and you'll just eventually overpower them and win.

1003
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,180
But for some reason, they think, no, guys, Pokemon has to be for the kids now.

1004
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,580
You millennials, you 20-year-olds, you've had your chance with Pokemon.

1005
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:36,100
Now it's time for the children to play Pokemon.

1006
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,180
We need to make this game baby game, because it's for the children, okay?

1007
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1008
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,860
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1009
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,860
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1010
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,020
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1011
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,780
are you as cool in my head Jesus Christ?

1012
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,280
No, you're trying to be yerde

1013
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,700
No

1014
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,660
your your bif behold

1015
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,260
OK, go on

1016
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,300
I want to hear it

1017
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:29,660
what's fun about Pokemon Let's Go, is that it's the game that you know and

1018
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:34,800
you can play it again and like they've re-done everything and like oh like wow I can see like this

1019
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:40,680
modern 3ds graphics and this old like fucking location and it's just it's the

1020
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Pokemon catching is like Pokemon Go

1021
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,720
but it's still fine, like you get experience

1022
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,560
for catching them.

1023
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,520
That doesn't sound like fine.

1024
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,320
I'm being swayed back to the other guy's side now.

1025
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,920
Well, I mean, it's, because like,

1026
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,320
you get experience for how well you catch the Pokemon,

1027
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,840
so like you get party experience and stuff.

1028
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,480
It's a bad experience for catching Pokemon.

1029
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,880
Everything, they changed.

1030
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,520
Everything, they shit's different.

1031
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,360
Okay, I know.

1032
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,720
Everything that's different about Pokemon, let's go.

1033
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,000
From mainline Pokemon, it makes it worse

1034
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,920
and like takes away from what I like about the game.

1035
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,800
The fact that you can like access your box at any time

1036
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,640
is a great change.

1037
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,600
It's a great improvement.

1038
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,960
I, Tom, listen, no offense, but I hate you.

1039
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,440
That's fine.

1040
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,880
Your opinion sounds pretty shit to me right now too.

1041
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,280
So like we're just on different wavelengths.

1042
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,120
That's fine.

1043
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,240
Okay, well, hang on, hang on.

1044
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,560
I think there might be at least some disconnect here

1045
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,600
because honestly, a lot of what I've seen in Pokemon,

1046
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,720
let's go, seem like really good things

1047
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,040
that we would want in a Pokemon game.

1048
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,840
Like just the idea of being able to see the Pokemon

1049
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,440
like on the map and then touch them.

1050
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,280
Like that's cool.

1051
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,240
It's okay, I guess.

1052
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,480
I like that.

1053
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,960
Yeah, first of all, I disagree with the idea

1054
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,160
that the younger generation deserves Pokemon.

1055
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,840
I don't think they do.

1056
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,520
I don't think that kids deserve it.

1057
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,680
They already have it.

1058
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,840
They already have it anyway.

1059
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,880
I'm upset.

1060
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,760
I've been waiting my entire life

1061
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,800
for a home console Pokemon game with like modern graphics

1062
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,280
and you can sit on your couch,

1063
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,600
you lay in your bed and play it on the TV screen.

1064
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,000
Been waiting my whole life for that.

1065
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,240
They finally make one and I look at it

1066
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,280
and it's got like Pokemon ghost shit in it

1067
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,320
and they did it wrong.

1068
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,200
They finally did it and they did it wrong.

1069
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,560
Just to spite me and just to give it to the...

1070
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,840
Next year, what everybody wants is coming next year.

1071
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,080
Ultra Sun and Moon are on the switch.

1072
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,920
Ultra Sun and Moon are on the switch.

1073
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,080
They announced Pokemon, let's go.

1074
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,760
They said the mainline series is coming next

1075
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,000
and that's gonna have all the regular mechanics.

1076
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,880
This is not a replacement.

1077
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,320
It's just a comfy co-op game where you can relive

1078
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,520
your first Pokemon adventure.

1079
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,840
This game is for some reason-

1080
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,680
It's fucking kill me,

1081
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,240
fucking kill me instead of that.

1082
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,160
No, you're a fucking idiot

1083
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,920
because you're playing this game for the wrong reason.

1084
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,760
If you're saying like,

1085
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,280
I wanna like fucking do a hardcore Nuzlocke run

1086
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,120
in Pokemon, let's go.

1087
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,120
Hey, I know.

1088
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,960
Not why you play this.

1089
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,720
Let's play a Pokemon game.

1090
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,960
Let's play a Pokemon game where you go on an adventure

1091
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,240
and catch monsters and become the very best

1092
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,560
like no one ever was, only, only.

1093
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,960
Let's make it so you don't have to fucking

1094
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,240
think about it at all.

1095
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,080
That sounds great.

1096
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,280
It's not even that you don't have to think about it.

1097
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,360
It's, I mean, we're not-

1098
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,560
Yes, it fucking is.

1099
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,400
I've seen it.

1100
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,960
You can literally, you can literally double team.

1101
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,240
You can two on one enemy trainers.

1102
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,120
You can fight their one Pokemon with two of yours.

1103
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,000
And you don't have to do it.

1104
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,320
It's just like, if you would,

1105
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,720
like me and Digi just sitting there playing I Am Games,

1106
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,760
just shooting the shit and we're just like,

1107
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,720
oh, Digi wants to jump in and just like play the battle

1108
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,640
with me because we're just,

1109
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,480
we're just enjoying and having a good time.

1110
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,720
It's not, like it's not a hardcore game,

1111
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,920
but it's not a bad game because it's not a hardcore game.

1112
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,120
It's just a casual, fun, like nostalgic experience.

1113
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,360
Like the newest ad for Pokemon Let's Go

1114
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,720
is literally a shot-for-shot remake

1115
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,080
of the original like Pokemon TV theme

1116
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,880
just done with in-game graphics.

1117
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,560
So like this isn't like for new people.

1118
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,720
It's for people who have good memories of this game.

1119
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,720
Just want to play it again and have a good time

1120
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,640
and just chill out.

1121
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,480
And it's fine.

1122
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,280
If that doesn't sound fun to you,

1123
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,520
then this isn't your kind of game,

1124
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,480
but that doesn't mean it's a bad game.

1125
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,320
It's not.

1126
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,160
No, Tom, let me stop you right there.

1127
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,120
The fact that it is not my kind of game

1128
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,400
does mean it's a bad game.

1129
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,240
To you.

1130
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,440
Because being bad means nothing

1131
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,000
other than that I don't like it.

1132
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,160
And because I don't like it, it is bad by definition.

1133
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,000
I made a video about this on my YouTube channel.

1134
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,640
Well, I don't like it for tearing people apart,

1135
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,800
making us fight.

1136
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,640
I don't like it.

1137
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,200
Yeah, it's making us all yell.

1138
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,680
Yeah.

1139
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,840
So much for comfy.

1140
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,440
I like how the stupid of the topic.

1141
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,680
Yeah, I have nostalgia for old Pokemon.

1142
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,040
No, I don't want to play some baby version of it

1143
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,520
to relive those memories.

1144
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,960
The stupid of the topic, the more political

1145
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,600
and fervent the discourse becomes.

1146
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,440
It seems like.

1147
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,280
Yeah, it is.

1148
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,120
It's true.

1149
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,080
Like, before it was all like the fucking Garfield,

1150
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,040
Monday's shit, and that was pretty stupid.

1151
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,880
Then it was like, oh yeah, well, furry is.

1152
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,720
And that was a little bit more stupid,

1153
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,440
getting a little bit more heated.

1154
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,600
But then you start talking about whether the new Pokemon

1155
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,800
game is too much for kids or not.

1156
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,240
And then all of a sudden it's like, well, let

1157
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,320
me stop you're right there.

1158
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,600
So no, no, no, let me finish.

1159
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,200
Let me finish.

1160
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:11,960
Let me say what I want.

1161
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,840
You were invested.

1162
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,600
Yeah, I am invested.

1163
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,400
I just can't think of someone.

1164
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,120
Because the more frivolous the topic,

1165
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,680
the less afraid I am to have a strong opinion about it.

1166
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,520
Here's the thing.

1167
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,480
Pokemon Go players who haven't played the main series games.

1168
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,200
I would say the majority of people who play Pokemon Go

1169
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,600
have played the main series games.

1170
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,120
Let's examine the people who haven't.

1171
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,680
I know someone.

1172
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,880
It's Kazzy's dad.

1173
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,640
Is Kazzy's dad this fucking portly Bostonite going to be

1174
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,840
like, oh, you know what?

1175
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,200
I really want to get into main series Pokemon.

1176
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,520
It's almost like the reason I play Pokemon Go is because

1177
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,960
it's a mobile game.

1178
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,520
And I can play it on my phone.

1179
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,440
It's not like you can trust me.

1180
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,160
You know what?

1181
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,560
I really, really care about Pokemon now.

1182
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,760
So I'm going to go out.

1183
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,520
I'm going to buy like a $200, $300 video game machine,

1184
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,520
which I'm going to play exclusively Pokemon on.

1185
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,080
And that's what I'm going to do with my time and money.

1186
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,040
I have time for this.

1187
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,080
I agree that those people are not going to buy it.

1188
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,280
But by the same token, you just said the majority of people

1189
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,440
who play Pokemon Go play the main series.

1190
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,400
So if you're already playing Pokemon Go,

1191
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,880
and this game works with it, and you can trade guys

1192
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,240
between it and stuff, like it's another game.

1193
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,120
They would already be doing it all the time.

1194
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,760
If you already play the main line series

1195
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,520
and you have a functioning brain,

1196
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,440
no offense, Tom.

1197
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,640
Love you, love you, buddy.

1198
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,800
But then you shouldn't like this new fucking remake.

1199
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,680
Look, it's just a different kind of game.

1200
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,560
And it's still fun.

1201
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,200
It's just not the same kind of game as a main line series.

1202
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,880
It's why it's not replacing it.

1203
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,640
I mean, it's fun.

1204
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,880
It is good.

1205
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,440
I don't hate remakes as long as they're good.

1206
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,200
OK.

1207
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,280
But OK, this is a remake of a different style.

1208
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,360
It's a different interpretation.

1209
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,600
There's a value clash here for sure.

1210
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,160
I am definitely not the kind of game.

1211
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,080
Just wait for I am Games video, which is coming out probably

1212
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,120
today or tomorrow.

1213
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,000
And yeah, it'll explain that more.

1214
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,200
Based on what you said, Nate, were you saying, Nate?

1215
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,480
Well, I was just saying, I can already

1216
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,600
guess the content of that video, which is I'm not saying,

1217
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,480
oh, I don't give a shit.

1218
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,200
I'm just saying, I already know there's clearly

1219
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,440
a distinction between, I mean, I'm really not

1220
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,760
a comfy gamer guy.

1221
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,720
I'm really not.

1222
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,720
I'm a like to be challenged guy.

1223
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,960
I'm not saying I'm better.

1224
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,560
It literally, objectively, doesn't matter.

1225
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,720
I'm saying it, Nate.

1226
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,440
I'm saying we're a higher breed.

1227
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,680
We have a better pedigree.

1228
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,480
We come from a better fucking casual mood.

1229
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,880
I mean, no, no, no, no.

1230
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,280
It's not even about being casual or any of that shit.

1231
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,760
My opinion with video games has always been they're a great

1232
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,240
friend.

1233
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,320
You're a fucking doom fag.

1234
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,800
From doing things I actually care about.

1235
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,920
So I'm not going to sit here and spend all my time

1236
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,080
100% think some incredibly hard game,

1237
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,720
because I have more important things to do than 100%

1238
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,360
a game that when it's done just goes back into the fucking shelf.

1239
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,160
I play it because I'm playing on the street.

1240
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,320
There's another factor here.

1241
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,400
There's another factor here.

1242
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,480
And it is basically, it is what direction is the Pokemon

1243
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,680
company going?

1244
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,040
Because I want them to go in a different direction.

1245
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,120
They're making a, OK, here's the thing

1246
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,200
that I'm also happy with about Pokemon Let's Go.

1247
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,120
And I'll tell you why.

1248
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,960
If they have, because they said during E3 when this game was

1249
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,520
announcing everything, that they're

1250
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,720
going to do this two-prong approach going forward

1251
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,760
and see how it works.

1252
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,920
So if they dump all the casual stuff into the Let's Go series,

1253
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,600
then that frees up the main series

1254
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,360
to be more hardcore and not have all the baby shit in it.

1255
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,120
I would like that very much, but I have no faith at all.

1256
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,040
I have no faith at all that that will happen.

1257
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,920
I think they are lying or mistaken,

1258
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,920
because I don't think they will do that.

1259
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,680
There's no way.

1260
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,480
Look at Sun and Moon.

1261
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,160
Look at Sun and Moon.

1262
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,200
There's no way they're going to stop the baby if it can't

1263
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,920
design a Pokemon Let's Go series.

1264
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,920
I don't know.

1265
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,720
Then it sounds like fourth one is just

1266
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,480
a shitty series that you guys shouldn't play anymore.

1267
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,280
That's correct.

1268
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,000
That is correct.

1269
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,120
I go back and forth on this.

1270
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,280
I feel like maybe, like we had the switch to 3D

1271
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,920
in Gen 6, and then there was Gen 7.

1272
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,000
And I didn't play Gen 6, but Gen 7 was pretty good,

1273
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,360
but I don't think it was quite there.

1274
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,960
I feel like in Gen 8, I don't know.

1275
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,160
I feel like they might really nail it.

1276
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,040
They might nail the formula in Gen 8.

1277
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,080
I am extremely anticipating to see what development choices

1278
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,560
they make in the next game, because I

1279
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,280
think that'll tell us a ton of information about where

1280
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,000
they're actually going.

1281
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,160
I mean, if I'm looking at the series history

1282
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,800
and I'm having to guess, here's my prediction.

1283
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,600
They add a bunch of frivolous bullshit

1284
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,720
that nobody cares about.

1285
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,880
Remove a lot of features for no real reason.

1286
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,480
Yeah.

1287
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,320
Like maybe they add a new version of contests.

1288
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,080
Wouldn't that be cool?

1289
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,080
It is not a cynical position at all

1290
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,440
to think that a series has declined,

1291
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,680
because it's not like never.

1292
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,680
None of us are happy right now.

1293
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,600
None of us are like, oh man, it's so good to hate Pokemon.

1294
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:50,320
We get such catharsis out of making bad reviews of Pokemon

1295
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,240
or something.

1296
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,880
I am not happy that Pokemon, to me,

1297
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,000
has gone downhill in a way.

1298
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,680
It's not even a new thing.

1299
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,000
It's not even like I thought this for years or something.

1300
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,480
This is an extremely new development for me.

1301
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,240
I'm still in like a shock, like denial stage,

1302
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,200
where I just think, wow, why is this happening?

1303
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,400
Stop it, please.

1304
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,200
High points of the series for me

1305
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,360
were Black, White, Two, and Sparkle Souls.

1306
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,440
And that wasn't that long ago.

1307
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,400
That was like what?

1308
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,160
Like a couple years ago.

1309
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,200
That wasn't very long.

1310
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,960
Yeah, four, five, six years ago?

1311
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,800
Man, I don't know.

1312
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,120
I don't know if it's gone downhill

1313
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,760
or if I've gone downhill.

1314
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,480
I mean, I didn't play Ultra Sun and Moon,

1315
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,480
but I heard that they weren't much better than Sun and Moon

1316
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,800
were not as good as White, Two.

1317
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,280
I can't really keep track of them.

1318
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,920
I mean, to me, it's like all the gents are the same,

1319
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,840
like all the Pokemon gents.

1320
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,600
I mean, they're all police officers.

1321
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,520
They all look the same.

1322
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,920
You know?

1323
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,920
All the Pokemon gents.

1324
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,520
You know, the gents and Pokemon.

1325
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,360
Oh.

1326
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,360
You fucking pheasant.

1327
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,360
No.

1328
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,360
Oh, damn it.

1329
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,640
I was rubed.

1330
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,320
I mean, is rubed a word?

1331
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,320
Can you be rubed?

1332
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,120
Sure.

1333
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:08,960
Why not?

1334
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,840
There's a game.

1335
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,360
I think I'm at Ruzed.

1336
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,520
There's a game that I have in my Steam library

1337
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,360
that I come back to fairly regularly to play with friends.

1338
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,480
It is called Yet Another Zombie Defense,

1339
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,720
and it is $0.99.

1340
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:25,360
It's a shit shovelware, like Steam, green light,

1341
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,440
push through the doors as possible to turn a quick buck.

1342
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,360
When you open up the game, the file on your computer,

1343
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,480
like on Task Manager, it says My Game, all caps,

1344
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,640
and it has an Xbox controller logo.

1345
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,840
And it just is you are spawn in this like Unity graphics,

1346
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,680
like only default settings.

1347
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,400
Like, they didn't actually make any of their own models.

1348
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,960
It's just like default shit, and you just shoot zombies forever.

1349
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,040
And that's literally all the game is.

1350
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:56,920
And that game, I could recognize, is shit, but I love it.

1351
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,840
First of all, for, because it's funny, because it's hilarious.

1352
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,040
It's called Yet Another Zombie Defense.

1353
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,320
Like, even the title is exasperated at what it is.

1354
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,920
But not only that, just because it's such like an easy game

1355
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,520
that I can just call up Ethan whenever I want,

1356
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,400
and I can be like, oh, dude, you up for it.

1357
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,520
You up for the Yet Another Zombie Defense session.

1358
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,480
He'd be like, oh, hell, yeah, we get past our high score.

1359
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,360
We gotta get past night 20.

1360
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,680
And then we can do that, and it'll be a great time.

1361
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,680
And I feel like that might be the sort of thing

1362
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,480
that you do, Tom, with this video game, where I don't,

1363
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,080
I mean, I think it's a difference between you

1364
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,720
thanking the game is bad or not.

1365
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,760
But it's more about the social aspect of it

1366
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,880
rather than the game itself being good or bad.

1367
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,960
I'm just sick of playing games being easy.

1368
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,240
Like, I was already way sick of it.

1369
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,320
And now, a way more easy Pokemon game comes out.

1370
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,680
And I know that's just me.

1371
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,520
I know that's just me.

1372
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,080
All the Pokemon games have been easy since the first one.

1373
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:52,800
Yeah.

1374
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,920
Well, look, there's a huge fucking difference

1375
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,840
between the ease of like, sun and moon versus like, diamond.

1376
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,400
But like, the writing's been on the wall forever.

1377
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,600
That doesn't mean it's good.

1378
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,520
And that just means my points are correct.

1379
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,360
But it just means that after like two decades,

1380
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,800
you're going to have to be like, I guess

1381
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,000
this is just a simple game.

1382
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,920
I hate this argument.

1383
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,320
I hate this argument that we should just give up on Pokemon.

1384
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,480
I'm not saying you should give up.

1385
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,400
I'm just saying like, go and expecting

1386
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,480
that it's probably going to be a simplistic game.

1387
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,400
Like, I don't think, I agree with you.

1388
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,480
I would like the challenge of red and blue back.

1389
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,560
Because like, Pokemon red and blue

1390
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,080
wasn't so challenging that I would just like, stop playing it

1391
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,320
because I have better things to do.

1392
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,640
It's like, enough like, oh, like, I actually

1393
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,000
have to like, think and try.

1394
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,920
And like, when they released Fire Red and Leaf Green,

1395
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,920
I was like, ah, they made this way simpler.

1396
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,040
Like, that game was still fun.

1397
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:35,640
I still enjoyed it.

1398
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,720
Because I'm like, whoa, it's like, better graphics and stuff.

1399
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,240
And like, this is like, a deeper realization of the world.

1400
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,360
It's interesting to see.

1401
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,080
Like, is it better than the original?

1402
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,160
No, but it's still an interesting experience

1403
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,080
to see this again with different hardware.

1404
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,800
Like, that's a cool experience to me.

1405
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,200
And Let's Go's doing the same thing.

1406
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,480
It's like, it's a new experience.

1407
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,800
Like, we were talking on the stream

1408
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,720
how like, there's so much more detail that like,

1409
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,120
I know where I'm going, but it almost doesn't even

1410
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,080
feel that familiar.

1411
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,240
Like, if it wasn't, because did you

1412
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,480
was saying how like, the level design of Let's Go

1413
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,480
is still kind of like, geometric and right

1414
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,680
angley, like the original Game Boy gamers.

1415
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,240
But there's so much detail in it,

1416
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,960
that it almost like, the visuals,

1417
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,080
like the actual technical details of the visuals

1418
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,680
are way better than like, Sun and Moon, for example.

1419
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,200
But Sun and Moon were designed from the ground up

1420
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,360
as a 3D game.

1421
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,920
So the geometry and stuff is more organic

1422
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,960
and less right angley.

1423
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,280
So the actual like, level layouts

1424
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,360
are more in depth in Sun and Moon.

1425
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,480
So these like, level designs feel more basic

1426
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,000
because they're based on 1996 Game Boy games.

1427
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,920
But visually they look great.

1428
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,720
3D, 3D was a mistake.

1429
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,840
The series never looked better than it did in Gen 5.

1430
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,360
And it never will.

1431
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,560
I want, we've talked about Pokemon a lot

1432
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,600
and I feel it always does come down to one thing,

1433
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,920
at least for me.

1434
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,760
It's true.

1435
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,080
I mean, even if I want Pokemon to be good,

1436
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,840
the proof is in the pudding.

1437
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,760
Maybe the next games will really be something

1438
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,600
that shakes things up.

1439
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,120
Now that there's been a divide between hardcore

1440
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,160
and soft core players, to whatever extent we'll find out.

1441
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,520
But the real answer is, go play Crystal Clear,

1442
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,000
go play the ROM hacks, that's the shit.

1443
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,240
We should just all go play Crystal Clear.

1444
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,640
And apparently that's the good one,

1445
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,640
that everyone says to play.

1446
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,480
I don't want to seem like a doom bringer here.

1447
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,760
I don't want to seem like someone who's saying

1448
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,800
the apocalypse isn't anything.

1449
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,360
I don't think Pokemon has degraded to such a point

1450
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,920
where I don't like it anymore or something.

1451
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,760
Yeah.

1452
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,080
I don't know.

1453
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,960
I'm allowed to be mad, aren't I?

1454
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,720
I'm allowed to be like, oh man,

1455
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,640
things were better like a couple years ago.

1456
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,040
Do I not earn that?

1457
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,360
Do I not have that?

1458
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,880
Sun and Moon weren't terrible.

1459
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,520
They were just like, you know,

1460
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,120
they were no black, white too.

1461
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,440
They were just exasperating.

1462
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,360
They were no hard-goal, soul, silver.

1463
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,280
And that's a shame, it's a shame that the sequels

1464
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,880
are not improving.

1465
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,720
Yes.

1466
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,720
For a while they were, every generation,

1467
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,560
every generation from one to five

1468
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,400
was a straight improvement at fact, hashtag fact.

1469
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,480
I don't know about four.

1470
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,320
Well, why not four?

1471
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,840
Why not four?

1472
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,760
I'm so fucking mad at you stupid millennials.

1473
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,680
You don't fucking get it.

1474
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,520
Shut up.

1475
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,360
Physical special split.

1476
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,680
Shut the fuck up.

1477
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,080
A hard-goal, soul, silver were,

1478
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,800
but the main like diamond pearl were not.

1479
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,640
Yeah.

1480
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,960
I didn't like diamond pearl that much.

1481
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,520
All of your problems with it.

1482
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,000
Three was a huge step down from gen two.

1483
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,800
Three?

1484
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,640
I don't know about that because just gen,

1485
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,080
I mean, I skipped gen three,

1486
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,000
but it added the physical special split, right?

1487
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,920
Gen three took out the day-night cycle,

1488
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,720
which was so cool about gen two.

1489
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,200
They reduced the amount, like you only had eight badges

1490
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,160
again instead of 16.

1491
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,680
So the game was half the size.

1492
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,920
And then in order to get like the evolutions

1493
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,880
they debuted last gen,

1494
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,600
you had to buy GameCube games

1495
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,000
just so you could port them in.

1496
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,840
Okay.

1497
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,680
I understand.

1498
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,520
I understand.

1499
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,360
And those trumpet sounds were fucking disgusting.

1500
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,200
And to this day,

1501
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,920
it sounds like nails on the chalkboard.

1502
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,040
Halfing the game isn't good.

1503
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,080
And they'd never been able to top that either.

1504
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,400
But the immeasurable benefit of having like abilities

1505
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,400
and natures and shit like that in battle,

1506
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,320
completely revolutionized the battle.

1507
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,120
Okay, here's the distinction.

1508
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,720
In all of the best Pokemon games,

1509
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,320
they kept adding more and more stuff

1510
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,840
to the battling system,

1511
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,680
because that's how you interact with the game.

1512
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,320
Stop pretending that Pokemon isn't about battling.

1513
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,880
Because that's literally all that you do in the game

1514
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,720
is battle.

1515
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,560
That's all you do.

1516
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,880
Mechanically, the game has only improved

1517
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,160
and I don't think it's ever slid back.

1518
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,760
Oh, I wouldn't say, I think it has.

1519
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,600
Man.

1520
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,440
It's been bogged down.

1521
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,840
I hate the natures and all the hidden stats.

1522
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,560
It's just ruins the whole fucking experience.

1523
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,680
No, those are, they add to the game

1524
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,920
but you can ignore them if you want to.

1525
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,800
No, they're like totally like, eh.

1526
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,440
Nah, I don't like them.

1527
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,160
Nah.

1528
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,440
That's 10 out of 10.

1529
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,440
I was gonna hate that more passionately,

1530
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,000
but I fucking ran out.

1531
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:57,040
I hate when people are like,

1532
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,000
this comes a lot,

1533
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,520
this comes a lot in smash community discussions

1534
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,840
where it's like, why do you want the game to be competitive?

1535
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,000
What, just fucking, it just turned your brain off.

1536
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,280
It's just a party game.

1537
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,400
I don't even, I don't want anyone else

1538
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,600
to experience the game in any other way than my do.

1539
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,600
A.K.A. I only ever want to play like four players

1540
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,520
with Atom's on.

1541
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:27,520
I fucked up the starting of this conversation so badly.

1542
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,600
I'm not saying that you can't have parties

1543
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,440
or anything like that.

1544
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,960
I'm not saying anything remotely.

1545
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,240
I'm just trying to say that it's fun

1546
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,760
to play games competitively.

1547
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,600
It's fun to try hard.

1548
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,960
Devils advocate here, when you're at a party

1549
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,400
and you're all playing Smash

1550
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,760
and someone is really good, the party's ruined.

1551
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,000
Well, just don't get that.

1552
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,560
Okay, okay, first of all, nothing to do with the game.

1553
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,280
Because I was Princess Peach and I killed Steve,

1554
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,880
I killed all of Munchie's friends

1555
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,440
and once with fucking in a display of power

1556
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,280
yet unrivaled by man.

1557
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,520
And we all had a great time

1558
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,360
as I was destroying everyone

1559
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,600
with my incredible Peach powers.

1560
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,000
Having the game be balanced and be able to be competitive

1561
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,440
does not detract from the party aspect in any way.

1562
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,320
There's absolutely no reason to not have it

1563
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,600
being competitively viable.

1564
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,480
As a loyal Peach player, are you excited to play as Daisy?

1565
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,440
Because I feel that strongly.

1566
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,560
Didn't you see my video?

1567
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:25,440
My E3 video, I was so excited, I sang from the heart.

1568
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,680
Did I, maybe I missed it, but shit,

1569
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,080
I don't know, I have to go watch it again if so.

1570
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,560
Oh shit, yeah, I did a whole video about Daisy

1571
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,240
and how cool it is and how excited I am and shit.

1572
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,880
She's got like a weird side B.

1573
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,920
I mean, what's the deal?

1574
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,760
What is it?

1575
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,120
Or it might be down, I forget which,

1576
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,040
the one with its toad, it might be her neutral B.

1577
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,720
She like swishes back and forth,

1578
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,320
it's a really bizarre motion.

1579
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,560
I am, honestly, Daisy is my number one character

1580
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,560
I'm excited to play as.

1581
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,400
I mean, I'm very excited to play as Daisy,

1582
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,040
but I also feel a little bit of guilt

1583
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,680
because Peach is like my best friend.

1584
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,840
She's like the best girl.

1585
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,680
She's like been there for me this whole time

1586
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,400
and sometimes I'm gonna have to be a Daisy.

1587
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,720
Sometimes, look, look, I can't be a one,

1588
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,840
I can't be a one princess guy, okay?

1589
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,920
I'm too cool for that.

1590
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,720
I wonder, do you think, just quick aside,

1591
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,960
do you think that the game or the fucking, the pro circuit,

1592
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,200
now that like, smash ball charging stuff

1593
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,320
is like a meter that gets charged,

1594
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,480
is that gonna be like switched off for tournament play?

1595
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,880
Or like, yeah, okay, well, all right.

1596
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,280
I was gonna say, Daisy and Peach,

1597
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,640
I think literally have the best one

1598
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,640
because it both gets an instant kill

1599
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,320
and they also can be fully healed,

1600
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,280
which is just like the best combination of shit.

1601
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,480
Yeah, there's no way they would ever allow

1602
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,440
smash ball to turn into whatever.

1603
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,400
In Eastergames, they switch to whatever.

1604
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,920
Nothing more asinine and infuriating

1605
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,960
and obnoxious in the world than being at a party

1606
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,800
and everyone's playing Smash Brothers

1607
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,960
and everyone's having a good time,

1608
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,840
but there's that one guy who's like,

1609
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,760
yeah, we gotta do a final destination, we know items.

1610
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,600
Turn off the fucking items.

1611
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,920
We gotta turn off the items.

1612
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,480
It's not a real fight, it's not real competition,

1613
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,600
it's not competitive.

1614
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,520
First of all, I hate the items.

1615
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,360
I hate them.

1616
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,960
No, the items are, okay.

1617
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,560
I vehemently disagree with the notion

1618
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,440
that having items on is somehow less competitive

1619
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,480
or less of a game of skill.

1620
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,000
Yeah, I'm with you.

1621
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,840
I'm with you, Jesse.

1622
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,680
No, it's so much more random.

1623
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,520
It's live, it's live.

1624
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,360
Yeah, yeah, it's live.

1625
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,200
It's random, but it's not.

1626
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,400
It's random, it's fair.

1627
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:32,000
Like, you still have to know how to capitalize on using it.

1628
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,040
Yeah, I don't get it.

1629
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:33,880
I don't get it.

1630
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,720
I don't get the idea.

1631
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,560
It's totally insane.

1632
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,720
Mate, no, knowing how to use the items,

1633
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,920
knowing it's a whole different skill set

1634
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,720
that the final destination crew

1635
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,920
just totally pretends doesn't exist.

1636
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,920
I can't even take this armor seriously.

1637
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,440
Yeah, like, yeah, you can get a lucky,

1638
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,400
you can get a lucky drop, you, shut up.

1639
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,480
You can get a lucky drop

1640
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,080
and get a hammer and win because of it,

1641
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,800
but I still think that the better player will win more.

1642
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,520
Oh, wow, look, it's a Pokeball.

1643
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,880
It spawned right in front of me.

1644
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,200
I'll approve it, though it's Kyogre.

1645
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,960
It helps the entire screen.

1646
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,560
Oh, cool.

1647
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,040
Like, you just get one Masterball spawn next to you.

1648
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,560
You get it, and it's like, I don't know,

1649
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,120
fucking instant win, Mewtwo, or whatever the fuck it is.

1650
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,040
I don't know.

1651
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,360
It's, that's silly.

1652
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,320
Look, look.

1653
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,240
Like, it's fine.

1654
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,080
Here's the thing.

1655
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,520
In a real combat. They're not bad.

1656
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,960
In a real combat situation, you don't get to go,

1657
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,720
okay, here are the rules and here's how I want them.

1658
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,600
And if someone attacks you in a bar,

1659
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,400
you're grabbing a bottle, you're grabbing a chair,

1660
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,360
you're grabbing anything you fucking can

1661
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,120
because that's competitive.

1662
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,560
Bitch.

1663
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,400
Yeah, okay.

1664
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,680
Well, I mean, I actually practice what I preach,

1665
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,200
AKA Bushido, and I believe in honorable duels.

1666
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,000
So maybe look it up one of these fucking days.

1667
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,240
I think the competition,

1668
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,160
it's not like about a bar fight, it's a sport, you know?

1669
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,520
He's right.

1670
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,200
Yeah, it's a closed, sanitized environment.

1671
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,080
The only sport that I believe in is professional wrestling,

1672
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,440
where there are no rules

1673
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,800
and anyone can do any stupid shit they want.

1674
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,480
And that's the one true sport.

1675
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,160
So somehow I've finagled my way into being right once again.

1676
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,200
I'm a different breed, you see.

1677
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,040
I'm a Zoomer.

1678
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,800
I grew up with Smash completely different

1679
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,720
than I see everyone describe it.

1680
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,320
Here's how Smash Plane goes with me.

1681
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,560
My friends come over.

1682
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,480
We talk about the latest Smash tournament.

1683
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,000
Then we go into 1v1s.

1684
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,680
And it's a great time when we all laugh

1685
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,160
and we all play like Friendly's 1v1.

1686
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,120
Non-fountaination, we do a plethora of stages.

1687
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,560
And it just is great because we're actually trying

1688
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,000
and it's somewhat a competition.

1689
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,920
And when we lose or win,

1690
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,800
it feels good because we're with our friends.

1691
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,560
There's no hard feelings or anything,

1692
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,280
but we're still playing the game

1693
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,840
like we're actually trying to.

1694
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,160
And it's not just fucking easy, nothing matters.

1695
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,200
That's how it was for me in college with my buddies.

1696
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,400
There was always kind of in the back of our minds,

1697
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,160
there was the idea that we're trying to get better

1698
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,760
because we did participate in tournaments

1699
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,600
every once in a while at college.

1700
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,040
So there was that idea that we were grinding our skills

1701
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,680
a little bit to try to up our game for that.

1702
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,400
So yeah, I guess I was involved with the scene

1703
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,520
at least a little bit.

1704
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,480
So I was trying to play to that.

1705
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,600
We turned off all the stages on the random selection

1706
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,920
except for the ones that were tournament viable.

1707
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,760
You know, shit like that.

1708
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,920
Fuck yeah, dude.

1709
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,840
Oh my God, it's gonna be so, okay, okay.

1710
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:12,080
No more fucking, oh, Pokemon isn't good.

1711
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,840
Listen, Smash Bros,

1712
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,840
it's gonna be a little bit fucked up.

1713
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,200
Listen, that's a short, but, but.

1714
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,120
Oh my, I never in a thousand years

1715
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,120
thought they would listen to this argument

1716
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,000
because it wasn't like the most, you know,

1717
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,920
and it's not like, oh, bring back wave dashes.

1718
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,080
It's not the loudest things in the community.

1719
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,720
But the fact that they have not fucking, you know,

1720
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,840
final destination mode, not that they have bathroom mode,

1721
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,320
but they have hazards off.

1722
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,400
That you can turn off hazards and play on any map you want to

1723
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:45,040
and have it not just like spawn weird boss battles at the time

1724
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,960
or just change, like transform

1725
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,120
into fucking bizarre awful versions of itself

1726
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,160
over and over again.

1727
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,840
Like you can just turn off hazards

1728
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,000
on fucking WarioWare Incorporate.

1729
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,160
You can go there and have the weird like pseudo battlefield,

1730
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,240
you know, like it's like a block stage

1731
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,080
with two extra platforms on the other side.

1732
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,360
Oh, glorious.

1733
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,480
I love that so much.

1734
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,640
It's so good.

1735
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,480
Me too.

1736
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,280
Me too.

1737
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,480
I'm so bored.

1738
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,120
I'm so fucking bored, you guys.

1739
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,520
What?

1740
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,520
Hey, Mage, how are you doing?

1741
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,360
How was your week?

1742
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,360
You haven't said anything in like an hour.

1743
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,640
I wanted to say that you guys were so passionate about things

1744
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,560
I didn't want to butt in.

1745
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,280
No, who cares?

1746
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,800
I like Pokemon.

1747
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,200
You doing anything interesting this week, Mage?

1748
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,280
No, no, I've been dead.

1749
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,120
And then I had a whole bunch of mobile apps

1750
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,600
that consumed my life for like forever.

1751
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,240
Yeah, Mage is becoming a digital crazy cat lady

1752
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,840
to reestablish before the podcast.

1753
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,160
I have like four apps that are all different cats.

1754
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,680
You're playing that Neco at Sumay?

1755
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,040
One of the things, yeah, I have like four different apps

1756
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,600
with cats of them.

1757
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,960
And one was Dragons.

1758
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,560
Well, I played Neco at Sumay a couple of years ago.

1759
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,160
I think I deleted it at some point.

1760
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,240
It's so cute.

1761
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,280
But I replaced it with Matt.

1762
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,440
For a while, I was really into Magikarp Jump.

1763
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,800
You guys ever play Magikarp Jump?

1764
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,440
Oh, yeah, I played it for a little bit.

1765
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,160
Magikarp Jump was actually pretty fun for a while.

1766
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,360
I like to turn off items when I play Magikarp Jump

1767
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,040
competitively.

1768
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,760
I just think they really have to disperse.

1769
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,800
They introduced too much randomness into the fun.

1770
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,040
Exactly.

1771
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,080
My worst nightmare.

1772
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,520
It's no longer a game of skill.

1773
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,800
My worst nightmare.

1774
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,640
Guys, guys, guys, guys, my worst nightmare.

1775
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,240
The thing I dreaded the most with Magikarp Jump

1776
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:28,320
was like having my Magikarp get taken away by like a Pidgeot.

1777
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,520
Is that a thing that can happen?

1778
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,240
Yeah, there's a random chance.

1779
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,120
You clearly did not play enough Magikarp Jump.

1780
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,720
Yeah, you can fuck up and lose the game.

1781
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,480
It can be stolen by a Pidgeotto.

1782
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,000
It can be, there's one other thing.

1783
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,840
It can evolve into a Gyarados.

1784
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,960
And you can evolve it into a Gyarados, which

1785
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,800
is the worst thing that can happen.

1786
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,280
No, no, no, no.

1787
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,680
Nate, you don't understand.

1788
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,080
Gyarados are worthless because they can't jump.

1789
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,040
They just fly.

1790
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,080
Who the fuck cares?

1791
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,280
This is a jumping competition.

1792
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,680
Is this a thing where you have to avoid the rare candies

1793
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,360
so you don't accidentally overlevel and become

1794
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,360
a Magikarp Jump?

1795
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:08,720
No, it's pretty hard to evolve them by accident.

1796
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,760
But you sort of have to go out of your way to do it.

1797
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,360
But if you do, you lose the game.

1798
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,640
Or well, you don't lose the game.

1799
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,760
You just have to start over with a new Magikarp.

1800
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,880
That's a feature, though.

1801
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,800
Yeah, there's some secret thing you got to do together.

1802
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,320
Damn, I'm going to download Magikarp Jump right now.

1803
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,000
I really like it.

1804
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,400
I like how rooted and lore it is because there's one of the.

1805
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,440
I have a deep lore of Magikarp Jump.

1806
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,960
Well, it is, though, because one of the Pokedex entries

1807
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:39,000
says that certain Magikarp that get old enough

1808
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,680
can jump over mountains.

1809
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,480
Does that happen?

1810
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,640
Well, I mean, not in the game.

1811
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,200
But the Pokedex does say that, yeah.

1812
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,440
Well, I mean, but what's the lore relevance

1813
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,080
if you don't actually jump over a mountain, then?

1814
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,960
Well, I mean, the point is, what the fuck?

1815
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,120
The point is that your Magikarp are jumping really high.

1816
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,800
But you said the lore is that they jump over mountains,

1817
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,600
but they don't do that.

1818
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,000
So, man.

1819
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,200
Are you fucking stupid?

1820
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,960
The point is that they jump really high.

1821
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,920
Jumping over a mountain is just an example

1822
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,920
of how high and far they can fucking jump.

1823
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,840
So the game is about jumping really high and far.

1824
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,920
That's sad, though.

1825
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,920
Why?

1826
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,800
I mean, being an old Magikarp that never became a Gyarados,

1827
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,600
it's like being an old virgin.

1828
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,920
Yeah, I mean, that's true.

1829
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,200
But the ones that become a Gyarados are like,

1830
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,360
they're the exception.

1831
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:30,640
I'm pretty sure that the way that the economy,

1832
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,320
the ecology of Pokemon works,

1833
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,160
like only like a very rare Magikarp,

1834
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,920
actually becomes a Gyarados.

1835
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,880
Maybe it's worse to be a Gyarados.

1836
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,520
Maybe there's something that we're not privy to

1837
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,840
in the life of a Gyarados,

1838
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,920
because they've always got that twisted snarls.

1839
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:45,760
They've got the mouth of it.

1840
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,240
They've got dry mouth for days.

1841
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,200
They've got a sore throat, dude.

1842
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,920
They look so miserable.

1843
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,240
They live under water, Munchie.

1844
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,240
They can't jump.

1845
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,440
They can't jump.

1846
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,040
They can't compete in the Magikarp Jump League.

1847
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:56,880
They can fly, though, right?

1848
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,960
Like as a kid, I'm like, oh, Gyarados is cool,

1849
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,640
because he looks scary and angry.

1850
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,400
But now I'm like, oh, man, Gyarados is living

1851
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,440
with a lot of anger,

1852
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,160
and I don't know if that's healthy for poor Gyarados.

1853
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,000
Maybe Gyarados just has a resting bitch face.

1854
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,600
I think it's a mental health issue.

1855
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,440
We have to.

1856
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,160
You know, that's true.

1857
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,760
Yeah, I could believe that, too.

1858
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,600
So I got a text the other day.

1859
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,440
I know what to find out.

1860
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,720
That enraged me.

1861
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,280
It was from someone I don't know.

1862
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,120
Already on there.

1863
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,440
I'll just, I'll read the exchange.

1864
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,560
I'll read the exchange that we had.

1865
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,120
I get a text that's like,

1866
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,120
where is it, where is it, where is it?

1867
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:43,960
It's like two down.

1868
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:44,800
Here we go.

1869
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,120
It's a link.

1870
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,720
It's a link to a GoFundMe,

1871
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,120
and then it would help a tremendous amount,

1872
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,960
if you donated, to my GoFundMe page.

1873
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,800
And yeah, yeah.

1874
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,080
So I clicked the link just out of curiosity,

1875
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,640
and it's the name of some girl that I don't know.

1876
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,120
I don't recognize the name.

1877
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,880
It's a picture of what I presume is her and her boyfriend,

1878
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,080
and it's like, help me escape

1879
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,240
from my abusive home or something.

1880
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,200
Okay.

1881
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,760
And then, I didn't read the whole article.

1882
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,600
There was something about, you know,

1883
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,240
my mother says that it would be better

1884
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,440
if I killed myself or something like that.

1885
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,560
Have you considered she's right?

1886
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1887
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,720
So I kind of wish I'd read the whole thing now

1888
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,960
so I could go into more detail, but I didn't, whatever.

1889
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,240
So I text her back, who is this?

1890
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,240
She says, who are you?

1891
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,800
To which I respond, you're the one

1892
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,120
that sent me a request to donate to your GoFundMe.

1893
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,680
No thanks, BTDubs.

1894
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,440
And I was very upset, and I'm still seething.

1895
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,960
I'm still seething with rage

1896
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,480
that anyone would intrude upon my personal space like this.

1897
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,000
It's disgusting, and I hate them.

1898
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,840
Yeah.

1899
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,920
Did they respond to that at all?

1900
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,960
No, they did not.

1901
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,960
But that was just yesterday,

1902
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,320
so they guessed there's still time.

1903
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,840
That is very rude.

1904
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,120
So I guess you just like mass send out

1905
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,960
to like all our contacts or something?

1906
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:06,840
Just like, please donate to me stuff, something?

1907
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,520
Maybe there's like some lists you're a part of,

1908
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,080
and every time someone wants to mass send a text,

1909
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,520
your number's on there.

1910
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,480
It's called the government no fly list.

1911
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,840
Oh, shit, you're right.

1912
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:19,200
Those people got a lot of extra money kicking around

1913
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,840
from all the flights they're not taking,

1914
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,440
so they're a perfect candidate.

1915
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,000
They can't escape and get an international number.

1916
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:30,200
I just felt like an addiction to GoFundMe lately.

1917
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,960
What? How so?

1918
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,800
What?

1919
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,000
Well, because like, you know, you see them,

1920
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,880
every once in a while, someone on your Facebook

1921
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,600
has like, oh, here's my uncle.

1922
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,360
He was in a car crash, or here's my friend.

1923
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,720
He needs a wheelchair or something like that, you know?

1924
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,560
Yeah.

1925
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,280
You're always seeing them, and just like,

1926
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:49,840
I see the GoFundMe as a people who are in bad situations,

1927
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,040
and like, I get this feeling inside me.

1928
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,760
That's like, I'm not trying to virtue signal,

1929
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,400
because it's not altruistic at all.

1930
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,240
It's a feeling of, I have to be better than everyone.

1931
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,720
I have to be better than people, so I have to donate.

1932
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,120
I have to donate $100 to all of these people,

1933
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:04,960
and I do.

1934
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:05,800
Oh my God.

1935
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,040
I donate $100 to each worthy cause that I find.

1936
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,320
Dude, I'm sorry, but fucking gag.

1937
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,760
If someone was fucking burned in an accident, $100.

1938
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:15,080
If somebody was fucking broke their ankle

1939
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,080
by slipping on ice, $100.

1940
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,640
You all get $100, because I have to be better.

1941
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:20,800
I'm better than people.

1942
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,920
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jesse, I'm not a GoFundMe.

1943
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,400
I guess if they're burned, I don't know.

1944
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,200
GoFundMe's for you, they're all to me, for no reason.

1945
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,240
Here's, I mean, okay, I guess, like this article

1946
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,360
did not convince me that this person's situation

1947
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,680
was actually dire.

1948
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,240
I guess I could kind of get it if I was really convinced

1949
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,120
that someone's situation was really dire.

1950
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,240
But at the same time, no matter how dire

1951
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,840
someone's circumstances are, it's not my responsibility.

1952
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,920
It like, it's not my responsibility to help people

1953
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,720
that have been burned, or crippled, or are dying, right?

1954
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,440
Like, there's a million of them in the world,

1955
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,760
and I can't help them all, so why should I help any of them?

1956
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,320
Now is a perfect time to reflect on the teachings

1957
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:00,720
of one iron rand, because what you're describing

1958
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:04,520
is exactly the mentality of the,

1959
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,640
I forget what they're called, of the parasites,

1960
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,740
or of the people who are manipulated by the parasites.

1961
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:12,480
One should keep in mind that it is a virtue

1962
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,560
to build oneself up, because it is only when you build

1963
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:19,600
yourself up, and see that you are the optimal human being

1964
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,360
that you can be, that you can then provide

1965
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,440
the most value to those other people,

1966
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,480
not that they deserve it, or anything,

1967
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,360
self-interest is the most important factor in the world.

1968
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,360
But, you know, it'll be objectively more useful.

1969
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,680
Well, Ayn Rand was a crazy monster.

1970
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,760
The reason to help one of them is that there's one person

1971
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,800
who's more happier than you left them,

1972
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,640
like, you know, when you started out.

1973
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,280
Thank you, thank you.

1974
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:47,360
But you'll just end up spending all your money on this shit.

1975
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,160
All of your money, you donate a little bit,

1976
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,640
you know, like, you might as well just go fund me.

1977
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,640
You're not gonna, I'm not saying to spend your 401k

1978
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,040
on this fucking person out of nowhere.

1979
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,200
No, listen, you see one person who has these

1980
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,560
bad circumstances, you feel bad, you donate the money.

1981
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,400
But guess what?

1982
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,920
There's a thousand more in the exact same

1983
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,560
or worse circumstances that you didn't give money to.

1984
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,400
And I'll get to them all.

1985
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,240
Why did you give money to this one human being?

1986
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,280
I'll get to them all eventually.

1987
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:15,440
One day when I'm ready, I'm gonna fix the world.

1988
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,000
I'm gonna fix them all.

1989
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,320
The thing is,

1990
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,720
is for some reason you resonated with that person

1991
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,040
to go fund me just a little bit more.

1992
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:23,880
I think the idea is,

1993
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,720
there's no shame in that.

1994
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:25,560
It's not what you're gonna want.

1995
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,000
Then the reason you're donating, you're not donating

1996
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,480
because of anything that you're donating

1997
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,880
because their marketing was better.

1998
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,040
Hey guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

1999
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,720
Yeah, what's, I don't understand what's wrong with that.

2000
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,920
Stop rewarding failure.

2001
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,240
Stop rewarding failure.

2002
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,080
Yeah.

2003
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,120
Guys, I'm sort of on Jess's side.

2004
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,040
I would like to help people, but the thing is,

2005
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:45,280
a lot of people take the goodwill of other people

2006
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,360
and use them like, you know, scams.

2007
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,880
And they could say like,

2008
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,880
oh, hey, I need a new wheelchair or whatever,

2009
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,160
but they actually don't.

2010
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,280
And they just use the goodwill of people.

2011
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,640
And I don't want to be one of those people they get used.

2012
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,280
And I feel sad that people do that.

2013
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,400
I've never done that before.

2014
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,240
Like, sure, I've donated to things before

2015
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,080
and it's been bullshit,

2016
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,640
but like that's just the risk you take.

2017
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,080
Like if I had the choice,

2018
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,200
if there's a cause that I believe in,

2019
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,480
and I would rather like give the couple bucks

2020
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,240
and like find out I got fucked,

2021
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,600
then not do it and feel shitty about it forever.

2022
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:20,120
Look, I would never say that everybody who's in need

2023
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,400
is a bad person or won't use it responsibly.

2024
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,200
But like, I get approached by homeless people a lot

2025
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,240
in Cincinnati.

2026
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,480
There's a lot of them asking for money.

2027
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,720
And this is a real, I was hyperbolic before.

2028
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,600
I was exaggerating, but this is a real point.

2029
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,320
I never give any of the money specifically

2030
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:41,320
because I really just have no idea who this person is

2031
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:45,120
or like, if my giving the money will actually help,

2032
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:49,480
will like, I'm actually facilitating a bad lifestyle

2033
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,480
if I continue to do this.

2034
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,320
Yeah, but it's true.

2035
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,160
I don't know if it's actually going to help them.

2036
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,000
But I think what Jesse's talking about,

2037
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,760
if he's seeing these GoFundMe's on Facebook,

2038
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,480
I'm assuming there's like some,

2039
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,600
like you know them or you know the people who know them.

2040
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,320
I get it, like I've been approached by bums

2041
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,920
and there are like grifters and people who are dishonest.

2042
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:06,760
You know, it happened to me

2043
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,960
when I was with you guys in Boston,

2044
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,960
that lady, I gave her $10 and she's like,

2045
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,840
give me more, so I had to give her $20

2046
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,680
and she was still like, well,

2047
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,800
can you give me a little bit more

2048
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:15,880
because I do have like five kids.

2049
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,120
I'm like, lady, enough, get away from me.

2050
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,200
You've made me mad now and now I regret helping you.

2051
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,880
And like, when you get sort of like grifted like that,

2052
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,720
it does like make you not want to help anyone else.

2053
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,840
It's like, people who are shitty

2054
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,320
and like take advantage of your kindness,

2055
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,040
they're just sucking the kindness out of the world

2056
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,000
because they're preventing you

2057
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
from wanting to help anybody else.

2058
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,440
But with the GoFundMe thing,

2059
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,360
the examples I gave were real examples.

2060
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,800
It's like, there was a guy who was burned

2061
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,640
and a guy who needed a wheel.

2062
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,880
And these are like, these are friends

2063
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,720
that I know on Facebook.

2064
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,160
So I know they're not scamming me or grifting me.

2065
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,720
I know they're real people.

2066
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:51,680
Okay, that is different.

2067
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,480
I don't understand your argument, Ben,

2068
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,280
about if you can't help them all, then why help one?

2069
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,120
Because you're helping one person.

2070
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,960
What is not self-evident about that?

2071
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,880
I think the idea is that it's not a double standard

2072
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:03,720
or anything.

2073
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,840
This person that you're helping

2074
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,760
does not deserve help anymore

2075
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:07,960
than hundreds or thousands

2076
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,800
or millions of other people.

2077
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,040
Right, but you're in contact with them.

2078
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,600
You know, I think the idea is that if everybody...

2079
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,440
So what?

2080
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,280
That's an accident.

2081
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,120
That's an accident of fate.

2082
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,160
And you don't owe them anything.

2083
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,440
Well, no, you don't owe them anything.

2084
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,280
This is about owing.

2085
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,240
This is about you wanting to help someone.

2086
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,080
Right.

2087
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,840
Why would you want to help someone?

2088
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,680
End of sentence.

2089
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,160
Even if it's a stranger,

2090
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,920
if it's a stranger who is like tangentially related

2091
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,420
to a friend of yours,

2092
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,960
I know that that's making my friend feel better

2093
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,120
or more, you know,

2094
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,760
so that's one less degree of separation where I can go.

2095
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,760
If it's, listen, okay, okay.

2096
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,420
If it's someone you know,

2097
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:43,120
if it's someone who is like in your life somehow,

2098
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,520
who is in your sphere,

2099
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,720
that makes sense.

2100
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,400
If I was rich, right,

2101
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,640
if I had more money than I knew what to do with,

2102
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,160
which is not even that much,

2103
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,120
maybe if I had twice as much as I do now,

2104
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,680
I would have more than I knew what to do with,

2105
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,040
then maybe, right?

2106
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,720
If I had disposable income

2107
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,960
that would not go to any other thing.

2108
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,800
But I don't.

2109
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,520
I mean, I'm a big believer that money does not actually,

2110
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,240
like people who win the lottery,

2111
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,080
how it's so common for them to lose it really quickly

2112
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,160
because they haven't built up the, you know,

2113
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,000
much management.

2114
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,760
I catch myself saying stuff like that.

2115
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,760
It's funny how we're bringing up the idea of like,

2116
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,320
being against charity when like the vast majority of us,

2117
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:27,440
like a good portion of our income is basically charity.

2118
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,880
It's not charity.

2119
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,720
It is not charity.

2120
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,240
I'm disgusted that you would say that.

2121
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,480
Yeah, I mean, I pretty strongly disagree with that one.

2122
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,560
I was gonna say that, but.

2123
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,760
That's totally not true.

2124
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,600
That's totally not true.

2125
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,440
That's totally not true.

2126
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,280
A lot of it.

2127
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,120
No, no, no, no, no.

2128
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,880
Tom, Tom, Tom, I was sort of thinking that,

2129
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:45,720
but at the same time,

2130
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:49,520
we are providing something in return in a sense.

2131
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,400
We are producing content.

2132
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,040
You're producing something, but it's free.

2133
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,280
Like nobody has to pay for it.

2134
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,280
They pay because they want to.

2135
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,160
Tom, it's a different goddamn payment model

2136
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,000
than traditional exchange.

2137
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,560
That doesn't make it charity.

2138
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,800
It's just that it's divided amongst.

2139
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,560
It's a not a direct exchange for goods and services.

2140
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,920
It's like, I like what you're doing.

2141
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,240
Therefore, charity should be a dirty word.

2142
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,080
Okay, look, look.

2143
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:16,080
If I give a homeless lady $5 and then she sucks my dick,

2144
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,160
it's no longer charity.

2145
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:19,960
It's a transaction.

2146
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,440
I mean, that's true.

2147
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:25,680
Or it's I'm being raped and mugged, in which cases.

2148
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,840
But that's not what we're doing.

2149
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,680
It's like we're going around

2150
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,960
and sucking everyone's dick for free.

2151
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:29,800
And if they like it,

2152
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,360
they'll give us a dollar every now and then.

2153
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,360
We're going up to people's cars

2154
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,200
and watching their windows without asking them.

2155
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,920
And then maybe they'll give us a dollar afterwards.

2156
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:38,760
Not exactly the same thing.

2157
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:39,960
That model is a little closer.

2158
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,280
But it is closer.

2159
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,800
Well, honestly, that's such a dumb point.

2160
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,680
I feel silly even arguing this.

2161
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,560
Okay, can we at least agree

2162
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,240
that like our income is based

2163
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,560
on the goodwill of people, basically?

2164
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,400
It is.

2165
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,240
That's my point.

2166
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:56,160
It's based on goodwill.

2167
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,720
And so it's charity.

2168
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,880
I mean, I think most of you are probably in the same position.

2169
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,160
As someone who does don't, I mean, not a lot,

2170
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,680
but I do donate to a few Patreons.

2171
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,040
And I do not feel like I am giving charity.

2172
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:13,040
I feel like I am exchanging currency for a service.

2173
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,520
I mean, but you're not.

2174
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,360
That's my whole point.

2175
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:17,360
As someone who gives Patreons to you,

2176
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,720
I don't feel that way.

2177
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:21,440
You don't feel like what, Munchie?

2178
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,440
I don't feel like I'm getting like a service.

2179
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,320
Like I'm getting your service in between.

2180
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,720
I'm giving it to you because I just like your stuff.

2181
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:28,560
Right, that's my point.

2182
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,840
I don't know if I'm supporting it really in a way.

2183
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,680
You, okay.

2184
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:32,520
Hang on, hang on.

2185
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,040
I feel like I'm supporting the people that do the things.

2186
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,520
Right, but that's not the same

2187
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,960
as buying something from them.

2188
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:40,800
Well, that's my point.

2189
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,440
I am sure there are people who consider their donations

2190
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,120
on Patreon or whatever, like effectively charity.

2191
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,200
I'm sure there's some people like that.

2192
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,920
But that doesn't mean that like some people,

2193
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,520
you must admit at the very least,

2194
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,240
some people must have the mindset that,

2195
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,360
oh, I want to fund this person's work.

2196
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,800
Therefore, I will contribute to doing that

2197
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,640
by giving them money.

2198
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:03,960
And to me, that seems like that's the main reason to do it.

2199
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,040
I agree that that's the main reason,

2200
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:09,640
but my point is that that logic is based on goodwill.

2201
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:13,640
It's not based on, because people who give to the PCP,

2202
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,160
other than people who do bonus episodes,

2203
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,000
but like in general on Patreon.

2204
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,560
Which is the vast majority, by the way.

2205
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,680
Sure, but people in general on Patreon,

2206
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,000
like your personal Patreon,

2207
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,480
I don't know what your rewards are or anything,

2208
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:27,240
but like they watch your videos, which are for free.

2209
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,760
They do not have to pay for them.

2210
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,480
And if they like you as a person

2211
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,120
or they like the content you make,

2212
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,880
they decide to give you money as a gesture of goodwill.

2213
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,280
They do not have to, because if nobody paid you,

2214
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,440
like the videos would still be there to watch,

2215
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,400
and assumedly you'd still be making more

2216
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,760
if you made half the amount of money you have

2217
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,520
because you're trying to build that career.

2218
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,440
So the videos themselves have no financial like worth,

2219
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,240
because they're not, the market value for them right now

2220
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,080
is free.

2221
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,520
That's why I think we hit an impasse,

2222
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,040
because I do not agree with that.

2223
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,520
Why? Who paid for your videos?

2224
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,440
Literally nobody.

2225
01:33:58,440 --> 01:33:59,280
The patrons.

2226
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,120
The patrons paid for them.

2227
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,080
No, they didn't.

2228
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:01,920
No, they didn't.

2229
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,160
Look, my situation is a little bit different

2230
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,000
because I-

2231
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,560
Look, forget me, because I'm a little different

2232
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,120
because I actually have a full-time job.

2233
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:12,760
Let's take somebody like just for example, Digi.

2234
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:15,760
Digi's lifestyle, his ability to make videos, et cetera,

2235
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,560
is literally paid for by his patrons,

2236
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,960
because that's how he lives and makes his money.

2237
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,600
Like yes, he makes YouTube money as well,

2238
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,040
but it is 100%, the vast majority of his income

2239
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,280
is from his patrons.

2240
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,160
So you can't just say that there's no relationship,

2241
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,320
like that clearly-

2242
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:34,560
No, Digi's lifestyle is funded

2243
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,200
by the goodwill of his patrons,

2244
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,000
but his videos on the market are worth $0

2245
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,400
because they are not for sale.

2246
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,440
We might get cut up in semantics here a little bit,

2247
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,840
because I think we generally would agree on this stuff,

2248
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,200
but I think there's a slight difference

2249
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,040
in the terminology that we use.

2250
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,800
All I'm saying is that Patreon is goodwill,

2251
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,760
not a market transaction.

2252
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,800
See, I agree that it is goodwill,

2253
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,640
which is why I have never given money

2254
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,960
to anyone on Patreon ever,

2255
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,040
because I don't think that way.

2256
01:34:59,040 --> 01:34:59,880
And it's true,

2257
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:03,440
because I have a distinct lack of goodwill in my heart.

2258
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,000
So that's true, that's true.

2259
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,480
I just think that it is certainly a factor,

2260
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,480
and maybe you would argue

2261
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,760
that it's less of a factor than I would,

2262
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:15,480
but it is a factor that people feel

2263
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,840
they are getting something.

2264
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:18,160
And I mean, I hear this from my patrons,

2265
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,360
but again, okay, let's consider that anecdotal, so whatever.

2266
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,480
I would argue that I think a large percentage of people

2267
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,480
are saying that they're getting something for it,

2268
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,800
even if it's just the satisfaction,

2269
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,200
which yes, is goodwill-centric,

2270
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,360
but it is supporting an artist

2271
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,720
so they can keep doing what they want.

2272
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,960
It's supporting an artist.

2273
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,240
You're supporting the creator.

2274
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,000
You're not buying their products.

2275
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,600
The products are free for the most part.

2276
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,600
I think that is, yeah, I'm sure.

2277
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,560
And that's the only tiny distinction I was trying to make.

2278
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:45,400
I don't know.

2279
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:46,240
I feel like they're-

2280
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,480
And that is similar to charity

2281
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,960
in the fact that you're just giving people stuff.

2282
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:53,480
My patrons are purchasing the pieces of my soul

2283
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,520
that I continually chip off of myself for their benefit

2284
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,960
and the constant sacrifice and toil and blood, sweat,

2285
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:02,760
pain, tears, and tragedy that I go through

2286
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,760
to make these things.

2287
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,200
That's what I'm selling.

2288
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,040
I don't know.

2289
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:06,880
In Jesse's case,

2290
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,440
because a lot of Jesse's stuff is just for patrons,

2291
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,760
so that is definitely-

2292
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:11,600
That is true.

2293
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,080
I release a lot of stuff exclusive to patrons

2294
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,400
that no one else sees on patreon.com slash endless jest.

2295
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,120
It's exclusive and no one else can see it.

2296
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:23,160
You have to be a patron and it's hilarious and cool content.

2297
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:27,080
So there you go, people.

2298
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,440
So a lot of it depends on the model, right?

2299
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,280
I mean, we-

2300
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,400
I guess like charity to me implies that like

2301
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,880
the person receiving the money

2302
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,120
isn't giving anything of their own.

2303
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,280
And I think in any of our case, in anyone's case,

2304
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,600
most people who have a patron are giving something

2305
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,720
unless it's like a total scam artist or something.

2306
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

2307
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,200
Even people, like for example,

2308
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,440
like a lot of us do live streams.

2309
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,920
When you're live streaming and you get a donation,

2310
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,000
even that, I don't think it's charity

2311
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,320
because you are getting something in return.

2312
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,160
Right.

2313
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,600
I mean, even if it's something that like-

2314
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,440
Donation.

2315
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,920
That takes no talent or no work,

2316
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,000
like just a random live streamer,

2317
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,280
even if it's something that doesn't necessarily

2318
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,640
take a lot of skill or thought,

2319
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,560
it's still you're giving people your time

2320
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,200
that you could be spending with,

2321
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,440
you love ones or spending on yourself.

2322
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,600
But like, true.

2323
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,760
I think the difference is that patron and donations,

2324
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,360
you get them because the person wants to,

2325
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,360
not because they need to.

2326
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,920
Nobody has to pay money to get into your Twitch stream.

2327
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,880
No one has to pay money to watch Best Guy Ever videos.

2328
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,760
They do it because they want to do it.

2329
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,920
But if I want to go to the theater

2330
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,600
and watch a movie legally,

2331
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,000
I have to give them money first.

2332
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,680
I can't just walk into theater,

2333
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,080
watch the New Avengers movie,

2334
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,080
and be like, yeah, that was pretty cool.

2335
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,400
I'll give Marvel five bucks.

2336
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:38,760
It doesn't work like that.

2337
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:39,600
Different models.

2338
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,560
I concede that Goodwill is definitely an element here.

2339
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,240
But like just for example, on my page,

2340
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,760
I have at the very least,

2341
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,000
like my patron discord that only patrons are in.

2342
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,960
So just even adding something like that,

2343
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,440
I think does change the equation.

2344
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,280
They're getting a reward.

2345
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,760
Right, at that point,

2346
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,640
if to get into your discord is a product,

2347
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,120
your discord does have a financial,

2348
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:58,960
whatever that tier is,

2349
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,960
because you have to pay that amount of money to get in there.

2350
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,160
And it's a subscription service,

2351
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,120
because as soon as you stop paying,

2352
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,600
you're no longer in there.

2353
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:05,440
I think charity is a product.

2354
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,560
So that is cool, and I'm all for it.

2355
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,960
Everyone should be charitable.

2356
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:10,800
Yeah.

2357
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,400
Well, okay, I think we agree.

2358
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,800
I agree, patron.

2359
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,640
Definitely Goodwill is a major element,

2360
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,200
but I still think there's a large people are.

2361
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,640
I wanna go back to something that Ben said earlier about,

2362
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:26,560
like if I had all the money in the world,

2363
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,760
then of course I would give more to charity and stuff like that.

2364
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,960
Like I catch myself thinking that all the time.

2365
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:34,080
I always think like, oh man,

2366
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,280
if I ever have like a million dollars

2367
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,960
or a billion trillion dollars,

2368
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,240
I'm gonna give it to everybody.

2369
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:42,440
Everyone's gonna have fun times.

2370
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:46,480
I'm gonna make people's lives less shitty with my money.

2371
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,240
If only I had that million dollars.

2372
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,560
But then I catch myself saying that,

2373
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,440
and I think to myself, well, wait a minute,

2374
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,200
how much money is enough?

2375
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,840
Like where's the bar for when I have enough money

2376
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,720
that it's suddenly okay to be charitable?

2377
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,040
And that kind of makes me go, well, fuck that.

2378
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,400
I technically, I can be charitable now,

2379
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,600
so why the hell aren't I being charitable now?

2380
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:09,280
And that's what makes you wanna fucking do it.

2381
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:12,840
You know, there was a Sam Harris podcast about this stuff,

2382
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,580
and basically he was trying to find out like the most,

2383
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:16,780
I think I've talked about this before,

2384
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:19,700
but it was like, what can you get for your bang for the buck,

2385
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:22,420
the most good done for like the least amount of money,

2386
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,260
such that like everybody could do it?

2387
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:25,100
And it was something like-

2388
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:28,220
Is it like wells, like drinking freshwater wells in Africa?

2389
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:29,060
I mean, similar.

2390
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:32,340
It was actually insect nets for like South America

2391
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,660
to prevent like mosquito-borne disease,

2392
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:37,140
like what is it, malaria, I think.

2393
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:37,980
Malaria?

2394
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:42,880
And so like, that's something for like $30 a month

2395
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,460
that most people can afford.

2396
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,940
Like if you do that, you can really make

2397
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:48,660
a serious positive difference in the world.

2398
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:50,940
So like there are answers to these questions

2399
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:51,780
for something like that.

2400
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:54,740
Yeah, instead of giving it to,

2401
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:56,780
well, I probably shouldn't say your whole name,

2402
01:39:56,780 --> 01:40:01,340
but you want me to read some of this GoFundMe?

2403
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:02,180
Sure, yeah.

2404
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:05,700
And I will read it free of judgment.

2405
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:06,540
Okay.

2406
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:07,380
And I will just let you-

2407
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,980
The judgment already happened earlier, let's go.

2408
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:12,620
Well, I mean, I made the judgment not to donate,

2409
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:13,460
but I mean-

2410
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:14,980
I guess the thing itself could be independent.

2411
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:16,500
But as, I mean, as you've heard

2412
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,140
from the things I've said on this subject,

2413
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:20,620
like that there's not a high bar of badness

2414
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:21,780
to make me not donate.

2415
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:23,380
Yeah.

2416
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:24,620
Here we go, here we go.

2417
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:26,100
Here's the pitch.

2418
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,500
What would your parents say to you

2419
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,460
if you called them following a dangerous car accident?

2420
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,820
My mom told me she was glad I got into one.

2421
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:35,580
To me, this sort of thing is normal.

2422
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:37,660
Though I've lived with this for too long,

2423
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:40,220
Tristan and I are trying to move out of my mom's house.

2424
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:41,580
Should I not say real names?

2425
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:42,420
Does it matter?

2426
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:44,300
I guess just from here on, yeah.

2427
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,500
Okay, T and I are trying to move out of my mom's house

2428
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,820
to get an apartment with two friends of ours to start-

2429
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:50,900
Oh, this is good.

2430
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:53,660
Oh yeah, to start our YouTube channel

2431
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:55,820
and engage in our creative endeavors.

2432
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:58,060
Yeah, that takes a lot of fun to just start a YouTube channel.

2433
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:58,900
Okay, all right.

2434
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:01,020
Oh yeah, we originally scheduled to move

2435
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:02,620
in January due to saving,

2436
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:05,660
but after yesterday, we want to get out as soon as possible.

2437
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:07,740
For most three bedroom apartments, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2438
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:10,020
I want to raise money, blah, me and my friends.

2439
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:11,860
So we don't have to be around this abuse anymore.

2440
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:14,220
If we raise $2,000, we can leave immediately.

2441
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:16,660
M, our close friend, is moving in a week.

2442
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,500
Originally, he was gonna blah, blah, blah.

2443
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:19,460
The more time we wait,

2444
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:21,780
the longer I'm around my toxic mother.

2445
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:24,580
T, M, and I all want to be in a supportive environment

2446
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,940
where we all support each other all the time.

2447
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:27,100
Wait, he said T, M, and I.

2448
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:29,620
Who's the third person involved here?

2449
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:32,020
Not, no, I as in the pronoun.

2450
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:33,980
Oh, well, I thought the way you said it was-

2451
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:36,540
There's a T, there's an M, and there's her.

2452
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:40,140
Who she refers to as I, as one does.

2453
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:42,020
But who's the, wait, who's the third person there?

2454
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:42,860
Who's the M?

2455
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:44,020
There's someone called M.

2456
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:45,300
There's someone called M.

2457
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:47,700
Well, okay, are this person in some sort of

2458
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:48,860
three-way relationship?

2459
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:49,940
Is that what's being implied here?

2460
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:51,260
No, no, no, she said close friend.

2461
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:52,260
Oh, okay, okay, all right.

2462
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:53,540
So she's just like trying to do it.

2463
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:54,580
Anyway, blah, blah, blah.

2464
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:56,460
Here's the rub, here's the rub.

2465
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:57,940
Picture of her and T.

2466
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:00,940
T has a nirvana shirt and cherry red dyed hair,

2467
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:03,420
and he's making a terrible fucking

2468
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,700
Japanese V sign with his hand.

2469
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:08,580
She, this girl J, I'll call her,

2470
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:11,860
has a big ole nose ring and has like,

2471
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:14,940
you know what, God, you'd have to see,

2472
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:17,300
you would have to see this picture of her to understand.

2473
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:19,980
But we won't share it with people.

2474
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:21,780
Let me, in a minute I will post a picture,

2475
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:25,660
but she has like, she has like, you know, like long,

2476
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:27,580
it's gotta be like a silver wig,

2477
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:30,500
and she's got like, like drawn on eyelashes

2478
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,620
that like are, like go under her eye

2479
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:35,060
to make it look like a big sparkly anime eye,

2480
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:38,740
and she's got like, weird like blush face.

2481
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:40,180
She's got a nose ring and she's like,

2482
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:41,740
she's all pink and like spotty

2483
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,180
and like looks like a fucking freak,

2484
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:45,980
and like, and here's the rub, here's the rub.

2485
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,100
There was another GoFundMe.

2486
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:51,180
She's raised $439 on this campaign out of a goal of 2,000.

2487
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:52,620
It took her two days to do.

2488
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:54,300
It's not bad.

2489
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:58,220
She, a year ago, she had another GoFundMe.

2490
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,020
It was on a different account,

2491
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:01,420
but I know because the picture of her

2492
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:03,460
has her in the same kind of makeup.

2493
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:07,220
And the GoFundMe was, help me cremate my cat.

2494
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:11,820
And the goal was $200, and she raised 100 of it.

2495
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:13,140
Damn it.

2496
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:13,980
You don't like cremate half of it.

2497
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,340
We didn't quite get it.

2498
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:17,260
Had to bury Fluffy out in the backyard,

2499
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:19,460
like a common, like a common beast.

2500
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:23,900
Had to just eat her to make up that extra hundred dollars.

2501
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,220
Here's why, here's why people of the world-

2502
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:26,540
How to reinvest that cat meat

2503
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,220
back into my personal economy.

2504
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:32,100
This is why you don't want me donating these people.

2505
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:35,940
Here's why, because in order for me to donate,

2506
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:38,380
I'm gonna have to grill this person

2507
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,660
and talk to the other side of the story,

2508
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,940
AKA the mom, to find if this is really all stacking up.

2509
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:45,380
Is there some bias here?

2510
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:47,700
Like, I wanna know if this is actually

2511
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,820
an injustice being done, or if it's just some like,

2512
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,820
I mean, not to be judgy.

2513
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:54,700
Maybe she's just a little emotional kind of a person.

2514
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:56,540
Things have been taken a little bit out of control,

2515
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:57,780
and the mom's not a legal monster.

2516
01:43:57,780 --> 01:44:01,180
You can never trust anything that a young person says ever.

2517
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:04,500
Anyone under 25 is just a liar, period.

2518
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,980
The word that stands out to me

2519
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:09,260
in this description is yesterday.

2520
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:12,380
She says that this exchange,

2521
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,900
when she got into a car accident, called her mom,

2522
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:17,700
and her mom said she was glad she got into a car accident,

2523
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:18,820
happened yesterday.

2524
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:22,780
That is such an outrageous claim, I just don't believe it.

2525
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:27,180
I feel like maybe she was mad.

2526
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:30,060
You know, I can see how you would say something

2527
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:33,100
close enough to that that you could interpret.

2528
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,820
If you were angrily, maybe she was angrily she crashed the car.

2529
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:38,340
Maybe she said, well, you were being reckless or something,

2530
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:42,260
or you're irresponsible, so you deserve to get in this car accident.

2531
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:44,220
You brought this on yourself or something.

2532
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:47,460
And she structured the way she makes this claim now

2533
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:50,340
to make the worst possible interpretation possible.

2534
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:54,060
She's phrasing it as like, my mom literally wants me to die,

2535
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:56,220
which I don't believe.

2536
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,420
I mean, maybe it's true, but I just don't,

2537
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:00,020
I'm not going to take it away from you, but you know how I really...

2538
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:04,460
I would find that much more shocking than if this person is just emotional

2539
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,580
and got in a bad fight with her mom and then said,

2540
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:08,860
oh, I'm going to go on, I'm going to make a go fund me,

2541
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:12,300
and I'm going to move out with my boyfriend, T,

2542
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:15,420
and we're going to move in with Mason, and I'm going to show you,

2543
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:17,860
I'm going to show you that I can beg for money on the internet.

2544
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:21,500
What just gets me is that there's so many people in the world

2545
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:26,220
who love an excuse to like prop up people like this

2546
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:28,500
without any kind of questions asked.

2547
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,980
They see any kind of claims of victimhood,

2548
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:33,180
and they're like, I am on board.

2549
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:34,140
I'm on it. Here I go.

2550
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:37,580
Wait, someone says that someone says they're in a bad situation,

2551
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:40,980
someone says that a bad thing happened to them, I'm there.

2552
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:42,380
I'm fucking there.

2553
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:45,460
Comments, hope you guys are able...

2554
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:49,740
Kiyoko says, hope you guys are able to get to a more healing environment soon.

2555
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:52,020
Someone with a Japanese username says,

2556
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:54,700
nice to help a local need or a smaller one.

2557
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:57,660
I can relate with the one to get out of a situation like this.

2558
01:45:57,660 --> 01:46:00,540
Dawn says, no one should have to live through abuse.

2559
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:02,820
Good luck, and I hope you heal quickly.

2560
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:05,500
Harley says, I want you to feel safe and happy.

2561
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,460
When I stream, I'll draw a picture of you

2562
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:09,500
and tell my streamers to go donate to you.

2563
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,180
Man, every since fucking Kavanaugh got into the Supreme Court.

2564
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:15,100
It's been constant abuse, constant rapes of mother

2565
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:17,460
against their children verbally and otherwise.

2566
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:19,820
It's just a madhouse out here, guys.

2567
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:22,580
Michi says, I am so glad that you're alive.

2568
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:25,180
You're one of the best, sweetest people on Facebook and Deserve...

2569
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:26,740
Okay, this person probably knows her in real life.

2570
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:28,460
It sounds like it, yeah.

2571
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:30,820
You know, so anyway, it's a bunch of bullshit.

2572
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:31,860
What do you say, Jesse?

2573
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:34,060
And the more I read of it, the less...

2574
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:36,860
I went in there with an open mind and an open heart,

2575
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:38,980
and the more of it I read, the closer it got.

2576
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:40,580
So, you know, that's me.

2577
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,700
That's me in a nutshell.

2578
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,300
I think the...

2579
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:46,420
Maybe this says more about me than it does about her.

2580
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:50,860
The real way that I determine the limits of my charity

2581
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:55,940
deep in the true dark pit of my hateful, vengeful soul

2582
01:46:55,940 --> 01:47:00,460
is just like, I won't give to anyone

2583
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:03,940
whose story is less sad than my own.

2584
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:04,780
That's a good move.

2585
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:05,620
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2586
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:06,460
Absolutely.

2587
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:09,460
If it's like I was paralyzed and I can't support my family,

2588
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:11,700
well, okay, okay, I'll help this guy out,

2589
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:13,740
because that sucks a lot.

2590
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:15,700
But if it's just like someone like,

2591
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:18,100
oh, my environment sucks and I'm trying to move away,

2592
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:21,180
well, join the fucking club, you little brat, you know?

2593
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,980
I've been trying to move away from my environment

2594
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:25,860
for fucking 50 years.

2595
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:29,300
You know what's interesting?

2596
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:31,500
Not to make it overly political based on that,

2597
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,740
but I think that that exact reasoning

2598
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:35,860
is why a lot of people who are accused

2599
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:38,700
of having white privilege have little sympathy for that

2600
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:41,820
because they're like poor people and life sucks.

2601
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,300
And they're just like, well,

2602
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:46,740
while it is literally true that I have white privilege,

2603
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:49,140
frankly, like I'd like to stop being, you know,

2604
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:51,700
crushed under the boot heel of just life in general.

2605
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:54,780
So yeah, well, you know what they say,

2606
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:56,860
you can still lose on easy mode.

2607
01:47:56,860 --> 01:47:58,220
Indeed, indeed.

2608
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:01,660
Yeah, that's always been my thoughts on it

2609
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:04,340
or my feelings on it is because like,

2610
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:07,180
you hear, you've got white privilege

2611
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,220
because you're not black or you're not a woman

2612
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:10,300
or you're not a minority.

2613
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:12,180
But then when I sit down and think about it,

2614
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:16,140
I think I've never met a black woman or minority in my life

2615
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:18,780
whose life was worse than mine ever.

2616
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:20,420
Sure.

2617
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:22,020
I mean, my life has been harder

2618
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,380
than any like black persons I've ever known.

2619
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:25,740
So, fuck you.

2620
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:28,500
Maybe I'm talking out my ass here.

2621
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:31,140
What I will say about this is like, okay, like yeah,

2622
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:33,940
if white privilege is a thing, I think,

2623
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:38,220
but I would rather have, I think it seems to me

2624
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:41,700
that like rich privilege is much better than white privilege.

2625
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,900
And I would much rather, if I had to do that,

2626
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:44,860
I would much rather.

2627
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:45,700
It's a class thing.

2628
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:46,980
I would much rather be rich than,

2629
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:48,660
God damn it, let me finish my sentence.

2630
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:50,380
I would much rather be rich than white.

2631
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:52,060
I think that's a much bigger advantage.

2632
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:55,300
As Mage said, it is, people point this out a lot,

2633
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:58,500
but yeah, it's like the real division is class

2634
01:48:58,500 --> 01:48:59,340
as opposed to anything else.

2635
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:00,180
It's like, I think it's big.

2636
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:02,540
Don't you love it when you make a point so salient

2637
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:05,220
that you are interrupted by fervent approval?

2638
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:08,740
It's the time.

2639
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:09,580
Fervent what?

2640
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,420
Fervent approval.

2641
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:12,300
Like everyone is just like jumping down your throat,

2642
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,540
ah, shut up, you're absolutely right,

2643
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:14,380
and I agree with you.

2644
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:16,340
God damn, that's such a good point, yeah.

2645
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:18,700
Why does this podcast always get so political?

2646
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:21,980
Why do we always like to send into this?

2647
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:22,820
I don't know.

2648
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:23,660
Am I being political?

2649
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:24,500
I just think it's-

2650
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,620
I mean, slightly, I don't know.

2651
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:28,420
I just think being rich is the greatest privilege of all.

2652
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:30,860
I do believe white privilege is a thing.

2653
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:32,180
I just, I don't think it's-

2654
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:35,540
There's other privileges, some of which might trump it.

2655
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:36,380
Some of which might trump it.

2656
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:38,180
Except for rich and poor, like that's all it is.

2657
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,020
That's the only real divide.

2658
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:39,860
Oh shit, I said Trump.

2659
01:49:39,860 --> 01:49:40,700
I said Trump, it's political.

2660
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,580
Don't ever say Trump.

2661
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:44,460
No, I mean, it's all just a distraction

2662
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:46,940
from the real privilege, which is wealth.

2663
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:49,860
Wealth is the ultimate and only-

2664
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:51,980
I, yeah, I would say that wealth

2665
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:53,940
is probably the ultimate privilege, yeah.

2666
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:54,780
Makes sense to me.

2667
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:55,620
Wealth, it is-

2668
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:57,820
Maybe a few centuries ago, it was nobility,

2669
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:58,660
but we don't have that anymore.

2670
01:49:58,660 --> 01:49:59,500
The real privileges-

2671
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,340
Nobody cares about that anymore.

2672
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:03,660
That people take for granted are not like racial

2673
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:06,340
or gender privileges or sex privileges.

2674
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:09,700
The real privileges are like being born wealthy,

2675
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:13,260
being beautiful, not having like abusive parents

2676
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:15,120
or like having good parents is a privilege

2677
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,540
that people take for granted.

2678
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:18,020
Like those are the real privileges

2679
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:19,100
that like people don't think of,

2680
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:20,180
cause all they could think of,

2681
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:22,860
everyone spends sort of like brainwashed into this,

2682
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:24,980
oh, it's race and gender.

2683
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:27,260
Everything is race and gender and sexuality.

2684
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:29,780
Like no, it's there's other social factors

2685
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:31,300
that determine privilege.

2686
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:33,820
Yeah, I mean, race is a factor.

2687
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:35,460
Like that does affect things.

2688
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:38,340
Like you can't, you can be, you know,

2689
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:41,780
excluded or marginalized on that basis.

2690
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:43,220
It's just when you ignore everything else

2691
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,980
just for something like that.

2692
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:45,820
But it's, yeah.

2693
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:47,460
It's like everybody's got blinders on

2694
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,100
for race and gender and shit.

2695
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,820
And they're ignoring that, you know,

2696
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:54,380
if I can, you can have all the so-called

2697
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:56,480
white straight male privilege in the world,

2698
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,300
but if you grow up and your fucking,

2699
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:59,700
your dad is an alcoholic

2700
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,180
and he like throws you in the tool shed

2701
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:03,700
and like whips you with a telephone cord,

2702
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:05,380
then you're probably gonna grow up

2703
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:06,460
with some disadvantages.

2704
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,740
You're gonna be messed up in the head a little bit.

2705
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:10,580
Yeah, yeah.

2706
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:11,980
It's just cause those external things

2707
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:14,700
are so easy to recognize and easy to group up in.

2708
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:15,540
That's true.

2709
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,380
They are, yeah, yeah.

2710
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:18,060
They're very, they're very apparent.

2711
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:18,900
You can't just make it sound right and be like,

2712
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,300
you're clearly have like shitty parents.

2713
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:23,660
You came from an abusive household, you.

2714
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:25,860
But you can definitely say that there are

2715
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:29,620
more abusive households for lower income people.

2716
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:31,140
And you can also definitely say

2717
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:35,700
that there are more minorities in lower income households.

2718
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:37,820
Like you can say that it's all,

2719
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:40,140
as long as you have self-awareness about what you're saying

2720
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:41,380
and you're not just going around going,

2721
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:44,940
ah, white people and fucking straight, you know.

2722
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:45,860
I don't know.

2723
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:46,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2724
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,580
I feel like I'm saying the correct thing.

2725
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:53,060
I know that I would never say something that wasn't smart.

2726
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,740
I know that, so.

2727
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:55,700
Yeah, yeah.

2728
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:56,540
Same, same.

2729
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:59,060
I'm gonna jump on that bandwagon real quick.

2730
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:00,100
I wanna say it quickly.

2731
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:03,940
I think it's also important to have like a stable family home.

2732
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:04,940
Like.

2733
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:07,660
Yeah, that's what we're saying.

2734
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:10,540
Yeah, yeah, it's a very important factor.

2735
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:13,300
People very easily overlook, I think.

2736
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,900
Yeah, I've said this a lot about,

2737
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:18,820
or I've thought this a lot in my private dark moments

2738
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:20,860
of bitter rage and resentment.

2739
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:23,740
When I think about my good friend Digi, bro.

2740
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:29,380
I just thought like Digi talks a lot about being privileged

2741
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:33,300
and like the ultimate privilege that Digi has in his life

2742
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,780
is having the family that he does,

2743
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:38,420
the supportive mother and father

2744
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:40,260
and the talented siblings.

2745
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:41,740
Like I look at- For sure.

2746
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:42,740
Say it with me and Ben, I think.

2747
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:45,060
Yeah, like I look at the way like a person,

2748
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:48,260
like Digi grew up, just having that family unit

2749
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:50,620
that I never really had and I'm just like,

2750
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:52,300
that's the ultimate privilege in life.

2751
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:54,340
Like if I had had that,

2752
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:58,220
I would be like a way contented person, probably.

2753
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:00,700
Makes sense. I don't know.

2754
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:04,220
It's just everyone thinks that the thing they didn't have

2755
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,460
is the ultimate privilege.

2756
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:06,740
Like no matter what you have.

2757
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:07,980
You know, everyone kind of wants to-

2758
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:09,860
It's always gonna be the crassest greener

2759
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:11,660
on the other side of the fucking-

2760
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:14,500
And everybody wants to be like, I did it myself.

2761
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:18,500
They don't want, like there's an incentive to downplay

2762
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,820
your own privileges, whatever they might be and so on.

2763
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:23,740
But nobody does it all by themselves.

2764
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:24,580
Absolutely.

2765
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:27,420
You know, as the other village people said.

2766
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:28,420
You know what is-

2767
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:29,740
You know what is the-

2768
01:53:29,740 --> 01:53:31,220
He does it all by himself.

2769
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:34,580
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf.

2770
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:38,260
You got privilege because you were born white

2771
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:40,980
and some would make you rhyme.

2772
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:42,620
And that is not all right.

2773
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:46,820
We did it, Reddit.

2774
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:48,980
Hang on, Munchy was jumping in.

2775
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:50,780
I wanted to hear his perspective, I mean,

2776
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,620
if you wanted to share.

2777
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:55,260
All I was gonna say is that I don't disagree

2778
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,500
with any I owe to what's happened here,

2779
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:01,820
but as an SJW myself, I feel like everyone knows this

2780
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:05,020
and everyone also does still talk about wealth.

2781
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:07,660
In fact, I would say that I probably hear that more

2782
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:11,740
as a thing than the caricature of everyone's

2783
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:14,860
just fucking crazy about jumping on white people

2784
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:15,700
for white privilege.

2785
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:18,780
I almost exclusively hear social political class thing.

2786
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:20,420
I might just be the bubble that I'm in,

2787
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:23,860
but I feel like we might not be giving people enough credit.

2788
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:27,460
I hear a lot, I hear Reyes talked about it a lot more.

2789
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:30,100
I hear race and gender talked about a lot more than class,

2790
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:32,700
but maybe I'm just not watching the right YouTube videos.

2791
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:34,340
Yeah, that is true, Nate.

2792
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:36,740
I think the people who are talking about race and stuff

2793
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:38,500
are just more vocal, but there is definitely,

2794
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:41,220
I mean, you look at like a lot of like.

2795
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:43,180
Look at Tom's like Communist Tumblr,

2796
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:44,180
and then you'll see.

2797
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:45,940
Exactly, my lord and savior.

2798
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:49,340
None of this is to say, none of this is to say that like,

2799
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:50,380
I don't want this to be interpreted as like,

2800
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:52,140
I think the world's going crazy

2801
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:55,460
and everyone's a crazy SJW who's obsessed with race.

2802
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:57,980
I think by and large, most people are sane

2803
01:54:57,980 --> 01:55:01,700
and have the ability to make logical distinctions

2804
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:02,540
in their minds.

2805
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:03,420
I mean, we're definitely not the only ones

2806
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:05,260
that have these ideas.

2807
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:06,820
I think we're the only ones thinking

2808
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:09,060
about this galaxy brain level stuff here.

2809
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:10,620
I think everyone knows we're just fucking

2810
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:12,460
stuck in the fucking dirt.

2811
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:14,980
That is the one good thing about living in a world

2812
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:16,900
where everyone has gone fucking crazy

2813
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:20,580
and is mentally retarded is that I can say

2814
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:22,500
just the most basic obvious shit

2815
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:24,300
and people will think it's smart

2816
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:25,980
when really it's just in the whole world.

2817
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:28,260
It's really easy to look intellectual online

2818
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:30,100
when you do that shit.

2819
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:32,020
Yeah, like all you have to say is that like,

2820
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:35,100
oh, you know, it's probably bad to hate

2821
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:38,140
other human beings for no fucking reason at all.

2822
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:40,380
And people go, oh my God, that's like the most,

2823
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:43,300
that's the most salient fucking thing I've heard all week.

2824
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:46,220
I, that's, I feel that way too,

2825
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:48,740
but I never knew how to put it into words before.

2826
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:54,580
The bar is set so low now for being smart.

2827
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:56,420
That's true.

2828
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:57,420
That's true.

2829
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:59,340
You know, that's an interesting effect.

2830
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:01,220
You know, does anyone else notice this

2831
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:04,060
and just think about like their own videos

2832
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:05,420
or the videos that are popular

2833
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:06,980
and just think like, Jesus Christ,

2834
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:09,100
this is such a basic fucking point.

2835
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:09,940
Oh yeah.

2836
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:12,420
The point of me making this or watching this.

2837
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,660
Sometimes I feel like maybe I'm just an asshole

2838
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:17,260
in my own head, right?

2839
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:21,660
Because I feel and almost,

2840
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:26,460
I feel almost always, like almost anything that I see,

2841
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:29,180
I feel like is at least on some level,

2842
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:31,500
some basic shit that I could have said

2843
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,420
and I could have done and I'm not impressed by that.

2844
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:34,980
Oh my God, you know what this reminds me of?

2845
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:36,780
This extends to almost everything

2846
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:38,660
that I see and experience in life.

2847
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:41,300
Very much, especially on the YouTube landscape.

2848
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:45,980
But I watched a movie yesterday, The Big Short,

2849
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:46,860
which is this movie.

2850
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:47,700
Oh, I love that movie.

2851
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:49,020
I love that movie so much.

2852
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:49,860
I like that movie.

2853
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:52,180
It basically, it's explaining.

2854
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:53,020
Is it about my day?

2855
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:54,340
It's a dramatic reenactment

2856
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:56,620
of like the housing crisis bubble collapse

2857
01:56:56,620 --> 01:56:58,900
in 2007 or whatever.

2858
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:00,940
And okay, what was interesting about it,

2859
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:03,140
this was honestly kind of insulting,

2860
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:04,820
but I get why they did it.

2861
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:06,620
They talk about how like, blah, blah, blah,

2862
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:08,060
like it's a movie about banking, right?

2863
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:11,460
So they're like, oh, CDOs, IRAs, blah, blah, blah.

2864
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:13,060
You obviously don't know what that is,

2865
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:14,660
which is true, no one does.

2866
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,820
And that's kind of the point of the movie

2867
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:16,980
that no one gets it.

2868
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:19,940
So to explain these technical things

2869
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:22,780
and use these like silly metaphors to get it across,

2870
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:25,180
they'll be like, we're now cutting to,

2871
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:26,660
what's Margot Robbie?

2872
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:31,540
So it's Selena Gomez to explain to us at a poker table,

2873
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:35,020
so that your fucking retarded ape-ass brain

2874
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:36,500
will understand what's going on.

2875
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:38,300
And yes, like it's true.

2876
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:40,220
I needed a baby metaphor example

2877
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,660
so that I could get it, all right?

2878
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:43,500
But I didn't need you to pretend

2879
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:46,100
that I'm only gonna listen to Margot fucking Robbie

2880
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:47,460
sitting in a bathtub.

2881
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,340
Like, frankly, that's more of a distraction

2882
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:51,340
because I just wanna have sex with this creature.

2883
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:53,860
I'm not interested in listening to her talk about this shit.

2884
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:55,740
So I wish it was like a fucking,

2885
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:57,860
I don't know, fun teacher or something.

2886
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:58,700
It was annoying.

2887
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:00,500
I thought it was, I don't know,

2888
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,580
kind of funny in a way, the way they did that movie.

2889
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:04,500
They were definitely trying to be glib with it.

2890
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:07,100
I felt, I don't know, I felt a little pander too,

2891
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:10,420
unintended, like more than they thought they were doing.

2892
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:11,660
But it was a good movie.

2893
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:13,140
But like the point is, it's just like,

2894
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,860
I feel like that's kind of like what YouTube videos do.

2895
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:18,140
And like, I made my video about Huey's Law or whatever.

2896
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:20,900
It's just about taking whatever fucking idea you have.

2897
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:23,860
How about something like, I don't know, it's okay to be gay.

2898
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:26,340
And you put in like a big, elaborate music video

2899
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:28,420
where like, oh my God, can you believe it's like

2900
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:30,380
actually not a problem to be gay?

2901
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:32,700
You make a big production.

2902
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:35,460
You add like some sad music things

2903
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:37,740
as you talk into a camera about.

2904
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:41,660
You talk about, you're making a video

2905
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:44,260
talking about how like the new Ghostbusters

2906
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:46,140
isn't as bad as everyone says it is.

2907
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:48,100
And then at the end, and then you suddenly,

2908
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:51,020
and then you suddenly cut away to like a new angle

2909
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:53,900
and you bring in some sad music and you go on a tangent

2910
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:55,980
about how you understand depression

2911
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:59,220
because last year you too attempted suicide

2912
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:01,020
and it was a really rough time in your life

2913
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:02,900
and you were in a bad place, but you're better now.

2914
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:04,340
And thank you to all my viewers.

2915
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:05,620
And thank you to all my viewers

2916
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:07,620
for watching my content and supporting me.

2917
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:10,140
And then your Patreon quadruples overnight.

2918
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:14,180
Yes, I don't even disagree that these points are valuable

2919
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:16,140
and can be said and it makes all the,

2920
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:18,900
there's probably lots of people who still need to hear it.

2921
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:20,500
I just hate it.

2922
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:23,740
I just hate it when I feel talked down to

2923
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:26,940
and it's like it's so little substance at the end of the day.

2924
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:28,980
You take a thought or a feeling that you have

2925
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:32,980
and you just dumb it down and chip all the nuance off of it

2926
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:35,260
and then you wrap it up in pandering

2927
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:37,660
and you fucking, you throw it out there

2928
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:41,340
and the dumber it is, the more simplistic and moronic it is,

2929
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:43,420
the more people will fucking flock to it

2930
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:44,900
and hail you as the same.

2931
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:48,260
The more basic it is, the more relatable and comprehensible,

2932
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:50,500
the more people will latch on to what you're saying.

2933
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,180
Yeah, and if you-

2934
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:54,340
It's literally lowest common denominator.

2935
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:57,980
And if you use the word mental health at any point,

2936
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:00,020
then you automatically, a million views

2937
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:02,380
and everyone thinks you're the best person who ever lived

2938
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:05,220
because- Yeah, yeah, yeah, everyone's like, I too,

2939
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:06,660
feel bad sometimes. I too feel bad sometimes.

2940
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:08,860
I understand mental health issues.

2941
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:12,620
I too have social anxiety and depression.

2942
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:16,420
Like, who doesn't have social anxiety and depression?

2943
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:17,780
Am I right gamers?

2944
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:21,420
I just like, I hear the words mental health anymore

2945
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:24,940
and just like, my eyes just instinctively roll

2946
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:27,060
so fucking far into the back of my head.

2947
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:28,540
I'm so sick of it.

2948
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:29,980
You know what it is?

2949
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:32,380
It's not like mental health isn't a real thing.

2950
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:33,620
No, I could agree with all of it,

2951
02:00:33,620 --> 02:00:35,660
but I would still be so fucking sick of it.

2952
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:36,500
You know what was interesting?

2953
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:37,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2954
02:00:37,340 --> 02:00:38,180
There was something interesting-

2955
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:39,700
Wait, wait, wait, let me say what I'm saying.

2956
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:42,220
Like, what it is, is it's the same thing as charity.

2957
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:45,340
It's the bad eggs that are asking for charity

2958
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:46,180
that don't really need it.

2959
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:47,740
They're abusing people's goodwill.

2960
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:51,300
It's lay people fucking armchair diagnosing

2961
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:53,340
and self-diagnosing a bunch of bullshit

2962
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:56,540
has just made discussion about mental health issues.

2963
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:59,140
It has poisoned the well and turned it into a thing

2964
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:01,540
that I don't feel that I should take seriously,

2965
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:03,340
don't want to listen to on the internet.

2966
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:06,540
All of the scummiest, most like narcissistic,

2967
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:09,340
terrible people that I've ever met in my life

2968
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:11,140
have also just so happened to be

2969
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:13,340
those mental health fucking people

2970
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:16,300
who are always constantly talking about their depression

2971
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:18,660
and their bipolar and their manic fucking what's it.

2972
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:22,980
And it's like, the more people talk about mental health issues,

2973
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,820
the more they think they can get away

2974
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:27,860
with being a slimy fucking piece of shit.

2975
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:30,660
Yeah, it's like drama, you know,

2976
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,940
the people that say that they don't want drama,

2977
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:35,900
the people that say that the most are the most drama-prone.

2978
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:36,740
Listen to this.

2979
02:01:36,740 --> 02:01:39,140
Because they're thinking about drama the most.

2980
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:40,340
I suppose that's true.

2981
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:42,740
So the other day, I was watching a PewDiePie video

2982
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:44,060
and it was like his news show or whatever

2983
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:47,180
and he just brings up that it was in the news

2984
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:49,380
that, you know, Superwoman on YouTube,

2985
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:50,740
she's like one of the biggest people,

2986
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:54,380
okay, Lindsey Singer, whatever her name is, Superwoman.

2987
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:56,380
She made a video and I brought it up here.

2988
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:59,900
Look at this video, it's called I'll See You Soon.

2989
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:02,940
Okay, it's an announcement that she's like leaving,

2990
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:03,780
that she's gonna-

2991
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:04,900
Is she taking a mental health break?

2992
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:07,140
That's effectively what it boils down to, yes.

2993
02:02:07,140 --> 02:02:10,540
And like, okay, that's fine, that makes sense.

2994
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:12,660
Let me, can I make a prediction?

2995
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:14,060
PewDiePie's point on this was like,

2996
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:17,100
he was basically like, why was this necessary?

2997
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:19,820
Why do you need to like make a big production,

2998
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:21,100
just leave?

2999
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:22,700
And I mean, this is coming from a guy

3000
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:24,620
who's been through the fucking ringer

3001
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:26,900
and has been squeezed and, you know,

3002
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:29,500
manhandled by the fucking legacy media,

3003
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:31,740
trying to fuck him up and call him, you know,

3004
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:33,900
an all right Nazi and all this shit.

3005
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:35,980
And so he's been through the scandals

3006
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:38,260
and he is fine, whatever.

3007
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:40,500
And he's just like, what's the big, why are you doing this?

3008
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:43,660
Like just leave, make a humble announcement

3009
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:44,700
and then come back.

3010
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,860
Why you got a virtue signal about all this meant?

3011
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:47,700
You know why?

3012
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:48,540
You know why?

3013
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:49,380
The answer's obvious.

3014
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:50,220
So that your Patreon will quadruple overnight.

3015
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:52,820
That's it, it's easy.

3016
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:55,660
It's so easy to just throw out some words like this

3017
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:57,780
and get, you know, even if you don't have a Patreon,

3018
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:01,300
love, support, attention, any of that shit.

3019
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:02,780
I don't look, look, okay, okay.

3020
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:05,060
I don't want to vilify this person because-

3021
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:06,500
I have to watch the video, so I have no idea what she says.

3022
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:09,220
I was being, I was being salty one time

3023
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:11,860
about this kind of thing that I'm being salty about right now.

3024
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:14,460
People like, I mean, it wasn't about mental health

3025
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:16,620
specifically, but it was about people using buzzwords

3026
02:03:16,620 --> 02:03:19,060
and saying the right thing to get sympathy,

3027
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:22,580
to get, you know, to get, you know, goodwill to,

3028
02:03:22,580 --> 02:03:24,780
and you say the right thing and your Patreon

3029
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:27,900
can quadruple overnight because what, for various reasons.

3030
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:32,900
I was being salty about this and a guy on my discord,

3031
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:35,580
AJ Shoup, AJ Shoups, who I think you know,

3032
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:38,940
he's an RFCK guy, he said, and this stuck with me,

3033
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:41,660
he said that, well, you know, like success is,

3034
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:42,980
what is it, like opportunity?

3035
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:45,260
It's opportunity plus action.

3036
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:48,900
And so like, the way you succeed is when an opportunity

3037
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:50,900
comes up, you take it, and if you don't,

3038
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,820
you're just like denying yourself success.

3039
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:56,580
And so for the, to not, to not do, like if a time,

3040
02:03:56,580 --> 02:03:59,340
if the time becomes ripe that you have the opportunity

3041
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:01,420
to say something that will quadruple your Patreon,

3042
02:04:01,420 --> 02:04:02,420
why wouldn't you say it?

3043
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:03,260
Exactly.

3044
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:06,460
So like, I can't even be mad or vilify these people

3045
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:08,100
and I don't think that they're bad for doing this.

3046
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:08,980
Look, just look at this real quick.

3047
02:04:08,980 --> 02:04:10,100
I put just posted another image,

3048
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:12,260
this YouTube spill channel, whatever,

3049
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:15,900
literally makes a video called Superwoman Leaves YouTube

3050
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:17,820
teaches everyone a lesson.

3051
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:20,420
And you can see a snippet from her description of the video

3052
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:23,260
that says, mental health is important, y'all.

3053
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:25,020
And I'm just,

3054
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:26,540
And just the fact that it's become,

3055
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:27,380
And I'm just,

3056
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:30,620
The fact that like sincerity and like,

3057
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:33,180
like exposing like your real feelings and sadness

3058
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:36,540
has become like a formula for money and success

3059
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:39,940
is like so scary and converted.

3060
02:04:39,940 --> 02:04:40,780
Cause like,

3061
02:04:40,780 --> 02:04:41,620
Yeah.

3062
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:44,020
I think about doing, like you see these videos

3063
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:45,500
of YouTubers where they come out and say,

3064
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:46,900
this is what I've been dealing with.

3065
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:49,340
And this is, you know, how much my life sucks.

3066
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:51,100
And this is what I've been thinking.

3067
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:55,500
And like I sit around and I think about making videos

3068
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:56,500
like that all the time.

3069
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:59,180
Like I think about, you know,

3070
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:03,140
I wish I had the courage to be a little more open and honest

3071
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:05,060
and say, so this is what's going on with me.

3072
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:06,700
And this is what I'm dealing with.

3073
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:09,660
And, and just, you know, but like,

3074
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:12,340
it's scary for me.

3075
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:14,860
And I feel like it's supposed to be scary.

3076
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:16,660
And if it's not scary for you,

3077
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:18,540
if you do it so much that you,

3078
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:20,860
that it's like normal and it's what you do for money,

3079
02:05:20,860 --> 02:05:24,140
then you've perverted it and made it that much harder

3080
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:27,420
for other people who might actually, I don't know.

3081
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:29,620
It's just shitty people cheap and everything good.

3082
02:05:29,620 --> 02:05:31,540
It's what it comes down to, like we were saying.

3083
02:05:31,540 --> 02:05:35,460
Like stoicism, stoicism itself is not rewarded

3084
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:37,180
in today's like culture.

3085
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:40,380
It like advertising one's, one's, you know,

3086
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:41,220
victory status.

3087
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,060
That's what's rewarding.

3088
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:42,900
Yeah.

3089
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:45,580
And I feel, I think I'm a kind of stoic guy

3090
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:47,340
who like hides his pain.

3091
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:48,180
Yeah.

3092
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:49,260
And I feel like I have,

3093
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:51,100
and I feel like I'm punished for that.

3094
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:53,180
I feel like I have failed to capitalize on.

3095
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:56,100
I mean, it's not capitalizing on the market opportunity

3096
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:59,020
that the millennial culture has presented to us, I guess.

3097
02:05:59,020 --> 02:05:59,860
I think.

3098
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:00,700
I can feel that, yeah.

3099
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:04,420
You guys are giving too much credit

3100
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:08,980
to practicing bad, literally bad mental health practices.

3101
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:12,740
It's not cool to never speak to your friends

3102
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:14,420
about your problems or to pretend

3103
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:15,860
that you don't have any.

3104
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:19,180
Talking to your friends is different from like.

3105
02:06:19,180 --> 02:06:20,020
I agree with you a bunch.

3106
02:06:20,020 --> 02:06:20,860
Making.

3107
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:22,460
But it's also not cool to turn it

3108
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:24,300
into like a thing for profit.

3109
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:25,140
And just use your fucking-

3110
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:27,220
Yeah, no, I'm not saying it is.

3111
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:28,060
It's a middle ground, yeah.

3112
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:33,060
I'm just saying, I guess I felt like the winds

3113
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:35,100
of the conversation.

3114
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:35,940
We wouldn't want to-

3115
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:37,660
Everyone just, you know, everyone deals with stuff

3116
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:39,300
so just no one should talk about it.

3117
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:40,140
I think it's a good place.

3118
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:41,620
Look, when I said that thing about being stoic

3119
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:43,540
and hiding my pain, I didn't mean it as like,

3120
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:46,020
I'm better than these people that are open about it.

3121
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:46,860
But I agree with you.

3122
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:49,180
We're like, encourage a type of overcompensation of it.

3123
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:50,020
Look, you guys know-

3124
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:51,980
I don't even, like I was saying before,

3125
02:06:51,980 --> 02:06:53,420
I can't even be mad.

3126
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:54,260
Yeah.

3127
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:55,660
I want my instinct is to be mad

3128
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:59,500
because I feel like people that get this kind of support

3129
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:01,340
and sympathy, they're capitalizing on something

3130
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:05,260
that I just can't, either I don't know how to do it

3131
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:06,500
or I can't bring myself to do it

3132
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:07,460
or I just haven't done it

3133
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:09,900
or it's just not applicable to me or something, whatever.

3134
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:11,020
It's something that I don't have.

3135
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:11,860
It feels like-

3136
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:14,220
My instinct is to be salty and mad,

3137
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:18,420
but I can't actually pinpoint what is being done wrong here.

3138
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:21,140
Unless like, if this is being done cynically

3139
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:24,100
and like calculatedly, then I would say, ew, gross.

3140
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:25,420
But I don't know that.

3141
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:27,300
I don't know anything.

3142
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:29,820
I think because it feels disingenuous

3143
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:32,940
when you capitalize on something like,

3144
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:36,260
something that's so personal and sincere

3145
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:38,180
and like that's giving you a hard time

3146
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:41,900
and you're sharing it with people

3147
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:45,860
and it's such a very sort of like a vulnerable moment

3148
02:07:45,860 --> 02:07:48,780
and people then capitalize on this moment

3149
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:53,780
that it doesn't feel sincere, it doesn't feel good.

3150
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:55,420
I'm not saying everybody does this,

3151
02:07:55,420 --> 02:07:57,820
but some people literally whore out their depression.

3152
02:07:57,820 --> 02:07:59,140
Yeah, yeah, the fact.

3153
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:00,980
Yeah, the fact.

3154
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:05,020
I am in all support of people sharing.

3155
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:07,540
Like different people deal with different things

3156
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:09,500
differently, a lot of differences.

3157
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:13,340
But like, you know, so like I have a few friends

3158
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:16,100
that do come to me and talk to me about stuff

3159
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:17,500
and I'm more than happy to help.

3160
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:19,140
I do that too sometimes with friends,

3161
02:08:19,140 --> 02:08:22,580
but for the most part, when the big things happen,

3162
02:08:22,580 --> 02:08:24,100
I usually don't share it with people,

3163
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:28,220
but basically to vent sometimes it's good

3164
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:30,860
and therapeutic and I am all supported with sharing and stuff.

3165
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:34,340
But when people, like you said, whore out their depression,

3166
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:37,460
that's when I draw the line, I guess.

3167
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:42,700
What makes it weird is not, no individual case

3168
02:08:42,700 --> 02:08:46,140
is like horrible and like, you know,

3169
02:08:46,140 --> 02:08:48,020
I can't point to an individual case and be like,

3170
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:51,100
oh, this person's bad, this person's being a whore or whatever.

3171
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:54,300
But the fact that it is like a recognizable pattern,

3172
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:58,540
like a widespread recognizable pattern and for success

3173
02:08:58,540 --> 02:09:00,700
is dystopian and horrifying.

3174
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:02,980
I think these people who, you know,

3175
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:05,380
do these sort of things makes it harder for people

3176
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:08,300
to genuinely share their problems with other people.

3177
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:10,300
Yeah, that's what I was saying exactly.

3178
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:13,660
Yeah, because, you know, like you just wanna be honest

3179
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:15,900
with people and share your experiences and whatnot,

3180
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:18,940
but then like you're afraid that you'll get good compared

3181
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:20,580
or like, oh, you're just whoring for attention

3182
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:22,300
or you're just trying to be a victim.

3183
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:25,500
You don't wanna be lumped in with YouTubers.

3184
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:27,300
It's like there's such a stigma

3185
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:30,340
because of what YouTubers have been.

3186
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:33,700
It's like these narcissistic like,

3187
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:35,300
yeah, this is me and look at me.

3188
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:36,380
Like I don't wanna be that.

3189
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:38,140
No one wants to be that

3190
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:41,140
and you'd hate to get compared to those people.

3191
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:45,620
So yeah. I do think some of this just kind of makes sense

3192
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:49,900
with the widespreadedness of like us kind of all whoring

3193
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:53,100
ourselves out to varying degrees on social media.

3194
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:55,400
You know, I've always described or I've recently described

3195
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:58,020
like being a YouTuber as like selling your personality

3196
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:00,660
as a service or like whatever, you know, that kind of shit.

3197
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:03,060
So like you really are exposing yourself

3198
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:05,460
more probably mentally and like,

3199
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:08,740
cause people like I really try to keep a wall here,

3200
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:10,420
but if I was like a daily vlogger

3201
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:12,020
and was just putting like everything I had

3202
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:13,460
on the internet and stuff

3203
02:10:13,460 --> 02:10:15,220
and like people could see everything I do

3204
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:17,380
and they can be like, oh, that's shit.

3205
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:18,940
Then like that'll mean a lot more

3206
02:10:18,940 --> 02:10:21,220
than if I like edit a video, it's not funny.

3207
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:22,740
And people are like, well, that sucked

3208
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:24,700
cause it's not like me, they're attacking.

3209
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:25,900
It's like a product.

3210
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:28,220
So maybe that breakdown of that wall

3211
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:31,020
is what's leaving people more mentally vulnerable

3212
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:32,180
or something to this stuff.

3213
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:33,020
I don't know.

3214
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:35,700
I've felt like less and less comfortable

3215
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:36,700
with that kind of stuff.

3216
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:41,460
And like, I mean, I don't do social media anymore at all.

3217
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:45,660
And like, I haven't been on this podcast for over a year.

3218
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:49,700
Like, I'm at the point where just like,

3219
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:51,820
like chipping off parts of my personality

3220
02:10:51,820 --> 02:10:55,540
and parts of my experience to like give to the world.

3221
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:58,540
It's not fun, it's exposing and it's scary.

3222
02:10:58,540 --> 02:11:01,060
And I don't know if I really like it.

3223
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:03,700
It kind of makes a day job seem like a nice thing.

3224
02:11:03,700 --> 02:11:04,780
Yeah, it absolutely does.

3225
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:06,980
You don't have to sell your soul.

3226
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:08,220
Put me in a comic book store

3227
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:09,900
and let me like work behind a register.

3228
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:12,900
I feel like I'd almost be happier.

3229
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:13,980
I don't know.

3230
02:11:13,980 --> 02:11:14,900
And now I'm doing it.

3231
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:16,380
Now I'm doing the thing that I was just

3232
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:18,100
fucking talking about.

3233
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:20,700
Cause now I'm fucking, so you just can't,

3234
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:22,820
it's like a trap, you know, you fucking shit.

3235
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:24,820
Yeah, I guess that's true.

3236
02:11:24,820 --> 02:11:26,100
Well, I'll tell you what team.

3237
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:27,420
How about we go to those questions?

3238
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:28,380
How about we go to those questions?

3239
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:29,220
Wait, no?

3240
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:30,340
I have, you know,

3241
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:33,100
I want to say, I don't usually do this,

3242
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:35,700
but I actually came into this episode with notes

3243
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:38,660
and like top, I have a list sitting in front of me

3244
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:41,020
on topics that I wanted to talk about.

3245
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:42,820
I never have this, but I have this this time.

3246
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:44,460
And we only got to two of them.

3247
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:45,620
And I'm like, damn it.

3248
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:47,740
I had actual stuff that I wanted.

3249
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:48,700
But what are we going for?

3250
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:49,540
Like two hours now?

3251
02:11:49,540 --> 02:11:50,900
Yeah, a little over two hours.

3252
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:51,740
Yep.

3253
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:52,580
Man.

3254
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:53,420
So, okay.

3255
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:55,020
Well, I'll leave some of these for later.

3256
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:56,540
However, there's one.

3257
02:11:56,540 --> 02:11:58,260
Before we go on the questions, I have one thing.

3258
02:11:58,300 --> 02:12:02,380
I feel like I have, I have sensed a sort of confusion

3259
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:05,340
or a sort of widespread false belief

3260
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:09,620
that I live with at Digi's house with like Tom does.

3261
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:11,020
And I just want to say no.

3262
02:12:11,020 --> 02:12:11,860
Is that true?

3263
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:12,700
I just want to put that.

3264
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:13,540
Where did that come from?

3265
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:14,380
Who said that?

3266
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:16,020
I feel like I've, I don't know where I saw it.

3267
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:19,100
It might have been on like the PCP fan discord or something.

3268
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:22,380
Or some, I don't know, I feel like that one time.

3269
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:24,860
Maybe it was, yeah, maybe people got the impression

3270
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:26,140
because I've been on IM Games.

3271
02:12:26,140 --> 02:12:27,900
But I feel like some people believe

3272
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:30,660
that I live with you guys at Digi's house.

3273
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:32,700
And no, I have my own place.

3274
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:35,380
And it's a real cool guy, so cease the bullying.

3275
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:36,700
I'm way cool guys.

3276
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:39,140
Yeah, I'm a cool guy.

3277
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:40,140
And I don't know.

3278
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:42,660
Okay, I guess there's really nothing else to say about that.

3279
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:45,060
We're at Digi House.

3280
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:46,500
Did I mention that this is,

3281
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:48,020
people stopped calling it Monkey House?

3282
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:48,860
Oh, you did mention it.

3283
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:50,700
They call it, they call it Wheel House now

3284
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:51,540
and their name sucks.

3285
02:12:51,540 --> 02:12:52,740
I refuse, I refuse.

3286
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:53,580
Yeah, fuck it.

3287
02:12:53,580 --> 02:12:54,420
It's Monkey House.

3288
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:55,260
Bring it back, Monkey House.

3289
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:58,460
Okay, well, never, sorry,

3290
02:12:58,460 --> 02:12:59,900
that was a bit of a dead-end tangent,

3291
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:01,500
but at least it's out there now.

3292
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:03,340
You got our announcement, you're okay.

3293
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:05,780
All right, let's go to these questions here.

3294
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:10,460
Wait, wait, oh man, I feel like we can squeeze

3295
02:13:10,460 --> 02:13:12,220
one more Monday joke in here somewhere.

3296
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:13,660
I just gotta fucking think of it.

3297
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:17,660
Hey Garfield, what's tomorrow?

3298
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:22,660
Oh, John, you know what the worst mental health thing

3299
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:26,300
of all is?

3300
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:29,180
Mondays, okay, there we fucking go.

3301
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:34,180
Okay, I got that, here's my YouTube video confession

3302
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:35,180
for all my fans.

3303
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:36,900
Sorry I haven't posted in a while,

3304
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:41,820
but guys, it's Monday and I just can't do it anymore.

3305
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:44,460
What do they say about like,

3306
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:46,500
what's that thing like in winter you get depressed

3307
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:50,460
is like seasonal affective disorder, SAD?

3308
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:53,900
I think it's SAD, well Garfield's got MAD,

3309
02:13:53,900 --> 02:13:56,140
Monday affective disorder.

3310
02:13:56,140 --> 02:13:56,980
People, people.

3311
02:13:56,980 --> 02:13:58,780
His mental health just plummets.

3312
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:01,980
We need to take mental health seriously, people.

3313
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:03,260
If Garfield was in a coma.

3314
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:04,780
Oh my God, he said what I feel,

3315
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:06,140
but I could never put into words.

3316
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:08,860
I have to fucking give him the cash.

3317
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:10,020
If we don't start taking it seriously,

3318
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:13,260
Garfield is gonna shoot up a school,

3319
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:16,100
and you know what they're gonna say in school?

3320
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:18,260
And it'll be your fault for not supporting

3321
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:21,020
Endless Desk for saying this right now.

3322
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:25,060
All school shootings happen on Monday.

3323
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:30,020
I was gonna say, school shootings are just

3324
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:32,820
a Monday thing, I mean, I assume.

3325
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:35,540
Well then obviously the way to end school shootings,

3326
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:37,700
every single one, all Mondays.

3327
02:14:37,700 --> 02:14:39,100
Yeah, the way to end school shootings

3328
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:41,180
is to abolish Mondays.

3329
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:43,060
Garfield's united with those.

3330
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:45,420
Hey, quick question, if Garfield was in a coma,

3331
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:48,980
let's say for three months, and then he wakes up,

3332
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:51,380
and he wakes up on a Monday,

3333
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:52,900
but nobody tells him it's a Monday.

3334
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:55,740
Would he know it's a Monday, even if nobody tells him?

3335
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:56,580
Would he somehow know?

3336
02:14:56,580 --> 02:15:00,780
I'm gonna say he would because he always gets the splort

3337
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:01,620
on Monday.

3338
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:02,460
What's the splort?

3339
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:06,780
The splort is a pie that seemingly comes from nowhere,

3340
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:09,900
a hand with a pie in it that hits Garfield in the face,

3341
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:12,340
and the sound effect is always splort.

3342
02:15:13,340 --> 02:15:17,740
So somehow, he would get squirted, he would know.

3343
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:19,180
He could deduce it.

3344
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:20,780
I think he's got a sense for it now,

3345
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:23,300
and he would very quickly realize that it was Monday

3346
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:26,300
because like pianos would fall on him from the sky and stuff.

3347
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:29,820
What a tragic belief system where he's doomed one seventh

3348
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:32,940
of his entire life to be sheer agony and misery.

3349
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:34,380
It's not, it's not belief.

3350
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:36,660
This is not like the secret kind of like,

3351
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:38,780
like his believing makes it so.

3352
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:40,980
This is like, like the universe conspires

3353
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:41,820
against the Monday.

3354
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:43,340
Yeah, and this is like a scientific law of the universe

3355
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:44,780
in the Garfield canon.

3356
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:46,100
Mondays will get you.

3357
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:47,340
I guess that makes sense.

3358
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:49,140
All right.

3359
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:51,700
It's like, it's on every Monday, it's like he gets hit

3360
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:55,620
with Chris Chan Sonichu's Cursier Hamehawai.

3361
02:15:55,620 --> 02:15:56,620
Yeah.

3362
02:15:56,620 --> 02:15:58,140
Yeah.

3363
02:15:58,140 --> 02:16:00,580
Okay, let's get to a question here.

3364
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:02,140
Oh, so we're going to the questions.

3365
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:03,340
This isn't an actual question,

3366
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:06,500
but here's a little sound bite from one spar.

3367
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:07,460
Listen up.

3368
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:08,300
Here we go.

3369
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:11,100
Hello.

3370
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:14,980
It's time for voicemails.

3371
02:16:14,980 --> 02:16:16,300
Yeah.

3372
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:17,300
Oh, I like that.

3373
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:18,780
Voicemail intro.

3374
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:19,620
Sick.

3375
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:20,460
That is nice.

3376
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:21,900
Oh, that's good.

3377
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:23,020
It's a good idea.

3378
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:23,860
Yeah, okay.

3379
02:16:23,860 --> 02:16:24,700
It was good actually.

3380
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:25,540
I like having like a stick.

3381
02:16:25,540 --> 02:16:28,380
It makes sense to have a little jingle for a segment.

3382
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:29,700
Yeah, way to go once, Bar.

3383
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:31,540
And by the way, please finish that fucking

3384
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:33,660
a DeVoo game shit.

3385
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:34,500
Okay.

3386
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:35,340
Okay.

3387
02:16:35,420 --> 02:16:38,260
Finish that fucking DeVoo game shit.

3388
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,140
I can't remember the name of it.

3389
02:16:39,140 --> 02:16:39,980
It's long.

3390
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:40,820
I always forget.

3391
02:16:40,820 --> 02:16:41,660
Autonomous.

3392
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:42,500
Autonomous.

3393
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,340
Yeah.

3394
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:44,660
Finish that let's play so I can watch it.

3395
02:16:44,660 --> 02:16:45,500
Or Ben, whatever.

3396
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:46,340
I don't care.

3397
02:16:46,340 --> 02:16:47,180
One of you.

3398
02:16:47,180 --> 02:16:48,020
All right.

3399
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:48,860
Next one.

3400
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,700
This is from, ah, here we go.

3401
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:54,020
This is from Radcon Israeli Defense Four.

3402
02:16:54,020 --> 02:16:56,900
So like four, you know, like the numbers.

3403
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:57,740
Okay.

3404
02:16:57,740 --> 02:17:01,780
So let's see who we've got waiting for us in this country.

3405
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:03,900
Radcon Four.

3406
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:06,980
Radcon Israeli Defense Fours.

3407
02:17:06,980 --> 02:17:09,180
All I need to do is pretend that you're Jewish

3408
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:12,540
and the Israeli government will send you a ticket

3409
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:14,860
to Israel for free.

3410
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:18,340
So all you need to do is find a way to pretend you're Jewish.

3411
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:21,580
Digi, Victor, they already look Jewish.

3412
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:23,620
So you guys can just get away with that.

3413
02:17:23,620 --> 02:17:25,500
Ben, Nate, you're Polish.

3414
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:27,620
That's basically Jewish already.

3415
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:29,980
Rest of you fags have to get circumcised.

3416
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:30,820
That's it.

3417
02:17:30,820 --> 02:17:31,660
Bye.

3418
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:33,780
I'm just saying, if we could somehow

3419
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:37,100
trick the Israeli government to fund our trip

3420
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:41,060
for Radcon Israeli Defense Fours,

3421
02:17:41,060 --> 02:17:43,500
that would be pretty good.

3422
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:46,500
I doubt they're including return tickets, are they?

3423
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,220
Radcon Four Israel.

3424
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:50,340
Oh, God.

3425
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:52,660
Do they not include return tickets

3426
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:53,700
when you take this trip?

3427
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:56,020
Yeah, you can only go, but you can't leave.

3428
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:57,420
I mean, it kind of makes sense.

3429
02:17:57,420 --> 02:17:58,260
The goal is still a friend.

3430
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:01,100
We'll go for free and kickstart the return flight.

3431
02:18:01,980 --> 02:18:04,580
It's like, hey, hey, everyone, I'm doing a go fund me.

3432
02:18:04,580 --> 02:18:07,460
Help me escape from this abusive environment in Israel

3433
02:18:07,460 --> 02:18:08,980
where they won't let me leave.

3434
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:11,500
Okay.

3435
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:15,940
You guys know how you can't ever choose what you remember.

3436
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:18,260
So there's going to be some wayward thoughts there

3437
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:20,500
for some reason are stuck in your mind forever.

3438
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:23,980
I used to watch a ton of conspiracy theory YouTubers

3439
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:26,580
and there's this one phrase that stuck with me.

3440
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:28,700
Whenever I want to ratchet up things to 11,

3441
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:31,260
I think to myself to the phrase,

3442
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:35,460
what happens when the no fly list becomes the no leave list?

3443
02:18:35,460 --> 02:18:38,500
And that's like past 11, past 10.

3444
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:40,380
That's like the top of the food chain.

3445
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:42,680
Like, you know, like, let's get this party started.

3446
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:44,460
Let's kick this from the no fly list,

3447
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:47,060
the no leave list real quick here.

3448
02:18:47,060 --> 02:18:49,980
The no fly list to the no leave list.

3449
02:18:49,980 --> 02:18:51,620
It's like, it's like you've got your stereo.

3450
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:53,460
You go one to eight, like pretty good.

3451
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:54,620
Click it up to nine.

3452
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:55,940
It's like, oh, let's go a little higher.

3453
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:57,260
Next one, no fly list.

3454
02:18:57,260 --> 02:18:58,380
You're like, that's pretty good.

3455
02:18:58,380 --> 02:19:00,100
But we could go one further.

3456
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:01,860
No leave list.

3457
02:19:01,860 --> 02:19:03,580
Yeah, yeah, exact right.

3458
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:05,940
You like, you get on the plane to leave

3459
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:08,380
and right before it gets off the runway,

3460
02:19:08,380 --> 02:19:11,700
Master Hand plucks it out of the fucking air

3461
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:13,220
and puts it in a bag somewhere.

3462
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:14,060
That's the hand of Trump.

3463
02:19:14,060 --> 02:19:14,900
A marble bag.

3464
02:19:14,900 --> 02:19:16,420
It is the hand of Trump.

3465
02:19:16,420 --> 02:19:19,420
A big orange Master Hand.

3466
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:21,240
Oh no, but his hands are tiny.

3467
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:22,740
That's the joke, so they have to.

3468
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:23,580
Oh, that's true.

3469
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:25,980
So it can't be a Master Hand.

3470
02:19:25,980 --> 02:19:27,540
It'd be Crazy Hand.

3471
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:29,780
No, oh no, oh no.

3472
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:32,820
My Master Hand joke turned into a Trump joke.

3473
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:33,980
No, I hate when that happens.

3474
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:35,300
Please donate to my GoFundMe.

3475
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:36,980
No way, you're gonna get a show on Comedy Central

3476
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:37,820
in a couple minutes.

3477
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:41,060
So that I can get away from my jokes becoming Trump jokes.

3478
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:42,620
The good news is you're about to be, yeah,

3479
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:44,900
much like I said, given a Comedy Central special

3480
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:46,380
based on that one Trump joke.

3481
02:19:46,380 --> 02:19:47,220
So, you know.

3482
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:49,260
Yeah, all I have to do is remove all the humor

3483
02:19:49,260 --> 02:19:50,500
and punch lines from it.

3484
02:19:52,220 --> 02:19:54,700
All right, we got a voicemail from Mr. Bones,

3485
02:19:54,700 --> 02:19:56,100
who I think we've gotten in the past.

3486
02:19:56,740 --> 02:19:58,340
Let's go.

3487
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:01,660
I recently rewatched the Digi's lecture on The Dick Show.

3488
02:20:01,660 --> 02:20:03,820
And I know that some of you have been familiar enough

3489
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:06,340
with the story and what was going on with it.

3490
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:08,300
And considering that it seems that Jess

3491
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:09,860
is now back on some of these podcasts,

3492
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:11,540
I thought it'd be worth asking,

3493
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:14,220
are any of you still keeping up with The Dick Show?

3494
02:20:14,220 --> 02:20:17,260
And if so, what do you make of the continuing narrative?

3495
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:21,420
It feels like in the year since that lecture was released,

3496
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:24,380
there's been so much hot goss to come out down the pipes

3497
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:28,540
that it kind of feels like a whole new lecture is necessary.

3498
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:32,060
And I know that PCP lectures are, you know,

3499
02:20:32,060 --> 02:20:34,380
there's a lot of competition for what would be put in them.

3500
02:20:34,380 --> 02:20:37,300
But my question is, would Digi or any of the rest of you

3501
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:39,500
ever consider doing the hot goss too?

3502
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:43,860
Well, it would have to be Digi to do it.

3503
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:47,020
To be honest, I watched a bunch of,

3504
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:50,020
I watched like maybe half of the,

3505
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:51,460
I was gonna say best guy ever,

3506
02:20:51,460 --> 02:20:53,140
biggest problem in the universe.

3507
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:55,940
And I didn't finish it.

3508
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:58,820
By the time I was there, like, you know, the whole,

3509
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:01,700
the thing happened, they split up, Dick Show started.

3510
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:03,140
I watched a little bit of The Dick Show,

3511
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:04,940
mostly just like incidentally,

3512
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:06,340
when Digi happened to be watching it,

3513
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:08,340
and I happened to be in the room.

3514
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:10,260
I didn't, so I haven't actually seen that much.

3515
02:21:10,260 --> 02:21:12,340
I haven't kept up, most of what I know about it

3516
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:14,420
comes from Digi and that lecture.

3517
02:21:14,420 --> 02:21:16,220
That's me, that's where I'm at with that.

3518
02:21:16,220 --> 02:21:17,980
So no, I haven't been keeping up with it.

3519
02:21:17,980 --> 02:21:19,460
Has anybody else been keeping up with it at all?

3520
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:21,500
No, I think when he did the lecture,

3521
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:23,340
I was, I was, you know, all caught up.

3522
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,860
And right around the end of the time,

3523
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:27,820
I fell off the train of pretty much watching anything.

3524
02:21:27,820 --> 02:21:30,220
To me, like the lecture kind of like put the capstone

3525
02:21:30,220 --> 02:21:33,180
on my interest and like, I can let this go now.

3526
02:21:33,180 --> 02:21:34,620
I wish you'd given us some examples.

3527
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:35,460
I have no idea.

3528
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:36,900
I guess I wish Digi was here.

3529
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:39,300
I have no idea what it was about anymore.

3530
02:21:39,300 --> 02:21:42,220
The goss itself just got so fucking tiresome to me

3531
02:21:42,220 --> 02:21:44,060
and boring after like, yeah.

3532
02:21:44,060 --> 02:21:45,980
It's like, like now, like,

3533
02:21:45,980 --> 02:21:48,900
I think I see tweets from mysterious every now and then

3534
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:52,980
it just kind of seems like a lot of sort of past,

3535
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:54,740
I don't know, like a stereo is funny,

3536
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:55,820
so I don't want to shit on him.

3537
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:57,420
But like a lot of what I see is just kind of like

3538
02:21:57,420 --> 02:21:59,580
passive aggressive, like look at this,

3539
02:21:59,580 --> 02:22:02,900
look at this new really stupid thing Maddox is doing.

3540
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:03,740
What an idiot.

3541
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:05,220
He's just embarrassing myself.

3542
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:06,540
The stereo is just fucking hilarious.

3543
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:10,060
It is like the epitome of being a dead horse though.

3544
02:22:10,060 --> 02:22:11,860
Like, I mean, you won the Wall Street.

3545
02:22:11,860 --> 02:22:12,700
Yeah, yeah.

3546
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:14,140
What more can you do to this man?

3547
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:16,620
I mean, maybe something good actually happened.

3548
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:18,900
I mean, it does start to feel,

3549
02:22:18,900 --> 02:22:21,780
it does start to come off cruel after a while

3550
02:22:21,780 --> 02:22:24,180
and it does start to rub me in the wrong way a little bit.

3551
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:25,580
It starts to come off cruel,

3552
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:28,900
but on the other hand, Maddox did bring this lawsuit

3553
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:31,420
and like caused this whole trouble that like, you know,

3554
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:34,180
a stereo and everyone else is having to deal with.

3555
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:36,740
I mean, I can't put myself in a stereo suit in the first place.

3556
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:41,020
So I get why a stereo feels victimized.

3557
02:22:41,020 --> 02:22:42,620
I think that that makes sense.

3558
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:45,380
And like, it's not like any of these things

3559
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:48,020
that Maddox does in the suit, like any of the like,

3560
02:22:48,020 --> 02:22:49,140
it's like, ha, ha, you know,

3561
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:50,780
we have to legally prove these a cuck.

3562
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:53,500
Like that is funny, but it does start to be like,

3563
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:55,260
it's sort of been the same story for what,

3564
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:56,100
like a year and a half now.

3565
02:22:56,100 --> 02:23:00,420
I just feel like it's gotten to the point where Maddox,

3566
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:02,220
like I feel like I might see a news story

3567
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:05,900
that he killed himself and then it won't be funny anymore.

3568
02:23:05,900 --> 02:23:08,900
That's kind of where I started leaving interest in it.

3569
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:11,220
It's just like, it's like, it's like,

3570
02:23:11,220 --> 02:23:13,340
it's like a flawless victory fatality.

3571
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:14,540
Where do you have left to go

3572
02:23:14,540 --> 02:23:17,020
and like making Maddox look worse than he actually is?

3573
02:23:17,020 --> 02:23:19,380
It seems like that to us,

3574
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:21,540
but I think to them, it's ongoing.

3575
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:23,300
No, I totally get why, you know,

3576
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:24,860
a stereo suit if I was in his shoes,

3577
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:27,980
I'd be mad and fucking want to fight too constantly.

3578
02:23:27,980 --> 02:23:30,740
But I don't like, his fucking, his,

3579
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:32,660
a stereo suit's videos where he was like,

3580
02:23:32,660 --> 02:23:34,540
Tom Phillips, the game reporter,

3581
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:36,420
are like the funniest videos ever.

3582
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:37,420
Like that's what I love.

3583
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:39,260
And like his dumb characters,

3584
02:23:39,260 --> 02:23:42,020
like the fucking, that Bayou voice that he does,

3585
02:23:42,140 --> 02:23:45,060
is like a Cajun guy, that was incredible.

3586
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:48,900
And like, I like Dick when he's just being the guy

3587
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:50,940
who like rants about stepping in dog shit

3588
02:23:50,940 --> 02:23:52,620
and like has those everyday problems

3589
02:23:52,620 --> 02:23:53,700
and like goes crazy about him.

3590
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:56,300
That's good stuff.

3591
02:23:56,300 --> 02:23:59,140
But no, I just, even if it weren't for like me

3592
02:23:59,140 --> 02:24:00,020
getting bored of the goss,

3593
02:24:00,020 --> 02:24:02,980
I just kind of really fell out of watching

3594
02:24:02,980 --> 02:24:06,260
or listening to fucking anything for a long time now.

3595
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:07,820
I just fucking don't care about the internet.

3596
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:10,500
I'm just real curious, based on what this guy was saying,

3597
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,620
like it sounded like there was new goss.

3598
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:13,540
I wonder if that's good.

3599
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:15,540
It seems like none of us actually knows that we also

3600
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:18,460
maybe there was some recent development of,

3601
02:24:18,460 --> 02:24:19,300
but I don't know.

3602
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:20,140
Yeah, I don't know either.

3603
02:24:20,140 --> 02:24:21,700
All right, well, whatever.

3604
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:23,060
Next, next call.

3605
02:24:23,060 --> 02:24:26,820
This is from easily influenced idiot.

3606
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:27,980
Okay.

3607
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:30,660
So people have told me that I'm smart.

3608
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:31,500
Wrong.

3609
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,460
Which is wrong.

3610
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:36,860
Yeah, but how can I abuse that people think

3611
02:24:36,860 --> 02:24:38,700
that I am smart?

3612
02:24:39,700 --> 02:24:41,020
That's it.

3613
02:24:41,020 --> 02:24:42,860
You're a cartoon character, buddy.

3614
02:24:44,180 --> 02:24:46,220
But the question was, how can I abuse the fact

3615
02:24:46,220 --> 02:24:47,540
that people think that I'm smart?

3616
02:24:47,540 --> 02:24:49,460
He is not smart, but people think he's smart.

3617
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:51,340
How can he use this to win?

3618
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:52,180
How can he use it?

3619
02:24:52,180 --> 02:24:54,180
It sounded like a fucking mad hatter.

3620
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:55,020
I did believe it.

3621
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:55,860
Yeah, I know, I know.

3622
02:24:55,860 --> 02:24:57,460
I sound like a cartoon character.

3623
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:01,180
How can I, how would I?

3624
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:03,020
Keep in mind, he's not smart.

3625
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:04,060
He's not.

3626
02:25:04,060 --> 02:25:05,940
Yeah, that's difficult.

3627
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:08,500
I was gonna, well, in that case,

3628
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:09,940
you can make people do what you want

3629
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:12,340
by just telling them this is a good idea and I'm smart.

3630
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:15,340
But since you are dumb, if you do that,

3631
02:25:15,340 --> 02:25:17,740
bad things will result because your ideas are bad.

3632
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:19,900
That's probably true.

3633
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:21,700
Okay, he's gotta do some sort of like,

3634
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:23,980
he's gotta get in some sort of situation like King

3635
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,940
from One Punch Man, if you're familiar.

3636
02:25:25,940 --> 02:25:27,900
Whereas everyone thinks that King

3637
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:29,820
is the strongest man in the world,

3638
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:32,500
but it's all due to misunderstandings and shenanigans.

3639
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:36,100
He is actually just a gamer boy, basically.

3640
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:38,300
He has no abilities whatsoever.

3641
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:40,100
But everyone thinks that he's super strong.

3642
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:43,460
But it's honestly, the role of King in One Punch Man

3643
02:25:43,460 --> 02:25:47,060
gives me such anxiety every time he's on screen

3644
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:48,900
because I'm constantly terrified.

3645
02:25:48,900 --> 02:25:51,060
He's going to be found out this time,

3646
02:25:51,060 --> 02:25:52,580
that this is gonna be the time.

3647
02:25:52,580 --> 02:25:53,420
So I don't know.

3648
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:56,500
I don't know if I can in all conscience

3649
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:58,620
advocate anything that is in any way

3650
02:25:58,620 --> 02:26:00,420
not just upfront about how dumb you are.

3651
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:02,620
It sounds to me that like the best thing to do

3652
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:04,100
is you just keep doing what you're doing

3653
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:05,740
because you've obviously already fooled everyone

3654
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:06,580
to think you're smart.

3655
02:26:06,580 --> 02:26:09,980
You just ride on that social credit and just keep going.

3656
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:11,500
Okay, because you're not smart,

3657
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:14,580
you will not be able to make any grand plans happen.

3658
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:15,980
But the good news is,

3659
02:26:15,980 --> 02:26:18,260
you can just make people think you're smart

3660
02:26:18,260 --> 02:26:19,780
and use that in small ways

3661
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:22,780
to just get general social benefit.

3662
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:24,260
Here's what I think.

3663
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:25,080
Here's what I think.

3664
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:27,300
You should team up with someone who is smart,

3665
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:29,300
but maybe has low charisma.

3666
02:26:29,300 --> 02:26:32,500
And then you should be the mouthpiece,

3667
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:33,900
and he should be the ideas guy.

3668
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:34,940
That's a great idea.

3669
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:35,780
Go hit up the chess club.

3670
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:37,780
And the two of you can rise to the top together.

3671
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:38,620
Hit the nerd club,

3672
02:26:38,620 --> 02:26:40,260
hit the computer programmer desk,

3673
02:26:40,260 --> 02:26:42,740
be elite hacker or something.

3674
02:26:42,740 --> 02:26:44,180
Yeah, do that.

3675
02:26:44,180 --> 02:26:46,020
That's what you need to do.

3676
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:48,900
Yeah, you gotta find a partner

3677
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:51,140
that fills in the gaps in your stats.

3678
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:52,020
Team up with a smart guy,

3679
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:54,340
work really hard and eventually you can get that farm

3680
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:55,460
and tend the rabbits.

3681
02:26:57,300 --> 02:26:58,460
Based on that voice mail,

3682
02:26:58,460 --> 02:27:00,980
this man's charisma is obviously off the charts.

3683
02:27:00,980 --> 02:27:01,980
So, you know.

3684
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:04,940
Yeah, because he sounds like the mad hatter all the time.

3685
02:27:04,980 --> 02:27:06,220
That's his real voice.

3686
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:08,900
And everyone just finds it so charming.

3687
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:12,500
He is literally lording the club that is that tea party.

3688
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:13,340
Oh yeah.

3689
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:15,380
Oh, he's lording that club too.

3690
02:27:15,380 --> 02:27:18,260
All right, next question is from our next voicemail.

3691
02:27:18,260 --> 02:27:19,580
Do it, I dare you.

3692
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:22,180
Well, I think called in last week, but let's say.

3693
02:27:23,180 --> 02:27:25,580
All right, motherfuckers.

3694
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:30,180
I take my precious time out of delivering pizzas.

3695
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:31,020
Oh yeah.

3696
02:27:31,020 --> 02:27:31,860
Close your car door.

3697
02:27:31,860 --> 02:27:32,700
I still do.

3698
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:33,540
I literally never stop.

3699
02:27:33,540 --> 02:27:38,300
Never stop delivering pizzas for a whole straight week.

3700
02:27:38,300 --> 02:27:42,700
And I asked, I needed to know whether or not you,

3701
02:27:42,700 --> 02:27:43,980
you were sledding.

3702
02:27:43,980 --> 02:27:48,780
And I spoke, I guess, with two intellectual,

3703
02:27:48,780 --> 02:27:51,980
two grand of a way of speaking.

3704
02:27:51,980 --> 02:27:55,660
And so, none of you understood that I was asking.

3705
02:27:55,660 --> 02:27:59,900
I was pleading for advice on how to,

3706
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:01,860
whether or not I should go fucking sledding.

3707
02:28:01,860 --> 02:28:03,940
Sounds like munchie after he's gotten a job.

3708
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:08,140
It's a living cold place where it sometimes snows.

3709
02:28:08,140 --> 02:28:09,540
But if I go up to the mountains,

3710
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:11,180
there'll definitely be snow.

3711
02:28:11,180 --> 02:28:13,420
If I just go on, if I go on a mountain,

3712
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:15,580
there's like 99% of the time it snows.

3713
02:28:15,580 --> 02:28:16,420
Okay, all right.

3714
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:17,780
Wait, what is this issue?

3715
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:20,460
If you guys ever slitted, I can't make decisions.

3716
02:28:20,460 --> 02:28:24,660
And there's people on the internet who I listen to

3717
02:28:24,660 --> 02:28:26,620
tell me about what it needs to be.

3718
02:28:26,620 --> 02:28:28,700
So fucking talk about sledding.

3719
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:32,220
Yeah, okay, if you request,

3720
02:28:32,220 --> 02:28:36,860
oh, and it, and you still don't, yes, agreed.

3721
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:40,780
If you, yeah, go sledding if you feel like going sledding.

3722
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:41,860
Sledding is awesome.

3723
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:42,700
That's it.

3724
02:28:42,700 --> 02:28:44,300
You know what, there's a hierarchy, all right?

3725
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:47,140
It's like snowboarding is at the fucking bottom.

3726
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:48,540
Snowboarding sucks.

3727
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:51,340
Skiing is a little bit more fun than snowboarding.

3728
02:28:52,380 --> 02:28:54,740
Barely, sledding is at the fucking top.

3729
02:28:54,740 --> 02:28:56,500
Sledding, anyone can do it.

3730
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:57,660
You never mess up.

3731
02:28:57,660 --> 02:28:59,180
Even if you wipe out on a sled,

3732
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:01,300
it's somehow it's still fucking part of the,

3733
02:29:01,300 --> 02:29:02,140
it's great in the hilarious.

3734
02:29:02,140 --> 02:29:03,480
That's part, that's part of the fun.

3735
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:06,380
If you wipe out skiing, you failed at skiing.

3736
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:09,180
But if you wipe out sledding, you're still just sledding.

3737
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:11,900
And also you fucking died.

3738
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:14,020
You just become, yeah, it's part of it.

3739
02:29:15,460 --> 02:29:16,540
You're supposed to wipe out.

3740
02:29:16,540 --> 02:29:19,180
You're supposed to go like 90 miles an hour

3741
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:22,780
on that little, on a thin piece of plastic,

3742
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:25,940
like for babies, and you hit the end of the fucking hill,

3743
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:27,020
and at the end of the hill,

3744
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:28,740
it kind of goes up a little ways.

3745
02:29:28,740 --> 02:29:30,660
So you have fucking fly 50 feet in the air,

3746
02:29:30,660 --> 02:29:32,100
and you break your fucking leg.

3747
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:35,100
That's sledding, and it's fun, and it feels good, dammit.

3748
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:35,940
It feels good.

3749
02:29:35,940 --> 02:29:36,780
If it's good enough for Calvin,

3750
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:37,620
it's good enough for you, dammit.

3751
02:29:37,620 --> 02:29:39,780
Yeah, yeah.

3752
02:29:39,780 --> 02:29:41,940
Those great, those great fucking,

3753
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:45,580
you know, like 10 series long comic panels of Calvin,

3754
02:29:45,580 --> 02:29:49,060
like discussing the philosophical concepts,

3755
02:29:49,060 --> 02:29:50,620
eventually just smashing into a fucking tree.

3756
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:53,180
That's how the last Calvin Hubstrip ended, right?

3757
02:29:53,180 --> 02:29:54,020
That's true.

3758
02:29:54,020 --> 02:29:54,860
Let's go on an adventure,

3759
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:55,700
and they were sledding down the hill.

3760
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:56,540
It was a big hell.

3761
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:57,380
Did you really die?

3762
02:29:57,380 --> 02:29:58,220
Is that what's implied?

3763
02:29:58,220 --> 02:29:59,060
Oh my God.

3764
02:29:59,060 --> 02:29:59,900
Yeah, and actually, no.

3765
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:01,780
He woke up right before he hit the ground,

3766
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:03,100
and he was in a coma, all of a sudden.

3767
02:30:03,100 --> 02:30:03,940
Oh.

3768
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:05,420
Is that in any way true?

3769
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:06,260
That is completely not.

3770
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:09,460
He just sled down, and then Hobbs turned to him,

3771
02:30:09,460 --> 02:30:11,340
and he said, listen, honey,

3772
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:13,660
the doctors say that you think I'm a YouTuber.

3773
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:15,540
Listen, I know you think,

3774
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:17,460
I tell you to like, comment, and subscribe,

3775
02:30:17,460 --> 02:30:18,720
but actually, I'm your husband.

3776
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:19,560
Please wake up.

3777
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:20,400
Yeah, please wake up.

3778
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:21,940
I'm trying experimental technology.

3779
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:22,940
Can you hear me right now?

3780
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:24,180
Wake up, wake up, Calvin.

3781
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:25,860
Hey, remember that guy,

3782
02:30:25,860 --> 02:30:27,900
that voicemail that we got that was a message

3783
02:30:27,900 --> 02:30:30,620
from a higher reality telling us

3784
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:33,180
that we were all in a coma and need to wake up?

3785
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:34,100
Did anyone do that?

3786
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:35,460
Did anyone take his advice?

3787
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:36,540
I didn't.

3788
02:30:36,540 --> 02:30:37,380
I did.

3789
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:39,740
I went on and got some snacks, and then came back.

3790
02:30:39,740 --> 02:30:41,260
Yeah, okay, good.

3791
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:42,500
That looks good.

3792
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:44,460
Yeah, Calvin wakes up from his coma,

3793
02:30:44,460 --> 02:30:46,820
and the doctor explains that you see, Calvin,

3794
02:30:46,820 --> 02:30:49,500
it was all a dream composed of metaphors.

3795
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:50,340
Oh.

3796
02:30:50,340 --> 02:30:52,340
For example, the character of your mother

3797
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:55,060
represented your repressed homosexuality,

3798
02:30:55,060 --> 02:30:56,540
and the character of your father

3799
02:30:56,540 --> 02:30:58,500
also represented your repressed homosexuality.

3800
02:30:58,500 --> 02:30:59,700
The character of Kock,

3801
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:03,380
represented your repressed desire to suck cock, you see.

3802
02:31:03,380 --> 02:31:05,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3803
02:31:05,220 --> 02:31:06,060
It's just all that.

3804
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:08,700
Your sexually ambiguous friend, Susie,

3805
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:12,540
clearly represented your deep, gay butt fuckery.

3806
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:13,860
Oh, shit, my groceries are here.

3807
02:31:13,860 --> 02:31:14,700
I'll be back in a minute.

3808
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:16,220
All right, let's go on to the next one.

3809
02:31:16,220 --> 02:31:17,060
Wait.

3810
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:19,020
Let's go on to what?

3811
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:22,380
Oh, I was confused if Ben actually went to get groceries,

3812
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:24,660
or if that was part of the Calvin and Hobbs bit,

3813
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:27,380
but I'm like, wait, why is Calvin getting groceries now?

3814
02:31:27,380 --> 02:31:28,380
I lost something.

3815
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:29,460
I'm gonna assume.

3816
02:31:29,460 --> 02:31:32,860
Okay, next call is from, I think this is real talk.

3817
02:31:32,860 --> 02:31:34,900
This is from real talk.

3818
02:31:34,900 --> 02:31:35,740
Let's get real.

3819
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:42,620
The PCP are just human, fallible beings, mortals.

3820
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:45,900
Do not look up to them,

3821
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:49,460
except if you're looking for financial advice from Nate,

3822
02:31:49,460 --> 02:31:50,940
that is just about it,

3823
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:55,700
or perhaps art advice from a hippo or pen,

3824
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:58,980
but it's not people who are just trying to figure out

3825
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:02,340
their careers in life, just like you are.

3826
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:05,500
However, maybe they're just a little bit older,

3827
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:07,420
and you'll figure it out too.

3828
02:32:07,420 --> 02:32:10,380
So don't idolize people with a lot of pen install

3829
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:13,500
because it's just gonna hurt you in a lot, right?

3830
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:17,340
So, don't forget to take your call drops.

3831
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:19,940
Yeah, I appreciate Marvin the fucking Martian calling you.

3832
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:23,660
It sounded more like a Dalek, but just like a calm one.

3833
02:32:23,660 --> 02:32:25,100
Yeah, that's true.

3834
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:27,060
Yeah, you know, you start out kind of in tense,

3835
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:28,260
but you're just like, you know what?

3836
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:29,180
Yeah, you know what?

3837
02:32:29,180 --> 02:32:32,340
Do whatever you want, make your own decisions.

3838
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:35,380
I like when people call in with a point

3839
02:32:35,380 --> 02:32:37,740
and then refute their own point as they go along.

3840
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:41,620
Has this become like a meme of people saying,

3841
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:45,940
don't put us on a pedestal or anything?

3842
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:46,780
No.

3843
02:32:46,780 --> 02:32:49,660
It seems like I've heard, did you say that a lot,

3844
02:32:49,700 --> 02:32:51,900
or something, I figured people say that.

3845
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:54,740
Like, I don't know, I feel like if your options

3846
02:32:54,740 --> 02:32:57,100
are to either put me on a pedestal

3847
02:32:57,100 --> 02:32:59,620
or like put me on a place where you don't like me,

3848
02:32:59,620 --> 02:33:02,420
then by all means, put me on a fucking pedestal, please.

3849
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:04,260
Please.

3850
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:07,980
I would rather be liked too much than not enough.

3851
02:33:07,980 --> 02:33:10,500
Climb the pedestal at patreon.com slash best guy ever,

3852
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:13,620
everybody, head over there and show your love of height.

3853
02:33:14,660 --> 02:33:16,180
Well, all right, I mean, yeah.

3854
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:18,260
I mean, I think we have talked about this a little bit

3855
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:20,300
about like how you shouldn't listen to us

3856
02:33:20,300 --> 02:33:22,620
for fucking gospel or whatever.

3857
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:24,060
Like, yeah, I mean, I don't know,

3858
02:33:24,060 --> 02:33:26,140
I just feel that point's pretty clear, I guess.

3859
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:27,820
But it's always nice to hear from the voice

3860
02:33:27,820 --> 02:33:29,340
of a literal alien, so that's-

3861
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:34,340
Look, if you ever catch me saying that you should

3862
02:33:34,380 --> 02:33:37,140
go outside and risk the elements

3863
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:39,580
and brave the world on a Monday,

3864
02:33:39,580 --> 02:33:42,820
then you know that I need to be off that pedestal.

3865
02:33:42,820 --> 02:33:45,100
I have lost my right to the pedestal.

3866
02:33:45,100 --> 02:33:46,660
Don't listen to me if I say that.

3867
02:33:46,660 --> 02:33:48,380
But anything else I say, you can listen to me

3868
02:33:48,380 --> 02:33:52,220
because it's pretty fucking, it's probably correct, you know.

3869
02:33:52,220 --> 02:33:56,020
Here's a voicemail I assume is either from or for Mage,

3870
02:33:56,020 --> 02:34:00,300
it's from UwuUWU, you know, with the little face,

3871
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:03,100
so let's see what he has for us.

3872
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:06,620
So, I've been watching the drawcast a lot lately

3873
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:09,180
and it's really inspired me to try and learn how to draw

3874
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:10,700
and hopefully become an animator someday,

3875
02:34:10,700 --> 02:34:12,620
so like beer games and shit.

3876
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:14,140
So I was wondering if you guys have any tips

3877
02:34:14,140 --> 02:34:16,060
for getting good art relatively quickly,

3878
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:18,420
relatively being like a year or two?

3879
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:19,260
Andrew!

3880
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:20,820
I think your art is fucking amazing

3881
02:34:20,820 --> 02:34:21,820
and I hope to be on your level.

3882
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:24,660
Yeah, okay, okay, okay, yeah, okay, yeah.

3883
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:25,780
Okay, is it done, is it done?

3884
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:26,620
Yeah, okay.

3885
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:28,980
Andrew Loomis is funneled with a pencil, that's it.

3886
02:34:28,980 --> 02:34:29,820
That's all you need.

3887
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:31,700
Google search Andrew Loomis is funneled with a pencil.

3888
02:34:31,700 --> 02:34:34,780
You'll find a PDF like the second Google search.

3889
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:36,060
That's it, don't come back.

3890
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:36,900
Fun with a pencil.

3891
02:34:36,900 --> 02:34:38,820
What kind of information is contained in that tome?

3892
02:34:38,820 --> 02:34:39,660
Just for the later.

3893
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:41,780
It takes you from literally not knowing

3894
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:44,420
what the fuck is happening, how do I hold a pencil,

3895
02:34:44,460 --> 02:34:46,980
to being proficient in like 60 pages.

3896
02:34:46,980 --> 02:34:50,300
It explains drawing in the only way

3897
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:51,740
that actually makes sense.

3898
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:52,980
You can like be like, all right,

3899
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:54,700
here's how you draw the head from this side,

3900
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:55,860
here's how you draw the head from this side,

3901
02:34:55,860 --> 02:34:57,500
here's how you draw the pencil.

3902
02:34:57,500 --> 02:34:59,940
Does not matter until you realize,

3903
02:34:59,940 --> 02:35:02,020
oh wait, here's how you draw.

3904
02:35:02,020 --> 02:35:04,820
You take shapes that appear in the world,

3905
02:35:04,820 --> 02:35:09,020
but then you basically reverse engineer them.

3906
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:11,660
So instead of thinking about a skull as being a skull,

3907
02:35:11,660 --> 02:35:13,260
you're sitting about the skull, okay, what is a skull?

3908
02:35:13,300 --> 02:35:15,500
It's like a sort of elongated sphere,

3909
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:18,460
then there's the nose is sort of like a triangle,

3910
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:20,460
like trapezoid sort of thing, okay, okay.

3911
02:35:20,460 --> 02:35:22,500
You don't think about it in terms of like symbols,

3912
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:23,860
what you think a head looks like

3913
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:25,300
or what you think a nose looks like.

3914
02:35:25,300 --> 02:35:27,340
You think you bring it out into the geometric shapes

3915
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:28,260
and that's what that guy does

3916
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:30,460
and he explains it to you in greater detail in that book.

3917
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:32,380
No one says that, no one's like,

3918
02:35:32,380 --> 02:35:34,540
no one starts out drawing and he's like,

3919
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:36,500
okay, time to learn the geometric shapes and shit.

3920
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:37,540
No, that's what you have to do.

3921
02:35:37,540 --> 02:35:39,860
That's how you actually learn how to draw for realsies.

3922
02:35:39,860 --> 02:35:41,300
So do that.

3923
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:43,780
How about you, Mage, got any suggestions?

3924
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:46,180
Hey, I think Munchie has better suggestions.

3925
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:50,900
I just draw like a lot, but yeah, I guess, you know,

3926
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:55,340
using other people's examples of how to do its best.

3927
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:58,580
But like, I mean, like the more hours you put in,

3928
02:35:58,580 --> 02:36:02,380
the better you'll get at it eventually, so.

3929
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:04,220
How about you, Tom?

3930
02:36:04,220 --> 02:36:06,220
I would ask Ben as well, but he's not here.

3931
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:09,660
Gesture drawing, draw from life a lot.

3932
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:13,140
Understanding that drawing from life doesn't mean,

3933
02:36:13,140 --> 02:36:15,260
like the reason I never drew from life when I was a kid

3934
02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:16,940
because I hated drawing realistically

3935
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:19,660
because I didn't wanna draw photorealistic stuff,

3936
02:36:19,660 --> 02:36:21,660
but none of my art teachers ever said,

3937
02:36:21,660 --> 02:36:22,940
just because you're drawing from life

3938
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:25,060
doesn't mean you have to draw every last detail.

3939
02:36:25,060 --> 02:36:27,900
Like gesture drawing is about getting the idea of a figure,

3940
02:36:27,900 --> 02:36:31,420
not like doing every last little like skin pour.

3941
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:33,860
So once I realized that, I started doing it

3942
02:36:33,860 --> 02:36:36,580
and my figure drawings got better in literally two weeks,

3943
02:36:36,580 --> 02:36:39,380
like orders of magnitude better.

3944
02:36:39,380 --> 02:36:41,300
Figure drawing, gesture drawing.

3945
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:42,580
Yep, I'm doing that right now.

3946
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:43,500
I've been doing that for the,

3947
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:45,300
I think I said this before, but yeah,

3948
02:36:45,300 --> 02:36:47,140
I've been going gesture drawing classes every Monday

3949
02:36:47,140 --> 02:36:49,980
and I've been doing that and it's been absolutely fantastic.

3950
02:36:49,980 --> 02:36:50,820
Oh, that sounds fun.

3951
02:36:50,820 --> 02:36:53,820
I've improved nocibly in the short amount of time.

3952
02:36:53,820 --> 02:36:55,500
It's just fantastic.

3953
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:56,340
How about you, Jesse?

3954
02:36:56,340 --> 02:36:59,180
How do we get the MS Paint masterpiece from within?

3955
02:36:59,180 --> 02:37:00,180
Put it on the canvas.

3956
02:37:00,180 --> 02:37:02,100
Well, you gotta go to a figure drawing class

3957
02:37:02,100 --> 02:37:03,140
where they take their clothes off.

3958
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:06,060
That's the first rule, and that's really the only rule

3959
02:37:06,060 --> 02:37:06,940
because once you,

3960
02:37:06,940 --> 02:37:07,780
Hey, Kale.

3961
02:37:08,780 --> 02:37:12,100
Once you see a naked lady contort her body

3962
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:14,900
into all manner of shapes and figures,

3963
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:16,300
well, then you get that boner

3964
02:37:16,300 --> 02:37:18,500
and then you get that spirit,

3965
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:22,500
that real fighting spirit in your soul

3966
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:23,660
and you become a man.

3967
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:24,620
And once you're a man,

3968
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:26,660
you can draw whatever the fuck you want.

3969
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:29,820
And if people say that it looks bad

3970
02:37:29,820 --> 02:37:31,460
or if it's a poopy drawing, you say,

3971
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:34,180
no, that's my artistic style.

3972
02:37:34,180 --> 02:37:35,500
That's my flair.

3973
02:37:35,500 --> 02:37:37,580
That's just how I draw.

3974
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:39,260
I hate that excuse.

3975
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:41,460
I don't, well, I saw the naked lady,

3976
02:37:41,460 --> 02:37:42,900
so I'm a man now.

3977
02:37:42,900 --> 02:37:43,740
So he knows,

3978
02:37:43,740 --> 02:37:45,180
I think he knows a little bit more about drawing

3979
02:37:45,180 --> 02:37:46,020
than you made.

3980
02:37:46,020 --> 02:37:47,300
She's seen the naked lady.

3981
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:49,180
I just wanna reinforce this point with,

3982
02:37:49,180 --> 02:37:51,940
okay, Uwu, so you called in, right?

3983
02:37:51,940 --> 02:37:53,220
You did a good thing.

3984
02:37:53,220 --> 02:37:55,460
You asked a question, it was a fine question.

3985
02:37:55,460 --> 02:37:57,620
We heard it and we responded.

3986
02:37:57,620 --> 02:37:58,860
You have the expertise.

3987
02:37:58,860 --> 02:38:00,500
Okay, I just wanna tell you,

3988
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:03,060
you now have one year, okay?

3989
02:38:03,060 --> 02:38:04,540
I'm not, fuck that two year thing.

3990
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:06,860
You have one year in order to,

3991
02:38:07,020 --> 02:38:09,940
Munchie just gave you the answer.

3992
02:38:09,940 --> 02:38:11,340
He gave it to you.

3993
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:12,940
Just do that.

3994
02:38:12,940 --> 02:38:13,780
Did I miss anything?

3995
02:38:13,780 --> 02:38:14,780
You did.

3996
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:17,180
This guy asked a question about recommendations

3997
02:38:17,180 --> 02:38:20,220
for how to get good at drawing in one year or two,

3998
02:38:20,220 --> 02:38:22,260
but whatever, a short amount of time.

3999
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:24,220
Munchie said, what was the name of the book again, Munchie?

4000
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:26,340
Andrew Loomis's Fun With The Pencil.

4001
02:38:26,340 --> 02:38:27,700
Fun With The Pencil, that's the one.

4002
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:32,700
I mean, there's no figure drawing for fun, right?

4003
02:38:32,900 --> 02:38:34,140
There's one called like,

4004
02:38:34,140 --> 02:38:36,140
there's one called Figure Drawing For Something.

4005
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:38,860
Figure Drawing For All It's Worth.

4006
02:38:38,860 --> 02:38:40,340
Yeah, yeah, Figure Drawing For All It's Worth

4007
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:42,700
is my pick for Loomis, but you know.

4008
02:38:42,700 --> 02:38:44,580
I've been reading all of Loomis, he's all great.

4009
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:46,060
The reason I suggest Fun With The Pencil

4010
02:38:46,060 --> 02:38:48,220
is because he takes you from such a low level.

4011
02:38:48,220 --> 02:38:49,060
Yes, that's good.

4012
02:38:49,060 --> 02:38:50,620
He takes you from the absolute beginner.

4013
02:38:50,620 --> 02:38:54,820
Yeah, Ben, didn't you literally decide

4014
02:38:54,820 --> 02:38:57,540
to get good at drawing in a year and did it?

4015
02:38:59,140 --> 02:38:59,980
Yeah. So there you go,

4016
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:02,700
just do whatever the fuck Ben does, there you go.

4017
02:39:02,700 --> 02:39:04,380
And yeah, yeah, what I did.

4018
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:06,340
I mean, don't do everything that Ben does,

4019
02:39:06,340 --> 02:39:08,980
but you know, basically do whatever the fuck Ben did.

4020
02:39:08,980 --> 02:39:11,180
I just do most of it though.

4021
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:13,580
I feel passionate about this call.

4022
02:39:13,580 --> 02:39:17,100
You, this guy was literally just given the answer.

4023
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:18,500
Just do that.

4024
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:20,460
Read, start with Munchie's book.

4025
02:39:20,460 --> 02:39:21,740
That sounds like the easiest one.

4026
02:39:21,740 --> 02:39:23,740
Literally do that one thing.

4027
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:25,540
And if you don't do it,

4028
02:39:25,540 --> 02:39:27,980
I don't wanna fucking hear you complaining

4029
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:29,380
about how hard it is to drawing.

4030
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:33,620
You should be drawing every single day for 365 days

4031
02:39:33,660 --> 02:39:35,380
in a row without stopping.

4032
02:39:35,380 --> 02:39:37,140
And if you do that, you'll be good.

4033
02:39:37,140 --> 02:39:40,140
If you don't, you'll be a fucking pissy baby piece of shit

4034
02:39:40,140 --> 02:39:42,140
and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.

4035
02:39:42,140 --> 02:39:43,340
So go fucking do it.

4036
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:47,460
I refuse for this to be some masturbatory advice bullshit.

4037
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:49,380
I will fucking gun you down in the street

4038
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:51,940
if you have not actualized in your fucking dream.

4039
02:39:51,940 --> 02:39:53,100
You fat motherfucker.

4040
02:39:53,100 --> 02:39:54,140
So go do it.

4041
02:39:55,140 --> 02:39:56,620
I will expound a little bit.

4042
02:39:56,620 --> 02:40:00,660
Like what got me like before, before I did,

4043
02:40:00,660 --> 02:40:03,460
I kinda like got, I mean, you know,

4044
02:40:03,460 --> 02:40:04,900
obviously you never stop improving,

4045
02:40:04,900 --> 02:40:09,340
but I went from like, I went from like a three to like a,

4046
02:40:09,340 --> 02:40:11,340
well, I don't wanna rank myself on how good at drawing,

4047
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:16,380
but you know, I made my big leap in maybe a year or two.

4048
02:40:16,380 --> 02:40:19,220
And yeah, like I had read Bakuman

4049
02:40:19,220 --> 02:40:21,500
and I had watched Strip Search.

4050
02:40:21,500 --> 02:40:23,340
And those two things got me really hyped

4051
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:25,260
and motivated me to learn.

4052
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:27,020
And then yeah, I read a bunch of Loomis.

4053
02:40:27,020 --> 02:40:30,140
I read some other stuff, but Loomis was the best.

4054
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:32,700
And then I watched a lot of,

4055
02:40:32,700 --> 02:40:35,660
I watched a lot of like YouTube, like drawing tutorials.

4056
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:37,180
Some were bad, some were okay.

4057
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:40,260
I used to watch a lot of psychra streams and psychra,

4058
02:40:40,260 --> 02:40:44,580
like videos that was pretty inspiring and educational.

4059
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:45,420
Yeah.

4060
02:40:45,420 --> 02:40:47,100
Do you know the YouTuber Proko?

4061
02:40:48,220 --> 02:40:49,060
No.

4062
02:40:49,060 --> 02:40:51,180
Well, someone in the audience will.

4063
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:54,460
The Proko is like an old drinking buddy

4064
02:40:54,460 --> 02:40:56,940
of my gesture drawing class teacher.

4065
02:40:56,940 --> 02:40:57,860
Like they are friends.

4066
02:40:57,860 --> 02:41:00,100
And Proko is like a big huge drawing YouTuber.

4067
02:41:00,100 --> 02:41:02,020
I was like, like, I don't know, like probably like a bunch

4068
02:41:02,020 --> 02:41:04,380
of fucking, like a million subs or something.

4069
02:41:04,380 --> 02:41:05,420
So, and that crazy.

4070
02:41:05,420 --> 02:41:06,260
Really?

4071
02:41:06,260 --> 02:41:07,100
Yeah.

4072
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:07,940
That's cool.

4073
02:41:07,940 --> 02:41:08,780
Weird.

4074
02:41:08,780 --> 02:41:09,620
You got to get in touch.

4075
02:41:09,620 --> 02:41:10,460
Yeah.

4076
02:41:10,460 --> 02:41:11,300
You got to use that connection.

4077
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:13,380
Hey, hey, I just podcast.

4078
02:41:13,380 --> 02:41:15,060
I was wondering if Proko could listen to it.

4079
02:41:15,060 --> 02:41:16,620
It's called, it's called the Procraster.

4080
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:19,140
It's called, it's called the Zit Crushing podcast.

4081
02:41:19,140 --> 02:41:19,980
I think I like it.

4082
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:20,820
What was it?

4083
02:41:20,820 --> 02:41:21,660
The Pimple Crush podcast.

4084
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:23,220
Yeah, Pimple Crush in.

4085
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:25,260
By the way, you know what?

4086
02:41:25,260 --> 02:41:27,620
I meant to say this earlier, but just,

4087
02:41:27,660 --> 02:41:30,340
I watched a Joe Rogan podcast episode

4088
02:41:30,340 --> 02:41:32,180
that I would highly recommend everyone in the world

4089
02:41:32,180 --> 02:41:35,500
listen to, featuring David Goggins.

4090
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:37,780
I think his name was first, his last name was David.

4091
02:41:37,780 --> 02:41:39,500
His last name was definitely Goggins.

4092
02:41:39,500 --> 02:41:41,260
Everyone should go listen to it.

4093
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:43,860
It's about, it's like two and a half hours long

4094
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:45,820
of this guy, Goggins.

4095
02:41:45,820 --> 02:41:48,300
He's a black Navy SEAL, which is relevant

4096
02:41:48,300 --> 02:41:51,940
because like he says very few black guys become Navy SEALs.

4097
02:41:52,940 --> 02:41:55,940
And a lot of, he says, a lot of has to do with it

4098
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:57,260
because it's so water based.

4099
02:41:57,780 --> 02:42:00,180
Is it because they can't really?

4100
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:01,300
That's really what he says himself.

4101
02:42:01,300 --> 02:42:02,780
Yes, that's what he says.

4102
02:42:02,780 --> 02:42:04,620
But the whole, the whole can't swim meme?

4103
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:05,460
He says it's real.

4104
02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:06,700
He says it's real.

4105
02:42:06,700 --> 02:42:07,980
I'm, I'm, I'm agnostic.

4106
02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:09,260
I'm just reporting the facts.

4107
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:10,100
Okay.

4108
02:42:10,100 --> 02:42:11,420
Here's, here's the point.

4109
02:42:11,420 --> 02:42:14,260
This guy tells his life story, which was like,

4110
02:42:14,260 --> 02:42:18,700
he was the most like decrepit piece of shit broken down,

4111
02:42:18,700 --> 02:42:22,060
sad, fucking, fat sack of shit in the world.

4112
02:42:22,060 --> 02:42:22,980
And now he is.

4113
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:25,180
I was down and out with the blues.

4114
02:42:25,180 --> 02:42:26,020
That was him.

4115
02:42:26,020 --> 02:42:27,340
That he got himself to the YMCA.

4116
02:42:27,340 --> 02:42:30,620
He one day, okay, this is why I love this guy so much.

4117
02:42:30,620 --> 02:42:33,700
One day he was a huge avid fan of Rocky.

4118
02:42:33,700 --> 02:42:36,100
He would watch it like every day.

4119
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:37,740
He was a huge fan.

4120
02:42:37,740 --> 02:42:38,580
Yeah.

4121
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:40,300
He's already a wise man.

4122
02:42:40,300 --> 02:42:43,380
And it was, oh, and he loved platoon.

4123
02:42:43,380 --> 02:42:46,460
He loved platoon, specifically for the scene where Elias

4124
02:42:46,460 --> 02:42:48,580
keeps getting shot in the back by the natives.

4125
02:42:48,580 --> 02:42:50,140
This is trying to run to the helicopter,

4126
02:42:50,140 --> 02:42:53,140
but he keeps getting up and keeps attempting to escape.

4127
02:42:53,180 --> 02:42:55,580
He doesn't escape, but he's fighting to,

4128
02:42:55,580 --> 02:42:56,420
even though it failed.

4129
02:42:56,420 --> 02:42:57,580
His struggle was valiant.

4130
02:42:57,580 --> 02:43:00,260
So this guy Goggins was a fat motherfucker, piece of shit.

4131
02:43:00,260 --> 02:43:02,820
And one day something snapped.

4132
02:43:02,820 --> 02:43:04,500
And he listened to the thing for the details,

4133
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:06,180
the Joe Rogan podcast, David Goggins.

4134
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:08,860
And he just decided that's it.

4135
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:11,580
He's going to now do everything he believed in.

4136
02:43:11,580 --> 02:43:12,740
And he started small.

4137
02:43:12,740 --> 02:43:14,260
He didn't do it all on day one,

4138
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:16,020
but he just fucking stuck with it.

4139
02:43:16,020 --> 02:43:18,540
And he is now one of the most hardworking,

4140
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:21,900
dedicated, driven pieces of people in the planet

4141
02:43:21,940 --> 02:43:25,540
was a supremely decorated Navy SEAL from nothing.

4142
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:28,700
Listen to the podcast.

4143
02:43:28,700 --> 02:43:29,700
It's insane.

4144
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:30,540
That's Nate.

4145
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:31,380
What?

4146
02:43:31,380 --> 02:43:32,940
That story's a little light on the details.

4147
02:43:32,940 --> 02:43:34,140
Okay, it is.

4148
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:35,500
Because I don't want to waste everybody's time.

4149
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:36,580
They really should go listen to it.

4150
02:43:36,580 --> 02:43:37,420
Yeah, okay.

4151
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:39,740
The point was he had been abused by his dad.

4152
02:43:39,740 --> 02:43:41,380
He had incredibly low self-esteem.

4153
02:43:41,380 --> 02:43:44,140
He literally faked having confidence

4154
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:45,980
and being like a capable human being.

4155
02:43:45,980 --> 02:43:47,340
He was poor.

4156
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:48,180
Well, don't we all.

4157
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:49,220
Indeed, he was poor.

4158
02:43:49,220 --> 02:43:50,780
He had no money.

4159
02:43:50,780 --> 02:43:51,900
He lived with his mom.

4160
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:53,260
He would go home and cry

4161
02:43:53,260 --> 02:43:54,500
about how sad he was about his life.

4162
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:57,100
He had extreme social anxiety.

4163
02:43:57,100 --> 02:43:59,140
But then one day, I forget,

4164
02:43:59,140 --> 02:44:00,260
I don't remember what it was,

4165
02:44:00,260 --> 02:44:02,260
but just something changed in his mind.

4166
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:05,860
And he began to think about, wouldn't it be crazy

4167
02:44:05,860 --> 02:44:09,220
if I, me, this huge loser, he was an exterminator.

4168
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:11,220
He just quit his job when he realized this.

4169
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:12,060
How old was he?

4170
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:13,140
What?

4171
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:13,980
How old was he?

4172
02:44:13,980 --> 02:44:16,420
He was 24, I think at the time.

4173
02:44:16,420 --> 02:44:17,980
I think he was 24.

4174
02:44:17,980 --> 02:44:19,380
So not so, he might have been 22.

4175
02:44:19,380 --> 02:44:20,220
I could be wrong about that.

4176
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:21,580
He was around that age, though.

4177
02:44:21,580 --> 02:44:23,940
And he just decided,

4178
02:44:23,940 --> 02:44:26,220
he had always wanted to be a Navy Seal

4179
02:44:26,220 --> 02:44:27,780
and then he just decided to do it.

4180
02:44:27,780 --> 02:44:31,020
And he is now like an insane ultra marathon runner.

4181
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:33,660
He is the world record holder for pull-ups,

4182
02:44:33,660 --> 02:44:38,020
having done 4,060 or something in 24-hour period.

4183
02:44:38,020 --> 02:44:38,860
Oh my God.

4184
02:44:38,860 --> 02:44:39,700
Oh my God.

4185
02:44:39,700 --> 02:44:41,300
He is an ultra marathon runner.

4186
02:44:41,300 --> 02:44:45,180
He ran over 100 miles in 17 hours

4187
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:46,660
when he was starting out.

4188
02:44:48,100 --> 02:44:50,060
He's just an insane guy.

4189
02:44:50,060 --> 02:44:52,300
And when I just think about all the people

4190
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:53,140
out there in the world.

4191
02:44:53,140 --> 02:44:54,940
Wait, is he not, is he not a Kenyan?

4192
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:57,420
No, he's an American, he's American.

4193
02:44:57,420 --> 02:44:58,260
That's so weird.

4194
02:44:58,260 --> 02:44:59,620
There's like, cause there's like that one,

4195
02:44:59,620 --> 02:45:02,620
there's like that one tribe of people in Kenya

4196
02:45:02,620 --> 02:45:06,340
who are like disproportionately like the best marathon runners.

4197
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:08,180
And I was like, I was sure that the world record holder

4198
02:45:08,180 --> 02:45:09,860
for marathon running would be one of those guys.

4199
02:45:09,860 --> 02:45:10,860
Nope.

4200
02:45:10,860 --> 02:45:11,820
Based on what he said,

4201
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:14,860
seems like ultra marathon running is honestly more question

4202
02:45:14,860 --> 02:45:18,380
of pain tolerance than anything else.

4203
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:20,340
And patience, and patience.

4204
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:22,180
And a lot of people just don't have that.

4205
02:45:22,180 --> 02:45:25,180
So the point is just like when I hear this question

4206
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:28,180
about like, how can I get better or something?

4207
02:45:28,180 --> 02:45:31,100
And there's an answer given immediately.

4208
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:34,060
I've just, this is why I'm literally starting,

4209
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:36,880
what is it, Reduwe, run every day until I'm hot

4210
02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:39,940
because I listen to this podcast and I'm not going to stop.

4211
02:45:39,940 --> 02:45:42,940
When people have the solution and they don't do it,

4212
02:45:42,940 --> 02:45:45,200
they're worthless and they deserve death.

4213
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:46,900
But when they capitalize on it,

4214
02:45:46,940 --> 02:45:49,660
that is when I respect them and they are good.

4215
02:45:49,660 --> 02:45:52,660
So do that and listen to that fucking podcast.

4216
02:45:52,660 --> 02:45:54,000
We'll put a link in the show notes.

4217
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,260
Everyone should listen to it.

4218
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:57,100
It's great.

4219
02:45:57,100 --> 02:45:57,940
It's good.

4220
02:45:57,940 --> 02:45:58,780
I like it.

4221
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:01,540
And also draw every day.

4222
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:04,500
Back to, I forgot to mention as I was saying how I got good.

4223
02:46:04,500 --> 02:46:06,580
Also, I drew every day for a long time.

4224
02:46:06,580 --> 02:46:07,420
Great.

4225
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:08,260
That was also part of it.

4226
02:46:08,260 --> 02:46:09,100
Okay, moving on to the next one.

4227
02:46:09,100 --> 02:46:09,940
Oh, and finish thing.

4228
02:46:09,940 --> 02:46:10,780
This is from-

4229
02:46:10,780 --> 02:46:11,780
Don't just do sketches.

4230
02:46:11,780 --> 02:46:12,780
Don't just do sketches.

4231
02:46:12,780 --> 02:46:14,240
Like yeah, do a gesture drawing,

4232
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:16,500
but then like finish it on top of it.

4233
02:46:16,540 --> 02:46:19,340
Because every stage of the drawing process

4234
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:21,540
is its own skill set and you need to practice them all.

4235
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:22,380
Makes sense.

4236
02:46:22,380 --> 02:46:23,900
And also finishing things in general.

4237
02:46:23,900 --> 02:46:25,860
Finishing things is a skill in and of itself

4238
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:27,500
that should be trained like a muscle.

4239
02:46:27,500 --> 02:46:28,500
Man, that's so true.

4240
02:46:28,500 --> 02:46:29,460
That's an important one.

4241
02:46:29,460 --> 02:46:30,500
Yeah.

4242
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:33,340
Next call, relevant, is from I hate myself a lot.

4243
02:46:33,340 --> 02:46:35,500
Let's see what he's got for us.

4244
02:46:35,500 --> 02:46:36,680
Okay, choose one.

4245
02:46:36,680 --> 02:46:39,140
Either everyone you try to communicate with

4246
02:46:39,140 --> 02:46:43,020
doesn't understand you or people just inexplicably hate you.

4247
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:44,260
What you choose and why.

4248
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:46,060
Both of those are already my life.

4249
02:46:47,500 --> 02:46:48,580
Both of those-

4250
02:46:48,580 --> 02:46:49,420
Wait, that got cut off.

4251
02:46:49,420 --> 02:46:51,220
My life is already both of those things.

4252
02:46:51,220 --> 02:46:53,740
Hmm.

4253
02:46:53,740 --> 02:46:57,240
So it's a choice between no one understands you

4254
02:46:57,240 --> 02:46:59,960
or everyone hates you.

4255
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:04,860
Is there the ability to recover from everyone hating me?

4256
02:47:04,860 --> 02:47:06,680
Or is that set in stone?

4257
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:07,780
I think this is permanent.

4258
02:47:07,780 --> 02:47:08,620
Well then why?

4259
02:47:08,620 --> 02:47:09,460
Okay.

4260
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:10,780
I think these are just your conditions.

4261
02:47:10,780 --> 02:47:12,180
That first option.

4262
02:47:12,180 --> 02:47:14,200
Okay, I guess if you can communicate with people,

4263
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:16,380
they still might be willing to do things for you

4264
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:19,140
for example, sell you food even if they hate you

4265
02:47:19,140 --> 02:47:20,740
so you might not starve.

4266
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:22,180
But if everyone hates you,

4267
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:24,220
then they might just let you die in the streets.

4268
02:47:24,220 --> 02:47:28,700
So, you know, maybe I'd probably go with the first one,

4269
02:47:28,700 --> 02:47:30,420
I guess, I don't know.

4270
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:35,420
I mean, you could probably figure out a way

4271
02:47:35,820 --> 02:47:37,740
to have people like you,

4272
02:47:37,740 --> 02:47:39,300
even though they don't understand you.

4273
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:41,980
Like, oh, who's that guy?

4274
02:47:41,980 --> 02:47:46,340
He was like emperor so-and-so in San Francisco.

4275
02:47:47,180 --> 02:47:48,500
I know what you're talking about.

4276
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:51,820
He was an insane person who was like,

4277
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:53,780
I think he was trying to be president for a while

4278
02:47:53,780 --> 02:47:55,140
and then moved on to emperor.

4279
02:47:55,140 --> 02:47:55,980
I know you're talking about it.

4280
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:58,740
Okay, no, he was like a emperor,

4281
02:47:58,740 --> 02:48:00,100
his name was Emperor Norton.

4282
02:48:00,100 --> 02:48:03,100
Yeah, Joshua Norton in San Francisco.

4283
02:48:03,100 --> 02:48:06,460
He was like a kind of rich guy,

4284
02:48:06,460 --> 02:48:10,500
like a stock trader or something or like a rice trader.

4285
02:48:10,500 --> 02:48:13,500
And he lost all his money, basically lost it,

4286
02:48:13,500 --> 02:48:15,060
dressed up in a military uniform

4287
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:17,260
and stalked around the streets of San Francisco

4288
02:48:17,260 --> 02:48:18,340
for the rest of his life,

4289
02:48:18,340 --> 02:48:20,260
claiming to be the emperor of America.

4290
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:23,740
And everyone loved him and he was great.

4291
02:48:23,740 --> 02:48:24,580
So like-

4292
02:48:24,580 --> 02:48:25,780
Emperor denied his throne.

4293
02:48:25,780 --> 02:48:26,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4294
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:29,260
You know, people would pay him quote unquote taxes

4295
02:48:29,260 --> 02:48:31,980
if they saw him in the street, you know?

4296
02:48:31,980 --> 02:48:33,780
Like they made dolls of him.

4297
02:48:33,780 --> 02:48:35,700
He printed his own money,

4298
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:37,740
which some people actually accepted

4299
02:48:37,740 --> 02:48:39,340
in the San Francisco area just because-

4300
02:48:39,340 --> 02:48:40,180
Damn.

4301
02:48:40,180 --> 02:48:41,860
He was like a local hero.

4302
02:48:41,860 --> 02:48:44,060
Everyone was like, man, this emperor Norton guy,

4303
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:45,860
he's the best, we love him.

4304
02:48:45,860 --> 02:48:48,980
Yeah, so that guy was insane and nobody understood him,

4305
02:48:48,980 --> 02:48:50,220
but everyone loved him.

4306
02:48:50,220 --> 02:48:53,700
So I feel like maybe you could finagle something like that

4307
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:54,540
with the first one.

4308
02:48:54,540 --> 02:48:55,900
That sounds like a clear choice in my opinion.

4309
02:48:55,900 --> 02:48:57,260
So I'm gonna go with that one.

4310
02:48:57,260 --> 02:48:58,780
I agree.

4311
02:48:58,780 --> 02:48:59,540
Yeah.

4312
02:48:59,540 --> 02:49:01,380
Okay, we've got one more call

4313
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:03,500
and this one's a special treat for everybody.

4314
02:49:03,500 --> 02:49:07,140
All right, we're once again visited by the wonder,

4315
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:11,540
the creature known only as racist forest gump.

4316
02:49:12,500 --> 02:49:15,900
Oh, here we go, here we go.

4317
02:49:15,900 --> 02:49:20,500
Janae, I'm gonna join the KKK, Janae.

4318
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:25,220
The forest you already noticed for the last week.

4319
02:49:25,220 --> 02:49:26,060
Stop.

4320
02:49:26,060 --> 02:49:28,900
It's not gonna be as funny the second time.

4321
02:49:28,900 --> 02:49:30,340
Why are you doing this?

4322
02:49:32,180 --> 02:49:36,620
But Janae, it's funny because it's racist.

4323
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:39,940
No, for us.

4324
02:49:39,940 --> 02:49:42,340
Why do you need this joke?

4325
02:49:42,340 --> 02:49:43,180
Why?

4326
02:49:44,460 --> 02:49:45,300
Why?

4327
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:53,220
Janae, it makes me feel good inside

4328
02:49:53,220 --> 02:49:56,540
when I make people laugh, who do I look up to?

4329
02:49:56,540 --> 02:49:57,380
Aw.

4330
02:49:59,380 --> 02:50:00,700
Aw.

4331
02:50:00,700 --> 02:50:02,140
Why don't you just go outside

4332
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:05,740
and get some real fucking friends, son?

4333
02:50:05,740 --> 02:50:07,740
Why don't you just do that?

4334
02:50:07,820 --> 02:50:09,140
What?

4335
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:14,140
But Janae, I'm with Tony and I got AIDS.

4336
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:19,020
I can't make friends, I got AIDS, Janae, I got AIDS.

4337
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:27,540
I wasn't here last week, so that was new to me.

4338
02:50:27,540 --> 02:50:28,380
Yeah.

4339
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:30,060
This is forest gump, a new beloved character

4340
02:50:30,060 --> 02:50:32,060
on the progressives podcast.

4341
02:50:32,060 --> 02:50:34,460
You know, I still have hope for him.

4342
02:50:34,460 --> 02:50:36,300
I think he could make some recovery here.

4343
02:50:36,300 --> 02:50:41,300
I think lots of people, lots of racist people with AIDS

4344
02:50:41,660 --> 02:50:46,420
go on to live very successful, happy lives, fulfilling also.

4345
02:50:46,420 --> 02:50:47,300
There's still hope.

4346
02:50:47,300 --> 02:50:49,740
In Trump's America, there's hope for everyone.

4347
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:55,700
Even racist forest gump can rise to the top

4348
02:50:55,700 --> 02:50:57,100
in Trump's America.

4349
02:50:58,460 --> 02:50:59,300
There's nothing to say.

4350
02:50:59,300 --> 02:51:01,300
Let's just wrap it up there, everybody.

4351
02:51:02,220 --> 02:51:03,060
Are we done?

4352
02:51:03,060 --> 02:51:04,060
That was the last one.

4353
02:51:04,100 --> 02:51:05,580
This is a racist forest gump,

4354
02:51:05,580 --> 02:51:07,140
the last note we're going out on.

4355
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:07,980
He's the headline for this podcast.

4356
02:51:07,980 --> 02:51:09,300
Yeah.

4357
02:51:09,300 --> 02:51:10,140
All right, cool.

4358
02:51:10,140 --> 02:51:12,020
Well, thanks for being here, everybody.

4359
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:16,220
Patreon.com slash The Procrastinator's podcast.

4360
02:51:16,220 --> 02:51:19,500
Bonus episodes, there's 19, 20th coming pretty soon,

4361
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:22,420
and the next one's gonna be pretty good, what I suspect.

4362
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:23,420
I thought it was just Patreon.

4363
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:24,620
Oh, the bonus one?

4364
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:27,580
I thought it was just Patreon.com slash The Procrastinator's.

4365
02:51:27,580 --> 02:51:29,380
Did we add podcasts at the end?

4366
02:51:29,380 --> 02:51:30,860
Okay, you're right, there is no podcast.

4367
02:51:30,860 --> 02:51:33,140
It's just The Procrastinator's, I fucked it up.

4368
02:51:33,180 --> 02:51:35,100
Oh, you fool, you just cost us millions.

4369
02:51:35,100 --> 02:51:36,220
I just cost us everything.

4370
02:51:36,220 --> 02:51:38,540
Everyone thought that there'd been an update,

4371
02:51:38,540 --> 02:51:42,140
so they unpleased, and then repledge to that one.

4372
02:51:42,140 --> 02:51:45,260
We just lost the big account because of you.

4373
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:46,860
No, we...

4374
02:51:46,860 --> 02:51:48,860
We gotta get back the big account,

4375
02:51:48,860 --> 02:51:49,860
or the boss is gonna,

4376
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:52,100
this is a million dollar deal is going down.

4377
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:54,740
Well, go to, pay a Twitch.

4378
02:51:54,740 --> 02:51:56,620
No, wait, I meant Twitter, Twitter.

4379
02:51:56,620 --> 02:52:01,620
At TPCrastinator's, you can send us your Bitcoin wallet key,

4380
02:52:02,380 --> 02:52:04,260
so we can get in there, please do that,

4381
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:08,340
so we can remake these costs of living that we just lost.

4382
02:52:08,340 --> 02:52:10,180
And I guess that's it.

4383
02:52:10,180 --> 02:52:12,620
Patreon.com slash The Procrastinator's,

4384
02:52:12,620 --> 02:52:13,980
that's the real deal.

4385
02:52:13,980 --> 02:52:16,820
Give us your money, enjoy listening to the show every week.

4386
02:52:16,820 --> 02:52:20,700
The next bonus episode was my idea.

4387
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:22,900
Actually, the next two bonus episodes were my idea,

4388
02:52:22,900 --> 02:52:24,780
and they're both genius.

4389
02:52:24,780 --> 02:52:25,820
They actually are both great.

4390
02:52:25,820 --> 02:52:27,540
We're trying to up our game,

4391
02:52:27,540 --> 02:52:29,860
and I think we got some good stuff coming.

4392
02:52:29,860 --> 02:52:30,700
Yeah, yeah.

4393
02:52:30,780 --> 02:52:32,860
Well, that said, we'll see you next week, people.

4394
02:52:32,860 --> 02:52:33,700
Thanks for being here.

4395
02:52:33,700 --> 02:52:35,020
Have a wonderful time,

4396
02:52:35,020 --> 02:52:38,420
and hopefully this came out at 2 p.m. when it's supposed to.

4397
02:52:38,420 --> 02:52:39,260
Bye.

4398
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:40,100
Good bye.

4399
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:40,940
Good bye.

4400
02:52:40,940 --> 02:52:42,620
Last week, they were like, I crave more PCP.

4401
02:52:42,620 --> 02:52:43,460
Anyway, goodbye.

4402
02:52:43,460 --> 02:52:44,300
Yes, also bye.

4403
02:52:44,300 --> 02:52:49,300
I'm supposed to be working right now.

4404
02:52:49,420 --> 02:52:54,420
I'm supposed to be working right now.

4405
02:52:55,100 --> 02:53:00,100
But I'm not working, I'm doing nothing.

4406
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:05,460
My dick, I'm jerking, myself, I'm sucking.

4407
02:53:05,820 --> 02:53:10,820
I am an asshole, I am a stupid.

4408
02:53:11,140 --> 02:53:16,140
I've got a deadline, don't wanna do it.
