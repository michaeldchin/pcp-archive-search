1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,740
That son of a bitch.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,740
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,740
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,740
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,740
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,740
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,740
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,740
Son of a bitch.

10
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,740
Son of a bitch.

11
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,740
Son of a bitch.

12
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

13
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,980
It is me, Ben Saint, and Simsie.

14
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,980
No, it isn't.

15
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,980
It's me, Oblivionfall.

16
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,980
How's it going?

17
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,980
Okay, do it.

18
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:29,860
Do the Oblivionfall impression, but say something with a TH sound in it.

19
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:41,400
You can make it an F. No, I literally couldn't think of a single word that had a TH in it.

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
There aren't any.

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
It's a trick question.

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Something.

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,400
I need to go do something.

24
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,600
Does he do that?

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Does he do what?

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Does he do the THF thing?

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Yeah, a little bit.

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Okay.

29
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,100
Subscribe to Oblivionfall's Patreon, everybody.

30
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Sorry, Oblivionfall.

31
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,600
Everybody critique Oblivionfall while he isn't around.

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,100
Never do that.

33
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,600
Yeah.

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,060
The reason why I said, oh my god, and then went silent, and then said fuck softly before

35
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,060
we started recording.

36
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,060
That did alarm me.

37
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,660
That did make me quite frightened.

38
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:25,920
Well, I was tense because there's a fly in my room, and it is a particularly annoying

39
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,140
one that I have failed to kill for like an entire day now.

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,260
He will not land anywhere.

41
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,260
He just won't do it, and I keep losing track of him.

42
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,660
And usually it doesn't take me this long to kill one, but he landed on my gallon jug

43
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:50,820
with my excess slime in it, and I was like, oh my god, I was going to whack him while

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,580
he was on the cap, but he took off again.

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,040
Mal, maybe one day you'll find him.

46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,440
He, he, this is the worst fly ever because he won't land, but he keeps like buzzing my

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
face.

48
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,040
He keeps buzzing like right across my face and in my ear, and like flies usually don't

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
do that.

50
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,960
Mosquitoes tend to do that more, but he is like aggressive and evasive, and he's big

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
too.

52
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
He's not even like a small one.

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,880
He's like a, he's like a good sized house fly.

54
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,940
He's one of the fat, juicy fuckers that buzz around.

55
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,780
He's not like the biggest, but he's, he's, he's big-ish.

56
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,980
He's house fly size.

57
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,580
He's not like one of the little ones.

58
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,820
I've mostly had moths recently, yeah, because of the heat wave means that I kept my window

59
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,540
open at night to try and actually cool down my room for once, and it would just meant

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,540
a million moths got in.

61
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,140
So there are about 40 dead moths on my windowsill, and then I think a bunch of spiders got

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
in as well.

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,920
So there's spiders in my corners.

64
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,600
There's one I can see right now just above my bed.

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,120
There's one in the lamp shade of my little desktop lamp who's built perfect spider web.

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,840
Yeah, I live in a spider hole.

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,640
Well now I don't feel quite so bad.

68
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,360
Oh yeah, that's all right.

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,600
I mentioned, I mentioned there were fruit flies in my kitchen.

70
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,000
There's have been reduced somewhat because I finally took my garbage out.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,360
So you know, I'm thinking little, taking baby steps.

72
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,580
Mine was more of a migration more than an infestation, I think, because I just sort of left the way

73
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,580
open for them.

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,820
I haven't dealt with them yet.

75
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:37,740
Did I describe the most disgusting thing that I saw in my kitchen a while ago?

76
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,980
It was a...

77
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,220
Was it the coffee thing?

78
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,260
No, no, no.

79
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,380
It was more recent than that.

80
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,580
That was a while ago, like when I moved.

81
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,580
This was...

82
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:56,400
Okay, I mean someone had, you know, we had mice, so someone laid a mouse trap, a glue trap.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,720
They laid it in the crevice between the fridge and the counter, which has like a couple,

84
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
like two inches of space there, which is just wide enough for it to set a glue trap.

85
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,600
And it did catch a mouse.

86
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,560
And you could see it like, you know, it wasn't really under anything.

87
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,800
You could pretty much see it just if you looked in between those.

88
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,740
It was easy to see.

89
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:24,460
The mouse got caught in the glue trap, laid there and died.

90
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,660
This fly is buzzing right in my face again.

91
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,660
I don't...

92
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,660
This one...

93
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,060
Why does he...

94
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,060
Most of them don't, like, come at me.

95
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,780
This one, like, comes at me and yet and never lands.

96
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,860
And I'm so angry.

97
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,860
I'm so fucking mad at him.

98
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,980
What did I do?

99
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,020
What did I do to be punished like this?

100
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,360
You do not have Febreze that you can use to murder him or something like that.

101
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,860
What do you mean Febreze?

102
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
Like a spray?

103
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,120
Well, it stuns them and then you can kill them.

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Spraying at that...

105
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Does it?

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Yeah, usually.

107
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,080
Like, deodorant or something like that will usually, like, stun a creepy crawly and make

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,240
him able to be assaulted by a grown man.

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,760
I wonder if I have anything like that.

110
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,760
I have, like, a sprayable sunblock.

111
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
No, that's probably not.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,100
I don't think I want to get that, like, all over my room.

113
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,500
It's more like aerosol kind of thing, yeah.

114
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Shaving cream?

115
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Probably won't do it.

116
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
It'll keep him in place.

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
If I hit him, yeah.

118
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Yeah.

119
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Um...

120
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,380
Okay, okay, but anyway, this mouse died on the glue trap and then before I noticed it,

121
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,840
he became infested with maggots and then the maggots crawled out of his body and also

122
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,120
got caught on the glue trap.

123
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,800
So the glue trap was covered not only with a dead mouse, but also with dead maggots.

124
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,240
Were there any maggots feeding on the corpse of the maggot?

125
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,080
Yeah, smaller maggots, based out of the...

126
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
It was very...

127
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
It was horrible.

128
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Yeah, that was the sound.

129
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,880
It was very gross.

130
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,380
I don't think I've ever encountered a maggot in my life.

131
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,880
I don't think I've ever had to come to terms with the fact that those exist by seeing them.

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,380
Oh my god, I got it.

133
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
You got the fly?

134
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,380
I got the fly.

135
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,380
Did you get him or if you caught him?

136
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,380
No, I killed him.

137
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,380
He's dead.

138
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,380
He's dead, okay.

139
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,380
Seriously, he's been buzzing my face since last night.

140
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,880
I had to go to sleep knowing that he was around because I just couldn't catch him.

141
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,880
He was flying near my feet like on the floor.

142
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
He wasn't landing.

143
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,580
So I picked up my writing tablet, my soft paper notebook and I laid it out flat and I threw

144
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,180
it at the ground hoping to intercept the space between it and the floor and catch him in

145
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,680
it and it worked.

146
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
It worked.

147
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,180
I just hydraulic pressed that man.

148
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,180
I've done that.

149
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,680
This is not the first time that I've killed a fly not by like whacking it when it lands

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,180
but like by throwing something at it when it is in flight.

151
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,180
It happens.

152
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,180
It can work.

153
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
You know what's perfect?

154
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,180
A slipper smack.

155
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Slippers, for some reason, some of the way the design have the perfect momentum and speed

156
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,680
to accelerate fast enough to destroy any fucking bug.

157
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,680
I have whacked a fly with a slipper before.

158
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
I have done that, yeah.

159
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,680
It's nothing that makes you feel more like a cartoon character than doing that.

160
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,680
First you feel like walking around in like a dressing counter to take off your slipper

161
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,680
and kill a bug with this slipper.

162
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,680
There is something that makes me feel more like a cartoon character than that and I did

163
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,680
it at my last house and that was no two houses ago.

164
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Was it rolled up newspaper?

165
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
No.

166
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,180
I killed a mouse with a frying pan.

167
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,180
Yes, there we go.

168
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,180
I literally did that.

169
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,180
Rolled up newspaper would be pretty good.

170
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,180
Rolling panes is another good contender.

171
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,180
But again, just like this fly, I killed that mouse not by whacking it with a held frying

172
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,180
pan but by dropping a frying pan at it on the ground.

173
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,180
You killed that little motherfucker from above.

174
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,180
What the hell?

175
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,680
You killed that little motherfucker from above my fucker, yeah.

176
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
I didn't like it.

177
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I didn't like it.

178
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Mice are, I mean, mice are kind of cute.

179
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Yeah, that's the...

180
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
It's kind of, yeah, it's a bit of a bug.

181
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,180
I mean, I don't like them living in my kitchen but they're kind of cute when you look at them

182
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,680
so it's not really fun to kill them.

183
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,680
They're just extra pets for me to keep them.

184
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,680
They like poop on the counter.

185
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,180
Ew.

186
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,180
Yeah, sometimes in the corners I find mouse poop and I'm like, well, that's not cute.

187
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,180
That cancels out any affinity I might have had.

188
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:04,180
It's pretty annoying how everything on this fucking planet needs to shit brown goo everywhere.

189
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,180
At least mouse poop is, it's almost hard to even spot, which kind of makes it worse because

190
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,180
it could be anywhere and I might not even notice it.

191
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,680
But it's very hard, dry, little like tiny little pellets, like smaller than a grain of rice.

192
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Yeah, they look like tiny little black roses, don't they?

193
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,180
Yeah, they do.

194
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,680
And so they're kind of innocuous but like when I notice them and I realize what they are,

195
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,180
I'm like, god, fucking, god damn it.

196
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,180
Those mice have been shitting on my property again.

197
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:43,180
They've been eating my scraps and then pooping them back out at me.

198
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,180
And that's just disrespectful.

199
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,180
It's not the nicest thing.

200
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,180
No.

201
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,180
No, I'm going to disagree with you.

202
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,180
I think it's the nicest thing.

203
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,180
I think it's the coolest, sweetest thing is that mice leave you little presents all over the floor.

204
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Yeah.

205
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,180
Haven't caught any more.

206
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,180
Only caught that one.

207
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,180
Only caught like two mice in these traps.

208
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,180
I know there still are some, but there are less than there were before, so that's good.

209
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:18,180
See, I can't even comprehend like killing a mouse because I've never had mouse infestation.

210
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,180
So if a mouse showed up in my room today, I would probably hide it from my family and keep it.

211
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,180
Put it in like a little cardboard box and feed it every night.

212
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,180
Yeah, at that other house two houses ago, they were a bit of an infestation in the kitchen.

213
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,180
They were really annoying and they are even worse one.

214
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,180
I would say they are a worse infestation here at this house.

215
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,180
So, yeah, I really, I never had mice as a kid.

216
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,180
I would see cartoons with a little mouse hole in the wall and be like, lol, what the fuck?

217
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Oh, Jerry kind of actually based.

218
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,180
Garfield.

219
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Garfield won't kill the mice.

220
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,180
That's funny. Garfield's lazy and fat.

221
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,180
I hate that.

222
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,180
Who wrote this unlikable fat character?

223
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,180
Was it J.K. Rowling? Right Garfield?

224
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,180
Trying to make me hate fat people?

225
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,180
By making them not kill mice?

226
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,180
Davis, I don't know.

227
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,180
J.K. Davis.

228
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,180
Blue's legend.

229
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Blue's legend J.K. Fats Rowling or Davis, whatever.

230
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,180
Right, Garfield and Dobby and Hagrid.

231
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:44,180
I was thinking about that slavery thing in Harry Potter.

232
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,180
Yeah.

233
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,180
It's fun to think about, isn't it?

234
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:57,180
As a kid, I mean, I wanted to defend myself a little bit because I like those books a lot as a kid.

235
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,180
You were on the side of slavery as a kid, you will say.

236
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,180
Well, of course. I mean, they like it.

237
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
They like it. They do like it.

238
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,180
It's in the text. If you read the text you analyze it, it says that they enjoy it.

239
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,180
There's nothing wrong with it.

240
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,180
It literally is. And as a kid, I did not connect it to any real world thing.

241
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,180
I kind of just was like, I guess these slaves, I guess they like being slaves.

242
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,180
So that's weird. That's wacky, but okay.

243
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,180
Isn't that magical and whimsical?

244
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,180
It's magical and whimsical.

245
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,180
This is a magical fantasy world where slaves love their masters.

246
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,180
Okay, it's good.

247
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,180
It's literally Pokemon. We love Pokemon.

248
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Everybody loves Pokemon because you enslave these sentient creatures and make them battleship.

249
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,180
But it's okay because they love it.

250
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Oh, no, because it lets them reach their full potential.

251
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,180
It's literally the same thing.

252
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,180
Hippocrates.

253
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:56,180
Anybody who hates Harry Potter now because of the horrible things that J.K. Rowling has written and said

254
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,180
and likes Pokemon, you are a fraught and a faker.

255
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Hippocrates. Shigeru Miyamoto.

256
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,180
Shigeru Miyamoto loves slavery and hates trans people just as much. Look at him.

257
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,180
Did you ever see like the leak from Nintendo?

258
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
I can't remember if it's like fake or not, but it was something like that.

259
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:20,180
Apparently whenever they would get people to work overtime at Nintendo, Miyamoto would walk in and say it's Mario time.

260
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,180
And then they would know that that meant they had to stay an extra four hours to crunch for a video game.

261
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,180
It's Mario time?

262
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,180
Yeah, apparently.

263
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,180
I don't remember where I saw that, but I don't think it's true, but I just thought it was funny.

264
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
I don't think I've ever heard that.

265
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,180
I think I did hear that he would like...

266
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,180
I think I did hear that he would just kind of like walk into people's cubicles and like fuck around with them.

267
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Like he would just kind of wander in and out of the office at will and just like distract people.

268
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,180
Yeah.

269
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
I can't remember who it was.

270
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,180
There were some really early like Western developers that were working at Nintendo of Japan.

271
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,180
I saw it in like a documentary on Netflix about video games.

272
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,180
It wasn't very good, but it was narrated by Charles Martinet, so I watched the whole thing.

273
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
No.

274
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:16,180
There was a bit where they were just talking about the weird attitudes that Miyamoto had where he put them in like a tiny office on the other side of the building from all the Japanese workers.

275
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,180
And he would come in and just go like, you okay?

276
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,180
And they go, yeah, and then he wouldn't look at any of the work you're doing.

277
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,180
Just leave or something like that.

278
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Oh, that's the dream.

279
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,180
It is.

280
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,180
I can't remember what they were working on, but...

281
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
Hmm.

282
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,180
Interesting.

283
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,180
Anyway, Harry Potter.

284
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,180
Yeah.

285
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
I said that in the worst way possible.

286
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:48,180
I was just thinking, I just want to say, I didn't love slavery as a kid.

287
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,180
Harry Potter didn't make me love slavery.

288
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,180
I just didn't think about it.

289
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,180
I just love slavery, but I love Harry Potter.

290
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,180
I swear, I swear, I didn't love slavery.

291
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,180
It didn't make me think, oh, slavery is based, actually.

292
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Yeah.

293
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,180
I would say that I don't think Harry Potter has instilled any poor values on me.

294
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,180
I don't think so.

295
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,180
Not directly.

296
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,180
I am actually immune to propaganda.

297
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,180
So in my opinion, it just doesn't work on me.

298
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
It would simply not be influenced.

299
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,180
It's like you're a grass type being hit by a grass type move.

300
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
It just doesn't work because you always use propaganda yourself.

301
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,180
That's right.

302
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,180
You can't use stunts for.

303
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,180
At least not in generation.

304
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,180
I was going to say you can't get hurt by dragon type moves

305
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,180
because you use dragon type moves, but that's wrong, isn't it?

306
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,180
That's the opposite.

307
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,180
That's the opposite of what's true, yeah.

308
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,180
I don't fucking know Pokemon.

309
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,180
I know Hagrid.

310
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,180
I know who Hagrid is.

311
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Are you not actually familiar with the source material?

312
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,180
With Harry Potter.

313
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,180
No, no, yeah. I've read them.

314
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,180
I've read them. I've watched them. I know.

315
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,180
I haven't watched them.

316
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,180
I've watched the first four movies, I think.

317
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
See, I'm a different generation than you.

318
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,180
So I started with the movies.

319
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:22,180
I think the first Harry Potter thing I saw was the beginning of the sixth movie.

321
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,180
I watched it with my dad.

322
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,180
No, I watched the whole sixth movie with no context from any of the previous ones.

323
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,180
And then we went to Citrus and saw the seventh.

324
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,180
Then I watched all the ones previous and then we went and saw the eighth.

325
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,180
That's so funny.

326
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,180
I know.

327
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,180
I saw the first movie in theater.

328
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,180
I think I saw the first two or three.

329
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Yeah.

330
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,180
And I just got sick of them.

331
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,180
I just didn't care after a while.

332
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,180
I was scared of them as a kid, so I didn't watch any of them until

333
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
that's so funny.

334
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
Until I was like 13.

335
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,180
I was scared of fucking everything as a child.

336
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
At 13, really?

337
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,180
Yeah, I was fucking terrified.

338
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,180
I didn't fucking...

339
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,180
I think I was like year eight or year seven or something.

340
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,180
Must have been around then.

341
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,180
I mean, I was going to say, I was scared.

342
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,180
You probably never...

343
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,180
You probably did not have a Nintendo entertainment system.

344
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,180
You probably started with like the GameCube or some shit.

345
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,180
Like Spokes, even worse.

346
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,180
Yeah.

347
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:29,180
So, yeah, on the NES, there was a game called Star Tropics.

348
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,180
And there were caves, you know, to explore and battle in.

349
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,180
And some of the caves were like shaped like a skull.

350
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,180
And that scared the shit out of me.

351
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,180
The skull cave scared the shit out of me.

352
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
This was when I was like seven.

353
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,180
Six or seven or something.

354
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,180
So, I feel like I have an excuse.

355
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,180
Do you remember just like really bad like disc PC games?

356
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,180
That whole like early 2000s era of really bad ones.

357
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,180
We had the one that was like zoo vet.

358
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:10,180
And it was just like really weird like semi pixel art, semi like realistic painting things of animals.

359
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,180
And you just like dragged like needles into them and like sewed them up and stuff.

360
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Like zoo vet.

361
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,180
Yeah, I don't know.

362
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,180
Like a zoological veterinarian.

363
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,180
That kind of thing.

364
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,180
I looked up screenshots of it.

365
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,180
Is that a game?

366
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,180
I don't remember what it was called, but it was something like that.

367
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,180
There are games called zoo vet that come up when you Google it.

368
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
There's a bunch.

369
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,180
So, I'm not sure which one.

370
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,180
I'm going to have a look even though I'm scared.

371
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,180
It looked pretty bad.

372
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:52,180
My sister used to play it and I would hide behind her and cry when the monkey was being sewed back together.

373
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,180
I mean, did it show like surgery?

374
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,180
Yeah, it showed like gooey bits.

375
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,180
I think it was this.

376
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
Hang on.

377
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,180
Here's a screenshot of a lion getting shit on his asshole.

378
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,180
What?

379
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
No.

380
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,180
It was this kind of thing.

381
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,180
It was like bad 3D renders.

382
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,180
Oh, that's gross.

383
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,180
Yeah, it is.

384
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,180
I know there was one where you opened the monkey's chest and that one really upset me.

385
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Yeah, I could see how it would.

386
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
That one scared me.

387
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,180
That was an early video game scaring experience.

388
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:37,180
The whole vibe of Rayman 2 freaked me out even though I really liked it as well.

389
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
Of Rayman 2?

390
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,180
Yeah, that game's just weird and dark and strange.

391
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,180
Just the aesthetic of it really creeped me out.

392
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,180
I was a big, big pussy.

393
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
I don't think you understand.

394
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
Which one's Rayman 2?

395
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,180
Oh, the 3D one?

396
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Yeah.

397
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,180
I'm not familiar with that one.

398
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:04,180
There was a level at the end where it has a place like a fucking scary horror movie that clips the audio and it freaked shit out me.

399
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Everything was strange and French and I didn't like it.

400
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,180
I was terrified as good.

401
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,180
You know, when you say it like that, it makes sense.

402
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:18,180
I was scared of Hieronymus Bosch paintings as a child.

403
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,180
Those are meant to be creepy and scary and off-putting.

404
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,180
I guess it's probably not that weird.

405
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,180
What else scared me as a child?

406
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,180
To this day, I can't watch horror movies.

407
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:41,180
I don't like the emotions that they deliberately set out to evoke.

408
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,180
I was obsessively, massively squeamish when I was younger, which I've sort of overcome.

409
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,180
But it would even be things like in the Star Wars prequels at the end when Anakin gets burned in lava.

410
00:20:52,180 --> 00:21:00,180
I would fucking scream and run away from the screen because I thought it was gross that his skin was coming off and was burning.

411
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
It is gross.

412
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:08,180
Yeah, but if you look at the effect, it's just a guy with black shit all over his face.

413
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,180
I mean, sure.

414
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
I was...

415
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,180
Oh fuck, I just had...

416
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:25,180
I didn't watch the Nightmare Before Christmas until I was in high school because I thought it looked creepy and scary.

417
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:38,180
I think I saw a clip from it, maybe from a commercial where the doctor pops his head open and rubs his brain.

418
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:47,180
And there's the part where the real-world kid opens the present that Jack left him and he pulls out a shrunken head.

419
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,180
And that scared the shit out of me.

420
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
Actually, I misremembered it.

421
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,180
I misremembered it as the kid pulls the head out of the box and the head starts screaming.

422
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:06,180
The head does not start screaming in the movie, but I imagined that it did and that thought terrified me.

423
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:15,180
Did you ever have something that creeped you out as a kid, like a movie where the whole general thing you found unsettling, but you couldn't stop watching it?

424
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,180
You were obsessed with it.

425
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,180
Something I was creeped and unsettled by.

426
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,180
But you really enjoyed it and wanted to keep revisiting it?

427
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Maybe.

428
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Think of an example off the top of my head at the moment.

429
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,180
There was a terrible live-action Pinocchio movie that we had on VHS.

430
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:45,180
And, you know, Pinocchio, it has weird shit in it like when the kids turn into donkeys and this had a particularly bad version of that.

431
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Was it live-action?

432
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
Yeah.

433
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,180
I don't know when it was made, but there we go.

434
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
There's a screenshot of that moment.

435
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,180
Oh, dear.

436
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,180
Let's see it.

437
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
No good.

438
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,180
This was something I was obsessed with as a kid.

439
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,180
I just watched that movie over and over again.

440
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,180
It's pretty weird, but I can just about manage the scary bits.

441
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,180
Even Pinocchio himself was very fucked looking.

442
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,180
It looks like a puppet.

443
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,180
He really does look like a puppet.

444
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
Oh, I've seen this.

445
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
I mean, I haven't seen this movie.

446
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,180
No, yeah.

447
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,180
I've seen this character.

448
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
It was Martin Landau.

449
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
What's his face?

450
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,180
Gepetto?

451
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,180
Gepetto, yeah, that's the one.

452
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
It's like a bolo.

453
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,180
I was always annoyed when I watched the live-action version.

454
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,180
I was like, why isn't those two guys that try and kidnap him a fox and a cat?

455
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,180
Oh, were they in the Disney version?

456
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Yeah.

457
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,180
I know I must have seen the Disney version at some point in the distant, distant past.

458
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,180
I barely remember it.

459
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,180
It's one of the ones that I watched a lot as a kid.

460
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,180
I guess I had a big Pinocchio phase.

461
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,180
I watched it in the early 2000.

462
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,180
I watched a lot of recorded episodes of Winnie the Pooh on VHS.

463
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,180
That adds up.

464
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,180
That makes a lot of sense.

465
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
Yeah.

466
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,180
More so than any particular Disney movie.

467
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Yeah.

468
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
That's good shit.

469
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Wait, there was an episode of Winnie the Pooh that creeped me out, actually.

470
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,180
There was one.

471
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,180
It was a New Adventures episode.

472
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:45,180
It's the episode where Tigger breaks a mirror,

473
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,180
and so he thinks that he'll get seven years bad luck,

474
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,180
but he, through some sort of logical gymnastics,

475
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,180
convinces everyone that no, actually,

476
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,180
technically, Piglet gets the bad luck due to some technicality

477
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,180
in how the mirror-breaking rule works.

478
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,180
So they try to protect Piglet from bad luck,

479
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
and at one point,

480
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,180
it's Tigger's thoughtlessness and his carelessness

481
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,180
that keeps inflicting terrible things on Piglet.

482
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,180
He gets what Piglet, yeah.

483
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,180
But they don't realize this, so they keep convincing him,

484
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,180
oh, it's the curse.

485
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,180
It's the bad luck.

486
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
Tigger's right.

487
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
Piglet did get the bad luck after all.

488
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,180
So at one point, they build him a safe house

489
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,180
to wait out the bad luck in,

490
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:50,180
and it's like a towering, it's like a creepy tower of rocks

491
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,180
that's long and pointy,

492
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,180
and Tigger puts a lightning rod at the top,

493
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,180
and he thinks a lightning rod is just something that attracts lightning,

494
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,180
and that that's good, and that it's more safe, actually.

495
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,180
He understands that a lightning rod is meant to prevent lightning strikes,

496
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
but he doesn't understand how it works,

497
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,180
so he just put a metal rod at the top to attract lightning lights.

498
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,180
That's so stupid.

499
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,180
And therefore, lightning strikes the safe house and explodes it.

500
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,180
And kills Piglet.

501
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,180
And kills Piglet, yeah.

502
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
And he has to go to the zoo vet.

503
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,180
Well, it explodes the house,

504
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,180
and Piglet is left sitting at the bottom of it,

505
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,180
and he's completely traumatized by the fact that his house has exploded around him,

506
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,180
and so he's just sitting there, like catatonic,

507
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,180
like staring straight ahead with his mouth twitching,

508
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,180
just going like...

509
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:53,180
And there's a shot.

510
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,180
You see him after the explosion,

511
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,180
and he's just staring straight into the camera with his mouth twitching,

512
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:07,180
and then there's a match cut to another scene where Piglet is still sitting there,

513
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,180
staring straight into the camera, mouth twitching,

514
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,180
while poo and rabbit think ponder,

515
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,180
and they walk back and forth behind him,

516
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,180
like, what to do, what to do, what are we going to do about this bad luck curse?

517
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,180
And for like a full minute, Piglet just stares straight into the camera,

518
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:30,180
catatonic, mouth twitching, and I found it very unsettling.

519
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,180
Because he just looks really, I don't know, scared.

520
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,180
I love little things like that.

521
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:41,180
And sort of like his face is kind of twisted up in a sort of rictus expression of horror.

522
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,180
There is a lot of them in like cartoons,

523
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,180
like specific little things that probably wouldn't bother anything else,

524
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
but always bothered you, you know?

525
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
Me?

526
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,180
No, no, like the royal you, you know?

527
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,180
Everybody has one little thing from like a cartoon they loved as a kid that was like,

528
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,180
I didn't like that bit.

529
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,180
I feel like I spent a long time describing that one,

530
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,180
but there was another one, there was an episode of all that.

531
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
I don't know if you're familiar with all that.

532
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
Is it sitcom?

533
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:17,180
No, it was a sketch variety comedy show for kids.

534
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,180
It was on, not SNCC.

535
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Yeah, SNCC was like the Saturday night like Nickelodeon block

536
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,180
for like marginally older kids, maybe.

537
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,180
It's the cooler, hipper one.

538
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,180
A little bit, yeah.

539
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,180
But all that, you know, it had like, it had Keenan and Kel in it,

540
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,180
and Amanda, Amanda Bynes.

541
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,180
Is it, you know, the all that diaspora is extensive.

542
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
The big names, you know.

543
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,180
The big names, yeah, yeah, the big names.

544
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Lori, everyone, who could forget Lori Beth Dinberg?

545
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,180
I certainly didn't.

546
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
Yeah.

547
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Whatever happened to her?

548
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,180
Anyway, there was an, I think it was a Halloween episode,

549
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,180
and there was a skit in which Amanda Bynes

550
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,180
brings her like monster pet to class for like show and tell,

551
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,180
and it's this big fucking like, it's this big fucking,

552
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,180
I don't know how to describe it, it's a big like furry like beast,

553
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,180
like horned beast that she keeps on like a leash,

554
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,180
and she brings it to class and she's like describing it for show and tell.

555
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,180
And she's, the camera sort of focuses on her as she's like show and tell,

556
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,180
describing things she does with her beast companion.

557
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,180
And meanwhile, the beast is like mauling and killing the other students.

558
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:49,180
And they, and like, they're like severed limbs are like flying like on screen

559
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,180
from off camera, from where it is dismembering people.

560
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,180
And they don't, there's no blood, they use like green slime for blood.

561
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,180
Like these limbs and stuff are like flying on camera,

562
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,180
and they're like, and they're like green on the stumps where they've been severed,

563
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,180
and they're like oozing like green goo.

564
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,180
Just have a significant impact on you.

565
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,180
And it just goes on, it just goes on and on,

566
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,180
like kind of the point of the scene is how it goes on for a really long time,

567
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,180
and everyone's like, hey, we're being mauled to death,

568
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,180
and the teacher's just like, don't be rude, don't interrupt,

569
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
and it just goes on and on until they've all been killed.

570
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,180
That seems like a forgotten like Treehouse of Horror Simpsons.

571
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,180
It's scary, you know?

572
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,180
And it's scared the fuck out of me as a kid.

573
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,180
Yeah, when I describe it.

574
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,180
But that's exactly what happened.

575
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,180
And it upset me a lot, I think.

576
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,180
I think my parents got kind of annoyed at it,

577
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,180
because like it really like disturbed us children at the time.

578
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,180
We were like, we don't want to go to sleep because we're afraid.

579
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,180
We're afraid that the big purple monster is going to kill us.

580
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,180
He was not purple.

581
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
He was brown.

582
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,180
I'm just imagining the big fucking thing from Foster's home for imaginary kids.

583
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,180
Yeah.

584
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,180
There's like a big purple guy with horns,

585
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,180
and that's all that's popped into my head.

586
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:20,180
He looks sort of like a cross between like beauty and the beast beast

587
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
and like the father-dook.

588
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,180
That's a good combo.

589
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,180
He was a horned monster of some kind.

590
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
He was a villain.

591
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
That's all we need to say.

592
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,180
Yeah, yeah.

593
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:40,180
Okay, that was another time a children's media scared me, a child.

594
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,180
See, I was much easier to scare.

595
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:48,180
Remember the episode of Spongebob where they're looking after a caterpillar butterfly thing?

596
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,180
And then it shows a close-up of the butterfly's face.

597
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,180
I vaguely remember that episode.

598
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:01,180
That was enough to scare me as a kid when it cut the realistic live-action high-close-up footage of a bug's face.

599
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,180
Just like an actual video of a bug.

600
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,180
Yeah, it would just like cut and it would be filling like the entire screen,

601
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
and it would just be really loud.

602
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
They are gross.

603
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,180
Yeah, they are.

604
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,180
Bugs are gross.

605
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,180
They are gross when, like, yeah, butterflies look nice from a distance,

606
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,180
but you look at their face and they're just as disgusting as any other crawling insect.

607
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,180
They got that cute nose, though.

608
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
The proboscis.

609
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,180
Yeah, the big curly nose friend.

610
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,180
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

611
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
Still.

612
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,180
That has good energy to it. I like that.

613
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,180
Yeah, sure.

614
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,180
The evil demon eyes.

615
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
So I still wouldn't...

616
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,180
Not so keen on them.

617
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,180
Demon eyes.

618
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,180
I still wouldn't...

619
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,180
I wouldn't want one to land on me.

620
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
It's still a little gross.

621
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Yeah, I didn't think I would want any bug to land on me, and I don't know why.

622
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,180
No, I wouldn't either.

623
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,180
The wings are nice, but their body is still a nasty bug.

624
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,180
Maybe a dragonfly.

625
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,180
Oh, yeah, I mean...

626
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:59,180
I think dragonflies are cool-looking, but still.

627
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,180
They got that big, fat tail which makes them look less like a bug,

628
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:07,180
because most bugs just sort of end or go lumpy at the end, you know?

629
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

630
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
It makes them a little...

631
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,180
I guess that's why they're called dragonflies.

632
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,180
It makes them a little bit more like other animal king to me.

633
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
I don't know.

634
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
Yeah.

635
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
Still.

636
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,180
Still.

637
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,180
Their head and body is buggy.

638
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,180
A nightmare.

639
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,180
Yeah, that's true.

640
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,180
A nightmare bug creature.

641
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Yeah.

642
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
Yeah.

643
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Wormpool.

644
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Would you let a wormpool crawl up on your shoulder?

645
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Here's the thing.

646
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:42,180
I am a genius, and therefore I'm psychic type, and therefore I'm weak to bugs.

647
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,180
Oh, okay.

648
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,180
So...

649
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,180
No, it would kill me.

650
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,180
It would kill me instantly.

651
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
No, I would die.

652
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
I would simply die, my friend.

653
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
No, I hate...

654
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,180
Actually, no, I hate caterpillars.

655
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,180
I hate caterpillars maybe the most of any bug.

656
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Worms and caterpillars are the worst, and I like them.

657
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:03,180
So I think if a wormpool was real, it would make me throw up if I saw one in real life.

658
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Yeah.

659
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:11,180
I'm not big on centipedes, but caterpillars and worms don't really bother me.

660
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,180
I don't like how squishy they are.

661
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
I kind of like that.

662
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
They're little guys.

663
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,180
They're little fatties, you know?

664
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Yeah.

665
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,180
Yeah.

666
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,180
I have dreams with worms in them sometimes.

667
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,180
It's like a kind of a recurring...

668
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,180
It's kind of a recurring thing.

669
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,180
That sentence wasn't enough to make me laugh, then.

670
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,180
I have dreams with worms in them sometimes.

671
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
I do have worm dreams.

672
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,180
Occasionally, I'll have a worm dream.

673
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
And it's always...

674
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:43,180
I'm never as disgusted in the dream as like I should be, and I'll wake up and be like

675
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,180
retroactively disgusted like, oh, God.

676
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,180
No, yeah.

677
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
That's the way with dreams.

678
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:54,180
Your emotions are always like half of what they would be if this thing happened.

679
00:34:54,180 --> 00:35:00,180
Sometimes I'll be really angry in a dream.

680
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,180
I'll be screaming, and then I'll wake up.

681
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,180
And it's just the next moment, but I'll just be like, huh, yeah.

682
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,180
I was really mad.

683
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,180
I find that dreamy has a lot of passivity to him.

684
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,180
I remember there was one dream where I can't remember how it happened.

685
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,180
For some reason, my entire genital area was gouged out and was just a big bleeding,

686
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,180
fucking gaping cannonball wound, basically.

687
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,180
And I was lying in hospital and talking to someone.

688
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,180
I was like, it is what it is.

689
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,180
Things happen.

690
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,180
What's the Japanese?

691
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,180
What's the Japanese?

692
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,180
It is what it is.

693
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,180
I have no idea.

694
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,180
What the fuck do you think I am?

695
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:47,180
It's a common phrase you hear in anime and stuff.

696
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,180
Konnichiwa.

697
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,180
Shogunai.

698
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Shogunai.

699
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,180
It can't be helped.

700
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,180
That's so good.

701
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
Shogunai.

702
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,180
That's what I said.

703
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
You look down.

704
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,180
You've been bifurcated, bisected at the midst of Shogunai.

705
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,180
It is what it is.

706
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,180
These things happen, I guess.

707
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
It's always shit like that.

708
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,180
I had a dream in high school where I was in a zombie apocalypse

709
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,180
and I was with the girl I had a crush on.

710
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,180
And I was like, don't worry.

711
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
We'll make it through this.

712
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
We'll rebuild the world.

713
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,180
Stuff like that.

714
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,180
For some reason, dream me seems to be a wise, sage-ly, completely calm.

715
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,180
Just not sweating it that much.

716
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
Just not worried about it.

717
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,180
Yeah, basically.

718
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,180
In a situation like that, you got to step up.

719
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:46,180
You got to calmly analyze the situation.

720
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,180
And just like, all right, here's what we're going to do.

721
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,180
You're going to put the plow on the front of our Mack truck

722
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,180
and we're going to drive through this parking lot.

723
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,180
Well, you kill literally everyone you meet.

724
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,180
Be they human or Zomboni or whatever.

725
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,180
Sure.

726
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Yeah.

727
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,180
Is that what happens in The Last of Us?

728
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,180
I don't remember.

729
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,180
I haven't played The Last of Us.

730
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,180
I played it for the first time recently.

731
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,180
There are bandits.

732
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,180
There are bandits that you do have to kill in The Last of Us.

733
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,180
Yes, that's true.

734
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,180
I believe the backstory of the main character is that

735
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,180
during the 20 years of the zombie apocalypse, he would do anything.

736
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,180
So he would just kill like everybody he came across.

737
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,180
Engaged in some light banditry.

738
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,180
And then he meets the girl and says,

739
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,180
oh, what if I can be daddy again?

740
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,180
And then he becomes daddy again.

741
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,180
What a beautiful story.

742
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,180
Beautiful.

743
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,180
Actually, I only know the story of it because I've seen

744
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,180
the action button review.

745
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,180
Yeah.

746
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,180
Oh, I haven't seen that one.

747
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,180
Now that I've played it, I could watch that one.

748
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,180
Oh, you have.

749
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,180
I've seen all the action button reviews.

750
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,180
What was it?

751
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,180
That's a pretty good one.

752
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,180
I was drawing and I had like Matthew Matosis and Noah Coldwell

753
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,180
in the background.

754
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,180
And I got all of their Last of Us videos in a row.

755
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,180
And I was like...

756
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,180
Were they just auto like recommended?

757
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
Yeah.

758
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,180
So I think I was watching like a Metroid one and then it went

759
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,180
to Matthew Matosis's Last of Us one, which came out in like 2014.

760
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,180
So it was like really weird and tearing him back then.

761
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,180
His old videos have held up really well, though.

762
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
Who? Matthew Matosis?

763
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
Yeah.

764
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,180
They're exactly the same except the mic quality is a bit different

765
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,180
and he's a bit higher pitch.

766
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,180
Yeah, but he said the N word that one time.

767
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,180
Oh yeah, he did.

768
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,180
Yeah, true.

769
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
We can't.

770
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
We can't.

771
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
You can't condone him.

772
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,180
He said it in an Irish accent though, so it doesn't count.

773
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
Yeah, it's true.

774
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
That's true.

775
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,180
I mean, Irish people were also called that.

776
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,180
Yeah, I completely forgot about that.

777
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,180
I've never rewatched that review because I don't care about Bioshock.

778
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,180
I like that review because I hate Bioshock Infinite.

779
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,180
And he also hates it.

780
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,180
I mean, a lot of people hate it.

781
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,180
I played it and thought it was bad, but I don't particularly hate it.

782
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,180
But I have never played a single other Bioshock game.

783
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,180
I watched Nate play it and I thought, okay.

784
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:18,180
And then upon thinking about it more later and hearing more people talk about it,

785
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,180
I kind of realized that it's pretty despicable actually.

786
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Yeah.

787
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
It do suck.

788
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,180
I would say it do suck as a game.

789
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Yeah, I would say so.

790
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,180
As a game.

791
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,180
As a gamer.

792
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,180
It sucks as a game and it sucks as a piece of gaming culture.

793
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,180
It's like a regressive sort of damaging piece of media.

794
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,180
That game has such a huge fan, but that game specifically, Bioshock Infinite,

795
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,180
people fucking love that game.

796
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,180
I know so many people that stand by it.

797
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:56,180
I get what's appealing about it.

798
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,180
The setting is kind of cool.

799
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,180
It looks nice.

800
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Yeah.

801
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
That's about it.

802
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,180
Yeah, everything else about it is bad.

803
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
It's kind of bad.

804
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,180
Like the gameplay even.

805
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
As a guy.

806
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,180
I didn't actually play it myself.

807
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,180
As somebody who likes a good shoot bang and playing that game.

808
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,180
That game came out 10 years after Halo 1 and it plays excrementally worse.

809
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,180
Excrementally is a good word.

810
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,180
Combined.

811
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,180
You've combined some concepts there.

812
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,180
I definitely did not fuck up and say the wrong thing.

813
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
Move on.

814
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Bioshock Infinite suck.

815
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
Last of us pretty good.

816
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
Yeah.

817
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,180
Sure.

818
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:50,180
I mean, Tim likes last of us more than I would.

819
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,180
Yeah.

820
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,180
Tim finds some interesting things to appreciate.

821
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:02,180
I think Tim has a little bit of a sort of Gen X boomer sensibility.

822
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,180
And the things that he appreciates that I think I am a little.

823
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,180
He's a little bit, this is awesome.

824
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,180
He's, yeah, he's a little bit like, he's a little bit like, oh, 60 frames per second.

825
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
Like HD.

826
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,180
Like at high res, high res, high frame rate.

827
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,180
Like, oh, beautiful.

828
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,180
Yeah.

829
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,180
He's, he's impressed by that sort of thing.

830
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,180
I see.

831
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,180
Yeah, definitely.

832
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,180
It's like, I don't know, every single one of those fucking long form reviewers have

833
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
their thing.

834
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
I think.

835
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:36,180
Like Mathematosis seems to be mechanical complexity and solid, like actual design in

836
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,180
terms of going through the world and stuff.

837
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:44,180
No, we're called Weldovace is all about the experiential storytelling and things like

838
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,180
that.

839
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,180
And Tim Rogers is sort of this.

840
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,180
I don't know how I would describe like his like focus on when he talks about games.

841
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
He's very like tangential.

842
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:59,180
I guess that's the whole point, but you know, I don't know how I would boil it down.

843
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,180
Yeah, there's no way to boil it down.

844
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,180
You're like, maybe he's maybe focused on a game's like.

845
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,180
Reputation.

846
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,180
Yeah, it's like it's cultural.

847
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
It's cultural impact.

848
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,180
It's impact on the landscape.

849
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:21,180
It's it's he reviews games from the perspective of a gamer.

850
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,180
Looking at the landscape of games.

851
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,180
No, I don't know.

852
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,180
That's angry Joe.

853
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,180
Angry Joe does that.

854
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,180
Oh, angry Joe.

855
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,180
Oh, bless you, my friend.

856
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,180
I have not.

857
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,180
I'm not as familiar with his uvra.

858
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
He's very much.

859
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,180
That was fucking awesome.

860
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,180
Or this is fucking dog shit.

861
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
Where's the shooting?

862
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,180
I think I've seen.

863
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,180
Oh, you know what?

864
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,180
Which there's a there's a jar podcast where they compare.

865
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,180
I think they compare Doug Walker to angry Joe.

866
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,180
No, they did two separate episodes.

867
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,180
One was is the Nostalgia Criticist fringe, as they say, and is angry Joe as bad as they say?

868
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,180
Oh, yeah.

869
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,180
Right.

870
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,180
Yeah, it was two separate ones, but like they they they have a lot of like comparatively

871
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,180
positive things to say.

872
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,180
Oh, yeah.

873
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
They're very passionate people.

874
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,180
Yeah.

875
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,180
Yeah.

876
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,180
What was that thing?

877
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,180
What was that thing he did?

878
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,180
Like he like.

879
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:31,180
He said something like completely out of line to some like games journalist or like death or

880
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,180
reporter at the game.

881
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,180
But it made me stand up and clap.

882
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,180
He interviewed Jeff Keeley.

883
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:42,180
And I don't know what specific thing you're talking about, but he just made like a full

884
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,180
of himself basically by being completely unprepared.

885
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,180
No.

886
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,180
No, it wasn't that he.

887
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,180
I don't remember he.

888
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,180
I think he said you're appealing to the lowest common denominator.

889
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
Is that it?

890
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,180
Is that the one you're thinking of?

891
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,180
Your show appeals to the lowest common denominator after you've been invited.

892
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:04,180
He basically just told this guy like he sucks and like in so many words.

893
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,180
And I was like, cool.

894
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,180
I don't know.

895
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,180
I don't even know.

896
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,180
I don't even know who this guy is.

897
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,180
I didn't care.

898
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,180
But like if you think this guy sucks, it's nice that you'll just, you know, you're

899
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,180
not here to like play nice with someone that you hate.

900
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,180
Yeah.

901
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,180
If you hate someone, I respect the willingness to just tell them you fucking suck, dude.

902
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,180
Exactly.

903
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,180
You're an asshole.

904
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,180
God bless you.

905
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,180
Don't be a joke.

906
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,180
Keep it up.

907
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,180
Yeah.

908
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,180
I don't know what he's doing now, but whatever.

909
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,180
Probably reviewing video games.

910
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,180
Probably talking about is there any new video games have come out stray?

911
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,180
The cat game?

912
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,180
I saw stray.

913
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:45,180
I saw the, what do you call it?

914
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,180
Spyro mod.

915
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,180
Spyro mod.

916
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,180
It could be Spyro the Dragon.

917
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,180
Oh yeah.

918
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,180
Yeah.

919
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,180
Okay.

920
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,180
I was going to say what?

921
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,180
I saw that video.

922
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,180
I thought it looked pretty fun.

923
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,180
What is stray?

924
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,180
I'm pretty sure it's just like a short exploratory story game.

925
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,180
People were hyping it on Twitter.

926
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,180
It's a cute cat game.

927
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,180
So of course, you know.

928
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:15,180
But it's like a cat going through a post-pocalyptic world with robots and going through a story

929
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,180
and then you finish it.

930
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,180
I don't know.

931
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,180
Well, what more can you ask for?

932
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,180
From what I know, it's pretty short.

933
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,180
But I didn't play it because it would have made me sad because my cat died recently.

934
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,180
Yeah.

935
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,180
Crunchy.

936
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,180
I saw that.

937
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,180
It came out the day after Crunchy time.

938
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,180
Oh yeah.

939
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,180
Crunchy.

940
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,180
I saw, I'd seen pictures before.

941
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,180
Yeah.

942
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,180
I looked at the, just, Crunchy looked like a sweet cat.

943
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,180
He was a good, good, good boy.

944
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,180
Yeah.

945
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,180
But the heat wave genuinely killed him.

946
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,180
No.

947
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,180
It was horrible to say.

948
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,180
But he's always had like trouble with his breathing.

949
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,180
And he's had a thing with his nose where it leaks and stuff.

950
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:01,180
But the recent heat wave in the UK, he was just like lying on the ground gasping because

951
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,180
he couldn't get any breath in because it was so hot.

952
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,180
Oh no.

953
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:11,180
We took him to the vet and it was like, yeah, you can have a big expensive surgery, but

954
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:16,180
he is 17 and probably is suffering right now.

955
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,180
And we were like, yeah, it's time to say goodbye.

956
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,180
But it's all good.

957
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:29,180
Anyway, on a more positive note, Stray looks like a fun video game where you play as a

958
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,180
pretty cat.

959
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:36,180
It looked, I guess, I just, you know, just looked fun to like jump between ledges and

960
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,180
stuff and knock, knock shit over.

961
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,180
That's true.

962
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,180
Fuck around with humans who I guess are not in the game.

963
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,180
It seems like every human is like a robot.

964
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,180
Yeah.

965
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,180
I thought at first maybe that's like a stylistic thing.

966
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,180
Like the cat just sees humans as automatons.

967
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,180
But then I thought, no, maybe this is actually just said in like a post-singularity future

968
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,180
where robots are the dominant species.

969
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,180
Yes, maybe.

970
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,180
Yeah.

971
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,180
I'm not sure.

972
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,180
I have no idea.

973
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:13,180
Speaking of short games, this guy on Twitter, Fulgadrum, he added me in a thread.

974
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,180
He shouted out my game, Phantom's Revenge.

975
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,180
I saw that.

976
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,180
Well, yeah.

977
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,180
Did you look at the thread?

978
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,180
No.

979
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,180
I didn't like it.

980
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,180
I saw the post of yours and it said equally unhinged webcomic.

981
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,180
I was like completely fair, absolutely fair.

982
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,180
When I do the Kickstarter, I should market it as unhinged.

983
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,180
I think that's a good angle.

984
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,180
You could put that as a quote, like a pull quote.

985
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,180
Equally unhinged web.

986
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,180
You know what?

987
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,180
Maybe I will.

988
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,180
The finale to the equally unhinged webcomic.

989
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:50,180
Just have that in text and then put like five asterisks below it instead of five stars

990
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,180
because you can get away with that.

991
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,180
It will trick people.

992
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:01,180
Now I'm, yeah, this guy didn't give any stars, but who's to say that the five stars that

993
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:07,180
I placed in quotations underneath his quote, I didn't say they were his stars.

994
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,180
I just put them there.

995
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,180
Those aren't stars.

996
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,180
Those are asterisks and they're there for an unrelated reason.

997
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,180
They're just decoration, bro.

998
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,180
That's part of the art.

999
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,180
Oh man, on that subject.

1000
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,180
Well, I don't want to...

1001
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,180
What was the thread?

1002
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,180
Okay, yeah, on the subject of the thread.

1003
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:36,180
The thread, it's the thread about short RPGs and some of them look super awesome.

1004
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,180
They look better than your game.

1005
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,180
I mean, I wasn't going to say it like that.

1006
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,180
I mean, some of them do have like a very cool aesthetic to them.

1007
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:54,180
I'm just scrolling through these and like, there were some that stood out to me like,

1008
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,180
look at, okay, look at this shit.

1009
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:05,180
This game, I guess, is called Strife of Cosmos.

1010
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,180
I don't know what's going on here.

1011
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,180
That's pretty cool.

1012
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,180
I just think it looks awesome.

1013
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,180
It's a little brain rot.

1014
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,180
So many things on screen for me, but yeah.

1015
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,180
Exactly.

1016
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:27,180
I prefer to cut down on the aesthetic a little bit, but that does look like an RPG to me.

1017
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,180
This one looks really cool.

1018
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,180
I don't know, it's going through these threads.

1019
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,180
Some of these are like two hours long.

1020
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,180
I might actually go and play some of these.

1021
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,180
That'd be fun.

1022
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,180
Maybe on like a stream or something going through the rest of them.

1023
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,180
That'd be cool.

1024
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,180
Yeah, maybe.

1025
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,180
Wait a minute.

1026
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,180
Oh my God.

1027
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,180
This one's called Slimes.

1028
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,180
This one's called Phantom's Revenge, but it's also ugly.

1029
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,180
Oh my God.

1030
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:54,180
That sounds like an epic video game.

1031
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,180
This one's called Slimes.

1032
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,180
Well, I got to play that one.

1033
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,180
Yeah.

1034
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,180
Yeah.

1035
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:08,180
On the subject of the book, since the Unhinged Webcomic, I have been, I worked like all week.

1036
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:14,180
I basically spent like this entire week just doing shit, man.

1037
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:20,180
Just like doing work on like the format.

1038
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:28,180
Just like formatting files to fit the goddamn template this Chinese company wants me to fit

1039
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,180
to have the stupid book printed.

1040
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,180
I'm almost ready.

1041
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:36,180
I'm almost ready to print a test print.

1042
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,180
Man, I don't know.

1043
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,180
It's really bummed me out.

1044
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:45,180
I just felt like I worked like every day this week, and it feels like I'm barely closer

1045
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,180
to having it done.

1046
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,180
That's not true.

1047
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,180
I am close to having it done.

1048
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,180
The progress is slow and incremental, but you've done so much of it that you are actually

1049
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,180
doing all right.

1050
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,180
I'm almost there.

1051
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:01,180
When I get it sent off and when I send her some money and she's like, okay, thanks.

1052
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,180
You'll have the book in like three weeks.

1053
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,180
I'll be like, thank God, but I'm not quite there yet.

1054
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,180
It feels like I've worked and worked and accomplished nothing.

1055
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,180
Yeah.

1056
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:17,180
I seriously did nothing else this week.

1057
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,180
I didn't get to play any more Mega Man legends.

1058
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:24,180
I didn't get to work on that video project basically at all.

1059
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,180
I have put that...

1060
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,180
No, finish the next step of the book.

1061
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,180
Finish the next fucking book thing.

1062
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,180
Do I know what the video project is?

1063
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,180
I don't think I do.

1064
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,180
I don't think I have told you about it.

1065
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,180
Do you want to know?

1066
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,180
No, I don't.

1067
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,180
Okay, good.

1068
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,180
That's fine.

1069
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,180
I want to surprise.

1070
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,180
I need some surprises in my life.

1071
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,180
I have told...

1072
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:51,180
I think Gib might be the only person who I've straight up just told what it is.

1073
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:56,180
I think maybe one or two other people have guessed it or no.

1074
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,180
Okay.

1075
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,180
Yeah.

1076
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,180
I probably, if I thought about it, I might be able to guess it, but whatever.

1077
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,180
Perhaps, maybe.

1078
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,180
Yeah, if you're not an idiot, yeah.

1079
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,180
Ellie is our bleep that out.

1080
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,180
Oh, shit.

1081
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,180
That's not exactly it, but it's kind of...

1082
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,180
It's sort of on the...

1083
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,180
It's too close.

1084
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:21,180
Ellie is our bleep that out.

1085
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:26,180
I can't believe you're reviewing this.

1086
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,180
Bleep everything.

1087
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,180
Oh, no!

1088
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,180
No way.

1089
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,180
No, that's not...

1090
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,180
No, that's not...

1091
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,180
No, that's not...

1092
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,180
Okay, I was going to say.

1093
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,180
Okay, Ellie is our get ready to bleep a lot of stuff.

1094
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:41,180
No, I'm doing a lecture where I do...

1095
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,180
I'm doing a lecture on...

1096
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,180
Nice.

1097
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,180
Right.

1098
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,180
But no one can know.

1099
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,180
It's a secret.

1100
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,180
Okay.

1101
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,180
Is it just like a straight video to audience lecture?

1102
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,180
Are you going to...

1103
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1104
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,180
Yeah.

1105
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,180
Okay.

1106
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,180
Cool.

1107
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,180
There was a...

1108
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:04,180
I was going to do it live.

1109
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,180
I had a...

1110
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,180
I had a studio books and everything.

1111
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,180
Like, when Gib visited for...

1112
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,180
Whoa!

1113
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:19,180
Yeah, I had a whole thing set up and then Gib got COVID, so it all couldn't happen.

1114
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:24,180
So, Ellie is our bleep most everything.

1115
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,180
Cut that, cut that, cut that, cut that, cut that.

1116
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,180
Don't let them know.

1117
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,180
Don't let them know.

1118
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,180
Wow, Ben, that project sounded interesting.

1119
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,180
Thank you.

1120
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,180
I can't believe I guessed it that easily.

1121
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,180
You got it...

1122
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,180
That's 75% right.

1123
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,180
Okay.

1124
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,180
Yeah.

1125
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,180
You were close enough that I would call it correct.

1126
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,180
Sure.

1127
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,180
Anyway.

1128
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,180
That's fun.

1129
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,180
So, I think it's fun.

1130
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,180
Although, I've been working on it.

1131
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,180
I thought it was going to be kind of easy.

1132
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:58,180
I have decided to make it hard on myself, but it's okay.

1133
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,180
That's the way to do something like that.

1134
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,180
Yeah.

1135
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,180
My new goal with it...

1136
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,180
My goal has expanded so that...

1137
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,180
I think the video will just end up being longer and that's okay.

1138
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,180
Long videos are good.

1139
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,180
People like them and they do well on YouTube.

1140
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,180
So, I don't even think that's a problem.

1141
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,180
Exactly, yeah.

1142
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,180
Yeah.

1143
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,180
So, that's...

1144
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:24,180
But I didn't get to do it because I have just been doing book stuff.

1145
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,180
I hate it.

1146
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,180
I hate the stupid fucking book.

1147
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,180
It sucks.

1148
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,180
It's not even that unhinged, to be honest.

1149
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,180
Yeah, it's not unhinged enough.

1150
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,180
No, not even close.

1151
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:41,180
It's more unhinged by the context than actual what happens in it.

1152
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:47,180
You know, speaking of context, I mean, I guess Chris Chan's going to trial now.

1153
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,180
Yes.

1154
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:52,180
I thought like, hmm, I wonder if I can like...

1155
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,180
I wonder if I can use that for marketing purposes.

1156
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,180
Ben...

1157
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,180
What?

1158
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,180
We've been down this rabbit hole before.

1159
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,180
I'm in it.

1160
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,180
I'm down it.

1161
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,180
I'm at the bottom of it.

1162
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,180
Ben, do I have to be one of the people in the comments who said,

1163
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:15,180
oh, what ever happened to Prime Directive Chris Chan, Ben?

1164
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,180
Well, she can't hurt anyone anymore.

1165
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,180
That's true.

1166
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,180
I suppose.

1167
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,180
She's going away for a long time.

1168
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,180
I don't know.

1169
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:28,180
I saw Chris Chan trending because the announcement came out that the case is going to trial.

1170
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:35,180
Did you rub your hands together and then look at all your formatted phantoms revenge comics on your computer?

1171
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,180
I don't know.

1172
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:43,180
If the trial was happening and there was like news coming out about it, I don't know.

1173
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,180
Maybe it would...

1174
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,180
Maybe I could use that.

1175
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,180
How long has it been since Chris Chan was arrested?

1176
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,180
Is it a year and a half now?

1177
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,180
I don't think it's that long.

1178
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,180
Wait.

1179
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,180
I think it might be.

1180
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:04,180
Wait, when did I put out Sonichi 102?

1181
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,180
That would be good.

1182
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,180
Because that was like right after...

1183
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,180
11 months ago.

1184
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,180
Yeah, so almost a year.

1185
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,180
Okay.

1186
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,180
Yeah.

1187
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,180
I'm overestimating time.

1188
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,180
Did I have an exact date?

1189
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,180
July?

1190
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,180
On a wild ride, it's been...

1191
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,180
Yeah, I put out that video on July 31st.

1192
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,180
Wait, that was exactly a year ago today.

1193
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,180
What?

1194
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,180
Wow.

1195
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,180
Well, that video came out exactly a year ago today.

1196
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,180
That's amazing.

1197
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,180
That's funny.

1198
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,180
That was days afterwards.

1199
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,180
It was a few days afterwards, yeah.

1200
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,180
That's less than a week.

1201
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,180
We're recording on things like...

1202
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,180
That's funny.

1203
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,180
Only a paltry 200,000 views.

1204
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,180
Such a shame.

1205
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,180
Such a shame.

1206
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,180
Deserves 10 times that many.

1207
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:00,180
What's my biggest tweet got in terms of impressions?

1208
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,180
Can I ratio with that?

1209
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,180
I bet not.

1210
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:09,180
Tweets don't get 200,000 likes.

1211
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,180
Maybe impressions.

1212
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:17,180
I got 418,000 impressions on one of them.

1213
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,180
Wow.

1214
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,180
Which one was that?

1215
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,180
It was a drawing of a character from My Hero Academia

1216
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,180
that was an unfinished sketch dog shit.

1217
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:32,180
For some reason, it got 23,000 likes on Twitter.

1218
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,180
I don't know.

1219
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,180
Why did this one blow up?

1220
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:41,180
A like on Twitter is better than a view on YouTube.

1221
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,180
But an impression...

1222
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,180
Yeah, because you have to click the button.

1223
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:47,180
But an impression on Twitter is not as good as a view on YouTube

1224
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,180
because you don't have to click anything

1225
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,180
to make an impression.

1226
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,180
I don't know.

1227
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:56,180
My Twitter has gone nuts recently.

1228
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,180
I saw you gained 10k followers this year.

1229
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:06,180
I've gained 14.6k followers in this month.

1230
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,180
And I don't know what happened.

1231
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,180
I just put out two banger tweets at least.

1232
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,180
Two drawings that just did really well.

1233
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,180
Which ones were those?

1234
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:20,180
It was the Nika Robin and that one I just sent you.

1235
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,180
Oh.

1236
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,180
Is it the My Hero Academia?

1237
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,180
Yeah.

1238
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,180
And then this one.

1239
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,180
The most boring drawings ever.

1240
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:34,180
What I would consider a pretty typical Simsie outfit.

1241
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,180
Yeah.

1242
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,180
There's nothing special about this.

1243
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,180
I don't know why they went beast mode.

1244
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,180
Yeah.

1245
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,180
I don't know.

1246
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:50,180
Maybe it's just because your account is bigger.

1247
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:54,180
And so when you have a hit tweet, the hits get bigger.

1248
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,180
Gross is exponential.

1249
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,180
How can I monetize that?

1250
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:03,180
Why can't I make it so that people have to pay me a dollar

1251
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,180
to follow me?

1252
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,180
Can you do that?

1253
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,180
No.

1254
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,180
You can do that stupid super follow thing.

1255
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,180
I don't know what the fuck that is.

1256
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:20,180
Okay, speaking of stupid Twitter features that I don't like,

1257
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:25,180
do you ever see Twitter, I think they're called Twitter Spaces?

1258
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,180
Yes.

1259
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:34,180
It's like an audio call that you can join and listen to someone talk live if you want.

1260
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:38,180
I saw someone was doing one.

1261
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:41,180
This guy, Alex, I think it's pronounced Deegan.

1262
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,180
Do you know who that is?

1263
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,180
No, no idea.

1264
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,180
He made a book called...

1265
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,180
Oh fuck, what's the title?

1266
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:53,180
He's done a couple comic, comic, graphic novels.

1267
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,180
Soft x-ray mind hunters.

1268
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,180
Soft x-ray mind.

1269
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:08,180
Let me just post an image so you can get an impression of what sort of art this guy does.

1270
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,180
Am I going to be overjoyed or disgusted?

1271
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:15,180
No, it's joyful, it's joyful.

1272
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:21,180
Okay, this is not the best image, but here's a sample.

1273
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:26,180
The word soft has me concerned.

1274
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,180
No, no, no, no, no.

1275
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,180
Okay.

1276
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:34,180
There are some boobs, I guess, but whatever.

1277
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:38,180
This is neat surrealism stuff.

1278
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,180
He did this book called soft x-ray mind hunters.

1279
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,180
My friend John lent me that book.

1280
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:46,180
I read it and I thought it was cool and I followed this guy on Twitter.

1281
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,180
He's not super big on Twitter or anything.

1282
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:53,180
But he was doing a space the other day and I was like, oh, it's that guy.

1283
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:56,180
I guess I'll join the space and see what's up.

1284
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:01,180
There was like one other person in the space and I joined it.

1285
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:05,180
And he was just playing some hip hop music.

1286
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:16,180
And the text chat in the space just kept sending messages of the lyrics of the song.

1287
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:20,180
And I think it was automated somehow.

1288
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,180
And I was like, what's the fucking point of this?

1289
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,180
He was just doing a karaoke stream.

1290
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,180
He was not singing.

1291
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:37,180
He was speech to text typing, auto typing, karaoke.

1292
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:42,180
I don't know, that might just be a thing that spaces do on their own.

1293
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,180
I bet you.

1294
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:49,180
You started it and was like, you know, when you start a live stream and nobody's there and you're like, hello?

1295
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,180
Is anyone there?

1296
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:53,180
Is anyone in the chat yet?

1297
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,180
I don't know.

1298
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:00,180
That kind of thing where you're just sort of like waiting for someone to show up and then you got bored and started listening to music.

1299
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:06,180
And then he was like, how can I turn this into a thing and then started spamming the audio?

1300
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,180
I don't know.

1301
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:13,180
Well, I mean, I joined it for like five minutes just to see what was going on.

1302
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,180
Nothing was going on.

1303
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,180
You were like, haha, that's crazy.

1304
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,180
Bye.

1305
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:21,180
I'll talk about this on my podcast.

1306
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,180
I can mine this for content.

1307
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:29,180
I have seen that was the only space I've ever joined.

1308
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:33,180
I guess I would call it a bit of a disappointment, to be honest.

1309
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,180
But maybe some other spaces are good sometimes.

1310
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:41,180
I think I joined one from some artists.

1311
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:47,180
I don't remember who it was, but I blocked them shortly afterwards because of something not okay.

1312
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:52,180
They said on the space and I was like, I don't think I want to be aligned with that.

1313
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:55,180
So you were in the space and he said something and you were like, oh no.

1314
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:58,180
I joined the space and I was like just listening.

1315
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:06,180
And then he said the F word that is offensive to the gay people and said that to the chat saying,

1316
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:11,180
you guys are the F word that is offensive to the gay people to the chat.

1317
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,180
I was like, yeah, I don't think I want to.

1318
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:25,180
Have you seen, this is not entirely related, but have you seen the one thing that Neil Cisariga ever said to Jon Tron?

1319
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,180
No.

1320
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,180
Is it great?

1321
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,180
Yeah, it is great.

1322
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:42,180
I'll try to find the image, but basically Jon Tron, I think Neil made a tweet in a thread that Jon was tagged in or something.

1323
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:47,180
And Jon replies like, hey man, like big fan, keep up the great work.

1324
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:54,180
And Neil says like, thanks, all I know about you is you were a huge dick to someone that asked you not to say the R word.

1325
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,180
And that's it.

1326
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,180
I know Jon Tron was in an internet historian video recently.

1327
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:09,180
Yeah, I deliberately did not go watch the video.

1328
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:13,180
I like the internet historians like videos, but I don't want to see it.

1329
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:21,180
I did watch that one and all I got from it was that his middle, Jon Tron's middle name is apparently Arian and I didn't know that before and that was funny.

1330
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,180
And he called him out on that.

1331
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,180
Is that his actual?

1332
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,180
Apparently.

1333
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:27,180
I think so.

1334
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:32,180
Unless he just did the funny internet historian thing where he edits a Wikipedia article and shows it on screen.

1335
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,180
It was not a good video.

1336
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,180
Jon Tron is not funny.

1337
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:53,180
He, yeah, I mean, some of his older videos seemed funny, but then like, I think the last one I watched was the one where he like fucks around in like fucking like Plymouth, Massachusetts, like doing like some sort of stupid historical cosplay.

1338
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,180
Yeah.

1339
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,180
Now it was not funny.

1340
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,180
Yeah.

1341
01:04:56,180 --> 01:05:09,180
I know his latest video was like a parody of like Ted Talks and it was it was five minutes long of him like doing, you know, when like like a sketch comedy where it's like hard cutting between the like a guy pretending to be emotional speakers just saying weird things.

1342
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,180
But you got to be motivated.

1343
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,180
Time to move like shit like that, you know?

1344
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:17,180
I don't really know.

1345
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:22,180
Just like acting and pretending to be a funny motivational speaker who's embarrassing.

1346
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,180
It's like that.

1347
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,180
And it's like a six minute long video.

1348
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:33,180
And at the very end, it's just like an advert for Rachel the legend to some shit or some or no, a dislike or whatever that is.

1349
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,180
It's a motherfucking game.

1350
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,180
I don't know what that is, but okay.

1351
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:40,180
It was like, it was like an ad disguised as a comedy video.

1352
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,180
And it wasn't even like where he put an ad in one of his normal videos.

1353
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:46,180
It's just that I can see.

1354
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:50,180
I mean, I can see how the premise could be funny.

1355
01:05:50,180 --> 01:06:00,180
Just opposing some kind of embarrassing motivational speaker with someone else's sort of like grim reality or whatever.

1356
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:02,180
I'd like to confirm.

1357
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:04,180
Not funny.

1358
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,180
All right.

1359
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:10,180
Yeah, I like the Internet historian.

1360
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:18,180
I mean, going thinking back, I definitely get the sense that his politics, his personal politics are maybe not great.

1361
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:21,180
But it doesn't really come into his videos much.

1362
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:28,180
So I kind of just like if he's not going to make a big deal about it, then I guess I'm not going to complain about it.

1363
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,180
Yeah.

1364
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:33,180
So, you know, I like Internet story.

1365
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,180
Yeah.

1366
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:39,180
It's one of those channels that I will let play in the background, rewatch videos a lot.

1367
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:42,180
Yeah, they go pretty.

1368
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:45,180
I've rewatched them a few.

1369
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,180
I've seen a couple of them a few times.

1370
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,180
Yeah.

1371
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,180
They're good.

1372
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:54,180
Not interested in his secondary channel though.

1373
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,180
I do like his secondary channel, actually.

1374
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,180
Oh, really?

1375
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,180
Yeah.

1376
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:02,180
It's just them rambling about life stories and stuff.

1377
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:05,180
But I find that fairly entertaining.

1378
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,180
I haven't checked it out.

1379
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:11,180
The John Tron episode sucks though.

1380
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,180
Yeah.

1381
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:23,180
At some point, I think it was that old timey colonial video.

1382
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:26,180
I think I just decided, you know what, I just don't think John Tron is funny.

1383
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:27,180
Yeah.

1384
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:31,180
I don't think I will ever watch another John Tron video.

1385
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,180
Not because I don't like him, although that's true.

1386
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,180
I'm simply not entertained.

1387
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:39,180
I think I have watched a bunch of them recently.

1388
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:45,180
I only watched that stupid advertising one because it was recommended to me.

1389
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:48,180
I was like, what the fuck is this?

1390
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:51,180
I wonder what that guy's up to.

1391
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:55,180
I think the one you were talking about came out in like three years ago from looking at

1392
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,180
this channel.

1393
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,180
Yeah.

1394
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,180
I think that was the first one that had come out in a while.

1395
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:08,180
I was curious about it or something.

1396
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:15,180
If you never have a public apology for things that you did, then it means that you don't

1397
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,180
regret them.

1398
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,180
No, he doesn't.

1399
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,180
He's totally unrepentant.

1400
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,180
I hate him.

1401
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,180
He's so obnoxious.

1402
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:26,180
It's obnoxious when people defend him.

1403
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:33,180
The people that defend him are really obnoxious because he's clearly not apologetic about

1404
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,180
anything.

1405
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,180
So like, don't fucking tell me.

1406
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,180
Yeah.

1407
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,180
Don't tell me.

1408
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,180
Don't lie to me, cowards.

1409
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,180
Dude, back off.

1410
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,180
Dude, come on.

1411
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,180
Yeah.

1412
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,180
Yeah.

1413
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:45,180
Yeah.

1414
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,180
Fight me.

1415
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:51,180
Anyway, good YouTube interrogation videos of any kind based.

1416
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,180
Interrogate.

1417
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,180
You mean like...

1418
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,180
Jim can't swim.

1419
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,180
Yeah.

1420
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,180
With us.

1421
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,180
Things like that.

1422
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,180
Didn't Jim can't swim?

1423
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,180
Get like kicked off YouTube for a while?

1424
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,180
They got nuked.

1425
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,180
They got nuked.

1426
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:06,180
Loads of their videos got deleted like one around Christmas, I think it was.

1427
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:12,180
I think most of them are still up, but like their latest one that they did is still gone.

1428
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,180
Bummer.

1429
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,180
I don't know why.

1430
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,180
Yeah.

1431
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:17,180
I don't know why.

1432
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,180
It sucks.

1433
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:19,180
Yeah, why?

1434
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,180
I don't know.

1435
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:24,180
All they do is show things and talk about them.

1436
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,180
I don't know.

1437
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:29,180
There's nothing particularly offensive in there, especially when it's all taken from

1438
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:32,180
that weird clinical perspective, which is what makes the videos good.

1439
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:39,180
I mean, is it like the only thing I can think that like might be objectionable about it is

1440
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:44,180
like that maybe it could be considered like murder bilia, like profiting off a crime almost.

1441
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,180
Maybe.

1442
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:48,180
Which is like, I don't know if I would make that argument.

1443
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,180
I don't know because there's plenty of other channels that do the same thing, do a similar

1444
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,180
or the same thing.

1445
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,180
Yeah.

1446
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,180
Yeah.

1447
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,180
True.

1448
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,180
Things that seem to have not had these issues.

1449
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:04,180
I don't know why Jim can't swim was a single out.

1450
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,180
I saw they were posting.

1451
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,180
This was a while ago.

1452
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:10,180
They were saying like they were considering like moving to a different platform or something.

1453
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,180
Yeah.

1454
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:16,180
And like, I mean, other platforms are terrible.

1455
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:19,180
But like, yeah, I do really like those videos.

1456
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,180
I might go watch something.

1457
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:26,180
I might go watch a Jim can't swim video on to be or whatever.

1458
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,180
Yeah.

1459
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:31,180
There's another channel called explore with us, which pretty much does the same thing.

1460
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:34,180
And but they're just a bit more long form and more detailed.

1461
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,180
And that one's very good.

1462
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:37,180
I don't.

1463
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:38,180
I've not heard.

1464
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:41,180
I've not heard of that one.

1465
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:49,180
I think they they they think they've blown up more recently, but they're they're originally

1466
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:54,180
their videos were a lot more like their videos are really click bait for what they are.

1467
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:57,180
Like, you know how Jim can't swim is a little bit.

1468
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:00,180
But like, you know, a good in like a cool way.

1469
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:01,180
Yeah.

1470
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:03,180
A little bit, a little bit click baby.

1471
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,180
Like what what pretending to be crazy looks like.

1472
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,180
That's like honest.

1473
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,180
That is what the video is about.

1474
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:13,180
But some of some of the explore with us thumbnails are a bit like, come on, man.

1475
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:16,180
Look at this.

1476
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,180
Let me see.

1477
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,180
Explore with us.

1478
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:23,180
I just sent a screenshot of the like recent ones.

1479
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,180
Oh, yeah.

1480
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,180
Yeah, these look pretty similar.

1481
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:32,180
They are basically the same thing.

1482
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:34,180
Going to release my Bible.

1483
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,180
Okay.

1484
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:36,180
You pick out a really like.

1485
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,180
Weird.

1486
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:38,180
Coletious quote.

1487
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:40,180
That one is a very good video.

1488
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,180
I really enjoyed that.

1489
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,180
Hmm.

1490
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,180
Okay.

1491
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,180
It's a.

1492
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,180
It's a what is it?

1493
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,180
It's a 15 year old girl.

1494
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,180
Her 19 year old boyfriend.

1495
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,180
And they're like 22 year old bipolar autistic friend.

1496
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,180
Who murdered someone.

1497
01:11:56,180 --> 01:12:00,180
And it go and it like cuts between all the different interrogations in a way.

1498
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:03,180
Where like reveals the information to you at the same time and stuff, even though the.

1499
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,180
It's good.

1500
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,180
It's well made.

1501
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,180
You know what?

1502
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,180
That sounds interesting.

1503
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,180
The the narrator is not quite as silky smooth as.

1504
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,180
Jim.

1505
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,180
Jim can't swim one.

1506
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,180
Yeah.

1507
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:16,180
I assume his name is Jim.

1508
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,180
I don't know.

1509
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,180
No, he isn't.

1510
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,180
He's a guy that they hired to do the narration.

1511
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,180
I think.

1512
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:24,180
If you look in the description of some of the Jim can't swim videos, it has a link to his

1513
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,180
channel.

1514
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:29,180
And it's mostly him going like, you know, the Republicans, they really fucked up this

1515
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,180
time.

1516
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,180
And I'm not.

1517
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,180
I.

1518
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,180
Oh, okay.

1519
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,180
Very good.

1520
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,180
Sure.

1521
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:38,180
I'm glad he's getting getting work.

1522
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:39,180
Yeah.

1523
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,180
He's good.

1524
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,180
He's a good guy.

1525
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,180
He seems like it.

1526
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,180
Yeah.

1527
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:44,180
And he has videos.

1528
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,180
He's got a pretty good voice.

1529
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:50,180
I'm trying to discover what's going on in my life and trying to find myself.

1530
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:54,180
You can see videos of him from like 12 years ago where he sounds exactly the same except

1531
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,180
higher pitch.

1532
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:58,180
You're making him sound like Kermit the Frog.

1533
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,180
Yeah.

1534
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:02,180
I always turn into that with really specific voices like that.

1535
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:04,180
I always turn into Kermit the Frog.

1536
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

1537
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,180
George Lucas as well.

1538
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,180
All right.

1539
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,180
All right.

1540
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,180
I might watch these.

1541
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,180
But the explore with us guys.

1542
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,180
Hello.

1543
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,180
Welcome to our video.

1544
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,180
This is one of those ones.

1545
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,180
Is he more YouTuber?

1546
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,180
Yeah.

1547
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,180
He's definitely more tuberous.

1548
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:22,180
She was stabbed and murdered.

1549
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,180
That's not.

1550
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,180
That's not my favorite.

1551
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,180
No.

1552
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:31,180
The following footage has been reviewed by a team of psychologists.

1553
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:32,180
Cringe.

1554
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,180
It's not too bad.

1555
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:36,180
A team of psychologists gets involved.

1556
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:42,180
And they inform random YouTuber what they think about crazy people.

1557
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:43,180
Yeah.

1558
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:47,180
Anyway, I don't know why I'm addicted to pro crime videos at the moment.

1559
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,180
I, I like Jim can swim.

1560
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:54,180
So how do we get on this topic?

1561
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,180
I don't know.

1562
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,180
We were talking about.

1563
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:59,180
Where are we?

1564
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,180
Right now.

1565
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:03,180
And then a historian.

1566
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:06,180
And then that's where the trail goes.

1567
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:10,180
I don't remember anything before that.

1568
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,180
Let's see.

1569
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,180
Shit.

1570
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,180
I don't really have any.

1571
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:21,180
My, my PZP topic notes list was just how annoying and long and hard the work on the book is.

1572
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:23,180
And I already complained about that.

1573
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:29,180
So I was going to say, uh, I'm going to, yeah, I got to catch a train a little bit.

1574
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,180
Cause I'm going home for my mom's birthday.

1575
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,180
I made her another batch.

1576
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,180
I made her another batch of gummy, gummy blocks.

1577
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,180
This is a, this is better.

1578
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,180
I have refined the recipe more.

1579
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,180
This is, these are, these are better than the last ones.

1580
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,180
Uh, they smell incredible.

1581
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,180
It's been really hard not to eat them.

1582
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:50,180
Have you not tasted one?

1583
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:56,180
I did taste like, uh, I did, uh, eat a few of each like flavor that I made.

1584
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:59,180
They were just really good and I just want to eat more of them.

1585
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,180
Okay.

1586
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:03,180
Uh, but I had, I had just, I had to stop.

1587
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:07,180
It's like, no, I don't want to give her like a half empty container.

1588
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:10,180
This is, this is, you've hit the limit.

1589
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,180
It's a very nice present.

1590
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,180
Something that you made yourself a big smile.

1591
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,180
Yeah.

1592
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:17,180
Unless there's shit in which case you fucked up.

1593
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,180
I think they're good.

1594
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,180
I think, I think they're good.

1595
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:24,180
It would be a shame if like my parents think they're bad and don't actually like them,

1596
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:27,180
but they're too polite to say it.

1597
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29,180
I don't know.

1598
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:35,180
You know, I could have made, I, I considered, uh, since I know how to etch a glass now,

1599
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:39,180
I could have, uh, oh yeah, I learned how to etch a glass.

1600
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:40,180
With chemicals.

1601
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,180
You can't just learn how to do that.

1602
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,180
That's what computers do.

1603
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,180
Nobody does that.

1604
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,180
No, it's easy.

1605
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,180
No, it's easy, bro.

1606
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:49,180
They do that in big factories.

1607
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,180
That doesn't happen in real life.

1608
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:55,180
I was talking about this cause I, cause I made those, uh, those slime bottles and I etched

1609
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,180
into the glass.

1610
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:01,180
I etched the like product of New Los Angeles city, uh, into the slime bottles that I gave

1611
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,180
out at RFC Kcon.

1612
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:07,180
I was thinking I could maybe etch, uh, like a glass container or something, but I didn't

1613
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:13,180
really have any appropriate, appropriately sized glass containers to present, uh, these,

1614
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:14,180
this candy.

1615
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:16,180
And so I thought, uh, maybe, maybe next time.

1616
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,180
Ben's gummies.

1617
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:18,180
Ben's gummies.

1618
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:21,180
When do you keep all your, your gummy chemicals?

1619
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,180
Are they just like in a cupboard?

1620
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:28,180
They're just in a cupboard cause like, I don't really, I, I did get some weird stuff, but

1621
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:30,180
I ended up not using most of it.

1622
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,180
I just use.

1623
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:35,180
You got, you got like eggs, bread, milk, monosaccharides.

1624
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,180
Yeah.

1625
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:41,180
Well, now I use, uh, it's all I really use is sugar, sugar.

1626
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:47,180
I don't really use the pectin anymore, uh, sugar, corn, fiber, corn syrup.

1627
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:49,180
Actually, actually, no, I ordered a big bucket.

1628
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,180
I have a big bucket of corn syrup, 50 pounds.

1629
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,180
That's all you need.

1630
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,180
Yeah.

1631
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,180
Uh, I mean, it's cheaper to buy in bulk.

1632
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:05,180
So, uh, sugar, corn, fiber, uh, corn, corn starch, uh, uh, water.

1633
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:08,180
Uh, uh, citric acid.

1634
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:11,180
And then I have a little box full of like flavors and colors.

1635
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,180
And like, that's it.

1636
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:13,180
There we go.

1637
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,180
Did I forget, did I forget anything?

1638
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,180
Wait a second.

1639
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:18,180
Like, consult my notes.

1640
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,180
Consult my master, my master list.

1641
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:25,180
The weirdest thing I've ever known anyone to do is just know, just knows how to make

1642
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,180
gummies.

1643
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,180
Just household the ingredients anytime.

1644
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,180
They're so easy.

1645
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,180
It only took me like two years to figure it out.

1646
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,180
Oh, gelatin.

1647
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,180
Oh, of course gelatin.

1648
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,180
You mastered it in two years.

1649
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,180
I ran out.

1650
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:38,180
I ran out of a gelatin.

1651
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:42,180
I feel like I just bought like a big box of like 500 sheets.

1652
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:43,180
I got the platinum.

1653
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,180
I got the platinum sheets this time.

1654
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:46,180
Oh, very nice.

1655
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:53,180
The difference between platinum and like other grades, basically that's the highest grade.

1656
01:17:53,180 --> 01:18:00,180
The difference is basically just like one sheet, one sheet of platinum gelatin has as much

1657
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:08,180
solidifying, gelling power as one sheet of, you know, gold or silver or bronze or whatever.

1658
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:11,180
It's just, I think the other ones are like less pure.

1659
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,180
Right.

1660
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:16,180
And so there's like, there's more impurities in them.

1661
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:19,180
It's condensed gelatin power, basically.

1662
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,180
Yeah.

1663
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:26,180
But like, it actually, it actually ends up that buying the platinum is like more, it's

1664
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:31,180
like less expensive because like, because there's less impurities, it weighs less.

1665
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:37,180
So you get more in the box that costs like, the box costs a little more, but you get more

1666
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:41,180
sheets and therefore you get more gelling power and it's actually more cost effective to buy

1667
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,180
the better stuff.

1668
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,180
Right.

1669
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,180
In addition to being pure and better.

1670
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,180
And yummy.

1671
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,180
So, so, but I'm out.

1672
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:52,180
I ran out of, use the last of it, making this.

1673
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:55,180
You need more platinum gelatin, my friend.

1674
01:18:55,180 --> 01:19:00,180
You need more platinum 240 bloom, baby.

1675
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,180
Platinum.

1676
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,180
Genatin sounds like a good band name.

1677
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,180
Platinum.

1678
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:05,180
Platinum gelatin does.

1679
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:06,180
Damn.

1680
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,180
That is good.

1681
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,180
I've always had rules.

1682
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:12,180
Do you have any band names in your head that I don't play musical instruments, but I have

1683
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:17,180
like a band name in my head that if I ever through some circumstance needed to name a band,

1684
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,180
I've always got one on the standby.

1685
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,180
Do you have one of those?

1686
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:22,180
I don't.

1687
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,180
What's yours?

1688
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,180
Radical gasket.

1689
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,180
Come on.

1690
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:26,180
That's perfect.

1691
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:27,180
That's pretty good.

1692
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,180
Yeah.

1693
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,180
It's pretty fucking perfect.

1694
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:33,180
Would it be like a sounds like maybe a punk band or something?

1695
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:34,180
Yeah.

1696
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:38,180
Maybe also alternative rock, you know, anything, whatever.

1697
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,180
Yeah.

1698
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,180
Sure.

1699
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,180
Yeah.

1700
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,180
I am completely non musical in any way.

1701
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:44,180
So I don't know why I came up with that.

1702
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:47,180
Well, I guess mine is platinum gelatin now because I really like that.

1703
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:48,180
Yeah.

1704
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:49,180
It's good.

1705
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:50,180
That rules.

1706
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:53,180
That could be the name of like an outro song to an anime.

1707
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,180
I can really easily see that.

1708
01:19:55,180 --> 01:20:02,180
I use the last of my, uh, my 600 sheets.

1709
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:06,180
I made this, I made the stuff, you know, for my mom's birthday present and I had a little

1710
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:10,180
bit left over and I was like, well, okay, I'll just use the last of it.

1711
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,180
And I use the last of it.

1712
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:17,180
And I decided, okay, well, I also have a little bit of cola flavor emulsion.

1713
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:21,180
So I'll use the last of my cola flavor emulsion to flavor the last batch.

1714
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:24,180
And I forgot that I hate the cola flavor emulsion.

1715
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:25,180
It sucks.

1716
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,180
It tastes bad.

1717
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,180
So I just threw it out.

1718
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,180
I wasted it.

1719
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:32,180
But at least I, but at least I got rid of that bottle.

1720
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,180
That goddamn emulsion.

1721
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,180
God damn emulsion.

1722
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:40,180
Just taking up, taking up so much space and it's little like one ounce bottle.

1723
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:43,180
I'm finally free of it.

1724
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:47,180
You need to start like a community in Boston of gummy makers.

1725
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,180
Oh, wait, wait.

1726
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,180
You know what?

1727
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,180
That's great news though.

1728
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,180
Gummy making convention.

1729
01:20:53,180 --> 01:21:00,180
They had, they had discontinued the worm molds, like the specific worm molds that I like.

1730
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:05,180
They only had shitty ones that like were shaped weird for some reason.

1731
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:11,180
And I don't know why they would make them stupid and bad like that.

1732
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:12,180
But they did.

1733
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:14,180
But now guess what?

1734
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:15,180
They're back in stock.

1735
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:16,180
They're back, baby.

1736
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,180
We're back, baby.

1737
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:24,180
They're back in stock and I'm debating, oh, should I, should I just buy like 10 of them?

1738
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,180
Like, so I'll never run out.

1739
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:30,180
Probably probably need to.

1740
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:34,180
The fact that they came back once probably means that they would come back again.

1741
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:38,180
If they get discontinued, maybe I'd buy like one more, one more set.

1742
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:41,180
Oh, there's like the perfect gummy worm shape.

1743
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,180
These are the perfect gummy worm shape.

1744
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,180
They're, you know, they're, they're S curve.

1745
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:47,180
They got that nice S curve.

1746
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:52,180
What, do they get like worn out and stop working or something when you need to replace them?

1747
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:54,180
I just want, I just wanted more.

1748
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,180
I just wanted to be able to make more at once.

1749
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:59,180
You were to make an absurd amount of gummies.

1750
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,180
Wait, here.

1751
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:04,180
Compare that, compare that to this garbage.

1752
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:09,180
I mean, you could get this, which is like a good, a good shape.

1753
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:12,180
Like this is a good shape, but it comes with all this bullshit.

1754
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:13,180
Oh yeah.

1755
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:16,180
Who the fuck wants to make gummy dolphins?

1756
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,180
Gummy dolphins and starfish.

1757
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:20,180
Oh, the gummy octopus is kind of cute.

1758
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:23,180
Oh, the octopus, like whatever.

1759
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,180
I eat the gummy octopus.

1760
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:27,180
They're wormy.

1761
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:33,180
Yeah, I mean, so that's all fine and whatever, but like just please, I'm here for the worms obviously.

1762
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:34,180
I'm here for the worms.

1763
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,180
We're ruining our gummy worm.

1764
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:39,180
Please stop wasting my time.

1765
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:45,180
And then this is the other ones you can get that are just worms look like this.

1766
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:51,180
And I mean, I feel like this speaks for itself.

1767
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,180
Yeah, no, not right.

1768
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:56,180
They have heads, that's so stupid.

1769
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,180
Those are gummy sperms, those are different.

1770
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:02,180
What's going on with like the uneven curve?

1771
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,180
I know.

1772
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:08,180
Why do they like bend all, they have like a big like S-curve at the back and why?

1773
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,180
And a really straight neck.

1774
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:10,180
It's so weird.

1775
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,180
I hate it.

1776
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:14,180
Gummy snakes or sperms, those aren't gummy worms.

1777
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:18,180
Frankly, frankly, these are no worms at all.

1778
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,180
I can't stand it.

1779
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:30,180
So I'm glad to see the good old modern gummy, 20 cavity candy kit back in stock.

1780
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:32,180
Finally available.

1781
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:38,180
Finally, finally, I might buy another one just as a treat.

1782
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,180
Another set of two.

1783
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:47,180
I treated myself to a Lego set recently just to have on my desk and you're treating yourself to gummy building.

1784
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:52,180
I mean, I mean, I mean, same same same idea.

1785
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:59,180
I think a little while ago, I was feeling kind of down.

1786
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:04,180
And I think it was partially because I hadn't made any gummies in a while.

1787
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:11,180
Like I I think I had like sort of been like just working on the book and not doing anything outside of that.

1788
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:18,180
And I think I was just like, and then I don't know, you got to have you got to have a hobby.

1789
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:19,180
You do.

1790
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:23,180
So I think I, yeah, I don't know.

1791
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:29,180
It brings me a small amount of joy in this dark, fucked up world.

1792
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:36,180
Yeah, I've been playing a lot of multiverses recently because big product.

1793
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:41,180
It's the Warner Brothers Smash Brothers fighting game thingy.

1794
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,180
Have you not seen this?

1795
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:47,180
No, it's a it's a big free to play.

1796
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:52,180
Like Smash Brothers style game we can play as all the Warner Brothers characters.

1797
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:58,180
My main is our Finn the human and Wonder Woman.

1798
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:00,180
Finn the human is a Warner Brothers.

1799
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:03,180
Yeah, because he's Carti Network and that's owned by Warner Brothers.

1800
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,180
Oh, I didn't know that.

1801
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,180
It's a it's good.

1802
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,180
It's a really good little free fighting game.

1803
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:11,180
And it's a it's going massive at the moment.

1804
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,180
Have you not seen this?

1805
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,180
No, I have.

1806
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:17,180
Well, maybe maybe I did, but I didn't pay much attention.

1807
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:21,180
Yeah, didn't like Nickelodeon make a like Smash like that?

1808
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:26,180
Yes, they did, but it's been sort of killed now.

1809
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:27,180
Oh, no one cares.

1810
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:29,180
We added voice acting to that.

1811
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:31,180
And that's good.

1812
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:35,180
But the problem is that game just doesn't play great.

1813
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:41,180
It's cool for what it is, you know, it's just like it's good, but it's not great.

1814
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:45,180
Whereas multiverses feels really, really good.

1815
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,180
Hmm.

1816
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:50,180
And it's got lots of pretty solid lots of cool people in it.

1817
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:52,180
And it's not just like Carti Network stuff.

1818
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,180
There's tons of dog shit.

1819
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,180
Hang on.

1820
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,180
Let me send the Ross.

1821
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:56,180
Multiverses.

1822
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:57,180
I guess.

1823
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,180
Yeah.

1824
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,180
Yeah.

1825
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:03,180
No, I think maybe I did see this somewhere.

1826
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:07,180
I like playing as Finn, Jake and Wonder Woman.

1827
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:12,180
Tasmanian devil versus Superman.

1828
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,180
Sure.

1829
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:15,180
Why not?

1830
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,180
It's a it's really fun.

1831
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:19,180
They recently added LeBron James.

1832
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,180
Yeah.

1833
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,180
Cool.

1834
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:22,180
Yeah.

1835
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:28,180
You shouldn't be surprised, but there's dog shit like that in it.

1836
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:29,180
I don't know.

1837
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,180
Shaggy.

1838
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:33,180
Okay.

1839
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,180
We got Shaggy, of course.

1840
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,180
Shaggy is.

1841
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:39,180
Do you remember there was memes of Shaggy if he was a Dragon Ball character?

1842
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,180
Ultra.

1843
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:42,180
I remember Ultra Instinct Shaggy.

1844
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:43,180
Does he go Ultra Instinct?

1845
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,180
Yeah.

1846
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,180
He like powers up and starts glowing and stuff in multiverses.

1847
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:48,180
That's I guess.

1848
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,180
I guess that's kind of funny.

1849
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,180
I guess.

1850
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,180
I guess that's a little late.

1851
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,180
Yeah.

1852
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:56,180
Yeah.

1853
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,180
Rick and Morty are being added soon, I think.

1854
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,180
You can act out Scoob and Shag.

1855
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:02,180
You can.

1856
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:04,180
Because Bugs Bunny and Shaggy are both here.

1857
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:07,180
And those are the only two characters in Scoob and Shaggy.

1858
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:13,180
Arya Stark from Game of Thrones.

1859
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,180
Really?

1860
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,180
Yeah.

1861
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:20,180
Voiced by the girl who played her in the TV show.

1862
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:23,180
Oh, so like there's a lot that aren't on this image, I guess.

1863
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,180
Oh, no.

1864
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,180
She's there.

1865
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,180
She's there on that image.

1866
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,180
Wait, where?

1867
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,180
Next to Velma.

1868
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:30,180
Oh, like my eyes completely glossed over.

1869
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:31,180
Yeah.

1870
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,180
Arya Stark.

1871
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:36,180
This is so fucking weird.

1872
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:37,180
It is really weird.

1873
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:38,180
But okay.

1874
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:39,180
Who is Rain Dog?

1875
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:40,180
I've never seen that one.

1876
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:44,180
They seem to have like original characters that they're adding.

1877
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:46,180
Just to fill out the roster of like.

1878
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,180
Okay.

1879
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:50,180
He's like a support thing where like if you get knocked off the stage,

1880
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,180
he can pull you back in and things like that.

1881
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,180
Hmm.

1882
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,180
Oh, fine.

1883
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:58,180
It feels like we need marketable dog type character for game.

1884
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:00,180
It feels a little like that.

1885
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,180
I feel like.

1886
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,180
I don't know.

1887
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,180
There's.

1888
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:14,180
There's relatively few properties represented on this roster.

1889
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,180
To be fair.

1890
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:18,180
And some of them have multiple characters from them.

1891
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,180
Yeah.

1892
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:21,180
It's only an open beta at the moment.

1893
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,180
Oh, okay.

1894
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:24,180
It's not like the full release.

1895
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:28,180
And I think they've said that they're going to keep adding characters as long as they can.

1896
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:29,180
You know.

1897
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:30,180
Yeah.

1898
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:33,180
I'm pretty sure Gandalf is datamined.

1899
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,180
Okay.

1900
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:40,180
I think Gandalf and Neo are definitely coming.

1901
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:41,180
Oh my God.

1902
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:43,180
Mad Max was leaked.

1903
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:45,180
But I don't think.

1904
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:47,180
I don't think that'll go through.

1905
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:50,180
Something about.

1906
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:52,180
I heard some rumors of Ben 10.

1907
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:54,180
I hope Ben 10 gets in.

1908
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:55,180
That'd be cool.

1909
01:28:55,180 --> 01:29:00,180
How recently did this game go to open beta?

1910
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:03,180
The open beta started on the 26th.

1911
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,180
So like a week ago.

1912
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,180
Oh, okay.

1913
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:10,180
And I see the there was an early alpha for it.

1914
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:13,180
And then there was an early access to the open beta.

1915
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:16,180
So if you got into the open into the closed alpha,

1916
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:18,180
then you got early access to the beta.

1917
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:21,180
So I played it a few weeks before it came out in open.

1918
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:23,180
But yeah.

1919
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,180
But it is really fun.

1920
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:26,180
It looks really strange.

1921
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:27,180
Yeah.

1922
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:28,180
It is.

1923
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:30,180
Who's your main?

1924
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:31,180
Finn.

1925
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:32,180
Finn Human.

1926
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:35,180
Because he's kind of like.

1927
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:38,180
If I was to compare him like a Smash Brothers character,

1928
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:41,180
he's kind of like mass combined with a hero.

1929
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,180
He's really weird.

1930
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:47,180
He has like a shop mechanic where you collect gold as you damage people.

1931
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:50,180
And then you can use his down special to buy things from the shop,

1932
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:53,180
like a speed boost, a defense thing.

1933
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:54,180
And then you can buy BMO,

1934
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,180
which lets you do like a super attack,

1935
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:58,180
which does tons of damage.

1936
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:59,180
Very cool.

1937
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,180
It sounds adorable.

1938
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,180
It is great.

1939
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:04,180
And they got all the voice actors for everybody,

1940
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:06,180
apart from LeBron James.

1941
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:10,180
LeBron James is the only person.

1942
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:11,180
He doesn't.

1943
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:13,180
They couldn't get him to voice himself?

1944
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,180
No.

1945
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:19,180
He's voiced by the guy who voices Barrett in Final Fantasy VII remake.

1946
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,180
Cool.

1947
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:22,180
They got Superman to voice Superman, you know,

1948
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:23,180
the real Superman.

1949
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:25,180
They actually got him, I can't believe it.

1950
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,180
Oh, they got the real Clark Kent?

1951
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,180
Yeah, they got him.

1952
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:31,180
I don't know where they found him, but they got him.

1953
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:36,180
My favorite thing about the game is that when Tom and Jerry get knocked off the screen,

1954
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:39,180
it plays the scream, the Tom and Jerry scream.

1955
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:41,180
Yeah, yeah.

1956
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,180
Which is a...

1957
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:44,180
What does Velma do?

1958
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:48,180
What does Velma do in a battle against Batman?

1959
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:54,180
Did you ever see Phoenix Wright in Marvel vs Capcom?

1960
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,180
Not really.

1961
01:30:56,180 --> 01:31:00,180
Where he does like attacks where it makes like a speech bubble.

1962
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:02,180
And that like is the hit box.

1963
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:06,180
So like Velma is like sass, deduction and something like that.

1964
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:11,180
And Jinkies it says in like speech bubbles and it hits you and stuff.

1965
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:13,180
I see, I see, I see.

1966
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:17,180
One of her attacks is based on like the little like charge up and run they always do in Scooby-Doo

1967
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:19,180
when they're running away from throwing things.

1968
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:22,180
And she like holds her hands completely straight and then her legs like wheel.

1969
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:25,180
Oh, like Sonic the Hedgehog?

1970
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,180
Yeah.

1971
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,180
Legs whirlwind, gotcha.

1972
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:32,180
If you like hit someone while they're in that, you like grab them and then throw them off the stage.

1973
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:34,180
That...

1974
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:36,180
Her main mechanic is really weird.

1975
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:42,180
It's like you collect evidence around the stage and then when you collect enough it will summon a police car

1976
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:47,180
and like grab the opponent and reveal that it was Mr. Jenkins all along.

1977
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:48,180
It was old man Jenkins.

1978
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:51,180
Like you pull the enemy, you pull your opponent's mask off?

1979
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:54,180
Yeah, but it doesn't like show you pulling their mask off.

1980
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:58,180
It like just puts them in a police car and then like it shows like a little icon of their character's face

1981
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,180
and it flips over and it's old man Jenkins.

1982
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,180
I see, I see.

1983
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:04,180
And then it like throws them off the stage in the police car.

1984
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:06,180
That...

1985
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:07,180
That's so funny.

1986
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:08,180
Oh my god.

1987
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,180
It sounds pretty fun.

1988
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:10,180
I'm just really...

1989
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:12,180
I'm bad at fighting games though.

1990
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:13,180
Oh, me too.

1991
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:14,180
It's too late.

1992
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:15,180
Yeah.

1993
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:17,180
It's too late for me to get good at them.

1994
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:23,180
I've always said to like fighting games you have to have liked fighting games for the past five years.

1995
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:25,180
It feels, it feels that way.

1996
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:26,180
You know what I mean?

1997
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:28,180
It's impossible to catch up.

1998
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:31,180
Yeah, I'll never do it at this point.

1999
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:33,180
Oh well.

2000
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:40,180
But I mean, I'm very, I'm, I'm you, I'm entertained by what I'm seeing.

2001
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:41,180
Yeah.

2002
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:45,180
I was very surprised by how much I liked playing as Garnet.

2003
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:49,180
I'm not, I don't remember anything about Steven Universe.

2004
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:52,180
I watched like half of it and I've completely forgotten it now.

2005
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:56,180
But she's really good at this in multi-person.

2006
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:58,180
I never finished Steven Universe.

2007
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:05,180
I made it to like almost the end and then I stopped watching like literally like six episodes before the end.

2008
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:11,180
And then I saw the movie, the one with the, with the...

2009
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:13,180
The good drawings.

2010
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:16,180
The clown girl, Harley Quinn.

2011
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:18,180
What's your name?

2012
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:20,180
I don't know.

2013
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,180
I know who you're talking about.

2014
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,180
I don't know.

2015
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,180
Spinel, Spinal.

2016
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,180
Oh, okay.

2017
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:27,180
And then I never saw, and I think there was another movie.

2018
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:30,180
I think there was a series afterwards, like a little like epilogue series.

2019
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2020
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:34,180
There was like a post-timeskip series.

2021
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:39,180
Oh, I never saw the post-timeskip like post-series adventure time movie either.

2022
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:41,180
Oh, there's four of those.

2023
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:42,180
Really?

2024
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:43,180
They're really good.

2025
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:46,180
I like, I like adventure time a lot.

2026
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:47,180
I don't know.

2027
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:49,180
And I never watched, I never watched the movies.

2028
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:50,180
There's four?

2029
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:51,180
What the fuck?

2030
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:56,180
They're hour-long specials and they all focus on like a different character.

2031
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:01,180
The one criticism I have for them is they release them in the wrong order.

2032
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:04,180
The third one definitely should have been the fourth one,

2033
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:07,180
because the third one is the Finn and Jake one.

2034
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,180
And that should have been last?

2035
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:12,180
Yeah, that should have been the last one, because of the way it ends.

2036
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,180
I don't want to spoil it, but it's pretty good.

2037
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,180
Okay, yeah, don't spoil it.

2038
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:18,180
I'll, I'll, I should watch it.

2039
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:19,180
The first one's BMO.

2040
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:22,180
The second one's Marceline and Princess Bubblegarden.

2041
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:24,180
The third one's Finn and Jake.

2042
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:27,180
And then the last one is Peppermint Butler, which should have been like,

2043
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:31,180
come on, that should have been before the Finn and Jake one.

2044
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,180
I mean, I don't know how that it ends.

2045
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,180
Yeah.

2046
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:37,180
It, it, it makes sense.

2047
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:38,180
I get it.

2048
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:40,180
I get why it's like a little joke.

2049
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,180
Yeah.

2050
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:42,180
It's funny.

2051
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,180
It's cute.

2052
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,180
Yeah, it is for cute.

2053
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:45,180
Yeah.

2054
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:47,180
But those are very good.

2055
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:50,180
And everyone should watch them.

2056
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,180
Yeah.

2057
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:52,180
I forgot.

2058
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:55,180
I forgot those existed until right now.

2059
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:58,180
Finn and Jake one in particular might be one of my favorite,

2060
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:00,180
like bits of adventure time.

2061
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:02,180
I think it is just great and perfect.

2062
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,180
I started a little while ago.

2063
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:08,180
I did watch, I rewatched some of the beginning of Adventure Time.

2064
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:10,180
And it's good.

2065
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:13,180
And people say that it just makes me happy.

2066
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,180
Bad.

2067
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:17,180
People say, people say that it gets bad.

2068
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:22,180
And I'll admit there are some underwhelming episodes, but like,

2069
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:29,180
I remember even watching like late stage Adventure Time and knowing

2070
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:31,180
that like it had a reputation that like, oh, it kind of,

2071
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:32,180
it kind of gets bad.

2072
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:33,180
It goes off the deep end.

2073
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:36,180
It gets like up its own ass with its lore.

2074
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,180
Yeah.

2075
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:38,180
It's boring.

2076
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:41,180
But I remember watching Ladder Day Adventure Time and knowing that.

2077
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:45,180
People say that, but being like, nah, I'm entertained anyway.

2078
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:47,180
I'm having a great time and it rules.

2079
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,180
What I appreciate is they like commit to that lore.

2080
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:53,180
Like they still reference things like that.

2081
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:56,180
Like especially in the, in that last episode thingy that I was talking about,

2082
01:35:56,180 --> 01:36:00,180
they reference the fact that Finn is a reincarnated Comet and has like

2083
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:02,180
tons of past lives and shit like that.

2084
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:05,180
And all that weird shit that they came up with.

2085
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:08,180
And, but they do it in like a cute little like nod way.

2086
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,180
Like, yeah, it's kind of weird.

2087
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:12,180
He accepts it because he's Finn.

2088
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:14,180
So, you know, he doesn't give a shit.

2089
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:18,180
The, the, um, they really, they really just,

2090
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:24,180
they really just committed to all that weird shit and they ran with them.

2091
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:26,180
They treated it completely seriously.

2092
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:29,180
And I respect it.

2093
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:33,180
I don't love the final villain of the actual series of Adventure Time

2094
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:37,180
where it's just like some God guy that you see in one episode like earlier

2095
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:39,180
that someone summons and is bad.

2096
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:41,180
And I was like, that's kind of weird.

2097
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:44,180
Wait, I don't even, I don't even remember.

2098
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:50,180
It was a big red guy that, um, the bad bubblegum man summons or something.

2099
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,180
I think it's called Grodd.

2100
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:55,180
Oh.

2101
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:58,180
Yeah, the one, oh God.

2102
01:36:58,180 --> 01:36:59,180
Yeah, it's called Gold.

2103
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:01,180
The one that he sees like when he dies.

2104
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:02,180
Yeah.

2105
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:03,180
Yes.

2106
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:07,180
Well, he's like a, some kind of force in nature or something.

2107
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:12,180
Yeah, it's just like an Eldritch God thing, but I think that's, you know,

2108
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:16,180
I either set it up a bit more or just make it a little bit more interesting.

2109
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,180
I don't know.

2110
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:18,180
Well, he's mysterious.

2111
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:19,180
Well, he's mysterious.

2112
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:21,180
Yeah, I suppose so.

2113
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:29,180
Uh, the, the, uh, fuck, I was going to say something about, um,

2114
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:30,180
Early Adventure Time?

2115
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:40,180
I do think it gets a little too invested in the sort of like, sometimes when it was

2116
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:45,180
really going deep on like the, oh, there's a recurring cycle of fire and ice and candy

2117
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:51,180
and slime and, and we will, we will, we will explore the like reincarnated versions of

2118
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:53,180
these concepts over and over again.

2119
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:59,180
Sometimes I thought like they could just left some of that out and it would have been fine.

2120
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:07,180
I didn't really need like, oh, who was the previous, who was the previous ice person?

2121
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:08,180
Yeah.

2122
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:09,180
I don't know.

2123
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:10,180
I don't care.

2124
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:12,180
Where did the crown come from?

2125
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:13,180
I mean, whatever.

2126
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:16,180
I just assumed it was, you know, an evil crown.

2127
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:17,180
Oh, an evil.

2128
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,180
Oh, okay.

2129
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:23,180
Now I know it was an evil crown that was made, made by a guy.

2130
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:28,180
Made by an ice guy that was programmed to imprint his brain onto it or something.

2131
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:33,180
And it turns anyone into him, into a crazy version of him.

2132
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:38,180
I'm glad, I'm glad that I know that it was not just an evil crown.

2133
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:40,180
That makes you a crazy ice man.

2134
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:43,180
It's an evil crown with some other guy's personality.

2135
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:46,180
That's like, that changes, changes everything.

2136
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:47,180
Sure.

2137
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:53,180
It's a bit, what does that, what does that remind me of a bit of like, I'm gonna, I'm

2138
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:59,180
gonna explain this shit to you even if it really requires no further explanation.

2139
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:02,180
The Master Sword in Zelda has that.

2140
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:03,180
Yeah.

2141
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:08,180
In Skyward Sword, that whole game is about explaining where the Master Sword came from and who's

2142
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:09,180
in it.

2143
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,180
Oh, maybe that is.

2144
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:11,180
Yeah.

2145
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:12,180
Maybe that is what I'm thinking of.

2146
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,180
Yeah.

2147
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:15,180
A fucking, it's got that like AI lady.

2148
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:16,180
Yeah.

2149
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:18,180
That's the first example that comes into my mind.

2150
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:20,180
I didn't play Skyward Sword, but I know what you're talking about.

2151
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:26,180
And that is a good example of like, did we really need the Master Sword need a backstory?

2152
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:29,180
I mean, it's, it's worse in that case because they made a whole game.

2153
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:30,180
Yeah.

2154
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:35,180
And like, that's the kind of like, story of a whole game that you spend.

2155
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:42,180
This is just like, there's a, there's a couple extraneous episodes in like a 75 episode show

2156
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:44,180
or however many it is.

2157
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:48,180
They're doing that with Dragon Ball a lot lately where they're like, oh, we need to show more

2158
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,180
and more of Goku's dad.

2159
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,180
It's like, he doesn't matter.

2160
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:51,180
He doesn't matter.

2161
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,180
Yeah.

2162
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,180
Yeah.

2163
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:57,180
Like if in one piece they did like an entire like flashback arc about Luffy's mom, like

2164
01:39:57,180 --> 01:40:01,180
no, I don't really, you know, I don't need that.

2165
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:05,180
I haven't been, I haven't not been keeping up with one piece.

2166
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:07,180
I assumed not.

2167
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:09,180
I've been seeing a lot.

2168
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:12,180
I feel like I've been seeing more one piece discussion.

2169
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:13,180
Yeah.

2170
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:15,180
On online than usual lately.

2171
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:16,180
I see it.

2172
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:21,180
I see it come up and people are talking about what happened in the latest chapter and maybe

2173
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:25,180
I should, I don't know, kind of makes me want to maybe stay current so I can know what people

2174
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:26,180
are talking about.

2175
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:29,180
It's because the one walk is like over now, basically.

2176
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:30,180
Yeah.

2177
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:33,180
I think that everyone's like excited to see what comes next.

2178
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:38,180
The discussions come up because there's lots of like hints at what's happening in the outside

2179
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:39,180
world at the moment.

2180
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,180
So there's a lot of stuff to talk about that.

2181
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:43,180
That is, that is interesting.

2182
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:44,180
Yeah.

2183
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:48,180
Okay, I should catch up on that.

2184
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:51,180
Maybe I'll catch up with it on the train.

2185
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:53,180
Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

2186
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:56,180
Actually, I probably won't have enough time on the train, but it's okay.

2187
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:58,180
You can get like halfway there.

2188
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,180
Yeah.

2189
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:04,180
Okay, okay, okay.

2190
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:06,180
Some things are good.

2191
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:08,180
Some media properties can be good sometimes.

2192
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:09,180
Yeah.

2193
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:11,180
Adventure time, really good.

2194
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:12,180
I do love adventure time.

2195
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:13,180
It makes me smile.

2196
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:15,180
Overall, I would have to say it's really good.

2197
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:18,180
I really like that stupid mini series with Finn's mom.

2198
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:20,180
I don't know why I like that one a lot.

2199
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:23,180
The one with like the islands with the humans on it?

2200
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,180
Yeah.

2201
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:25,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2202
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:27,180
That series had a good tone.

2203
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:37,180
I didn't want to watch any of Pendleton Ward's other shows.

2204
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:39,180
No.

2205
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,180
There's like that space one.

2206
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:45,180
And then there's the space one, and there's the one on Netflix,

2207
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:47,180
which is like a drug trip thing.

2208
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:51,180
The space one about four guys in space or whatever.

2209
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:53,180
Who look like adventure time guys.

2210
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:54,180
Yeah.

2211
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:56,180
And they have like a cute mascot.

2212
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:58,180
I heard there was a new...

2213
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:01,180
Yeah, I think I heard about the Netflix one.

2214
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,180
I haven't seen it.

2215
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,180
I don't even know what it looks like.

2216
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:07,180
My friend really hates it, but it's definitely not his thing.

2217
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:09,180
So I bet I would really love it.

2218
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:11,180
Hmm.

2219
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:13,180
Is it called Midnight Gospel?

2220
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:14,180
That's the one.

2221
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:15,180
Okay.

2222
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:17,180
I saw one episode of that and I hated it.

2223
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:18,180
Okay.

2224
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:20,180
I've heard it's good.

2225
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:22,180
I've heard people tell me that it's good.

2226
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:25,180
I think it's a Marmite situation where you love it or you hate it.

2227
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,180
I think it's the...

2228
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:30,180
I saw one episode of it and I thought it sucked.

2229
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:33,180
But I don't know.

2230
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:35,180
That's exactly what my friend said.

2231
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:37,180
I've always been curious.

2232
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:39,180
I might give it a go and see.

2233
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:42,180
I...

2234
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:44,180
No, don't.

2235
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,180
I think...

2236
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:49,180
I swear I tried to go into it with an open mind.

2237
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:50,180
Okay.

2238
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:52,180
Something about the premise of it...

2239
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:54,180
irritates me.

2240
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,180
And then...

2241
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:58,180
But I was like...

2242
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,180
I'm gonna...

2243
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:00,180
But I've heard it's good.

2244
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:01,180
So I swear I'm good.

2245
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:02,180
I'm not gonna hold it against it.

2246
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:04,180
I'm gonna just see what it has to offer me.

2247
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:07,180
And I did not like what was served.

2248
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:14,180
It's like he talks to people about stuff

2249
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:20,180
and then they animate like a fantastical magical mystery space world

2250
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:21,180
over that.

2251
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:23,180
Right.

2252
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:24,180
I don't know.

2253
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:25,180
That blows.

2254
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:26,180
I hate that.

2255
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:33,180
I don't get what's cool about that at all.

2256
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,180
What if you do the drug?

2257
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,180
It make it entertaining.

2258
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:37,180
I...

2259
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:40,180
That better not be the argument for it.

2260
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:43,180
The only...

2261
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:44,180
I don't know.

2262
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:45,180
The only thing that I think...

2263
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:46,180
I mean...

2264
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:48,180
I would want like does the world that it takes place

2265
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:50,180
and does it have lore?

2266
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:53,180
But like they're not talking about that stuff.

2267
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:56,180
They're not talking about like some like fantasy world lore.

2268
01:43:56,180 --> 01:44:00,180
They're talking about like real shit in the real world.

2269
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:05,180
So why is it set in a magical like drug trip space land?

2270
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:08,180
Ben, it's a beautiful juxtaposition.

2271
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:09,180
Don't you understand?

2272
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:10,180
Is it?

2273
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:11,180
Yes.

2274
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:12,180
I mean, maybe.

2275
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:13,180
No, I don't know.

2276
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,180
Maybe, maybe.

2277
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:21,180
Well, my initial impressions have been poor.

2278
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:22,180
You can tell.

2279
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:26,180
That reminds me of like how all the gorilla songs are just like about like living in L.A.

2280
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:27,180
and being an artist.

2281
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:32,180
And then like all the music videos is just like weird wacky like alien shit happening.

2282
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:33,180
You know what?

2283
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:34,180
That's fair.

2284
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:35,180
Yeah.

2285
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:40,180
I mean, some of them are about kind of abstract things.

2286
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:41,180
That's true.

2287
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:42,180
Yeah.

2288
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:43,180
What is...

2289
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:44,180
I just like...

2290
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:46,180
What is Clint Eastwood about?

2291
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:48,180
Yeah, that's true.

2292
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:50,180
What's the one with the windmills?

2293
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:52,180
Feel Good Ink.

2294
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:54,180
What's Feel Good Ink about?

2295
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:56,180
Corporate, uh...

2296
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:58,180
Corporate.

2297
01:44:58,180 --> 01:44:59,180
Yeah, exactly.

2298
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:01,180
That's the vibe I get.

2299
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:02,180
Yeah.

2300
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:08,180
Forced happiness, I don't know.

2301
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:12,180
Uh, I haven't really, you know, I'm not like a...

2302
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:14,180
I've listened to a bunch of gorillas.

2303
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:16,180
I don't know all their songs.

2304
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:20,180
Are a lot of their songs about being an artist living in L.A.?

2305
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:25,180
Yeah, a lot of their more recent stuff have been about like...

2306
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:31,180
To me, they've come off as just about the experience of being a musician and things like that.

2307
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:32,180
Or...

2308
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:33,180
Yeah.

2309
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:38,180
And then there's the occasional abstract one where it's just nonsense.

2310
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:40,180
They all sound really good.

2311
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:41,180
Got to write what you know.

2312
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:45,180
You got to have something to draw on to like what am I going to make a song about?

2313
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:46,180
Yeah.

2314
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,180
I don't know.

2315
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:48,180
Interesting.

2316
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:49,180
I still like gorillas a lot.

2317
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:54,180
They did a whole album which was very clearly just a big criticism of the state of America.

2318
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:55,180
Oh.

2319
01:45:55,180 --> 01:45:57,180
And that kind of thing.

2320
01:45:57,180 --> 01:45:58,180
Recently?

2321
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:01,180
It was the 2017 one, I think it was.

2322
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:02,180
Humans.

2323
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:04,180
Which is good about like...

2324
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:05,180
Thing bad.

2325
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:07,180
This shit bad, yo.

2326
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:09,180
Maybe there's...

2327
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:18,180
Maybe once in a while, Midnight Gospel might sort of stumble into a conversation about some real world thing

2328
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:27,180
that like thematically really matches and resonates with some sort of like trippy imagery that they animated for it.

2329
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:29,180
I mean, I guess I could see that happen.

2330
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:32,180
It obviously doesn't happen all the time.

2331
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:33,180
Yeah.

2332
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:34,180
But maybe there are some bangers.

2333
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:35,180
I don't know.

2334
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:37,180
Yeah, whatever.

2335
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:38,180
Whatever.

2336
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:39,180
Whatever.

2337
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:40,180
Pendle some war.

2338
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:41,180
Do what you want.

2339
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:42,180
I don't give a shit.

2340
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:43,180
I don't give a watch.

2341
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:47,180
I actually didn't know he was involved in that one.

2342
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:50,180
That's the only other thing that I know he's worked on.

2343
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:55,180
Aside from that Space One, which I think was like a YouTube series.

2344
01:46:55,180 --> 01:47:00,180
I did not know that he had anything to do with that, actually.

2345
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:05,180
I knew it was that guy, Alex Hirsch, was the guy who's like voice it is.

2346
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:06,180
Ah.

2347
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:10,180
And I thought it was maybe that guy Moynihan.

2348
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:16,180
I know Moynihan is one of like the designers and animators on Adventure Time.

2349
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:23,180
I can tell that Moynihan had like a hand in the art style on Midnight Gospel.

2350
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:26,180
What does Pendleton Ward do?

2351
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:27,180
Now.

2352
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:28,180
On that.

2353
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:29,180
What's.

2354
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,180
Hmm.

2355
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:34,180
I got to find out.

2356
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:39,180
I mean, nobody writes for it.

2357
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:40,180
Co-created.

2358
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:42,180
What the fuck does that mean?

2359
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:45,180
Co-created with a guy called Duncan Trussell.

2360
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:46,180
Oh, wait.

2361
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:47,180
Duncan Trussell.

2362
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:48,180
That's the...

2363
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:49,180
Wait, shit.

2364
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:51,180
That's who I meant to say when I said Alex Hirsch.

2365
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:53,180
So who the fuck is Alex Hirsch?

2366
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:54,180
Maybe he's not involved.

2367
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:58,180
Alex Hirsch is the Gravity Falls guy, and I didn't think he was involved with it.

2368
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:59,180
Oh, yeah.

2369
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:00,180
I was looking at his Wikipedia.

2370
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:03,180
No, Duncan Trussell is the guy whose voice it is.

2371
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:04,180
Yeah.

2372
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:08,180
I saw Alex Hirsch tweeting out all the notes that he got from Disney when he was making

2373
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:10,180
Gravity Falls, which was very funny.

2374
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:12,180
Yeah, I saw some of that.

2375
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:19,180
That was a good little insight into how fucking horrible this shit is.

2376
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:20,180
Hmm.

2377
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:22,180
They're just...

2378
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:24,180
I don't remember...

2379
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:27,180
Do you remember any details?

2380
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:33,180
It was like, we're going to kick your butt, and it was like a note saying like, this phrase

2381
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:38,180
is too similar to the phrase kick your ass, and we would prefer if they said something

2382
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:39,180
else.

2383
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,180
It was like really like minor shit like that.

2384
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:43,180
They would change, and then of course...

2385
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:45,180
You alluded to a swear word.

2386
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:49,180
You didn't say a swear word, but it almost suggests one, and please...

2387
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:55,180
And Alex Hirsch's response every time was just like, you're a fucking idiot.

2388
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:57,180
Hmm.

2389
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,180
Fascinating.

2390
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,180
Yeah.

2391
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:01,180
Fascinating.

2392
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:04,180
God, I would never want to work in television.

2393
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:12,180
Yeah, I see he's created by Pendleton Ward and Duncan Tressel, so I assume that means

2394
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:14,180
Pendleton Ward.

2395
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:16,180
He made some phone calls to make it happen.

2396
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:18,180
He's like, let's make a thing.

2397
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:22,180
He met Duncan Tressel, was like, hey, Pendleton Ward, great to finally meet you.

2398
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:26,180
I have a podcast, and I'd really like to make a cartoon about it, and Pendleton Ward was

2399
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:28,180
like, yeah, okay, let me call...

2400
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:29,180
Is that what it is?

2401
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:31,180
Is it like a cartoon of a podcast?

2402
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:36,180
Let me call Moynihan, and he'll do some sketches for you, and then we...

2403
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:38,180
Okay, all right, I'll see you.

2404
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,180
Okay, bye.

2405
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,180
Yeah, it's...

2406
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:44,180
The one that I saw was he was interviewing a...

2407
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:46,180
What do you call it?

2408
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:48,180
Not an undertaker.

2409
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:51,180
A taxidermist, but like...

2410
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:54,180
What do you call it when you do like a human taxidermy?

2411
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:57,180
When you prepare a body for a funeral?

2412
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:01,180
A mummification.

2413
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:03,180
No.

2414
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:06,180
I know what you mean, but I don't know the word.

2415
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:08,180
Embarming?

2416
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:11,180
Wait, no, that's part of mummification.

2417
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:12,180
That's part of it.

2418
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:15,180
Sorry, I've got mummies on the brain.

2419
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:19,180
Okay, what...

2420
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:21,180
Hang on.

2421
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:28,180
What do you call someone who works at a funeral home?

2422
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:30,180
Mortician.

2423
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:33,180
Yes, mortician, that is the word, yes.

2424
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:37,180
Anyway, he was interviewing a mortician, and...

2425
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:41,180
I don't know, she was just describing fucking...

2426
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:45,180
What you do as a mortician, and what it means to be a mortician,

2427
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:48,180
and what her experiences at a mortician are like,

2428
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:50,180
and some of the cultural history of...

2429
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:56,180
I think she was going into civil war era funeral practices,

2430
01:50:56,180 --> 01:51:00,180
historical things that have been considered normal at certain times

2431
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:03,180
that we would consider bizarre today, etc.

2432
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:05,180
It's fine.

2433
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:07,180
It's okay, I guess.

2434
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:09,180
It's fine, but I just don't care.

2435
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:17,180
But why was it animated as they're going through some sort of space maze

2436
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:19,180
with monsters chasing them?

2437
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:20,180
I don't know.

2438
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:23,180
I didn't understand what the point of it was.

2439
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:26,180
Hang on, here's the good Gravity Falls one.

2440
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:30,180
Do you remember those two gay cops in Gravity Falls?

2441
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:34,180
They would get notes every time they were next to each other and stuff.

2442
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:38,180
Please revise the action of Blubbs putting his arm around Durland

2443
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:40,180
as noted in previous concerns that their affectionate relationship

2444
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:43,180
should remain comical versus flirtatious.

2445
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:45,180
Ah!

2446
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:47,180
Ah!

2447
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:49,180
Oh, that's good.

2448
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:51,180
That's good.

2449
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:53,180
No gayo.

2450
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:55,180
There's the one of the...

2451
01:51:55,180 --> 01:52:01,180
This is not S&P approved, where it had some writing on a poster that they made them change,

2452
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:03,180
and then they kept changing it and changing it and changing it,

2453
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:05,180
and they kept refusing it every time,

2454
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:08,180
and then they just put not S&P approved on the poster,

2455
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:11,180
and then S&P replied,

2456
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:14,180
not S&P approved has been approved.

2457
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:16,180
Wait.

2458
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:20,180
This bit is not standard and practices approved on the poster.

2459
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,180
Oh, standard and practices.

2460
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:24,180
So it was a poster on the wall?

2461
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:26,180
Yeah, it was a poster on the wall.

2462
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:28,180
Camera would have said originally, but they were made to change it,

2463
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:30,180
and they changed it to something else,

2464
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:32,180
and they wouldn't let them use that either,

2465
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:34,180
so they just kept changing it,

2466
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:36,180
and then eventually you just put not S&P approved on it,

2467
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:38,180
and then there's the classic message,

2468
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:41,180
not S&P approved has been approved by S&P.

2469
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:43,180
I see.

2470
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:45,180
Because they got away with that one.

2471
01:52:45,180 --> 01:52:47,180
I wonder if I can...

2472
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:49,180
Can I Google image search the...

2473
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:51,180
Yeah, if you just...

2474
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:53,180
It's a party invitation.

2475
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:55,180
Not S&P approved,

2476
01:52:55,180 --> 01:52:57,180
so photos better end up online.

2477
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:01,180
Yeah, okay.

2478
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:03,180
I can't remember what the original thing said.

2479
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:05,180
It's in that video that you put out.

2480
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:07,180
Yeah, that's what I want to know,

2481
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:09,180
is like what...

2482
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:11,180
They must have been some sort of

2483
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:15,180
suggestion of saucy party activities.

2484
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:17,180
It was Spin the Bottle.

2485
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:19,180
It was Spin the Bottle.

2486
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:21,180
Really? They can't mention Spin the Bottle?

2487
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:23,180
It said Spin the Bottle and punch

2488
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:26,180
at party or whatever.

2489
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:28,180
And then they were like,

2490
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:30,180
Spin the Bottle is alluding to kissing,

2491
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:32,180
which is sexual, you can't put that in.

2492
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:35,180
I think I...

2493
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:36,180
You know what?

2494
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:38,180
I think I have to vote Republican now.

2495
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:40,180
I think cancel culture has gone too far,

2496
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:42,180
and this is the fucking line.

2497
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:44,180
This is the line that breaks me.

2498
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:48,180
Yeah, but they wanted the cops to be gay then.

2499
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,180
Which side are you on?

2500
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:52,180
Ooh.

2501
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:56,180
Wait, oh shit.

2502
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:58,180
Damn it, should I hate them for being cops,

2503
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:00,180
or should I love them and unconditionally

2504
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:02,180
approve of everything they do because they're gay?

2505
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:04,180
Ah, it's too...

2506
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:06,180
Fucking Alex, her. She's a genius.

2507
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:08,180
He's twisting our minds.

2508
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:09,180
True.

2509
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:11,180
You know what? I never finished

2510
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:13,180
Gravity Falls either.

2511
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:15,180
I watched a bunch of it.

2512
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:16,180
I think...

2513
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:18,180
It's one of the best. It's one of the best ones.

2514
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:20,180
Well, there was a long hiatus,

2515
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:23,180
and I never picked it up after the hiatus.

2516
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:24,180
That's true.

2517
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:27,180
Like, in between

2518
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:30,180
Episode 10 of Season 2 and the rest,

2519
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:31,180
I think it was.

2520
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:33,180
Yeah, sounds about right.

2521
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:35,180
I think I saw like two seasons of it.

2522
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:36,180
But it was a...

2523
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:39,180
Damn, it's the last 10 episodes.

2524
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:40,180
Those are great.

2525
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:42,180
The finale is the best episode.

2526
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:44,180
It ends perfectly. It's great.

2527
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:46,180
Yeah.

2528
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:49,180
I think I maybe should have finished it.

2529
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:51,180
Maybe I will at some point.

2530
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:52,180
It's one of those...

2531
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:54,180
It's like up there with Avatar,

2532
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,180
in terms of just being like,

2533
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:56,180
oh, it's planned out from the start.

2534
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:58,180
It's only 40 episodes.

2535
01:54:58,180 --> 01:54:59,180
It's...

2536
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:00,180
Damn.

2537
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:02,180
It's exactly what it needs to be, you know?

2538
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:04,180
I hope they never touch it again.

2539
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:05,180
Don't fucking touch Gravity Falls.

2540
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:06,180
Leave it as it was.

2541
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:07,180
That's so funny.

2542
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:08,180
That's so funny,

2543
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:10,180
because it really doesn't look like that kind of show at all.

2544
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:11,180
No.

2545
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:12,180
It looks like...

2546
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:15,180
It looks like something that would go on forever, you know?

2547
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:16,180
Yeah.

2548
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:17,180
Yeah.

2549
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:18,180
And be like a...

2550
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:19,180
Oh, it's SpongeBob.

2551
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:22,180
Oh, they're at summer camp.

2552
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:24,180
They work at a shop.

2553
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:25,180
Yeah.

2554
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:26,180
Crazy things happen.

2555
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:28,180
It's a setup that could theoretically be stretched out

2556
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:29,180
for Eternity.

2557
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:30,180
Yeah.

2558
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:31,180
It has a really good story and characters,

2559
01:55:31,180 --> 01:55:34,180
and a cool villain and things.

2560
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:38,180
I like the episode with the mini-golf,

2561
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:40,180
where they show the rich bitch girl

2562
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:42,180
what's going on.

2563
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:46,180
I did see that one.

2564
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:47,180
I did see that one.

2565
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:49,180
There's a bit where the big buff golf ball

2566
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:51,180
is carrying it through the poison gas

2567
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:53,180
my new toys,

2568
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:55,180
and they don't address it.

2569
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:57,180
He just straight up does sacrifice himself

2570
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:59,180
to get the ball to the end of the course.

2571
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:01,180
Well,

2572
01:56:01,180 --> 01:56:02,180
gotta do.

2573
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:03,180
I don't know how that got passed

2574
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:04,180
standard of practices,

2575
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:06,180
but spin the bottle didn't.

2576
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:11,180
Did he do Owl House or something?

2577
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:12,180
Did he do the other show?

2578
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:15,180
Yeah, I think he did Owl House or the frog one.

2579
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:17,180
Yeah, those are two that I'm aware of,

2580
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:18,180
and I haven't seen.

2581
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:21,180
Those are two of that genre of show.

2582
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:25,180
Owl House and Amphibia are two

2583
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:26,180
Gravity Falls likes,

2584
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:27,180
and one, I guess, is about birds,

2585
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:29,180
and the other is about frogs,

2586
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:32,180
and that's all I know about them.

2587
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:35,180
Okay, I don't think Amphibia has anything

2588
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:37,180
to do with Amphibia.

2589
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:38,180
Okay.

2590
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:40,180
I think I saw a clip of them referencing

2591
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:41,180
Gravity Falls in Amphibia,

2592
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:43,180
and that's what I'm thinking of.

2593
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:45,180
Okay, whatever.

2594
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:49,180
There's like Owl House,

2595
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:51,180
Infinity Train,

2596
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:52,180
and Amphibia.

2597
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:53,180
Oh, Infinity Train.

2598
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:54,180
Didn't that get canceled?

2599
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:55,180
Yeah, I think so.

2600
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:57,180
There's all those shows that I lump together

2601
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:59,180
in my mind and get them confused constantly.

2602
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:02,180
And I feel bad about it.

2603
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:06,180
Yeah, they're all kind of sort of a...

2604
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:08,180
Happy,

2605
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:09,180
mopey, you know.

2606
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:11,180
I don't know how to describe them.

2607
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:13,180
The sort of Steven Universe.

2608
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:14,180
Yeah.

2609
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:17,180
Like comedy, action,

2610
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:19,180
but with emotions in them.

2611
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:21,180
Emotional little girl's cartoon.

2612
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:22,180
That's it.

2613
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:24,180
I guess Adventure Time is like that, too.

2614
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:26,180
Did Adventure Time just lay the groundwork

2615
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:27,180
for all of these?

2616
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:28,180
Yeah, probably.

2617
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:30,180
Yeah.

2618
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:31,180
And then Steven Universe refined it

2619
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:33,180
in a way that people really liked,

2620
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:34,180
and then these new ones

2621
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:37,180
have taken up the torch.

2622
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:38,180
Yeah.

2623
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:39,180
Yeah.

2624
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:40,180
I don't know.

2625
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:41,180
I fell off to Steven Universe

2626
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:43,180
right after the human zoo bit, I think.

2627
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:45,180
That's pretty far in, I think.

2628
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:46,180
Yeah.

2629
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:47,180
And I was like,

2630
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:49,180
I don't care anymore.

2631
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:50,180
Isn't...

2632
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:53,180
I mean, when I hear Infinity Train,

2633
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:55,180
I think about that one episode of Adventure Time

2634
01:57:55,180 --> 01:57:57,180
that has the Infinity Train in it.

2635
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:58,180
Well, Train Dungeon.

2636
01:57:58,180 --> 01:57:59,180
Yeah, that one's good.

2637
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:01,180
Yeah, like that's what I thought

2638
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:03,180
Infinity Train was about.

2639
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:04,180
Is that...

2640
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:06,180
I don't know what Infinity Train is about.

2641
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:07,180
Dungeon Train.

2642
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:08,180
I don't either.

2643
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:09,180
Dungeon Train.

2644
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:10,180
I assume it's that.

2645
01:58:10,180 --> 01:58:11,180
Dungeon Train's cool, though.

2646
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:12,180
Yeah.

2647
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:13,180
I like the episode where Finn

2648
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:14,180
falls into a pile of pillows

2649
01:58:14,180 --> 01:58:16,180
and lives out his entire life

2650
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:17,180
with pillow people,

2651
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:18,180
falls in love and has kids,

2652
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:19,180
and then he comes back

2653
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:20,180
and he's fine.

2654
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,180
Yeah, and he sees Grubb.

2655
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:22,180
Yeah.

2656
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:23,180
He was set up.

2657
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:24,180
He was set up.

2658
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:26,180
That's true.

2659
01:58:26,180 --> 01:58:27,180
Oh, yeah.

2660
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:28,180
That is where that one was set up.

2661
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:29,180
You're right.

2662
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:30,180
Yeah.

2663
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:31,180
When he lives out his whole life

2664
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:32,180
and then he dies of old age

2665
01:58:32,180 --> 01:58:34,180
in pillow world and his spirit

2666
01:58:34,180 --> 01:58:37,180
travels through dimensions past Grubb.

2667
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:39,180
Yeah.

2668
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:43,180
What's the in-between

2669
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:44,180
between Adventure Time

2670
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:45,180
and Steven Universe?

2671
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:47,180
Because those were like a long time.

2672
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:49,180
I would say probably Gravity Falls.

2673
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:52,180
Gravity Falls was like 2012,

2674
01:58:52,180 --> 01:58:53,180
or 14 it started,

2675
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:55,180
somewhere in between there.

2676
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:57,180
That sounds about right.

2677
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:58,180
I mean, I know Rebecca Sugar

2678
01:58:58,180 --> 01:59:00,180
worked on Adventure Time.

2679
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:01,180
Yeah.

2680
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:03,180
She did a lot of the hard-hitting ones.

2681
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:07,180
And a lot of the ones with like the really good music in them.

2682
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:08,180
Yeah.

2683
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:10,180
Many of the hard-hitting ones were hard-hitting

2684
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,180
because of the music,

2685
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:12,180
but not all of them.

2686
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:14,180
Everything I remember from Steven Universe

2687
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:16,180
is the good music bits.

2688
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:20,180
Those are the main things I remember from it.

2689
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:24,180
I will say my main thing on Steven Universe

2690
01:59:24,180 --> 01:59:25,180
is it has the,

2691
01:59:25,180 --> 01:59:29,180
you know the idea of like a town cast?

2692
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:30,180
Yeah.

2693
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:32,180
The town is populated by wacky weird people

2694
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:35,180
The town is populated by wacky weird characters.

2695
01:59:35,180 --> 01:59:36,180
Yeah.

2696
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:37,180
I think Steven Universe

2697
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:39,180
has the worst one of those I've ever seen

2698
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:41,180
because I don't like any of them.

2699
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:42,180
Yeah.

2700
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:45,180
I'm trying to think.

2701
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:46,180
Oh God.

2702
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:48,180
I mean, yeah, there's like

2703
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:51,180
Pizza Family and French Fry Family.

2704
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:54,180
Everybody's favorite.

2705
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:56,180
There's the Roberto guy.

2706
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:58,180
I don't even remember who that is.

2707
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:01,180
He was like the conspiracy theorist fat guy

2708
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:03,180
with the noodle hair.

2709
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:04,180
Oh, yeah.

2710
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:07,180
Yeah, he's one of the Fry people, but yeah.

2711
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:09,180
Yeah, there's conspiracy theorist guy.

2712
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:12,180
There was the people who worked in the donut shop.

2713
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:13,180
The girl was okay.

2714
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:15,180
The boy was insufferable.

2715
02:00:15,180 --> 02:00:17,180
Lars and Sadie?

2716
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:19,180
Yeah, that's them.

2717
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:21,180
I mean, I would consider them a little bit more

2718
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:24,180
than just like town-y side characters.

2719
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:27,180
They kind of have their own little arc going on.

2720
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:29,180
Yeah, they're the best ones.

2721
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:32,180
But they're the best out of those, but I hate that fucking guy.

2722
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:34,180
I hate that Lars guy.

2723
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:37,180
I never saw the Res…

2724
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:40,180
I know he gets like a spaceship later.

2725
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:41,180
What?

2726
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:43,180
Yeah, Lars and the Stars.

2727
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:44,180
Oh.

2728
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:48,180
He becomes like the captain of like a renegades

2729
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:50,180
fucking gem spaceship.

2730
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:51,180
Geez.

2731
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:52,180
Yeah.

2732
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:53,180
Oops, spoilers.

2733
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:54,180
Whatever.

2734
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:58,180
Yeah, some runaway gems from Homeworld.

2735
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:00,180
Like he becomes their leader.

2736
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:01,180
Wow.

2737
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:06,180
And I don't think I ever saw how that resolves, actually.

2738
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:07,180
Okay.

2739
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:08,180
Okay, Steven.

2740
02:01:08,180 --> 02:01:12,180
Adventure Time started in 2010.

2741
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:14,180
Gravity Falls started in 2012.

2742
02:01:14,180 --> 02:01:16,180
And Steamiverse started in 2013.

2743
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:20,180
They are just like all like writing it after each other.

2744
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:23,180
Yeah, okay.

2745
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:26,180
And what do we have now?

2746
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:28,180
What's exciting that's coming out now?

2747
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:30,180
The Owl House and Nymphobia, I guess.

2748
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:32,180
Are those still happening?

2749
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:33,180
I think so.

2750
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:34,180
Or did they end?

2751
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:35,180
Okay.

2752
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:37,180
I feel like, I don't know.

2753
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:40,180
I feel like one of them ended.

2754
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:44,180
But Owl House?

2755
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:45,180
Maybe?

2756
02:01:45,180 --> 02:01:47,180
What's that one?

2757
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:49,180
Wait a minute.

2758
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:54,180
What's the one that has the little, I think she's like Hispanic girl.

2759
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:59,180
She's like stone tosses, like banner?

2760
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:02,180
I don't know.

2761
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:04,180
Stone tosses banner?

2762
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:05,180
Yeah.

2763
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:07,180
Or maybe it was someone else.

2764
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:09,180
Is it the Owl House girl?

2765
02:02:09,180 --> 02:02:12,180
Because there's a little girl in that.

2766
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:13,180
I don't know.

2767
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:14,180
This one.

2768
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,180
Maybe?

2769
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:16,180
Who's a gay?

2770
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:18,180
I know she's a big gay.

2771
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:19,180
Her.

2772
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:22,180
I swear she was like stone tosses banner.

2773
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:23,180
Or maybe someone else.

2774
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:25,180
I don't know.

2775
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:31,180
Was it to make fun of the gays by having a lesbian character as his banner?

2776
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:32,180
I wish I knew.

2777
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:34,180
I wish I knew why.

2778
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:36,180
Maybe it wasn't him.

2779
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:38,180
But it was someone like that.

2780
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:39,180
Okay.

2781
02:02:39,180 --> 02:02:43,180
When are we getting a kid's cartoon about gay men?

2782
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:45,180
Done with lesbians, I'm sick of them.

2783
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:46,180
Where's the gay men?

2784
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:50,180
Stone toss, get his own cartoon network for adventure.

2785
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:51,180
True.

2786
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:54,180
Yeah, gay men erasure.

2787
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:56,180
In fact, all men erasure.

2788
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:59,180
There were no men in Steven Universe.

2789
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:01,180
There was a start.

2790
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:03,180
There were only women.

2791
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:06,180
It's a big fact that.

2792
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:09,180
No, they emasculated him.

2793
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:11,180
They made him.

2794
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:13,180
They force feminized him.

2795
02:03:13,180 --> 02:03:15,180
Sorry, that's why he had long hair.

2796
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:16,180
Oh yeah.

2797
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:17,180
Yeah.

2798
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:19,180
Yeah.

2799
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:21,180
But.

2800
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:23,180
His wife was taller than him.

2801
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:25,180
So yeah, that's true.

2802
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:39,180
What is, what did, what did fucking, his like, his like manager says to him that one time, like, fuck, what's the dad's name?

2803
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:42,180
I have no idea.

2804
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:45,180
I want to say.

2805
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:46,180
It's something.

2806
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:48,180
I mean, he was something universe.

2807
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:51,180
I keep thinking it's, it's Steve.

2808
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:52,180
I know.

2809
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:53,180
The main character.

2810
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:55,180
I keep wanting to say Steven Universe.

2811
02:03:55,180 --> 02:03:56,180
Because.

2812
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:57,180
Steven's dad.

2813
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:58,180
I've told you about this.

2814
02:03:58,180 --> 02:03:59,180
Greg, Greg Universe.

2815
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:00,180
Okay.

2816
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:01,180
Yeah.

2817
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:05,180
I've told you about the stupid joke my friend has where he only refers to Steven Universe as Jared Universe for some reason.

2818
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:06,180
Right.

2819
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:07,180
No, maybe.

2820
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:09,180
Me and my friend did that for a while.

2821
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:12,180
So I literally just couldn't think of him as Steven Universe for ages.

2822
02:04:12,180 --> 02:04:17,180
It's like, it wouldn't look at him and say there's Jared from Jared Universe.

2823
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:21,180
And then my brain went, his dad's called Steven.

2824
02:04:21,180 --> 02:04:23,180
Because he's called Jared.

2825
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:24,180
His dad's called Steven.

2826
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:26,180
So I had it like wrong.

2827
02:04:26,180 --> 02:04:28,180
That's the next, that's the next generation.

2828
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:31,180
I don't understand.

2829
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:38,180
But that, that his manager tells him like, like Greg, you know, why, why are you so focused?

2830
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:44,180
Like you could have lots of little women, but instead your photo, you're too hyper focused on getting one big woman.

2831
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:46,180
Base.

2832
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:48,180
Absolutely base.

2833
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:51,180
Maybe Steven Universe isn't so bad after all.

2834
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:55,180
It's, it's got some, it's got, it's got some gems.

2835
02:04:55,180 --> 02:04:56,180
Yeah.

2836
02:04:56,180 --> 02:04:57,180
Get it.

2837
02:04:57,180 --> 02:05:00,180
Fucking get it.

2838
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:01,180
True.

2839
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:02,180
That's it.

2840
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:03,180
End of the podcast.

2841
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:04,180
End of the podcast.

2842
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:05,180
It's time to go.

2843
02:05:05,180 --> 02:05:07,180
What do you, what do you think about voicemails?

2844
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:10,180
Uh, no.

2845
02:05:10,180 --> 02:05:12,180
You know what?

2846
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:15,180
I respect it.

2847
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:20,180
If you, if you honestly, I wouldn't blame you if you want to leave and not do them and I'll just do them.

2848
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:22,180
I think, I think we might be having dinner soon.

2849
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:27,180
So it might make more sense to just not, me not hanging around because otherwise.

2850
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:29,180
You know, you know what?

2851
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:30,180
That's okay.

2852
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:33,180
What, what would you, what do you even get out of them anyway?

2853
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:34,180
I don't know.

2854
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:35,180
Nothing.

2855
02:05:35,180 --> 02:05:36,180
Nothing.

2856
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:39,180
The purpose of voicemails is to abuse me.

2857
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:40,180
Yeah.

2858
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:41,180
Okay.

2859
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:45,180
I feel bad for abandoning you now, but.

2860
02:05:45,180 --> 02:05:46,180
No, I don't know.

2861
02:05:46,180 --> 02:05:48,180
It's honestly, I'll just, I'll just tear through them.

2862
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:50,180
I'll just tear through them really fast.

2863
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:51,180
Okay.

2864
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:53,180
Everybody hate, the listeners hate the voicemails.

2865
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:54,180
Nobody wins.

2866
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:55,180
So.

2867
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:59,180
Only the people who have submitted voicemails, like voicemails.

2868
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:01,180
I think that's, I think that's true.

2869
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:02,180
Yeah.

2870
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:07,180
And then they go, oh my God, it's me.

2871
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:08,180
My voice.

2872
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:09,180
I hear it.

2873
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:10,180
That's what I do.

2874
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:13,180
That's, I only listened to the PCP episodes I was on.

2875
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:14,180
The PCP.

2876
02:06:14,180 --> 02:06:16,180
And I go, oh my God, it was me.

2877
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:19,180
The PCP is like a mirror for your voice.

2878
02:06:19,180 --> 02:06:24,180
If you put your voice on it, you can hear yourself instead of seeing yourself.

2879
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:25,180
Wow.

2880
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:28,180
Oblivion Fall is posting memes.

2881
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:29,180
Oh no.

2882
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:30,180
Is he?

2883
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:32,180
He posted one meme.

2884
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:33,180
He's right.

2885
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:34,180
Yeah.

2886
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:35,180
Something about animation.

2887
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:36,180
Whatever.

2888
02:06:36,180 --> 02:06:38,180
Something about animation and how it's bad.

2889
02:06:38,180 --> 02:06:42,180
I studied animation and I decided I hated it.

2890
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:43,180
Really?

2891
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:44,180
Yeah.

2892
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:45,180
I have a degree in animation.

2893
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:46,180
Did you know that?

2894
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:47,180
You do?

2895
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:48,180
I didn't know that.

2896
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:49,180
That's what I went to university for.

2897
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:52,180
And I decided, yeah, I'm no good at this.

2898
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:53,180
And it's too hard.

2899
02:06:53,180 --> 02:06:54,180
Yeah.

2900
02:06:54,180 --> 02:06:56,180
Still, still images are actually.

2901
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:58,180
Just the way of the future, man.

2902
02:06:58,180 --> 02:06:59,180
Yeah.

2903
02:06:59,180 --> 02:07:03,180
I like animated 3D models, but I hate making them.

2904
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:07,180
And I hate drawing animation as well.

2905
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:10,180
I've never done anything with 3D models ever.

2906
02:07:10,180 --> 02:07:13,180
It's a, I don't know why I just got it.

2907
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:17,180
I just sort of clicked with me and I was okay at it.

2908
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:21,180
I did a little animation with Homer Simpson opening a box and then slamming it down and

2909
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:22,180
he was pissed off.

2910
02:07:22,180 --> 02:07:24,180
And I was like, yeah, there we go.

2911
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:28,180
One time, one time I applied for like a job.

2912
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:33,180
I found out on Craigslist or something it was like an animator job for some furry porn

2913
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:38,180
guy who I think just needed people to animate some like cartoon.

2914
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:39,180
They were not public.

2915
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:42,180
They were like for like, like subscriber only.

2916
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:46,180
Like you had to like be subscribed to his like personal website.

2917
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:51,180
And it was like, here, I'll give you, I'll give you flash puppets and like the application

2918
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:56,180
when I submitted the application, they sent me a like a box.

2919
02:07:56,180 --> 02:08:00,180
They sent me a file of flash puppets and they were like, here, here's like a quick scene,

2920
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:02,180
like a very brief little scene.

2921
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:04,180
I take these flash puppets, animate the scene.

2922
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:09,180
And I was like, okay, and I spent like a few days doing it like an idiot.

2923
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:11,180
You know, I didn't know what I was doing.

2924
02:08:11,180 --> 02:08:18,180
So of course I was not accepted for the position and he was right not to let me do that, but

2925
02:08:18,180 --> 02:08:19,180
I did try it.

2926
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:24,180
You could have made this furries personal NFTs for him.

2927
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:30,180
Who probably who knows this was some this was some guy I'd never heard of sapphire

2928
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:31,180
thing.

2929
02:08:31,180 --> 02:08:32,180
I don't know.

2930
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:34,180
I don't even remember anywhere.

2931
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:37,180
I can hear plates chinking and stuff downstairs.

2932
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:39,180
I'm going to have to scram soon.

2933
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:41,180
Well, that's okay.

2934
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:44,180
It has been people trying to come in.

2935
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:47,180
It's been lovely having you on.

2936
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:48,180
Thanks for joining me.

2937
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:49,180
Thanks for having me.

2938
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:51,180
Thanks for filling time.

2939
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:52,180
Yeah.

2940
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:53,180
Okay.

2941
02:08:53,180 --> 02:08:55,180
Well, have a good snack.

2942
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:56,180
Have a good meal.

2943
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:58,180
I will do.

2944
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:01,180
I will stop recording now.

2945
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:03,180
Good.

2946
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:06,180
These are good things.

2947
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:08,180
All right.

2948
02:09:08,180 --> 02:09:10,180
Well, I guess it's just me.

2949
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:15,180
I guess it's just me here on the pro crass natives podcast.

2950
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:17,180
Let's rapid fire.

2951
02:09:17,180 --> 02:09:19,180
These fucking voicemails.

2952
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:21,180
I pre downloaded them.

2953
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:27,180
Which I guess was kind of a waste of time since I'm listening to them by myself.

2954
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:34,180
When it's just when it's just PCP members, we can just be logged in to the speak pipe thing and just listen to them in.

2955
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:37,180
In whatever in the in browser.

2956
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:38,180
But it's okay.

2957
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:46,180
I'll post them in the chat just for Eleazar's convenience so I don't have to make a zip file of them later.

2958
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:47,180
All right.

2959
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:56,180
First one is called that face when the world kind of agreed with the Nazis.

2960
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:57,180
Okay.

2961
02:09:57,180 --> 02:09:58,180
Three, two, one, go.

2962
02:09:58,180 --> 02:10:09,180
So Ben and Gabe, we're talking about the whole like Anne Frank have white privilege thing where like they're speculating like how did the Nazis treat queer and black people.

2963
02:10:09,180 --> 02:10:15,180
And the thing is that it's wack because they did not treat queer black people very well as you might.

2964
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:16,180
That is wack.

2965
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:25,180
You know, in my conf Hitler literally blamed Jews for bringing black people to Germany to destroy the white race.

2966
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:26,180
I see.

2967
02:10:26,180 --> 02:10:27,180
Oh, I see.

2968
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:33,180
And also like the Nazis destroyed like some way ahead of its time research into a lot of queer stuff going on in Germany.

2969
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:35,180
I heard that that was the first book burning.

2970
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:37,180
It was like a trans clinic.

2971
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:39,180
And one really talks about that.

2972
02:10:39,180 --> 02:10:47,180
You're not taught about that at school, presumably because the Allied powers didn't really want the bad look of agreeing with the Nazis on something.

2973
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:51,180
So they just like shrunk it down to being only about Jews.

2974
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:52,180
Yeah.

2975
02:10:52,180 --> 02:10:54,180
That sounds right.

2976
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:58,180
That that squares with everything that I know.

2977
02:10:58,180 --> 02:11:14,180
And I mean, yeah, it is it is kind of a bummer, but I mean, you know, an entire country was like composed, maybe not majority, but like largely of people that like pretty much were down with this ideology.

2978
02:11:14,180 --> 02:11:16,180
And you know, people haven't changed that much.

2979
02:11:16,180 --> 02:11:20,180
So like, yeah, a lot of people, a lot of people felt that way.

2980
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:29,180
And it's just a numerical fact that like a lot of people still do and they probably will for a long, long time, maybe forever.

2981
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:35,180
So that's a great that's that's nice.

2982
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:41,180
Next one is called I can't get no satisfaction.

2983
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:42,180
And you know what?

2984
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:49,180
I just realized I don't actually have to count down to these because no one else is going to have to time these is just me.

2985
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:51,180
Okay, here we go.

2986
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:53,180
Ah.

2987
02:11:55,180 --> 02:11:56,180
Yes.

2988
02:11:58,180 --> 02:11:59,180
Excellent.

2989
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:17,180
Wait, really?

2990
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:21,180
Who you think you are?

2991
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:24,180
Okay, until you next time.

2992
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:25,180
Sayonara.

2993
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:51,180
But no, that's that's fair.

2994
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:55,180
Okay, next one is called furthermore.

2995
02:12:55,180 --> 02:12:56,180
Okay, here we go.

2996
02:13:18,180 --> 02:13:19,180
Okay.

2997
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:38,180
Okay.

2998
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:52,180
Just got to do the best you can do.

2999
02:13:57,180 --> 02:13:59,180
Very, that's that's very big of you.

3000
02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:02,180
Very big of you samurai.

3001
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:06,180
Okay, next one is called a song.

3002
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:08,180
No, no, I won't count down.

3003
02:14:08,180 --> 02:14:09,180
Here we go.

3004
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:14,180
What?

3005
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:18,180
Wait, I got to listen to it again.

3006
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:20,180
Turn my volume up.

3007
02:14:25,180 --> 02:14:26,180
I can't.

3008
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:27,180
I'm sorry.

3009
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:28,180
I can't make it out.

3010
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:29,180
Good.

3011
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:30,180
Good.

3012
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:31,180
Good one.

3013
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:32,180
Next.

3014
02:14:35,180 --> 02:14:37,180
Happy birthday, Ben.

3015
02:14:37,180 --> 02:14:39,180
Yeah, thanks very much.

3016
02:14:39,180 --> 02:14:41,180
Better safe than sorry, Ben.

3017
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:42,180
Okay.

3018
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:43,180
Here we go.

3019
02:14:43,180 --> 02:14:44,180
Three, two, one, go.

3020
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:45,180
Shit.

3021
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:46,180
Fuck me, Ben.

3022
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:48,180
You've been going to the toilet a lot during these podcasts.

3023
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:49,180
Has something changed?

3024
02:14:49,180 --> 02:14:53,180
Are you and well, maybe you should go doctor and get this checked up.

3025
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:54,180
I pee a lot.

3026
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:56,180
I pee a lot.

3027
02:14:56,180 --> 02:14:57,180
You know what?

3028
02:14:57,180 --> 02:15:01,180
I just I drink a lot of fluids to stay hydrated.

3029
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:04,180
I've always I've always peed a lot.

3030
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:05,180
I think so.

3031
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:07,180
I drink a lot of fluids to stay hydrated.

3032
02:15:07,180 --> 02:15:13,180
And that's on purpose because I think it will help to prevent kidney problems.

3033
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:20,180
I think I may have been insufficiently hydrating back when I had those kidney issues a couple

3034
02:15:20,180 --> 02:15:21,180
years ago.

3035
02:15:21,180 --> 02:15:27,180
So to avoid that, you know, if peeing a lot is the price I got to pay, well, well worth

3036
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:28,180
it.

3037
02:15:28,180 --> 02:15:31,180
Next one is called life.

3038
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:32,180
Okay.

3039
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:34,180
Here we go.

3040
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:38,180
You know, when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.

3041
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:40,180
But life didn't give me any sugar.

3042
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:42,180
So I go to life and I ask for some sugar.

3043
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:44,180
And it says, yeah, it's in the mail.

3044
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:46,180
Some sugar home.

3045
02:15:46,180 --> 02:15:47,180
And there it is my sugar.

3046
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:53,180
But with an invoice, I go to life and I say, I can't afford this.

3047
02:15:53,180 --> 02:15:57,180
So anyway, I'm working for some sugar.

3048
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:59,180
I didn't want for some lemons.

3049
02:15:59,180 --> 02:16:01,180
I didn't ask for life.

3050
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:04,180
Life's a bitch.

3051
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:07,180
Then why did you work for her?

3052
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:11,180
You know, if you, if you, you know, if you don't, if you hate your, if you hate your

3053
02:16:11,180 --> 02:16:15,180
jobs, if you hate working for life so much, then why don't you just work for someone

3054
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:16,180
else then?

3055
02:16:16,180 --> 02:16:17,180
Huh?

3056
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:19,180
It's the free market.

3057
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:23,180
Very drill.

3058
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:29,180
Next one is called sucks that all the cool guests vanished and died in real life.

3059
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:30,180
Yep.

3060
02:16:30,180 --> 02:16:33,180
MZ was the latest victim of that epidemic.

3061
02:16:33,180 --> 02:16:36,180
So, you know, so tragic.

3062
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:38,180
Taken from us too early.

3063
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:39,180
Three, two, one, go.

3064
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:40,180
Fuck.

3065
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:43,180
Where the fuck is Simzi and Cybert Shelling?

3066
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:45,180
Gamer's Tavern?

3067
02:16:45,180 --> 02:16:46,180
What the fuck?

3068
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:49,180
There was, they used to be on like all the, now what lies?

3069
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:52,180
You know what?

3070
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:53,180
You know what?

3071
02:16:53,180 --> 02:16:55,180
I have not asked.

3072
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:57,180
I only, I only asked.

3073
02:16:57,180 --> 02:17:04,180
I mean, people, guests are welcome to join whenever they want, but I was just talking

3074
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:09,180
to Simzi for unrelated reasons this morning and I mentioned that I was going to start

3075
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:11,180
the podcast and he was welcome to be on.

3076
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:14,180
So that's why he joined today.

3077
02:17:14,180 --> 02:17:19,180
But I just have not reached out to those other guys.

3078
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:23,180
I did a while back, I think I did ask Cybert Shelling if he wanted to be on and he was

3079
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:25,180
like, I can't do it this week.

3080
02:17:25,180 --> 02:17:26,180
I'll do it another time.

3081
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:27,180
And I was like, okay.

3082
02:17:27,180 --> 02:17:29,180
And then I never asked again.

3083
02:17:29,180 --> 02:17:30,180
And I don't know.

3084
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:37,180
I guess I just, I haven't been very proactive about reaching out to guests to be on the

3085
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:40,180
podcast because, and this is going to sound bad.

3086
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:45,180
And I, I'm sorry to say, I almost feel like I'm insulting you, the listener, by saying

3087
02:17:45,180 --> 02:17:48,180
this, but I have just not had a lot to talk about.

3088
02:17:48,180 --> 02:17:54,180
And I feel like I've been focused on working on some stuff and getting some stuff done.

3089
02:17:54,180 --> 02:18:02,180
And I kind of feel like maybe I'll have more to say to guests when I have more stuff that's

3090
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:07,180
been recently put out and maybe some more stuff that's going on, like say the Kickstarter,

3091
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:10,180
for example, or that video that I'm working on.

3092
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:12,180
I don't know if that's irrational.

3093
02:18:12,180 --> 02:18:15,180
That might be irrational.

3094
02:18:15,180 --> 02:18:17,180
But that's how I'm approaching it.

3095
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:22,180
I just haven't been asking guests very much.

3096
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:32,180
But I mean, hey, if you want someone on, tell them to come on the podcast.

3097
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:34,180
And maybe they will.

3098
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:38,180
They're any, anyone, any, basically anyone who's previously been on is welcome to come

3099
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:39,180
on anytime.

3100
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:44,180
I'm just too stupid.

3101
02:18:44,180 --> 02:18:45,180
End of sentence.

3102
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:46,180
Okay.

3103
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:53,180
This one is called, well, it's an Imgur link.

3104
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:57,180
So let's see what's going on there.

3105
02:18:57,180 --> 02:18:58,180
Okay.

3106
02:18:58,180 --> 02:19:04,180
Ben and Nate, the guy who shows up every fucking episode.

3107
02:19:04,180 --> 02:19:09,180
Oh, it's a, oh, because Nate used to be the one that showed up every, every fucking episode

3108
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:10,180
and now it's me.

3109
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:15,180
Well, I was, I was always, there was, you know, there was, you know,

3110
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:18,180
there was a stretch there.

3111
02:19:18,180 --> 02:19:26,180
There was a stretch there where I was not on as much, which was, I don't know if, I think

3112
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:28,180
I've mentioned this before.

3113
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:33,180
That was because I had a terrible girlfriend who was like really weird about it and would

3114
02:19:33,180 --> 02:19:37,180
like get angry at me if I did things at certain times.

3115
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:44,180
And PCP was something that she would basically hated whenever I did it.

3116
02:19:45,180 --> 02:19:48,180
For some reason.

3117
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:52,180
So for a while there, I was not as much on the, other than that though, I think I was

3118
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:58,180
one of the more, one of the more regular people.

3119
02:19:58,180 --> 02:20:04,180
Other than Nate, who was genuinely on like basically every episode for the first, or

3120
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:07,180
almost every episode for the first, like probably 200 episodes or something.

3121
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:09,180
Who else was more consistent than me?

3122
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:11,180
I don't think anyone.

3123
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:16,180
But I mean, anyway, point, point taken, I guess.

3124
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:18,180
I mean, I guess you're just right.

3125
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:20,180
I agree with the meme.

3126
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:27,180
Next one is, oh boy, it's another, it's another Son of a Glitch.

3127
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:29,180
Let's fucking go.

3128
02:20:29,180 --> 02:20:33,180
My favorite show on the internet, Son of a Glitch.

3129
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:37,180
Welcome to my favorite show on the internet, Son of a Glitch.

3130
02:20:38,180 --> 02:20:40,180
Today's glitch is my bag of chips.

3131
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:45,180
My bag of chips is green, but yesterday my bag of chips was orange.

3132
02:20:45,180 --> 02:20:51,180
Who is to say that tomorrow my bag of chips might be blue or pink?

3133
02:20:51,180 --> 02:21:17,180
This would be much better to animate for, in a midnight gospel style than fucking, oh,

3134
02:21:17,180 --> 02:21:19,180
my job is an undertaker.

3135
02:21:19,180 --> 02:21:24,180
And in the Civil War, they used to stuff people with straw when they died.

3136
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:26,180
Isn't that weird?

3137
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:32,180
Just, that's what I have to say about that.

3138
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:40,180
Next one is, oh, the next one is called Multiversus is pretty good.

3139
02:21:40,180 --> 02:21:45,180
You can beat up Steven Universe.

3140
02:21:46,180 --> 02:21:47,180
Alright, posting that.

3141
02:21:47,180 --> 02:21:48,180
Here we go.

3142
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:50,180
Three, two, one, go.

3143
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:56,180
I realize I can send many messages at the same time instead of multiple messages.

3144
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:57,180
Yeah, I mean, technically you can do that.

3145
02:21:57,180 --> 02:22:01,180
Make myself send something to make it funny.

3146
02:22:01,180 --> 02:22:05,180
So one, have you seen all the Lego movies?

3147
02:22:05,180 --> 02:22:06,180
Lego movie?

3148
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:07,180
I saw the first one.

3149
02:22:07,180 --> 02:22:08,180
Lego movie.

3150
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:09,180
Two, second part.

3151
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:10,180
Batman.

3152
02:22:10,180 --> 02:22:12,180
No, just the first one.

3153
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:13,180
It was good.

3154
02:22:13,180 --> 02:22:14,180
Lego Batman?

3155
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:15,180
No.

3156
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:16,180
Ninjago?

3157
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:17,180
I think that's it.

3158
02:22:17,180 --> 02:22:21,180
They're all top tire animation things.

3159
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:23,180
The first one looks really good.

3160
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:25,180
Also, two, how do you draw?

3161
02:22:25,180 --> 02:22:33,180
I have a tablet thing, but it feels so weird comparing to actual paper and pencil.

3162
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:35,180
What do I do?

3163
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:36,180
Yeah.

3164
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:43,180
I used to sketch in a sketchbook.

3165
02:22:43,180 --> 02:22:51,180
And then once I got my Wacom bamboo, I just used it all the time.

3166
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:55,180
I just got myself accustomed to the bamboo by using it.

3167
02:22:55,180 --> 02:23:04,180
And then when I got a Cintiq, I didn't use the Cintiq for a long time because I was more accustomed to the bamboo.

3168
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:09,180
So I would use the shitty bamboo instead, even though I had this much more sophisticated device.

3169
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:15,180
But then at some point, I was like, I'm just going to start using it, just going to start practicing with it.

3170
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:21,180
And pretty quickly, I was like, OK, this is actually way more convenient.

3171
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:25,180
This is way more good.

3172
02:23:25,180 --> 02:23:31,180
So yeah, you just got to learn how to use it.

3173
02:23:31,180 --> 02:23:33,180
I mean, there's nothing wrong with drawing on paper.

3174
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:35,180
It's a bit more inconvenient.

3175
02:23:35,180 --> 02:23:38,180
You've got to scan it and stuff to post it.

3176
02:23:38,180 --> 02:23:43,180
But just get a scanner if you like that sort of thing.

3177
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:47,180
That's totally fine.

3178
02:23:47,180 --> 02:23:50,180
Next one is voice.

3179
02:23:50,180 --> 02:23:53,180
It's just called voicemail.

3180
02:23:53,180 --> 02:23:55,180
All right, here we go.

3181
02:23:55,180 --> 02:24:00,180
If you could instantly learn any language, what language would you choose?

3182
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:04,180
I mean, I don't know, my answer is boring.

3183
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:11,180
I'll probably just pick whichever one the most people speak, Cantonese.

3184
02:24:11,180 --> 02:24:15,180
I don't care.

3185
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:17,180
I guess maybe Spanish.

3186
02:24:17,180 --> 02:24:20,180
I kind of, I speak a little Spanish.

3187
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:23,180
I took it for years and years in high school.

3188
02:24:23,180 --> 02:24:26,180
So yeah, I'll probably just pick Cantonese.

3189
02:24:26,180 --> 02:24:30,180
More people speak that than Mandarin, right?

3190
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:31,180
Yeah, whatever.

3191
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:35,180
Just whatever lets me communicate with the most people.

3192
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:37,180
I don't care.

3193
02:24:37,180 --> 02:24:43,180
Other than that, I have no particular proclivities.

3194
02:24:43,180 --> 02:24:45,180
Next one is called redash.

3195
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:47,180
Sorry, that's such a boring answer.

3196
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:49,180
I'm sorry, it's lame.

3197
02:24:49,180 --> 02:24:50,180
But that's me.

3198
02:24:50,180 --> 02:24:55,180
Next one is called redash.

3199
02:24:55,180 --> 02:25:02,180
Yo, Ben, you've been talking a lot about Mega Man and specifically like how many games there are in each sub-series of Mega Man and stuff like that.

3200
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:07,180
And I'm surprised that in all of that, this one thing hasn't come up.

3201
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:11,180
So I'm going to assume you don't know and probably break your heart live on air.

3202
02:25:11,180 --> 02:25:19,180
There was a Mega Man Legend 3 that was made almost to completion and then just never released for really dumb corporate reasons.

3203
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:21,180
So I'll have fun with that.

3204
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:24,180
PS, I thrash on your Ben Solo cast.

3205
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:26,180
I thrash upon it.

3206
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:27,180
Get punk perfect.

3207
02:25:27,180 --> 02:25:28,180
Pop pop.

3208
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:29,180
Kind of true.

3209
02:25:29,180 --> 02:25:30,180
Park Boys is cringe.

3210
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:31,180
Govate piss you.

3211
02:25:31,180 --> 02:25:32,180
Cop kiss her.

3212
02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:33,180
Kind of.

3213
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:34,180
It is at this point a solo cast.

3214
02:25:34,180 --> 02:25:38,180
No, why would you think that I don't know that?

3215
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:40,180
No, I am aware.

3216
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:44,180
I didn't know it because I never played the Legends games before.

3217
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:48,180
But now I played the first one and I was looking into the second one.

3218
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:56,180
And yes, I am aware that there was a 3 that was cancelled way later.

3219
02:25:56,180 --> 02:25:59,180
And I was not sure why it was cancelled.

3220
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:03,180
I assumed it was bullshit and apparently indeed it is.

3221
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:04,180
And that's...

3222
02:26:05,180 --> 02:26:06,180
Yeah.

3223
02:26:09,180 --> 02:26:10,180
Seems terrible.

3224
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:16,180
It seems like really awful and tragic and senseless.

3225
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:22,180
But yes, I am aware and it's a bummer.

3226
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:29,180
I will play 2 and then I will regret and then I will probably be sad that I don't have a

3227
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:31,180
third one to play.

3228
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:36,180
Maybe I'll do that this week if I get the chance.

3229
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:37,180
Good voicemail.

3230
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:42,180
The next one is called a very demanding voicemailer.

3231
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:43,180
Where did I put that?

3232
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:44,180
Here we go.

3233
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:46,180
Here we go.

3234
02:26:46,180 --> 02:26:47,180
Okay.

3235
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:48,180
3, 2, 1, go.

3236
02:26:48,180 --> 02:26:49,180
Fuck.

3237
02:26:49,180 --> 02:26:50,180
No Nate.

3238
02:26:50,180 --> 02:26:51,180
No Watch.

3239
02:26:51,180 --> 02:26:52,180
No Tom.

3240
02:26:52,180 --> 02:26:53,180
No Watch.

3241
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:54,180
No Daboo.

3242
02:26:54,180 --> 02:26:55,180
No Watch.

3243
02:26:55,180 --> 02:26:56,180
You're gonna be not watching.

3244
02:26:56,180 --> 02:26:57,180
No Nate.

3245
02:26:57,180 --> 02:26:58,180
No Watch.

3246
02:26:58,180 --> 02:26:59,180
A Lot.

3247
02:26:59,180 --> 02:27:00,180
No Jesse.

3248
02:27:00,180 --> 02:27:01,180
No Watch.

3249
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:02,180
No Munchie.

3250
02:27:02,180 --> 02:27:03,180
No Watch.

3251
02:27:03,180 --> 02:27:04,180
No Munchie.

3252
02:27:04,180 --> 02:27:05,180
No Watch.
