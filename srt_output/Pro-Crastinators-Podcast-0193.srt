00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
Welcome, welcome, welcome, one and all to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy ever.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,780
Dun-nun-nun-nun-nun-nun-nun. We've got Tom Oliver.

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,920
Hello.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,600
Gibbontake.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,160
Radcon 4.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,640
Oh no, he didn't. His best say's he spilled the beans.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
What do you mean Radcon 4?

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,400
Well, what what we're it all started back in the summer of 86 talking about we're doing we're making it happen

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,900
We're making right for it's gonna be a real

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,060
We're gonna do it Radcon for real in March, right? Yeah, right come on you. Yeah. Yes

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,140
Yeah, I mean fuck it present time of recording a lot of the in like this very

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,620
Specifics are not ironed out, but we are planning to do it in March

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,620
hopefully in Virginia and

14
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,340
It's gonna be based around the idea of like spring break

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,780
Students still where where the PCP University students and we're on spring bake a break in like a beach

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:21,120
Spring bake may know what I'm saying, bro. We have the we have the house picked out or we have a house tentatively picked out

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,140
Yeah, and let's let's sell it. It's a it's like a beach

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,460
Yes, on the beautiful god. What if we don't I mean, I hope we get it. So yeah, we picked out. Yeah, it's great

19
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:40,180
It's on the fucking beach. It's a beautiful. I found it. I am responsible. I saw the listing and was like hey nice value

20
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,640
It's actually cheaper than the last place. Yeah, and on the fucking beach, which makes me go. Yeah

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,220
I'm surprised because more of us live in Boston

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:57,420
So I thought that we should do it here because we would save on travel costs, which is true

23
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,900
but yeah, yeah, but

24
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,740
Rental costs are lower in Virginia. So I kind of think it doesn't make much difference and it probably evens out and

25
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,420
Honestly, I want to go on a trip. I want to go on vacation. Yeah

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,380
Yeah, I'm gonna get on the plane and make us my summer getaway to sunny Virginia Beach

27
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,980
Tropical paradise

28
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,500
But yeah, but anyway, yeah, let's talk about talk about like little hints little hint

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,980
Oh, let's can we say the name the name we have in general? We have well

30
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:39,780
We're not 100% settled on it. Are we it's definitely rad corn for something rad corn for paradise or red corn for paradise

31
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,580
We were looking at the beach house and we thought that like a tropical getaway paradise

32
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,020
The theme would be pretty funny in it's a tropical paradise getaway

33
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,460
But also we have to be in school because we're bad children who didn't

34
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,580
Delinquents and we have to listen to a bunch of really great lectures

35
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:05,180
But also it's Virginia in March and the beach will be miserable and the water will be ice cold and we will probably suffer a lot

36
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:13,100
Here's the funniest part is that we're thinking of maybe doing a sexy swimsuit calendar

37
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,700
Like on the beach of all of us. Yep. These were these were all ideas

38
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,380
These are all ideas. We were tossing around that there might be a stretch goal for the Kickstarter

39
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,180
The calendar is a great idea

40
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,940
for only for only the highest and most dedicated donors

41
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,380
Because I don't want anyone to fucking see that shit

42
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,180
It's gonna be good. I'm gonna buy a wig. I'm gonna buy a wig and I'm just gonna be an anime girl. Oh

43
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,580
That's a good idea. I don't want to oversell it

44
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,100
But just picture all of us and your favorite anime swimsuit

45
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,900
I already have the fucking Ryuko Matoi like thing that I wore on that one time

46
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,740
True, but that's not a swimsuit. That's it. Well, you know, it's it's a school suit. It's it's it's it's got a skirt, you know

47
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,940
It sounds good as opposed to the Radcon 3 arena

48
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,140
We're all like our weaponry with our guns instead sexy pin-up girls. I guess I guess I better

49
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,980
I guess I better do stick to keto real hard so I can have my beach body ready. Oh, yeah, you better fuck

50
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,780
Yeah, you better you want to have like a like a

51
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,220
Comeback from fat Ben the last time

52
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,060
Yeah, I mean

53
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,220
Unironically for ever since Radcon 2 or 3 I have been thinking God, I can't look like that

54
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,860
For I can't do it

55
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,620
It's unacceptable on that. Yeah, true. There's been a transformation. I can I can I can always succeed more

56
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:53,140
True you can always be thin. I was yes. Look, you can always be better. Mmm. So until you're in the Skeleton War

57
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,140
You can always be

58
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,540
So

59
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:05,300
The lectures, right? Yeah, the lectures are to my thinking the thing that people I mean, they're the things that I mean for me

60
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,500
They're my most popular content. I think same. I think that's true across. Okay. I didn't know if it was true across the board

61
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,860
But yeah, I'm not surprised people love the lectures. So me personally. I'm double. I'm gonna do at least to I'll do at least

62
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,220
I'll do more if I can stomach it and if anyone anyone will stand for me to do so

63
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
I'll do them all

64
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,300
And I thought that like I thought it would be funny. I thought it would be funny if we

65
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,780
Actually had I've said this to you guys but for the audience

66
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,100
I thought it'd be funny if we actually had like a class itinerary

67
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,060
That we like like we get there and we've got it all figured out like oh on Monday

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,260
Professor fucking best man is doing a lecture on

69
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,860
Dogs in the media and and and at 6 p.m. Hippo's mates are running the

70
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,420
Students are doing the lectures hippos doing one on birds under the sea and I

71
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,820
Mean, I think we can hint or like just like show what the lectures are gonna be about right? Yeah, I mean, I don't mind

72
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,540
I'm sure everyone knows I've been saying it forever. I'm gonna do the Chris follow Chris Chan follow-up

73
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,900
I also want to do one on Jennifer Diane writes

74
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:24,100
And her comics because I think those are neat and I've just got I discovered sort of an arc

75
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:32,020
I discovered sort of like a weird like sort of a weird like history arc that ties in with the thing that she's best known for

76
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,020
Which is the coca-ro-wish comic

77
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,820
Right and how that it's all part of a broader story that I think is kind of neat

78
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,700
So yeah, those two and maybe others. I don't know. I know I talked in the past about maybe doing a

79
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,260
Df and Strix but like yeah, and I think that would be funny

80
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,380
But what sucks about that is that I would have to watch like fucking thousands of hours of like

81
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,100
D&D podcasts, and I just don't know if it's worth it

82
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,020
Yeah, that's a big oof. Yeah, it's not a good look in 2019

83
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Wait fuck it's 2020

84
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
Even worse

85
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,420
This look is getting more and more yikes by the second

86
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,580
I'm doing it. I'll probably do exactly one lecture

87
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,340
And I'll just say it's relevant to the setting

88
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,380
I guess we'll say where we're at and I'm thinking of things as I can do

89
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,940
Ah, sand. You're gonna talk about how it's Russian course

90
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,540
Do we know what it is? Have you told us?

91
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,780
I'm sure I have. I'm sure and I think I might even said it publicly, but

92
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,540
Because I forget. You know with the ocean in the background with the sandy shore on this

93
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,340
Well, you know it might be relevant. We'll see. Kingdom Hearts

94
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,580
Yeah, that is Kingdom Hearts relevant. The first level of Kingdom Hearts

95
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,820
I guess I could always I was thinking of doing like a Kingdom Hearts like two

96
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,140
I guess I could do that, but there's not that there's only one game effectively worth of story

97
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,020
And like I don't know it could do like a mini lecture that's like 30 minutes long

98
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,260
It makes that I think it makes worth it. I think it's where I think it makes sense

99
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,900
I mean like you did this big you did this big Kingdom Hearts lecture. It got really popular

100
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,660
And now there's a new game. It's like the final game in the series is wrap wraps it up. There's new context

101
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,980
Why not do I mean you've already done follow-up videos to the lecture. Yeah, maybe it's true

102
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,940
Maybe it should just be a follow-up rather than lecture number two like it's like it's like a

103
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:39,500
Like a supplementary class. Yeah extra credit extra credit. Yeah, not extra credits like the actual my favorite YouTube channel

104
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:46,020
No, yeah, no, not them they made video that was cringe and I saw people say that it was cringe

105
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,820
It's it's true live it down. It's it's not it's not wrong. Well, I'll I'll keep you nice post

106
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,940
Well, we'll see but I mean the Kickstarter from the time of when this comes out

107
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,300
We're hoping the Kickstarter is like up and running like within a week of when you hear this. So

108
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Maybe keep your fucking wallets open boys. That's

109
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,820
Times of the essence considering the time is kind of of the essence because we want to do it over over spring break

110
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,260
Which is I'll just give you the dates. I believe it's March 6 to 13th is

111
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,140
Munchy spring break. So it's framed around that with like the weekends or whatever. Oh shit

112
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:33,220
I just realized on February like the the PCP dating sim will be out. Oh Valentine's Day. That's true

113
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:41,940
We created PCP dating sim scenes in real life guys. We could all like I'm sure there'll be like a live stream

114
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,580
Set that we could we could just play the game. We could play that. Oh my god

115
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,220
As the PCP. Oh my god, that's a great idea. That's that's a real good

116
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,620
It's gonna be there's gonna be another role rumble if we can get that working again. Hopefully we can we it's a it's a necessity

117
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,540
It's a tradition. Yeah, so we he's gonna be video games and anime, you know your things you're like

118
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,660
Fuck yeah, fuck wait. What's it gonna say? Oh? Oh?

119
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,380
Let's discuss the fact that everything costs way more than we thought last time and we lost

120
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,580
Even though we hit all our stretch goals. We ended up losing money

121
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,060
that we did

122
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,260
That okay, primarily it was because of the because all of you motherfuckers live

123
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:32,100
Internationally and destroyed us with a thousand dollars in shipping costs that we did not see they're even worse than immigrants

124
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:39,220
They're just plain foreigners. They couldn't and that's just one of these goddamn foreigners just gonna emigrate to my goddamn country

125
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,900
It's already so easy how much easier can we make it for you to hop the border? Jesus Christ

126
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,900
We're giving you free shit and everything. Just come over here. Take my fucking job. Just save me the goddamn postage

127
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,620
Okay, so let us so so last time we asked for five thousand eight hundred dollars for rad con three

128
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:07,140
Oh sweet as we broke it down understood it this time, okay, because because some unnamed unmentionable

129
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,000
bureaucratic fools were in charge of rad con twos

130
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,900
Finances and whatnot not a godlike mathematical machine such as yours truly who documented every expense and whatnot

131
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,140
We have the facts and the she showed me the spreadsheet. It's a nightmare. I can't understand it

132
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:30,220
Yeah, it was developed that that spreadsheet was developed for the very specific purpose of just identifying who was owed what money

133
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,940
So it's not optimized for just I didn't like fucking counting up all the expenses

134
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
I should say not sir

135
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,380
Okay, okay, but that being said

136
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,620
Now that we actually know what like ten days in a place having rad con

137
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,500
We know what it costs and shall I base how shall I just say the number shall I just say what we're looking for

138
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,700
Fucking go for it. Yeah, all right with all the expenses

139
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,300
We all lost money with when accounting for flight food for all this stuff

140
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,980
So we have we've pretty much reverse engineered

141
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:09,540
How much we need to just break even to get like six or seven of us based on like how much things cost last time

142
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,420
That's right, including like food if we just want to not lose any money

143
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,420
Yeah, we would ask for

144
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:21,180
Considering like the 10% fee that Kickstarter asked for we're gonna ask for right about ten thousand dollars

145
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,220
That's how much it costs, you know to make the whole thing happen. You know, maybe we don't

146
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Maybe we shouldn't include food costs. Maybe maybe that's not necessary

147
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,660
Like we have to eat

148
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,420
I think it was like a couple hundred for the whole we're talking about a couple hundred for the whole 10

149
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:43,420
It's like ten days of just get a giant bag of rice for like ten dollars. That's all we'll eat

150
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,380
That's not keto. No, it's not well. Well, listen, this is how I'm thinking about it

151
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,460
Oh, I'm thinking about it overall the way that we did it last time

152
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,300
We yeah, we just way undervalued everything and of course that this number is including like making stretch goals

153
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,180
Shipping them out, which is like a thousand dollars just by itself to do that shit

154
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,980
And you know, we've got to incorporate all those into it

155
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,020
Like we can do things like not worry about like the food costs and whatnot

156
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:14,620
But all that means is that we're just putting the cost of this time on like us as individuals and look that's fine

157
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,820
Well, if you want to like pay for things out of our own pocket, that's okay

158
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,900
I'm just saying I'm just saying that we would be buying food whether we were at Radcon or not

159
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,780
I mean, that is true that that is true

160
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,340
You're not wrong about that and so I mean maybe what I would have that's like a that's like a quibble

161
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,060
That's like a pretty I mean like even if we took food out we'd be charging like

162
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,420
9,500

163
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:43,380
It's not it's not like a deal breaker break huge difference and I mean when we analyze it

164
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,020
I mean a lot of us spent tons of time after Radcon 3 working on extensive

165
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:54,580
Complicated editing projects and the man hours involved in those alone. Oh, okay, let me let me let me talk

166
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Let me talk about that so um

167
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:02,380
Yeah, ten ten paces and draw right was a massively complicated video to edit

168
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,220
I mean by my state it was it was by far the most complicated video. I've ever edited it took me like

169
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,740
Several months working on it on and off. It was a nightmare

170
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,100
And I didn't make any money off of it

171
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,540
Like like that was that was just like that was like probably like

172
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,260
60 or 70 hours of like totally unpaid labor and I will not do it again

173
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,260
Yes, and the same with t-bat resurrection was great. I'm glad it exists, but that arc is closed

174
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm not doing that again at least not for free if someone paid me. That's a different story

175
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:42,100
You know I would really like there to be like a ten paces and draw a stretch goal so that I would yeah

176
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,220
Yeah, that's what like I would I'm not saying I would never edit it again, but I will not do it for free

177
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,260
I'm sorry. I don't I don't think that much work for for free is like reasonable

178
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,500
So I don't feel like I don't feel like it's unreasonable for me to say I would need a budget

179
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,260
Allotment to put that amount of work in

180
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,900
Yeah, I mean I would like to do something with ten paces to draw because now that like

181
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,860
We could probably plan it out better and like we could do it better

182
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,020
And and like you actually screen record so like we could have footage of the drawings coming together and stuff like that

183
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,940
Because like munch is gonna have an iPad. I have an iPad. I have another tablet computer

184
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,620
So like we'd have we'd have abilities to do things and we could I really like ten paces and draw

185
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,580
I feel like the audience response was

186
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:33,300
I don't know did people like positive but not explosive hot like they like some people liked it and some people didn't give a shit

187
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,620
So like, you know, it had its it had its fans

188
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,900
I mean lectures are the meat and potatoes of Radco, you know, if you're gonna probably be doing a lot of that's

189
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:50,140
That's where my focus is that but I mean, I still want to be I do want to be uploading like, you know, just stupid

190
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:56,260
Vlogs and just like of course bullshit. Yeah, I mean, I I think we've discovered the perfect formula

191
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,580
In terms of being in a place the perfect formula is

192
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,780
Getting a place just like Rad country a big beautiful house that we can do stuff

193
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,900
And there's plenty of rooms to create things and goof around and whatever do whatever the fuck we want as late as we want and

194
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,220
We're all there to work for like a dedicated period of time

195
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,780
there is as few distractions as possible and

196
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:22,380
And we just put ourselves in just a creative mode and we get to see our friends for you know, a good 10 days

197
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,420
It's really it's the best environment to do it how valuable having the house the arena

198
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,700
For last for icon. It was so good. It allowed so many things happen simultaneously

199
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,940
Yeah, yeah, we were talking about like we were talking about saving money by doing it at Digi's place

200
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,860
But like it's yeah, it's wouldn't be that it's not it's theoretically possible

201
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,980
But it would be I say terrible we would be crammed in there

202
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,940
There would be no free space like the thing about the house that we rented was like they had the like at night

203
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,940
Like the basement was empty you could go

204
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:00,420
Yeah, like like at any given time you could go and like anyone could go somewhere and do something themselves and not bother another person

205
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,980
I mean that was never happened to paint the picture because like you Nate you and

206
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,460
Give we're downstairs recording pottycast and then we were upstairs running streams pretty much constantly

207
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,020
And then while the stream was going on I think at some point we were recording something in the kitchen as well

208
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,340
So there was just there were like three things going on at once just because of that space was there

209
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:27,780
It was just and then like like ben was saying the basement being available like the whole mining at night thing happened with those two or three videos

210
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,100
Right, right would not have happened without it

211
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:36,180
So it was just it was just so much stuff that happened at radcon 3 just because the space allowed them to all

212
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,740
Gile at the same time god

213
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Yes, I guess we should mention who is

214
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,700
Definitely coming to this if yes sure sure so it's all four of us

215
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,180
And digi and munchie

216
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,260
Anyone else and victor as camera and victor of course victor will be there

217
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:00,660
Uh getting the the perfect shots the succulent visuals victor victor and his camera are such assets to uh to radcon

218
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,780
I mean if not for the lectures as well as other stuff

219
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,580
If anything, I wish we had another camera man, but hey, what can you do one's uh one's pretty uh two camera man

220
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,340
Would make such a difference for like, um

221
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,620
For something like 10 paces 10 paces. Yeah. Yeah

222
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,140
You you were always uh, uh, what's the word uh being saying how unfortunate was you didn't have more b rolled

223
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,300
No, uh, honestly like yeah without b roll it almost

224
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,260
It really handicapped it

225
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,700
Yeah, yeah, um, you can't do those like those uh what do they call it the fucking like those uh fear factors

226
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,580
Shots of like where someone's lecturing like I hit a really tough time

227
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,380
And they do that like the close soon with a dun dun unlike a totally neutral face right a participant

228
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,700
You know create the narrative. Yeah, that's the good shit. I mean, I wonder if we could get

229
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,300
Someone to I mean does victor only have one camera?

230
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,220
Would he only be and could we get someone to like do b roll for just like one day?

231
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,580
Maybe let's just say we're doing 10 bases and draw just an example

232
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,940
Maybe one of I mean, I probably wouldn't be in it. I mean, I maybe could be a judging. I don't fucking know

233
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,260
But like I could I'm not I'm no cameraman

234
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,940
But maybe one of us like could do that role of trying to get b roll footage while it's going on

235
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,340
I don't know if he has a second camera, but if he did something to think about I suppose

236
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,580
Yeah, and because victor doesn't live far away. We've got access to his uh, oh, yeah

237
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,220
He must he must have more like like at his since his house will be there

238
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,580
Maybe I don't even trust any of us with the camera though. I mean those are expensive pieces of equipment

239
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,580
I mean since we'll be maybe

240
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,540
Like maybe like maybe like hope maybe hope could do it

241
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,580
Maybe hope could carry a second camera or may or someone. I don't know just get someone just for just for that one

242
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,180
Just for that one event

243
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:47,460
Yeah, victor's sick like billion-dollar camera and then all the b roll is just shot on an iphone handycam or webcam

244
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,460
On my iphone

245
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,020
Unregistered hypercam to converted compressed

246
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,980
We could like sell a tape like in the wrong aspect ratio. It's like vertical

247
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,660
Yeah, we could sell a tape like a gopro to the ceiling and it can act like security cam footage

248
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,300
Oh, that's true. Honestly. Honestly. Yes. I want that

249
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,500
Hey, do you guys all still have your go pros? I do. No wait, that's unironically a great idea

250
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,740
Okay, yes, please and I'll put and I'll make it like black and green and make it look like night camera footage, right?

251
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,340
And I'll make it look like

252
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,340
The

253
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
It'll be like

254
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,500
Yeah, just all over the house. They're just live streaming constantly

255
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,900
I definitely want to film like a lot of stupid vlogs

256
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,700
Wandering around on the beach, perhaps drunk, perhaps high and attacking the ocean

257
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,060
Oh, I want to spend time with I love the beach so much. I was saying it's gonna be cold. It's gonna be

258
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,940
I'm prepared. I'm prepared

259
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,860
Uh, I I was saying that I'm sure that at least one night of rad con. I will get

260
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,700
plastered

261
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,620
Uh, and you mind you must promise to turn the cameras off

262
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,500
We all film it, but wait, there's no promises. There's no promises that it will or will not go online

263
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:15,780
If it gets funny enough if it gets too embarrassing, you're I'll I will swear a blood oath against you

264
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:23,460
Uh, it'll be worth it. Okay, understandable. All right. Hey speaking of endorsements. This is unrelated, but I just got a message from

265
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:32,500
Uh, the devu who said very quality shovel night video and he said quote just doing based chad king things is his favorite line

266
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,420
Thanks devu

267
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
Appreciate that. All right unrelated

268
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,980
I call that an endorsement of rad con for if ever there was one. Oh, yeah, dude. Oh, yeah

269
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:49,620
There's gonna be probably content recorded there. Oh, yeah, probably all our fucking weirdo goofy retarded shows will be featured

270
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,100
They could be if I can chibi barkers. There's definitely gonna be you know, guys

271
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,820
I'm just putting it out there. I'm just telling you right now

272
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,980
$15,000 stretch goal. We get jeff through in the building guys

273
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:08,900
10 late out 10 late is in the building people. Please. It's happening. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Please. Can we

274
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,420
Where does he live?

275
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
Uh, Canada like Vancouver

276
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,900
Fuck yeah, all candidacies in the same city. Okay. Well, I'll get him a horse. I don't know

277
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,140
Also, I lied, but maybe we could ask him anyway. That'd be funny. That would be epic. Uh, how sick would that be?

278
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
I'll ask him. Pretty great

279
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:36,420
Dude, what if jeff through comes down to do a lecture like if he has an interesting topic that might actually be cool

280
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,580
If he wants to I'd say he's welcome. I mean, yeah

281
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,900
Absolutely, I suspect there may be some personnel differences between some of the members of the show

282
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:57,460
No, that'd be so great. We we bring in we bring in jeff through as the exchange student who comes in mid-arp to shake everything up

283
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
Damn

284
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,540
That's some good stuff. That's some good stuff. See it's like he it's season two and he's he's the poochie

285
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,580
He's the poochie character they introduce and then and then near the end we get monkey in to shoot the school

286
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
Yes

287
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,700
Yeah

288
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:22,420
That's uh, that's the meme. Oh, oh, this could be this is how jeff gets killed off in the arc. He takes the bullet for digi

289
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,780
They have a beautiful healing moment. And then uh, god, then he's written out of the story. This is the best fanfic ever

290
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,540
Damn, that's good stuff. That's good stuff. The pathos

291
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,460
Yeah, these are all great ideas guys. You're definitely gonna see all this. Yeah, this is all

292
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,060
Absolutely confirmed true no lies at all

293
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,500
That should be the tagline. No, we're definitely actually doing this

294
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,140
Hashtag no lies

295
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
project

296
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,340
Fucking a

297
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,580
Well, I'm so I'm super fucking excited though. I cannot wait and I it's it's a fucking travesty and and frankly

298
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,900
It's unbelievable to me that it's been two years

299
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,140
It doesn't it doesn't feel like it in a way

300
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,140
It doesn't feel like it at all and also it's like objectively just a huge mistake

301
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,020
It should not have it should not have been two years since the last just for the record folks

302
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,820
If everything goes ahead as planned, it would have been literally exactly two years

303
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,700
It will be on like march like 14th or whatever was when radcon three happened

304
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:29,460
It will be on march 14th. We'll be like one of the last days or whatever of this radcon for two years later

305
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,060
Yeah, that was that was a big oof. That was a big mistake. Uh, but uh, hopefully my god

306
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,180
It's pretty I was I was still in my 20s. I was still in my 20s when we had radcon three

307
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
Holy shit ending my 20s

308
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,140
With radcon three. I you know, I think a large part of it. I'll say this to defend us slightly was

309
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,900
I mean

310
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:57,860
t-bat resurrection took a full year to be finished because we had so many other things competing for time and stuff

311
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,700
And if I made my number, right, could I got it done first? I guess but I had fucking shit to do so, you know

312
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,540
Yeah, something like that again, like you can't do that unless it's so it's so much work

313
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,820
Well, let's make another stretch go ben $99,000. We make t-bat resurrection too. No, it's back, baby

314
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,140
t-bat t-bat resurrection

315
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,300
90 that's right. We're going all the way up. You got

316
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,300
Like fucking studio first first. There was t-bap resurrection now. There's t-bap

317
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,100
Ascension where you send back into pony heaven

318
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:39,460
That does sound good for season five, baby for for gen five. I mean phantom horn phantom horn has to conclude his arc in

319
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,780
New los angeles city

320
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,300
We'll have to see how that plays out

321
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:51,220
Surely t-bap saga including t-bap resurrection all took place before the the slime city saga

322
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,260
Uh, I suppose it must have. Yeah, the continuity is questionable

323
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,660
I mean, when was phantom sealed in stone with keg? Uh, presumably

324
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,460
Yeah, I guess I guess that all I guess that all must have happened. You know ben

325
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,060
Yeah, I guess I guess I guess slime and punishment must take place post resurrection

326
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,780
You could theoretically end it with I mean keg and phantom sealed in the garden for misdeeds

327
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,380
I mean keg was like, I didn't do anything but whoops. There he goes steel. I don't know

328
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:26,100
Maybe wouldn't that be amazing. It's it's it's conceivable. I don't know. I don't know. I'll have to think about it. I didn't even

329
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,300
Who knows like like the spider's web that I've woven of like the timelines of keg and phantom

330
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,380
It's all it's all a rich tapestry. Uh, that deserves a lecture as well

331
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Honestly, maybe it fucking does

332
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:48,100
Well, we've said like the horseshoe saga in general like all of our boys together and like the mlp fandom really well

333
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,980
It's own lecture. I think I think it would be funny to do a horseshoe crew lecture

334
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:59,780
But like an in a canon one like what canonically did like the events of course of a cutie mark kerfuffle

335
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:07,700
Yeah, yeah, like what canonically did the lives of phantom horn keg standard tall tales give and take digi bro starboard bow starboard bow

336
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,860
Yeah, lethal a roar

337
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,660
This has to be jeff's lecture. We can't talk about

338
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
the biggest fan

339
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,980
That'll be his uh, his um, you know, he'll get given that as like a project and he'll be like, ah, damn it

340
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,260
I don't want to do this and then his seo manager will say jeff jeff baby. Sweetheart

341
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:34,340
We got the numbers in the kids are all talking about this horseshoe crew. You've got to make your next video about this horseshoe

342
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:41,780
You gotta add tags. You gotta add hashtag horseshoe crew to all your videos. You gotta tag it. You gotta optimize your seo, sweetheart

343
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,100
I have I have nothing but respect who is saying 10 late, uh

344
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,700
He's seo manager guy the one who tells him what to make videos on who apparently is a real person from what I understand

345
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,860
I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I remember

346
00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:00,340
That's what it sounds like. I remember him. Yeah, baby. Baby. Sweetheart. You gotta make uh, sort out our line

347
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,420
You gotta jojo's bizarre

348
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,420
You heard about this enemy naruto. They got a video game now

349
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,940
It's everyone's favorite character with the seo c

350
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,860
Oh, that's yeah, that's good. Yes. Yeah, that's pretty good

351
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,180
Um

352
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:21,940
Man, fuck. I don't know. I'm really fucking hype for red count four. It's pretty cool because like literally 48 hours ago

353
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
We had no plans other than like

354
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,540
Very comfortable 48 hours ago. I was I was fucking I was uh, it's a wonderful life in it

355
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:34,740
I was on that bridge ready to end it all ready to have nothing to look forward to and now I'm I'm full of hope

356
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,100
I'm rejuvenated

357
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,820
It was funny. We were having a conversation and we were just like guys everything sucks. What's what do we do?

358
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,500
And they're like, what about

359
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,020
Things could not suck or remember radcons and we're like, oh, yeah

360
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,900
Um, why don't we do that? Why don't we just do that? Why don't why are we yeah?

361
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,660
Yeah, you know, it's it's funny for the record like that

362
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,860
We've been initiating that conversation for a while and the stopping point we kept hitting like recently

363
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,860
Munchie had said like hey, I'm free during spring break like we could theoretically do it then

364
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,620
And we had gotten to the point where he just hit the wall of like, okay, but where should we do it?

365
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,540
Do we need an air maybe could we do it in digi's house? But then we were just like fuck it

366
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,500
Uh, no, it's too small. We answered those questions and that's all it took and once that's done

367
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:22,020
uh, stone's rolling downhill and uh, that's uh, yeah, the rest is the rest is the easy part

368
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,340
So keep an eye out for that fucking Kickstarter. I guess come in come in within a week of when you see this very likely

369
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:35,860
Wow, maybe a little bit longer, but that's very soon. Yeah, soon, but soon though. There will shortly be a video announcement

370
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,980
No doubt about it. No doubt about it. Oh my god. Oh my god

371
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,940
So click that bell if you haven't already to get that sweet notification as soon as it tries

372
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,260
hell, yeah

373
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:54,260
Uh, it's great. Very very happy. You know, everyone's all the comments complain the show stagnant the show sucks

374
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,940
Guess what the show always sucked. It's not about the show. It's about rad con and we're back, baby

375
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,700
Yeah, the rad con is definitely like the the resurgence button like

376
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,620
Yeah, we would you know meeting up and doing all that cool shit

377
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,940
We'll definitely make us more hype about each other and the podcast

378
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,620
That's definitely true

379
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:22,740
And the fact that we have gone two years is the it's probably the reason the show suffered bad such a disaster

380
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,180
Two years without the orgy that keeps them rejuvenated. I guess we did have that meetup last year

381
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,980
Yeah, it was it was brief though. Yeah

382
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:37,460
It was rad con 3.3 things that I mean to plan to like can that was such a fucking dumb

383
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,620
That was such a dumb ass meeting

384
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:47,300
Was totally pointless. I mean it was kind of unnecessary, but I mean I didn't object to coming out to visit the peeps anyway

385
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,300
So it was fun. I was happy to do it. Uh

386
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,860
I mean, you know, I'm out in Cincinnati. I'm not near anybody. I know except really michelle. So, you know, sure

387
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,820
I was happy. I mean that part of it is fine. Yeah, but like the business meeting aspect of it

388
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,380
I think I remember

389
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,460
You guys were talking about that and I was like

390
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,180
This is dumb. This has nothing to do with me and it's probably all bullshit anyway

391
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,220
So I'm just gonna go get drunk in the basement and then I did that did that didn't happen. I didn't happen

392
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:19,460
I mean at that point that that was kind of when we were answering some of the questions about what this these plans

393
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,820
For the future looked like and I don't know. We have some ideas now, but we're still working it out. I don't know

394
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,780
We'll see anyway rad con

395
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,540
Coming soon

396
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,940
Keep talking and I was gonna say speaking of on this subject. Oh, hey a comment

397
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:42,100
I mean, is it uh, I guess comment if you want to let us know what kind of things you'd want to see or like what kind of stuff would

398
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,220
Entice you to donate. I guess what would what would be a good what would be a stretch

399
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,580
What would be a stretch goal that you'd be hyped to like push for I don't know

400
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,700
Yeah, if you have any ideas, but we are thinking of doing

401
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,820
We have we have we have a couple ideas of our own

402
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,660
Let's be crystal clear though on the calendar and that we you I want I want to do the calendar

403
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,500
The calendar is a great idea. You audience you don't know what you want and you don't know what it's worth to you

404
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,740
That's our job to figure out

405
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,740
To strategize the ways to get you to donate your money because I mean, here's one of the things

406
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,980
But also charge too little for each of our goals last time

407
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,020
And we will not be so like it's going to be similar to last time

408
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,700
But like a bunch of things relatively are going to be more expensive

409
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,540
Because we we charge too little for them last time

410
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:35,460
It's like equivalent goals are probably going to be more expensive because we fucked up last time and all lost money

411
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,500
And I'd like to at least break even at least

412
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,820
It's sad. It's sad. That was a painful phone call for like two hours who went line by line through everything. It was like, oh, no

413
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:52,660
Oh, no, remember that. Oh, no, I remember because I expected that like there was going to be some leftover money

414
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,140
And we would all get maybe like negative money and we would all maybe just get the extra like hundred bucks or whatever

415
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,060
And then it was like no, it's actually just coming out of like when jessy

416
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,860
Like oh, yeah, jessy, we'll cover your flight. It'll be fine. And then like, you know slam

417
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,140
Big miss big three months later. Oh, we we got nothing. But we still promise the man

418
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:17,220
include or will probably include like a plan of like exactly pretty much like because it's going to be very similar to

419
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,980
The last ride con breakdown like you can compare it'll be probably maybe you'll find it interesting to compare because I certainly do

420
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:29,060
Like what we expected the expenses to be last time we made that like chart of the expenses versus now

421
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:35,380
We actually know exactly how much those were and we're going to use that as our template for what we expect to pay for everything

422
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:41,140
This time and it's a lot more than we thought last time. So uh red con three was so much fun

423
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,780
It sure was buddy. It was the best thing I did that entire year easily

424
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,340
Uh wait, yep. What did what did I do in 20? Oh, oh

425
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,140
Yeah, that was the best thing

426
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,140
I

427
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,020
Mean it was the only thing I did so I mean it just wins by the fault doesn't mean anything. I hate all of you guys

428
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,380
But still

429
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,140
Understandable. Yep. Yeah

430
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,980
2018 was a bit of a low key year for me while I was working on we ag was and uh

431
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:14,260
Like looking to quit my job relatively soon. So what better way to start a new decade than with another rad con

432
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:20,500
You're welcome. You're welcome. All indeed. I'm gonna make your so big spenders. Russell. I'm talking to you

433
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:27,860
Open up that wallet buddy. Break it wide open. Russell get ready. Toya get drunk when the Kickstarter goes live

434
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,380
Oh, it was like the ultimate handboy warrior was the like. Yes

435
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,180
Hashtag like wrestle wrestle

436
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,140
Let Russell wrestle guys. We had we had one we had one

437
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,620
handboy warrior

438
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,980
I kind of think we were we were shocked someone was willing to do that and we had a we had a

439
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,420
What do we have like 15 or 16 like the dad dads?

440
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,060
Yeah, I'm thinking, you know, based on that based on those numbers. I'm thinking maybe

441
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,380
We have a couple we can have some one or two tears in between those

442
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,980
Maybe there might be someone who doesn't want to go the full thousand, you know, that that was a joke

443
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,700
I mean, we did not expect anybody. Yeah. Well, now we know now. We know that some idiots

444
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:13,060
Out their fat whales just weighing us spew their blubber into our waiting mouths. Oh, yeah, so succulent

445
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,220
Uh, yeah, yeah

446
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:21,780
So what we should do is I think as I'm coming up with a handboy warrior tier for rad gun for $10,000

447
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,140
I I think I don't know. Maybe we keep it something similar

448
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,860
But we actually open that up. So there's a couple more entries in there or something because like a thousand is plenty

449
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,900
Yeah, I mean, yeah, maybe people will be interested in that

450
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,460
But like things for like the the dad

451
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,660
Well, like all of our tiers of like getting physical rewards all of those I think are going to be more expensive

452
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,180
And then the dad one should bump up the theme of um the thing about um

453
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,660
We're just trying to not lose money guys. That's all it is. We just want to not

454
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,900
The handboy warrior tier is exciting because it like put you you you are

455
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:59,620
Involved in the yeah, that's real value. That's really like we sure surely we can find other things that we could like

456
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,460
Do

457
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,020
I don't know

458
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,060
I'll bet we could think of some shit that like if you donate this tier

459
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,020
We will include you in something else. I don't know. We'll we'll put you in the calendar

460
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:16,100
I don't know. I mean the dad thing I guess was the one because we like talked about them in like the in the fucking

461
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,500
Whatever that was the arena. I I feel like we could have done more with that. I feel like if we do it again

462
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,020
We should definitely have more dad involvement somehow whatever that we'll come up with some better plans

463
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,180
Yeah, but but yeah, you're you're right. You're right

464
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,300
It'd be like members of the school board or whatever this time

465
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,300
Oh, they could be our dads. Oh, you know doing our coming for parent teacher night. You know, here's my dad

466
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:43,460
Figerson and what yeah, what if they are like, yeah, what if the donors they're they're the parent. They're the pta

467
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,180
What if they can like what if we give them like

468
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,660
I don't know. Maybe they can like make

469
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,940
Rules for us or something or maybe they can like give us commands

470
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,740
I don't know

471
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:59,060
Step dad. I have to do anything you say. I don't know. I'm in trouble now

472
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:04,980
I'm stuck in the washing machine bent over in this precarious position again. I hope you don't do anything weird step dad

473
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,540
Turns on the wash

474
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
That's not the scenario I'm just trying to

475
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:25,940
Well, I'm sufficiently less interested. You've you've been a you've been a real dirty girl. He says turning on the wash

476
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,940
Oh

477
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,380
Damn that extra spin turns it up to like heavily spoiled and just like

478
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,820
Yeah

479
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,980
Extra hot water. Yeah, just uh, you know, uh, you know how it is. You know how it is. That's the real shit

480
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:52,980
Okay, but no, okay. I think more like audience involvement is always a good idea

481
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,220
Mm-hmm. You know how in like the hunger games like donors can like pay to like give them shit or like

482
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,740
Yes, set up. Maybe set off bombs or something. You know, they could they interact with

483
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,220
We should set off some seaford down in the house that we don't put some mines in the beach, you know

484
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:13,700
Maybe like an epic prank. Maybe maybe the pta can be like maybe we'll I don't know

485
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,780
Maybe we could have like certain things we want to do but we could have like polls

486
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,460
But like only the pta members get to like vote to say like what we do

487
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,620
That can be done something this is a very this is a very half-formed idea, but I hope you get the kind of thing

488
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:34,420
I'm gesturing it. Yeah. I mean by the time this episode comes out a lot of these things may have been ironed out and

489
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:42,740
Understood as to what we're gonna do. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the the big things that are guaranteed are lectures and streams and

490
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,700
High school theming indeed indeed also the beach

491
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,780
Also, the beach will be there and the tropical house. We're gonna do like a slow-mo slow-mo fucking

492
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,540
uh

493
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,540
Splashing in the water going. He he

494
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,100
That sort of thing. We will drink everything out of coconuts

495
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,940
Every single time, you know just for for the record uh of interest

496
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:14,020
Maybe we'll get the mind racing or tingling or whatnot the the shovel knight Kickstarter, which I was looking into the other day

497
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,980
It had a thing where like if you pledge a certain excuse me

498
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,580
You pledge a certain tier you get to vote on which of the eight like mega man boss knights effectively

499
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,020
Like we'll get a playable mode of their own or whatever and like the three that one were voted on like by those people

500
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,860
So maybe like influence in some style or some decision of something

501
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,580
Oh, wait, here's just an idea. Maybe there's like there's we there's some idea for a video

502
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,140
And like the star of the video will be voted upon by the serene

503
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,900
It'll be one of us will be like the subject of whatever this thing is and is decided by the viewers

504
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,980
And uh, I don't know. Maybe something like that could be um, the um penny the penny arcade

505
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,220
Like d&d twitch the the the c team

506
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:03,140
Uh, in particular has the thing where um the the twitch subscriber base the subscribers

507
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,820
They're called the shadow council and they get to like vote on stuff and like uh

508
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:13,700
The dm will like he'll ask like, you know, what what is the dark secret behind like rosy beastingers?

509
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:20,340
Like long lost uncle or whatever and it's like, oh, he's he's secretly gay or oh, he's secretly straight

510
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
And it's like I like this idea of

511
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:29,380
We we we modified like the dad tier into this pta one and now they get to like be they get to they get to exert

512
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,460
They get to exert a certain amount of uh, of uh, uh, authorial control

513
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,340
Interesting idea. It's an interesting idea. Yeah

514
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,220
Thank you. You're welcome

515
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
You're welcome future pta members

516
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:48,100
Uh, all right. Well, I guess that's pretty much it for all our rad con thoughts thus far

517
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,380
We're currently busily racing to get all the assets prepared so it can be out as soon as possible

518
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,900
Later today, I'll be working more on these on these details of tiers and stuff

519
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,340
So, uh, I have to uh, I have to do the the write-up still

520
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:06,020
Indeed indeed much. He's working on a logo and other things that you'll see soon. How exciting

521
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,780
I am

522
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,540
I don't know man. It's a real fucking hype. It's real fucking hype for it. My dude

523
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,740
I am as well, but I guess we must move on. Um

524
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:26,420
New matthew mitosis video out today or two days ago before before we start talking about stuff

525
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,580
I have an an announcement

526
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,980

527
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,420
Hopefully either today or the weekend coming

528
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,820
The first chapter of my new comic will be out. No

529
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:45,620
Shit, I haven't exactly decided on the title, but it's the lord of ghosts comic

530
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Hey

531
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
Fucking way, dude

532
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,900
Yeah, okay

533
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:57,220
Is this post his his involvement in uh becoming the the entity or whatever it was and then getting spat out of

534
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:04,100
Well, this is this is the story of of uh, the lord of ghosts and what he what happened to him after he was

535
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,820
Uh, uh, he was defeated and the mega slime was destroyed

536
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,580
Right. Um way back and this is his exploits

537
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,460
Uh leaving and outside of the city and the stuff that happens and it's

538
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,260
It's it's cool and I'm I'm proud of what I've written and drawn so far

539
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,620
I think like 14 out of the first 20 pages the the chapter is going to be in like

540
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,540
Each chapter is going to be like 20 pages long. There's going to be like four or five chapters

541
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,420
And uh, I hope fantastic. I hope for it to be basically done

542
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,060
By the middle of february

543
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,060
Oh, shit. So

544
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,060
Is it going to be on um

545
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:50,260
Aps adventures, it's going to be on a ps adventures. I might change that website's name to give and take dot com or something

546
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,740
Yeah, just for better branding

547
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,180
um

548
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,380
Uh, it'll be up on my webcomic website. It'll I'll probably make like an account on all of the

549
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:06,500
Webcomic places and put them there as well for no reason just just in case just in case somebody discovers me through that

550
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,540
And uh, that's um, uh, that's my big announcement

551
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,020
Say hopefully there will be a link in the description. It's fucking sick dude. That's fucking sick

552
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:23,060
Uh, are you gonna go back to uh red noir after this? Yes after that it's red noir until that's finished and then

553
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,980
Oh, yeah, the thing I was thinking because this first comic is like entirely digital

554
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:33,060
I I sketched it digitally and I'm gonna ink it and shade it digitally

555
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,860
And that's all cool. Uh red noir

556
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:42,740
I'm thinking of like drawing on my iPad to see how much easier or better that is or maybe not as good

557
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:50,340
You know just to see the the advantages that brings to that comic and then after that I'm gonna try and do a traditionally drawn

558
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,780
Um, perhaps digitally inked but definitely traditionally drawn comic for the third one

559
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,740
It's gonna be for the rest of the year. Maybe I don't know it's gonna be a long one

560
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,940
But that is my there's my comic thing

561
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,940
2020 was gonna be my my make three comics year

562
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,940
Um, I wasn't on the last episode so I didn't get to say like my goals

563
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
But I think I said it somewhere else

564
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,420
And that is that is what I'm gonna do

565
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,060
And it's a good goal. It's a good goal for anyone

566
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,860
Yeah, three comics three finished comics with stuff and it's

567
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,180
Fuck yeah, dude

568
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,820
That's good. That's getting me hype. You're getting me hype now

569
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,820
Dude, yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty stoked. I'm stoked more work for me. That's always a good a good thing

570
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,980
Mm-hmm

571
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,300
This is making me a little self-conscious that I haven't been working on slime and punishment. Oh god. Good. It's not only me

572
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,300
I was trying to like yeah

573
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,140
Watch that fear

574
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,140
I had a real big like

575
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:53,860
Idea of like January. All right. How many days are in January? Okay. How many pages could I potentially do?

576
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,300
Out of the pages I ever have sketched like finish them

577
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,980
Uh

578
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,660
Per day if it's like if I can keep on a pace of at least three per day

579
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,420
Um, I can finish the entire thing in January

580
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,700
Unlikely to happen because of you know, all sorts of things

581
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,060
motivation things getting in the in the way like

582
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,940
Other things taking up my time. So it's most likely going to be the middle of February

583
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,220
Um, but I'm I've been keeping good pace so far on the first day of January

584
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,540
I did like eight pages, but they were like easier to draw than the others

585
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,940
and um

586
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,300
I'm I'm feeling pretty good. I'm feeling pretty hype feeling pretty artistic

587
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,340
And I can't wait once we've finished this pcp to get back to it

588
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,060
Fuck

589
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,180
Yes, okay. Okay. Yeah, I

590
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,420
You know what? I was gonna say some shit about me

591
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,140
But it doesn't matter and I don't want to talk about it

592
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,780
Okay

593
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:59,300
Also, I I did your vaporette. Um, I would and I'm I'm really looking forward to all the vaporites being done

594
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:04,020
And having that fucking book on my shelf. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was I was gonna say

595
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,420
I should it's make it. I was gonna say it's making me want to work on that and get that done

596
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,300
I've been the last like yesterday night. I was like

597
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:17,060
I was like I was right. I was like, oh, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna I'm gonna finish it

598
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,740
Ah, but it's really late and I'm tired. I should do it. I would just sit there

599
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:24,580
We're just sitting there jacking my little dick. I'm just jacking my little dick here

600
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,860
And I was not gonna have time in the morning. I'll have time in the morning

601
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,300
I'll have time in the morning to do it. You know, I'll be I'll be more refreshed in the morning

602
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,460
You gotta like, um, I gotta leave space for jacking my little dick here tonight. That's what I got to be spending my time on

603
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,940
A little dick. He's a big wank

604
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,620
Nate, do you have any ground to stand on giving people shit for putting work off, Mr. Ghosting Show?

605
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,900
For having a little dick?

606
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,860
Yeah, I'm afraid not, damn you motherfucker

607
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:55,620
God damn you you fucking red bastard

608
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
You little red

609
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:10,740
But Ben, the way to think about it, um, to make it easier to understand the passage of time

610
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,540
Because it's easy to just think, oh, I'll do it tomorrow, but then tomorrow turns into three days

611
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:22,260
Um, you've just got to think of the calendar think of the date and like say I'm gonna do it on this date

612
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,540
Rather than this day of the week because there's there's gonna be another one of those days the next week

613
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:34,820
So if you say I want to do like a sentence of this thing or whatever on the 13th

614
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,620
Then if you don't have any plans on the 13th, then you remember it's the 13th

615
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,780
You'll be like, well, like best, you know, this is the day I set out to do this one thing

616
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,980
I may as well try and then you'll be more likely to do it

617
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,940
Yeah, I um, I

618
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,740
That's that makes sense. I talked about this. I talked about my uh, my the whole

619
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:02,020
Thing with me and the and the vaporettes in my oh, yeah, I did want to mention this in the show. I talked about it in my

620
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:09,460
Uh, patreon's only patreon podcasting that I stole from hippo, which I'm doing now. I'm doing a monthly thing

621
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,420
Um, you know, I was really relieved. I put that out and I thought well, this is fine

622
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,020
I hope people like that because you know, I don't

623
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,820
I just like everything I make I just put out for free

624
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,380
So there's not a lot of like shit that only my patrons get

625
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,420
So I was like, this is nice. This will be nice for them

626
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,540
But I was afraid because I said like I want to do like a Q&A

627
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,940
It would be cool if I had like sort of a back and forth with patrons where it's like they're asking me stuff

628
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,340
And I'm answering them because it's stuff they want to know

629
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,500
But I was a little afraid

630
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,780
Because like people don't use patreon like a social media site

631
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:47,780
So like posts don't get a lot of like likes or anything posts don't get a lot of engagement generally and like that's fine

632
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,620
But I was a little afraid that like I'll say hey, I want to make this like a Q&A

633
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,660
And it would just be radio silence and I'd get no questions

634
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,180
And then the next month I'd be like, okay. Well, I guess

635
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,860
Scrap that idea. I'll just pretend I never said it. I'll just ramble for 45 minutes. But no

636
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,940
I actually got like

637
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,380
Five or six like really good thoughtful questions from patrons

638
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,500
It was very nice and I was very happy and it's gonna be

639
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,940
And it's gonna it's gonna be it's gonna be a whole fucking

640
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,540
It'll probably be like an hour long

641
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,460
It'll probably take me like at least an hour to answer all that shit to go into all the depth and nuance

642
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:27,060
Um, I just ask the questions from patrons. That went over pretty well my discord, which works pretty well

643
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:32,340
I use yeah for the podcast that I do. Oh like when you get home from the gym and it's time for a little Q&A

644
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,660
Yeah, yeah, so, you know, you just go you go into discord and you just no like seriously though

645
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,740
Like and I just have in my discord server

646
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,420
I'll just ask because I do weekly podcasts and I'll just like you have questions

647
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,820
Drop in the suggestions channel. I'm the patron discord and because people are always there

648
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,060
Yeah

649
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,180
um

650
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:55,780
My it's a weird thing because like my money spenders podcast some people just don't listen to it

651
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,060
Even though they're patrons and you know, they want to be up to date

652
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:03,380
But it's like, ah shit. I haven't got around to that and I've realized some people just don't get around to it

653
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,580
I wonder whether that's because

654
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,540
It's like not as interesting

655
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,380
as

656
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:18,420
Maybe used to be or something. I just I I just forget like I did listen to your last one where you talked about like the rfck

657
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:24,340
And and stuff, but only because you reminded me because you like you said you mentioned it more

658
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:29,300
But yeah, I only listened to it because you reminded me because you said something about it in the in this

659
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,780
Discord server that we're in right now

660
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,220
I mean

661
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:37,300
What I've been doing is because because I have the the patron discord. I just do everything through there

662
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,380
I just I just use patreon to post them

663
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,660
because like

664
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,340
I was posting them on youtube, but it was easy to get around it and like keep like

665
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:50,580
Listening to new episodes without paying some people were doing that which is funny, but uh, I'll just go. I'll just whenever I

666
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,540
Add something on patreon. I'll just go onto the discord server and add everybody like there's a new thing

667
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:01,140
So like everybody knows that it's up as opposed to hoping they go on the patreon, which nobody does because why would you?

668
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,860
and uh, hope they notice it

669
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:11,060
Yeah, I can't put that in enough quotation marks. I mean I always get reminded by those things

670
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,340
Um by email, so I assume other people do maybe people just don't check email as much as I do

671
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,980
Possibly that's probably true. I

672
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,140
Don't check my email very much

673
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,220
um

674
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:30,340
Uh, my okay, so my like patreon is integrated with my discord right because like my pay my my discord is public

675
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,980
But there are patrons only rooms in it

676
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:39,460
Um, and I'm pretty sure like when you when you become a patron and you integrate your discord

677
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:45,780
It just gives you like the bot the patreon bot in my discord gives you the role that lets you into the patrons only rooms

678
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,140
But I'm pretty sure that if you unpatron

679
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:54,980
It doesn't take the role away. It does. So I'm pretty sure there are like people in there who became a patron

680
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:59,780
I'm pretty sure there's people in there who are not active patrons, but who the bot just failed to

681
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,660
What happens is what you do to like remove the role?

682
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,820
So what I'm saying is become a patron now because you can get so much value

683
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,780
You only have to pay them for one month to get permanent access to all my secret subscribers only discord channels

684
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:17,060
Well from what I understand it doesn't remove you from the server. It just removes your role as a patron

685
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,820
Yeah, yeah, but what I'm saying is that I still see people in that in that channel

686
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:27,460
Which means they must have that role who I do not think are active patrons. You would think so you would think so

687
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:33,300
So I don't know but I feel like if it's like a server that is entirely patron only

688
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,380
People can you know, they they're usually left in

689
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,620
Yeah, you have to manually get rid of people because the the pcp patron discord has

690
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,820
Occasionally people who have unpledged that the name changes color, but they're still in there

691
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,820
Yep, mm-hmm

692
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,220
But for hybrid discords which have like patron and non-patron

693
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,460
Uh rooms, I think it it generally seems to be

694
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:03,060
They only get access to the ones they should right because like you you lose the role

695
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:08,580
You can't get into those channels. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's fine. Maybe I'm just stupid. Maybe I'm just stupid

696
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,980
I've never had that problem, but you should you should look into it

697
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:15,540
Give it a test one of those people who you're suspicious of and see if it's kicking you out everyone

698
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:20,180
Yeah, it's suspicious of all of them paranoia setting in as as you should be

699
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,740
I don't I don't like them. I don't I don't I don't trust them

700
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,060
We were talking before about being excited to to make things and whatnot

701
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:35,220
And I know I said this on the on the private or the bonus episode recently about our plans for the future and whatnot

702
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,780
But I I've had a bunch of conversations recently

703
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:43,860
Including our one about radcon 4 that have really jazzed me up, uh for this uh this year coming

704
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:49,220
You know my my time on youtube here has been a little bit less successful and I was hoping uh, you know overall

705
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,300
That's why you know, uh

706
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,940
We aguas or I don't know maybe feeling a little stale and whatnot

707
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,100
So I mean I said in the bonus episode, but I'll just say it again here

708
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:00,980
Because I'm going to say it in my next we agua as well that I'm retiring the we agua format

709
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,220
There's also a long post about this on my patreon, which you can go look at for free

710
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,700
It's just you know, it's just my long explanation for why I'm doing it

711
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:14,260
Um, so I'm just going to be at the very at the at the at least for now temporarily suspending we aguas in

712
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,860
in you know

713
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,500
Indefinitely until such time as I decided to change it

714
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,220
Just to make time for the bigger projects people have been waiting for and and all that stuff

715
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,140
I think 2020 the year of ghosts is the right thing to do maybe

716
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,780
I well at the very least it we agua format has not been giving me the

717
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:37,220
I'm not I mean, I'm not saying that there's no room for like the we agua style content, but

718
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,860
Yeah, it shouldn't be at the expense of your bigger pieces people can read my post

719
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:48,900
They are expensive because I haven't talked about this much on their request, but uh, we we we've had another conversation and they don't mind anymore

720
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:53,620
I guess I whatever I've had an editor working with me on we aguas for a long time

721
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,700
Who just requested to not be known or whatever, but that does change now. It doesn't matter anymore

722
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,420
So like yeah, I've been working with an editor to give me more time

723
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,260
But even with that the amount of time that I've had to spend is just eaten into stuff

724
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,660
So I'm just like I've been talking with this editor and we're gonna we're gonna be switching it up

725
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,740
And we're gonna try to like

726
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,900
I'm gonna be working on big projects as like my main focus and like when there's small videos

727
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,340
Smaller ones kind of like my recent like konosuba or even the sunflower one

728
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:21,220
Maybe gonna try giving them those kind of smaller projects

729
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,420
Just uh, it's I'm trying to enter the era of quality of exciting bge videos again

730
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:30,340
You know, uh where people are give a shit and are interested to watch

731
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:36,980
So uh moving towards that. I'm pretty excited about it. I want to start making like youtube

732
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,900
Content. I want to start I want to start doing like video essays

733
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,460
Like like nothing fancy

734
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,780
I just want I just want to like

735
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,820
I don't know

736
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,540
I feel like maybe like rather than just getting mad on twitter

737
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,340
I feel like maybe a more constructive use of my energy

738
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:58,020
And like and when it comes to like the stuff I think about would just be to like write out an essay

739
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,740
Record myself reading it

740
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:06,900
Add some video clips of stuff or whatever just make drone images of you with your arms crossed talking

741
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,700
Yeah

742
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,700
Or whatever, I don't know

743
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,620
It would definitely be a better use of your time than twitter. Yeah, I agree though

744
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,820
I think you'll just get your information across in a much more

745
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,740
Constructive way

746
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:25,700
Prott, yeah, I might people might people I might make people like me instead of make people hate me instead of well

747
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,620
Let's not get too carried away here without expectations. I lost like 50

748
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,620
I lost like 50 twitter followers in like one day the other day, which I know that's not like a huge amount

749
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,860
But like that's more than I've ever lost in a day before and the weird part is

750
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:46,260
I I didn't even make any like particularly inflammatory tweets. That was just the day that like I tweeted my um

751
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,980
I tweeted my my discord link

752
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,180
And then I made a sort of tweet about like the left right spectrum

753
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,220
But I wasn't like it wasn't even like mean shit or any I don't know

754
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,060
I don't know what happened on that day

755
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,900
It was just like I guess people were sick of me or maybe twitter did a purge or something

756
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,540
Hey, yeah, that's always possible. I suppose. Yeah

757
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,020
Uh, yeah, well, I mean hell

758
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,620
I mean I agree just like when the ship doesn't seem to be going in the direction you want

759
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:15,060
Something should change probably gotta gotta change your tack to some degree. So, uh, yeah, give it a shot

760
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,340
I say I'll be interested to see what you make. I want I want to I want to do that

761
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,100
It's like, you know, I did like the ramble videos before and people generally like those

762
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,660
I feel and that's fine

763
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,100
I you know, I used to I used to be you know back in school and whatever

764
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,060
I was pretty good at writing essays, but I haven't done it in like forever

765
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,380
Yeah, I mean it's a skill. It's a muscle to flex and train and stuff like anything else

766
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,700
So I feel like it's something that I'm capable of doing a good a good job at and yeah

767
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:45,620
It's more constructive than just fucking airing my hot takes on twitter. You know, it's funny

768
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:50,340
I should say that I mean like effectively we Aga was have all been like unscripted videos

769
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,940
And making like both my sunflower and the and the kona suba videos

770
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:59,380
Those were intentionally scripted and designed to like be funny and entertaining and to convey the information

771
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,620
as efficiently as possible so as to not waste the viewer's time and

772
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,620
I both feel way better about those once they're done

773
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,300
And feel that people are not just like exhausted

774
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:18,660
Like long ass videos scripted ones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so like and and like I just feel good flexing that muscle again

775
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,300
So that's that's kind of one of those were like my testing grounds

776
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,660
But I really do

777
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,940
Like that feel and want to lean more into that. Um, I think I might

778
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,620
I think maybe when I'm done with like some of the stuff I got on my play right now

779
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:35,860
I might just I might just take some time and just like write a bunch of essays and like make them into videos and just like

780
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,860
See how they do

781
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:44,020
Doesn't seems like good idea. That's that sounds kind of exciting for me to be honest. I'm youtube is my platform

782
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,860
shareable clickable

783
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:52,020
Is it set or etc? I mean I've got you know, I've got like I'm not a big channel, but I've got like 14 000 subscribers

784
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,740
Which is like a it's a it's a respectable amount

785
00:58:55,060 --> 00:59:01,220
I would get like a you know, I would get a couple thousand. You are well known for that christian lecture people know you for that

786
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:06,260
Sure. I sure am. Um, you know, I would get some amount of views on anything I did

787
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,900
I don't know. Yeah, it'd be cool

788
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,940
It'd be nice. It'd be nice if like any of them if I fucking had a video like

789
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,900
Do do well and like get seen

790
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,620
Whatever it is a nice feeling, you know, I don't feel I've had that in a while myself

791
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:27,460
I don't get that on twitter because like I've man. I'm get so jealous whenever I see someone with like a viral tweet

792
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:32,100
I've never had a tweet go viral. I've had some tweets get like maybe like 200 likes or something

793
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:38,020
Which is like a lot, but it's not viral. I'm just like, you know, I can't I just say something that's so fucking funny or goofy

794
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,220
Or incisive that just everybody wants to just jump on a why am I not a fucking

795
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,260
I've had a couple viral tweets, but they're never of things that I actually care about or like things that I

796
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,780
Like would want to go viral. I think my most popular tweet

797
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,980
Was there's two that were really popular

798
00:59:52,980 --> 01:00:00,020
There was one when the first sonic trailer came out and I took a picture of the honeycomb mascot and just put it in photoshop

799
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,860
Made it blue. Yeah, that got like a couple thousand retweets and shit

800
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:07,460
And then another one was the uh, the aw shit here we go again

801
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,940
Meme that was going around twitter

802
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:15,460
I made one of those for the pirate bay when like disney plus was announced and like when all your favorite companies have a streaming service

803
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:21,540
And it was just him walking towards the pirate bay and that got like a billion fucking retweets. I'm like, these are both shit

804
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:25,380
I hate it. I hate all the people just like these simple memes, you know

805
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:31,140
It's like working on this fucking video game making all this 3d animation. Nobody cares drawing the meme. It's all you need

806
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,860
Draw draw a simple like visual

807
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:40,820
Comparison between things that are on people's mind and the in the current zeitgeist and like bam viral tweet

808
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:46,260
My viral tweet. I can't remember how much you got but it probably wasn't thousands and thousands

809
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,740
But the the serial experiments lane

810
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,140
Oh, right

811
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,980
That one was great. It was a an experiment using cheerios

812
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,980
Oh, yeah

813
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:02,980
Yeah, I remember that I think for me. I think this is my it wasn't we did not get like thousands of retweets

814
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,580
I think got like a couple thousand likes and I don't know maybe like a couple hundred retweets or whatever

815
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:12,180
But it was never cracked like like 200 likes is like the most I've ever got pathetic. Absolutely pitiful

816
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,540
This one was uh, it was when pokemon, uh

817
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:22,420
Let's go evie and pikachu was announced and they announced the quote friendly rival of like of the game

818
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:28,660
I made a post like posted him and I made this like long screeching rant in one tweet that was like like

819
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:34,500
What happened to rivals like I want the rival to break my fucking spine and step on my neck and rip my fucking heart out

820
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:39,300
And feed it to me. That's the pokemon rival supposed to be and then the last line was also he looks gay

821
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:46,180
That was like that was like the full tweet. Uh, so I guess people resonated with that to some degree god

822
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,780
I hate how difficult it is to find specific tweets on twitter. Yeah, it is challenging

823
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:56,660
I go to the like do I do I just have to scroll for like 20 minutes? Yes. I don't want to do that

824
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,380
Yeah, it sucks. It's a nightmare

825
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,260
Hey, well, hey on this subject

826
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,060
I started this this particular tangent by being like, uh, yeah

827
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,580
We aguas are going to be retired for some time and I'm trying other stuff

828
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:14,020
And I'm really I am excited about that because I'm hoping to like use my my editor bro to like

829
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:18,100
Help get more quality stuff out that people like and are excited about and I can get

830
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:22,020
I don't know like little thoughts out quickly while I work on the big stuff in like a format

831
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:25,620
That's just a little more just has a little more life to it than we agua

832
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,700
Which I think I did a pretty interesting analysis on my patreon, which is free

833
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:33,140
So if you want to hear my full thoughts, you should check that out just out of interest

834
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:38,980
But um, but also like this talk about like radcon 4 and like as soon as we had a plan

835
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:44,340
As soon as we like all the obstacles were gone like boom. We're making it happen right now. That's really exciting

836
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:53,380
Uh, fucking me and digi working on cantons. I'll just tell I mean we are currently working on what's effectively the spiritual successor to the weebcast

837
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,820
And then I was just like hey did you what if we like got some guests and did you like

838
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,580
Let's fucking reach out to some people

839
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,740
And so we don't know if anyone's going to happen with that

840
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:07,460
But people loved the weebcast and we're hoping to like keep that going to some degree now that like cantons like the perfect channel for that

841
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,860
And uh, I don't know we're talking about maybe getting like an editor

842
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,580
Working on that to help us out or something

843
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:18,020
And this is just many things seem very positive right now and I'm very much looking forward to this upcoming year

844
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:22,900
So uh, and it's not that I'm just dreaming of it. We're actually doing all of these things currently

845
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:28,980
So I'm very excited about it. Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm feeling very positive. What can I say? What can I say?

846
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,220
Hopefully things work out for the best

847
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,620
Uh

848
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,460
Fuck yeah, I mean I'm

849
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,980
I think I feel I'm feeling pretty optimistic. I'm feeling like

850
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:47,220
I'm feeling like I've got room to grow. I'm feeling like I've gotten new venues to branch out into that's exciting

851
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:50,500
Yeah, you know speaking about like youtube

852
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:52,180
just

853
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:54,180
doing videos I was

854
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,420
I was considering

855
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,260
because like um

856
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,940
For for no particular reason

857
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:04,580
I was on rusty cages channel because I'd never really looked into that guy and it turns out he makes

858
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:11,300
Like he's quite popular. I didn't actually realize that I thought mplemon was the big the big boy in that that whole like um

859
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,580
Friend of youtube

860
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:19,060
Yeah, but like rusty cages like he's got actually really great music and I like that

861
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:24,500
Um, but he's like he's he's quite a creative guy and he's got a webcomic or not a webcomic an actual

862
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:25,860
um

863
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:32,340
Requiem of the crazies requiem of the crazies and it's like a big like serious project that he's been working on for years

864
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:37,460
Rusty rusty seems really cool. Did you yeah, he like apparently he like um

865
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:44,340
Apparently he made a lot of money like winning like knife game contests or like

866
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,500
Like like or maybe not night. No, it was some contest that involved knives

867
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,180
Okay, but he like he just like won a whole bunch of money like doing that

868
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,860
And like I think that was before he was a youtuber even i'm not sure

869
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,260
Are we talking like millions here? Are we talking like more? You know, I don't know

870
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:06,420
Okay, like I'm just stuff maybe tens of thousands or you know enough enough to live on for a while

871
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:10,340
Or I'm not I actually have no idea. I just heard the second hand. So I don't know the details

872
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:16,900
Yeah, but anyway, he he made that one video explaining that he was going to try and focus on this comic

873
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:22,100
And you know make a whole chapter and you know stuff like that and I watched this video and he talks to

874
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,100
um

875
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:29,540
The the guy who made earthworm jim who has like his own youtube show. I saw that I saw that yeah

876
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,220
And he was giving advice and it was like I was listening because it was like obviously

877
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:37,940
Useful advice for me as well because I'm thinking of doing or I am doing comics now

878
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:46,740
And he was saying that you know, there's no reason to get like published by a publisher when you have this internet

879
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,980
Presence it, you know

880
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:53,620
Rusty is obviously very um, he's got like a few hundred thousands of subscribers

881
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,820
He can get this comic out to a lot of people. He's a million. He's a million subscriber boys, isn't he? I think so

882
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,060
Oh, is he?

883
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,020
I was it was a the knife the knife game song went like

884
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:10,820
Really popular like back in the day. Is that views or is that subscribers? You got 1.38 million. There you go

885
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,140
That's that yeah, holy shit. All right. I misread that as well. But yeah

886
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,300
He's got a big platform and for that reason his

887
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,020
it's quite easy for him

888
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:23,940
comparatively to

889
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:29,860
Launch a comic off the back of because of the amount of eyeballs he can get to his thing and it's like true

890
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:36,900
Maybe maybe it's not such a bad idea to do youtube for just that purpose if that would help

891
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:42,260
Yeah, because it's not like rusty has made comic videos the entire time. He just makes things

892
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:49,220
He makes videos about all sorts of things like any any platform that you establish a presence on you can use it to

893
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,020
like siphon

894
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:57,300
Views from it to anywhere else you want to them to go. Yeah true true

895
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,100
I was just thinking about that. I don't know whether I would go like

896
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:05,940
Come back full on like hypocrite in the same because it's that sort of stuff is

897
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:12,340
Very time consuming. I would probably be yeah, I probably but basically I'd be a come a big old sell out

898
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:15,620
And I try to get as much subscribers as possible completely cynically

899
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:22,100
But I don't know whether that's also either that is the is the best way to go about it. I might have to like

900
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:29,220
Figure out some sort of hybrid that is satisfying enough for the old fans and then can get lots of new fans

901
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:34,660
And then build that up just in the background somehow. I don't know these things can be challenging

902
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,260
I mean, I think we've been trying

903
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:42,420
But I mean one of the things I'm doing with reagua is like I think people are just I certainly feel exhausted with like

904
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:47,380
An attempt to play the algorithm and when I look at everybody else, I mean just do what the fuck you want

905
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:51,860
I saved up money so I could do what I want. So fuck it. I'm just gonna make the projects

906
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:56,980
That I feel like making and if I die, well, fuck it. I'll look. I've got a good degree

907
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:00,900
I've worked in a job if I lose all my money. I'll just fuck off get a job

908
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:06,340
Do youtube temporarily for a while and then try this thing again in a couple years once I've saved up money

909
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:12,340
Uh, you know, I'll be fine. So I'm not worried about me with the thing with like playing the algorithm

910
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,260
Is that none of us were

911
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,700
willing to go

912
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,300
Full shill we can't go Jeff. I can't do it. I just can't do it

913
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:22,660
It makes me want to die like if we can't if we can't do that then we don't

914
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:28,340
You can't expect to to game the algorithm because I was saying the other day using creative

915
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,820
Creativity points you're gonna run out of those

916
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:37,780
I was saying that I think reagua was the worst possible combination of too much production value meaning it takes up too much time

917
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,060
and

918
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:46,180
And also not enough to be justified in people waiting for it or whatever the worst possible middle ground is how I think it

919
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:50,500
Ended up. Um, whereas opposed to like some people spam every day a bunch of videos. That's fine

920
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:53,540
Or you make one a month and that's, you know, really nice or whatever

921
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,180
There's a bunch of youtubers that I watch like they do

922
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,900
Take sponsorships and they do ads

923
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,340
But they do them in a way that is just like openly

924
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:09,060
Disdainful of the thing and like I would somehow they somehow they keep getting like the the offers

925
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:13,700
And like they just keep doing it and like I guess it's just fine

926
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:20,580
I mean, what's the what's the purpose of advertising to increase brand awareness primarily just so that when that person

927
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,060
Thinks of oh, I need to buy this product

928
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:29,300
What comes to their mind is the thing that that youtuber was shitting on just because it's the first thing they think of

929
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:34,180
And so in that way, maybe it's fulfilling. It's it's need probably if they're saying a boost in sales

930
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:37,540
I guess like like we all need to get into that rage shadow legends of money

931
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:42,580
Like like like big joe will just end a video with like by the way guys

932
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:47,060
This video is sponsored by squarespace. You know, I always wanted to make

933
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:51,300
A website about like how much I love mayonnaise

934
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:56,900
So I I made a website and I put a picture of mayonnaise on it. Whoo squarespace and like that's the ad

935
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,740
Yeah

936
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:01,700
You know, that that's a minimal level of selling out

937
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,940
Very minimal very minimal. I don't know. I don't know. How does he how does he get away with it?

938
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,740
This mad is amazing

939
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,620
I like jesse's um

940
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:15,940
Squarespace fake ad where it's like a space where you put squares

941
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:21,940
You got squares. Here's a space for them. Somehow. I never figured that out as a pun

942
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:26,260
Of possibility. It's just so obvious. I still don't get it, but I'm laughing

943
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:32,500
It's if you got squares, this is the place. What? This is the space to put your

944
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
Squarespace

945
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:42,100
Expecting a lot from this over here, you know, just some high tier word play

946
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,060
Some high t word play for us low t

947
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
I mean my onions

948
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:56,980
I'm gonna make some curry later and put some onions in there. Oh, it's I was thinking of getting into curry

949
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,580
You've planted the seed get into it, bro. Join me on the curry train

950
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:05,620
Yes, your your sodium will go up, but it's worth it. Pay that piper pay that piper

951
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,660
It's the best food I've ever eaten in my life and I made it

952
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:11,860
I bought a big bag of fucking sweet potatoes fucking yams

953
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:16,820
I cannot wait to put that in my new fucking curry and enjoy that. It's the best part of the curry

954
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:22,900
Fuck the meat. It's all about the sweet potatoes. That's the best part. No, let's fuck this fucked up, man

955
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:25,380
I know it sounds insane, but it's true

956
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:29,940
It's true. I mean, I do love when you're low t you get into sweet potatoes, I guess

957
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:33,620
Yeah, yeah, so they're full of phytoestrogens, bro

958
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:37,460
Oh, shit, bro. I can feel my gains draining from my body

959
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:44,020
That's like you hear about the uh, the miracle burger is uh full of estrogen or whatever is like a fake

960
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:52,420
The sex change those damn globalists will stop at nothing to drain america sounds like a conspiracy to normalize trans people

961
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:58,020
We can't have that to normalize trans facts, but we won't allow it and I think

962
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:05,300
Probably it's against my judaeo christian values somehow. I don't know the chapter and verse, but I'm sure it's in there somewhere

963
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:11,780
I've no doubt. I've no doubt. Don't eat my discomfort. It's definitely a moral obligation, right? It's not just that. I'm not used to it

964
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,860
It's that I it's morally wrong

965
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:17,140
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think so and

966
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,540
gross

967
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:22,740
God created the biggest sin of all and yucky

968
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,260
Ew gross nasty

969
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:30,740
Uh, well, I want we could move to the fuck are we all are we all fucked out?

970
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:37,540
Are we all have we fucked one another enough for our time being are we all satisfied? I'm satisfied with the sex we've had today

971
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,980
Oh, yeah

972
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,940
Okay, I think we've had some positive exchanges here. So

973
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:47,460
We're all positive fluid exchanges. You know what I'm saying

974
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:51,940
If you catch my innuendo, I caught more than you in the window you bastard

975
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,860
Uh, well, all right speak pipe link boys and girls down below in the description

976
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,460
Uh, you can call it you can click on it. You can leave us voicemails if they're good

977
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,700
We will respond it on the show like you're about to see here before you on this very day

978
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:10,980
So first up to the gate to the slaughter is pancakes with craters

979
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:16,100
Why is our first voicemail? Let's hear why indeed go

980
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:22,660
Okay, pcp. We know how the views of game review channels usually work

981
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:27,460
They got they get about one two million views tops depending on the channel

982
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:34,340
There's a channel used to be called classic game room now going by the name 80s comics that has a video

983
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,460
Called classic game room hd

984
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,500
Ben 10 alien force for the we

985
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,100
review

986
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,780
And it has over

987
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,300
55 million views

988
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:52,420
Now this video is not special. It is no different than any of the other videos he does

989
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,220
I'm just wondering how such an oddity

990
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,460
Can occur

991
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:59,060
on youtube kids

992
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:04,020
It's the bats phenomenon. Yeah, I was thinking of the bat. I thought of bats as well. Yeah

993
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:08,580
Jesse's video bats that just has five million views for like no good reason. It doesn't make any sense

994
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:11,700
It is great video, but you know still the algorithm

995
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:18,500
Sometimes it just grabs one and it just shares it to everybody and this one does sound like the algorithm just grabs shit

996
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:25,460
Like I remember uh a few months ago everyone was weirded out because like it just put uh mkbhd's first video

997
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:28,580
He ever did and the algorithm was showing up and everyone's recommended

998
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:34,660
And it's like from when he was like 15 reviewing an old hp computer that nobody cared about and the quality was shit

999
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:39,140
Everyone's like, why is this like popular right now? Like what made this relevant?

1000
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:42,260
Who's very strange man? Speaking of the algorithm, uh

1001
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:47,300
chris chan and also speaking of rad con and lectures chris chan lecture is like

1002
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:52,900
It's gonna hit a million views in like it might have hit a million views by the time that this uh episode goes

1003
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:58,020
Oh, holy shit. It's gonna. It's like four. It's like four. It's like four thousand away. God damn

1004
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:04,180
but then and and also it's seeing a spike in views but simultaneously the uh the like

1005
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:08,500
Ad revenue like cost per mil is like just like plummeted

1006
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:13,940
So it's like getting like more views than usual, but it's making less money than usual and it's pissing me off

1007
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,740
And I don't like probably because it's not advertiser friendly

1008
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:22,580
It nothing changed. It's the same video youtube's policy change. It's the new year

1009
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,660
YouTube's no policies continue. I mean it could be something as simple as

1010
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:30,420
Because like it you get paid based on what ads are actually served

1011
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:34,260
So maybe it's happened to have like a batch of ads that don't pay as much

1012
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:40,180
That is theoretically possible. Well, they nothing is lost. Stop it. Yeah, you should give me the good ads, please

1013
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:47,540
Oh, just just for posterity sake. I found the tweet twitter has like apparently a search feature, but it's terrible

1014
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:54,820
Uh, I found the sonic the hedgehog tweet. It has 15 000 likes and 3 000 retweets

1015
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:58,660
Goodness gracious. Yeah, it was it was you posting it

1016
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:05,220
Uh, I can I can yeah, why not? Let's let the people I've seen it before but posted anyway. All right. I'll I'll link it

1017
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:11,220
Or I'll try it. I'm just clicking on on jesse's bat's review. Uh, a manchild, ink formally

1018
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:17,940
Shit, what was it formally horseshoe reviews and I remember drying horseshoes. Yeah, horseshoes. Yeah, and it's

1019
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,540
5.3 million views. That's fucking insane. I would be

1020
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,860
It would be pretty cool

1021
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:28,580
Sonic the hedgehog 20. That's it's good. It's great. All you need. Yeah, everybody loves this

1022
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:33,700
It would be pretty cool if uh, my lecture saw big spike in views when I hit a million

1023
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:37,220
Maybe it will be nice. It'll probably just keep on chugging

1024
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,260
I mean a million views on a lecture is fucking amazing. So I can't hear anyone. Hang on

1025
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:47,060
So what you get that that low low quality kami microphone?

1026
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,860
Ben when are you gonna get a fucking real?

1027
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:55,940
Microphone get an 80 2020 and a scarlet solo like indeed probably all in all with the mic arm probably like a

1028
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:02,340
Six seven hundred dollar investment all told if you're gonna start doing wait six seven hundred dollars

1029
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:07,540
I mean, there's the microphone. That's like four hundred dollars. The mic arm is a hundred dollars. Wait, what?

1030
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:11,380
An 80 2020 do I have a 20 20 or 40 40?

1031
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:17,780
I have a 80 2020. So I have a 40 40 like the upgrade. Okay. That's why that's that's the difference

1032
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:20,740
You spend four hundred dollars on a microphone. I think so pretty sure

1033
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:25,060
Why youtube compresses audio, there's no reason to spend more than a hundred dollars

1034
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:31,380
From econ for ten dollars. Nice. It's got that snow. Got that snowball ice, baby

1035
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:38,180
I am very satisfied with the performance of this microphone as my one mic for everything for the last like

1036
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,940
It's just so overkill. That's so overkill

1037
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:46,900
I mean, it's like big dick energy for sure, but like jesus

1038
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:50,980
I mean, you're not wrong. You're not wrong. But hey, let's not let's consider the fact at the time

1039
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:56,740
I was a employed programmer with a stable job and had income at the time

1040
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:03,940
You could have bought an 80 2020 and a ps4 pro. What were you thinking? That's not very gamer of you fair enough

1041
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:09,940
All right. Well, whatever. Whatever we're talking about. Let's just go to the next fucking voicemail. Uh, les are okay. We're back, buddy

1042
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,660
We're back. All right. Wait, where are we off? Are we off?

1043
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:17,380
Uh, we're talking about what was the voicemail? I don't remember. Uh

1044
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:23,300
Pancakes with craters. What about eliezer? Did he send a voicemail in? Oh, well, no, I just said like he would cut this section

1045
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:28,660
When you died, we said to cut that part out. It's fine. I mean, I came back almost in like two minutes. You did well

1046
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:32,580
Shit, well, we're still addressing it. Do you want to keep eliezer? If this part's interesting, keep it

1047
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:36,340
Ah, shit. All right. We'll no matter. All right. You can be the judge. I guess. Let's go to our next voicemail

1048
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:40,340
Anyway, which is from the puppet master. Uh, let's hear what he has to say

1049
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:46,500
Go. Oh, hello. This is comrade now from the pc fc pc rsh

1050
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:52,340
I have another comrade. Yes, welcome to speak to you. We are covering over the transfragistrnia transmitter

1051
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:55,700
Okay, I'm going to print him in there. Okay. Goodbye

1052
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,620
Bye

1053
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,580
Hello

1054
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,700
um

1055
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:07,300
So this is not another episode in the communist hell saga

1056
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,260
But it is somewhat related and I'd like to speak to

1057
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,820
digi in particular

1058
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:15,300
If he's on this episode, but I guess all of you

1059
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:17,380
lol

1060
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:22,020
Okay, a big problem that I think a lot of people have is starting a project

1061
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:27,060
And just, you know losing interest in it and not finishing it and I guess digi is

1062
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:32,420
You know, he's the one who's kind of known for that, but um, I'm just curious, uh

1063
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:36,900
How do you guys deal with that partially, uh, you know, how do you yeah?

1064
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:43,140
Stop yourself. How do you keep your in keep yourself interested in whatever project you're working on?

1065
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,180
and uh

1066
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,700
I don't know

1067
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:52,420
For the more autistic pc p members. Uh, does being autistic

1068
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:58,660
Help you in any way to stay interested and to be really obsessed with your projects such that you can finish them

1069
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,100
Did you poison your mind bro?

1070
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,980
I can't

1071
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,980
Anyway, thanks guys

1072
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:12,500
Talk to you later. Does being autistic like help you focus on your project, dude? Is that like helpful for you?

1073
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:17,220
Shut up. Oh, that's oh is that what yeah, that's fucking stupid god. I mean, that's really dumb

1074
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:22,820
So no ignoring that have I gone on record enough times to saying how much I hate the fucking digi autism meme

1075
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:26,420
It's fine as a joke that one could use in a funny goofy way

1076
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:30,180
But this guy's taking it too seriously. I can already tell uh chill bro chill

1077
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,820
All right beyond that

1078
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:39,380
The way to finish project, uh, you utilize you got to utilize your mind's weaknesses against itself

1079
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:42,100
You got to weaponize your own cognitive biases

1080
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:47,060
For example the sunk cost effect, right? Oh, yeah, that's a good one

1081
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:52,660
I've put so much effort into slime and punishment that I can't possibly live with myself if I don't finish it

1082
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,060
I know I I must do it

1083
01:20:55,540 --> 01:21:01,060
Um, even even if I even if I like even if I lost all enthusiasm for it

1084
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,780
Like I would still have to do it or I would just um

1085
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:09,540
Or I like like the pain I would experience from not finishing it is worse than than the suffering

1086
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,780
I would have to go through to slog through to the end

1087
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,220
um

1088
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:15,220
So

1089
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:17,860
Person finally stop

1090
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:23,460
Like they they they've been on hiatus for a million years and then they finally said actually i'm just gonna not do it

1091
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:28,340
Maybe release the rest of the the story is text. I think davoo told me about that

1092
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:34,180
I didn't know but that's interesting. She's been doing enough like a million fucking years. Yeah

1093
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:40,820
Uh, I mean, okay. This is a complicated question the real answer. I would say it's it's a multi-faceted one

1094
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:47,940
Okay, like one here's how you retain enthusiasm. There's a bunch of ways one finish the project fast

1095
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:52,180
Don't like if you just get it out fast. Oh, you don't have time to regret it

1096
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:56,660
Like that's important like work like finish it like like go at it with furious energy

1097
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:01,460
Yeah, uh terrified because if you like like like the sort of dam

1098
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:05,620
Whenever you're working on something on a long-term project or even a short-term project

1099
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:10,820
The sort of damocles is always over your head and that sort of damocles is boredom at some point

1100
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:14,420
You don't know when it will drop and you will start to hate the thing you're working on

1101
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:19,380
So it's always a race against time weaponize that initial burst of energy as much as you can

1102
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:22,180
The way to think about it really is

1103
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:24,420
is that um

1104
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:32,580
Every project is really hard to get off the ground and you need a lot of motivation and an you know excitement to get you like

1105
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:37,220
Accelerate it like you start at zero speed and you're trying to build up speed

1106
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,420
Uh, and once you're going it's easier to keep going

1107
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:45,380
Um, a lot of the time if you take a break you slow down and if you take a break for too long

1108
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:50,740
You slow down to zero and then yeah without that initial without the initial spark

1109
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:55,460
You have to somehow get back to the speed you were before and it's very demoralizing

1110
01:22:55,780 --> 01:23:00,820
Trying to do that and failing over and over again to get back to the right speed and then you know

1111
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:06,180
Every failure becomes more of a failure more of a reason that you fail the next time

1112
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:10,660
Let's consider this in context though because the guy who's calling in is of course

1113
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,020
I mean the puppet master

1114
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:15,620
I I don't know if you said that before but this is the guy who was doing like the communist hell

1115
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:19,940
Uh, like chairman Mao and I don't know who else so he's so like he's tired of that

1116
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:24,820
I guess it sounds to me if I I mean he didn't say this but inferring as I am with my big brain

1117
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:28,340
I would guess that he's referring probably to this narrative and

1118
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:33,780
Like I was just saying like being if you got it done fast and conclude it. That's fine. Here's another important one

1119
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:38,740
I suspect you didn't have like a vision in your mind for how to end this thing and that's fine

1120
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:45,060
I would say that like having that is important because one of the important things to do is not let the scope

1121
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:49,620
Drift out of your control so that one you don't even know what to do with it and two

1122
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:55,940
Even if you knew it would take so much energy to actually finish it that that in of itself is intimidating and

1123
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,940
demoralizing so like if you if you have the desire first of all

1124
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:05,780
I release you from any obligation to end the communist hell saga. We all enjoyed it. It was lots of fun

1125
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:09,860
You do not have to conclude it in any big epic way or anything like that

1126
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,140
But if you wanted to it sounds like you probably don't have a plan right now

1127
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:16,340
I would just say if why not do just like one final thing

1128
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:22,500
Take like the 10 minutes write down just a couple of lines. You think it'd be a funny way to like maybe hell explodes

1129
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:27,140
I don't know. Everyone goes to heaven. Uh epic goof. I don't know whatever whatever the fuck you want to do

1130
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:30,820
But you gotta don't do that. That sucks. Sure. That sucks

1131
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:35,780
But there's something that doesn't suck but like make it well make just narrow down your work by giving you something not

1132
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,860
Have a goal. Use those smart goals

1133
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:43,140
Here's my like big brain idea for for how this works. Yeah the

1134
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:49,940
A lot of the advice is plan better and make sure that you don't slow down

1135
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:52,180
But if you're already in that funk

1136
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,860
Um, I think the best thing to do if you really just

1137
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:01,460
You don't like you don't have a clear goal for where you're going and you feel bad that you're not doing anything

1138
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,940
But you also don't want to do it. Just cancel it

1139
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,660
There's no there's no like

1140
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:12,020
Yeah, um, there's no shame in cancelling a project so that you can work on something that will actually get done

1141
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,660
If you're just if you just don't want to do it, right?

1142
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:19,700
Then just like if you're at the point where you're like, I don't want to be satisfied with communist hell

1143
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:24,500
If that's what you're talking about. I feel no need. I don't I'm not even I'm not talking about communist

1144
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:28,100
I'm just talking janitor. I don't know. Is this about communist?

1145
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,020
I'm inferring it. I don't know for sure

1146
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:33,380
It's not clear anything if you just if you don't want to do it anymore, and they just don't do it

1147
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:36,900
Uh, and like, yeah, well the the reason I feel like

1148
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:43,860
Confident and happy about this lord of ghost comic is because I planned it all out before I started like quote unquote started

1149
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:46,420
um before I announced it and

1150
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:49,780
The whole thing is planned out from beginning to end and I like, you know

1151
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:55,140
I I wrote the entire thing and then did like a screenplay with dialogue before I started drawing

1152
01:25:55,540 --> 01:26:00,740
You know the pre-production is integral to making sure the the process of making it goes very smoothly

1153
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:03,140
And so because I did a lot of pre-production

1154
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:07,620
I'm confident it can work if I just went into it and

1155
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:11,700
You know had the same lofty ideals of how big it would be and how long it would go

1156
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:16,980
But had no real plan to fall back on it would be much easier for me to take a break

1157
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:20,900
And then lose momentum and then want to quit because I didn't know what I was doing

1158
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:23,460
and so the pre-production

1159
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:24,900
is

1160
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,300
It allows me to maintain my

1161
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:34,580
My speed so that I can get to the end of the project as fast as possible and and not slow down at any point

1162
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,180
um

1163
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,180
And that's why I know that's that's gonna work

1164
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:43,460
So it's it's it's it's really just a matter of planning out these projects beforehand

1165
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:47,140
That's the main thing similarly if you're going into a project with no plan

1166
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:52,500
It's okay for like it to just be shit like the um

1167
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:57,620
Yeah, the the canon story comic I I made I made um

1168
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:01,220
Just because why not I was bored or something

1169
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:06,180
I I forget the reason but I thought wouldn't it be cool to do that during a stream and I did a stream

1170
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:12,820
Where I drew a comic panel and then saw what happens next and then it was finished in the stream

1171
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:15,940
And it was incredibly low quality

1172
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,940
But the fact that it was a project that was started and finished really quickly

1173
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:27,300
It didn't matter the the motivation like the the happiness that came from a completed project no matter how shit it was

1174
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:31,460
Was like powerful enough to spark the next one which was bell shape

1175
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:35,540
And that one did have a lot of hurdles because I did slow down at points

1176
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:38,580
Um, I just really really wanted it to be finished

1177
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:42,740
But yeah, yeah, it's it. There's no problem with like

1178
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:48,100
quitting if you have no idea of what to do next or

1179
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:50,820
desire to continue

1180
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:55,380
I think he's gotten plenty of advice on this friend especially especially if like

1181
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:02,500
To continue something you would have to like not do another thing that maybe yeah, you would be more interested in

1182
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,100
Yeah

1183
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:07,380
Yeah, we've he's heard enough. Yeah enough for you

1184
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:11,460
Or spend too much time with his asshole. It's mostly just me boasting

1185
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,740
That's all right. We've got a message here

1186
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:23,060
Titled pokemon sword and shield. Let's quickly shift into the pokemon podcast people in the comments people in the comments

1187
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:28,580
Said that tom the guy who wrote the christmas carol about me. Yeah, he should be him. He should be in voice grail

1188
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:34,100
I don't know. I don't want to go very true back and nominate him for voice. Absolutely true. All right, tom

1189
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:40,660
Tom's going in voice grail. No other tom. Yeah, not this guy's not good enough. You haven't pulled your way. All right, tom

1190
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,580
No, no, no. I'll get there someday. Tom more like tomb

1191
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:50,820
To me for christmas. Please kill Ben saying I hate him. Yeah, it's all good stuff. All right

1192
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:55,300
Next voicemail right pokemon sword and shield. Let's hear what he has to say. Take it away

1193
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:59,300
Hey, mr. Best guy ever in your content video

1194
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:04,260
You talked about the trs and pokemon sword and shield and how you didn't know what it was

1195
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:10,580
If you go to one of the guys in the town there, he's all like bro. It's so vintage. It's vinyl. They're vinyls

1196
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:17,140
They're records. It's technical records. They they look like records and they break and they suck because they're records

1197
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,220
And it's vintage and then the tms

1198
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,740
Are technical like machines or some shit and they're like cds

1199
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:27,140
That's all I have to say. It's do what you will with that information. Okay

1200
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,660
Thank you for the okay in in pokemon sword and shield

1201
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:35,860
There are tms. You know tms now are multi use you can use them in infinite number of times

1202
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:40,500
But they also introduced this thing called tr as you get in the max raid battles that are

1203
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:43,940
They're they're they're the old like one time use version of tms

1204
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:48,340
So you might get a tr of earthquake you can use it one time and then oh items destroyed

1205
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:55,140
So now i'm getting it. It's like wait. Okay, it's like old tms. I don't do they look like do they look like records?

1206
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,300
They look they're

1207
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:04,260
Black as opposed to the other cds of tms that are like whitish. So there is a difference there. Yeah, I guess that makes sense

1208
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,740
That seems

1209
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:11,460
It seems obvious. I well, I don't know. I just see a tr and it's a different color

1210
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:15,380
I'm still confused as to what a tm is exactly. Oh wait

1211
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:22,820
Like how does a cd teach a pokemon a move? It looks like a disc based based on how it looks when you apply them in the gba games

1212
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:27,300
You basically glue it to their head and then it absorbs into their body and now they know something

1213
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,980
I know I've said this in the past, but in the pokemon adventures comic

1214
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:35,940
I believe by the way, I finally found the serial experiments lane tweet. It's not actually that much. Oh good

1215
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:41,140
It just is a lot for me. Okay. We'll say 500 retweets and about a thousand likes. I mean that's that's good

1216
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:45,220
That's good. And yeah, this is great. Um, but uh, that is so much better than my tweet

1217
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:48,020
I hate on this subject of technical

1218
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:51,540
Machines whatever in the pokemon adventures manga read

1219
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:57,220
At one point when he's battling someone he he has an evie and he uses a tm on evie

1220
01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:00,100
And I remember vividly because I was so freaked out by this

1221
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:05,220
He what he does is he has like two pieces of a machine. It apparently is a tm

1222
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:07,460
It's it's like a box. It's like a box

1223
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:13,780
He pulls it apart holds the pieces on either side of an evie's head and we can see like a data stream

1224
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:19,220
Like pass in between or something and it's like sticking it was teaching it mimic or whatever

1225
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:23,140
He's teaching his evie a move via this like weird data stream or something

1226
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:28,180
But it's the it's a disc now. You can't do that with a disc. I don't understand

1227
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:32,900
I mean the manga the mangas aren't the mangas aren't canon. So what are you gonna do?

1228
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:37,700
I think I've been confused for a long time on this whole just throw it like a shuriken and they catch it

1229
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:39,780
Yeah

1230
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:44,420
That'll do the job. Okay. Anyway, it's a rocket. I'm trying to I'm trying to find a picture of the sprite

1231
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:47,940
Because I want to see what they actually look like so I can make fun of you for not getting it

1232
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:53,940
It's just I don't know 25. They don't even show it in game. It's just like in the inventory

1233
01:31:54,020 --> 01:32:00,180
It's they don't have a sprite like items, right? They do Ben just google tm 25 in the menu or whatever. It doesn't matter and go to bulbapedia

1234
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:05,860
tm 25 that that's thunder and just click on it and it'll show you there's like this yellow disc and that's what

1235
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:11,300
Yeah, but that's a tm. I what does a tr look like? Oh, oh shit. It's that but black. He has like a black

1236
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:16,580
Fuck. Okay. I can't remember. Do the trs have names. Are they numbered?

1237
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:20,260
Yeah, they're the same the numbers are the same. They're just you know

1238
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:23,140
I'm searching tr 25 bulbapedia

1239
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:31,620
Got it. Okay. This is apparently scy shock here here. I'm putting the show notes. Enjoy everyone this link to tr 25 scy shock

1240
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:34,820
There you go. Click on it. You'll see it just as black okay black edges

1241
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:41,140
Oh, that's a record dude. I didn't okay now. I know that's a record. That's what a record looks like

1242
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,420
Unable to bun guy everybody

1243
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:48,740
That's a that's a great day of cosplay

1244
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:54,340
Yeah, I don't oh wait. It's not cut. It's like this is like proto-dave at the beginning of the series. Yeah

1245
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:58,740
Well, I'm wait fighting. Well, what's what's what color is red? I guess fire

1246
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:04,420
This one's pink. So it's a scy shock. So it's a psychic move. I guess so we need we need a fire type tr

1247
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:10,580
Oh, yeah, that'd be perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Anyway, uh, let's move on to our next voicemail

01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,140

1250
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:25,380
Hey guys, happy new year. Hello. So every new year. I thought it would be fun for you guys to do some predictions about

1251
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:28,420
2030 like for example

1252
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:31,300
Does the piece piece still exist?

1253
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:32,900
or

1254
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:38,580
Um, YouTube is no longer the place for most people watch your videos, you know, maybe a new platform has been created

1255
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,980
So, yeah, I thought it would be fun for you guys to do these predictions so that in 10 years

1256
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:46,260
We can listen back to this podcast and see if you guys were correct

1257
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:51,620
I hope you have fun. Okay. Well, see you in 10 years. Bye. See you then buddy

1258
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:57,380
If if the another prediction if a prediction of like youtube won't be around is correct

1259
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:02,340
We won't be able to come back and check that we were correct. Well, this does exist on other formats. It's on

1260
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:06,260
Yeah, yeah, you know other podcast format itunes and a couple other places

1261
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:09,620
Um, you'll have you'll have to pledge to our patreon

1262
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:15,220
Secret bonus the old bonus content now lost to time everywhere else. Damn true. Um

1263
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:20,180
I think I think I think I mean

1264
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:27,460
For myself like my plan in life is like maybe even if um, like

1265
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:32,420
I have to get like a real job again. I'm still gonna do like all my internet stuff

1266
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:36,980
I just won't be as you know, I don't have as much time. So I'm gonna keep doing it pretty much no matter what

1267
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:39,700
I'll be cringe posting till the day I die

1268
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:44,980
I saw ben. I loved your tweet the other day that here it is my final cringe post of the decade

1269
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:50,180
I thought of that the day before and I was like, but I can't post it today

1270
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:52,660
You gotta wait because then I I can't post until the end of the year

1271
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:56,180
So I had to wait until the day the last day cringe posting later that day

1272
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,500
It's like I gotta make my final cringe

1273
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:05,140
You technically posted it within January 1st in my time. Your time zone is not real

1274
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:11,300
So if you ever tried the cringe post in the uk, oh, oh, yeah, I'll bring it up. You're not allowed. You're not allowed

1275
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:14,100
Hey, you said you said it was your last one. You said

1276
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:21,220
Um, okay. Well, you took exist. What do you think? I'm sorry to break it to you, but I'm sure I have many more cringe posts in me

1277
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:23,460
Over the coming decade

1278
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:29,060
All right, so short version I I plan on working with you guys in some version for for a long time

1279
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:31,060
So I think the pcp in some form

1280
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:37,060
I plan on throwing all of you under the bus. Yeah, that'll be good to gain clout for myself. Oh, yeah

1281
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:40,660
Well, I yeah, that's been obvious for a while. Yeah, that's as soon as possible

1282
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:45,060
I plan on teleporting behind you so that the bus kills both of us

1283
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,540
great

1284
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:53,060
Biting my time for the perfect opportunity to jump ship as this whole thing crashes and burns

1285
01:35:53,060 --> 01:36:00,100
So I can escape scoffing want the pcp to exist. I mean 10 years is a long time. We'll be like 40 basically at that time

1286
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:06,660
Um, I will be 40. I'll be I'll be technically just under 40, but I hope I hope the pcp

1287
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:11,220
Doesn't exist not because like I I hope we all

1288
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:16,340
Like fall out. Yeah, I definitely hope we're all still friends, but I hope that we're all like

1289
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:20,340
More professionals you hope that we found something better to do

1290
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:24,500
Yeah, like like I would still love to talk with you. I'm not holding my breath

1291
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:28,100
I was still loved like I would love for like tom to be a game developer

1292
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:32,500
Uh, I would love I mean, you know, if that's what you you're going for

1293
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:34,260
Yeah, like for all of our projects

1294
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:40,980
We're working on now to be like more upgraded versions by that right right did she will probably have a kid and that would be funny

1295
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:47,940
You know you guys yeah the biggest downgrade of all by that time frame. I plan on having a kid or two. Yeah, so you know

1296
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:52,180
They can oh my god, they can start the new pcp

1297
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:57,380
Oh, that's their destiny. They can start content is just a fucking

1298
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:02,740
Trojan horse to like to have the dads hang out. Oh, that sounds fine. Maybe we could have them on

1299
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:06,180
No, we should we should re-brand us like the dad the old dad

1300
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:11,780
Oh, they could make a our children could make the pre teen cp. You know, it'll be

1301
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:17,380
Hey, anyone who donates $10,000 to the Kickstarter gets to name digi's kid

1302
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,900
We're not going to tell him that

1303
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:26,020
We're gonna sneak in and and and and write on the birth certificate before he can

1304
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:33,460
Yes, this is all great. This is all gold. That's so seriously if you're a dad, you're kicked from the pcp

1305
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:37,460
I don't make the rules. I just thank you. Thank you. I mean, okay

1306
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:40,020
I think I

1307
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:46,980
Personally like my goals are I would love if my channel could get big and I make a million billion dollars. Yay, wouldn't that be nice?

1308
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:54,740
I'm gonna I still want like my goal in life is to make good youtube videos that people find entertaining and hopefully interesting

1309
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:58,100
Uh, and I'm gonna try to make them better and better as I go

1310
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:03,220
So, I mean, I I want to do that. That's the thing I want to do. Maybe I'll like work with more editors

1311
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,900
Maybe I'll try to make them fancy or whatever. I don't know, but that's what I want to be doing

1312
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:14,020
Yeah, what I want to be doing is making comics and yeah, like writing for movies and and doing all that cool

1313
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:19,700
Shit by that point definitely something that I've been working on will be out from my writing work

1314
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:23,620
Sure, sure, and then I'll be like, uh getting money from it or something

1315
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:27,700
I have some desire to crack into voice acting to some degree, but that's kind of on the back burner

1316
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:30,020
So I'm not I have some desire to voice crack

1317
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,100
Oh

1318
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:39,460
Happens when you least expect it, you know, I'd like to I'd like to sound a bit of this voice crack storyboard for cartoons

1319
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:43,700
I think I could do that really good. I could do that real good

1320
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:49,940
I know the guy who uh used to make that webcomic three-word phrase got a job storyboarding for regular show man

1321
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:56,900
I'm sure it's like hard, but like it looks so fucking easy. Sure. Sure. It looks so easy

1322
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:02,900
Yeah, uh, I want to do storyboards for family guy personally. Uh, I want to

1323
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:05,620
Be like uh lois

1324
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:08,580
Forget about it

1325
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:16,260
His classic line forget about it lois. Um, that's what I'm looking forward to that's gonna be my career

1326
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:20,180
Uh, other than that, I'd like to live in a nicer place. I want to leave the ghetto

1327
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:24,980
Um, you know, I guess this isn't really in keeping with the spray. He has four predictions

1328
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:28,980
Yeah, I was gonna say so like will youtube still exist. What do you think about youtube?

1329
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,500
I think youtube will still exist. I mean facebook. I think youtube will

1330
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,740
Uh, uh, what's the word?

1331
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:40,340
My space still exists. Uh, so it's just I don't think youtube will be nearly as relevant

1332
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:46,260
I think micro content is gonna start taking over. I think i don't think so. I don't think so reduce people's standards

1333
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:51,860
I don't think I would like that but I don't think the idea of like youtube as a platform will probably exist

1334
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:57,220
It may not be on youtube, but like so many people are so used to this sort of media

1335
01:39:57,460 --> 01:40:01,300
I think it'll be hard to just suddenly disappear for sure youtube will exist

1336
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:03,060
I think that more

1337
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:07,220
I don't like I don't think like a direct youtube competitor will like overtake it

1338
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:14,180
But I think that like alternative platforms that like maybe cover some of the youtube niche will become more viable

1339
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:16,580
Yeah, I think so they're starting. Yeah

1340
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:20,580
Um, there will there will be not there will be not direct competitors

1341
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:26,820
But there will be viable like pseudo competitors and probably like them the the the platforms will diversify

1342
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:33,140
I think youtube will continue to become more commercial and so that'll force underground creators to go somewhere else. Yeah

1343
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:36,820
I possibly in in 30 years

1344
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:39,940
Uh, I'm not 30 years. I mean the next decade

1345
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:43,780
2030 I hope by that point we will have

1346
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:45,460
VR

1347
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:49,380
Games that are actually good games because you admit they're not good right now

1348
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:55,620
I fucking proved it everybody. He admits it that I'm right about vr games. There's a couple good video games

1349
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:01,460
There's a couple good video games, but like I've never felt the urge to go and play a video game in vr

1350
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:06,740
Maybe the half-life one like I've tried it out and it's been it's been it's been like quite nice

1351
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:13,940
But did I bring my did I bring my um oculus to rad con three? No, but you should bring it to rad con four

1352
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:19,700
Yeah, I'll bring it to rag them for we can all play fucking. Yes. I want to play super hot so bad in vr

1353
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:23,780
That's the one game. I actually want to play sounds fucking sick. Okay. Fuck. Yeah. Nice

1354
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:27,540
I didn't actually mean vr. I was going to say something else. Oh, well, still it's a good idea

1355
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:32,260
Like just just general technology improvements, but like I was trying to think of some

1356
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:35,860
Interesting thing, but of course I've got a bold prediction. I don't make technology

1357
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:39,780
I don't know how but of course you couldn't think of anything interesting you idiot. No

1358
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,860
I'm just a creative I suspect

1359
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:48,900
That here's a here's a bold prediction during the next 10 years

1360
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:51,620
effectively

1361
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:54,820
It might exist in some form, but it would be as a shadow of itself

1362
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:59,380
I think that the main line of the final fantasy series will die

1363
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:01,620
It will straight up die

1364
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:08,020
And sure the mmo might exist not it already died. I mean that's that's the thing final fantasy 15 came out

1365
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:15,060
I guess there's no plans right now for final fantasy 16, but like people have hope foolishly. I I don't know people

1366
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:23,140
I'll extend that to to square enix in general as a development. Things will wax and wane in video game franchises

1367
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:28,900
People rely way too much on franchises now and continue to rely on franchises in the future

1368
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:34,820
I think if something dies people will eventually be like, let's bring something back that died earlier

1369
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:37,860
Let's bring back final fantasy. It's been like six years

1370
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:43,780
I mean they're trying like oh my god. It's been such a what like gamers are just gonna keep getting older and they're never going to die

1371
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:49,300
Look at mega men look mega men 10 and they're still gonna want to play final fantasy 7 again and feel like a 12 year old

1372
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:54,340
But it's not gonna work. It's not gonna happen. What I'm saying is I don't like the big like I think that final fantasy 7 remake

1373
01:42:55,140 --> 01:43:00,260
People are very excited about it right now. I do not think it's going to be it's gonna be kind of like

1374
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:01,860
um

1375
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:05,540
Like the force awakens in that people are really excited for it

1376
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:11,700
They see a lot of good things, but like I mean I'm not I'm not even like judging the people or anything

1377
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,700
But I'm just saying like I think that they don't

1378
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:19,860
Know what they're in for because it's just a remake of a story. Everyone already knows

1379
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:26,900
Like I sure Sephiroth's an hd now. Is that really like this is my prediction now. So I can be wrong

1380
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:30,420
Literally people will love it as long as it's not a complete

1381
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:34,500
Adventuring trash fire of a video game people will love it because

1382
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:41,140
Because people still love the star wars movies that have come out for nostalgic reasons. Okay, but that's why I say the that's why I

1383
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:44,340
I pitted as um the force awakens because the force awakens did well

1384
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:49,780
But what it did was it it showed what it or like now we know with the benefit of hindsight

1385
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:55,300
We know that they did not have a plan and that like the next one like wasn't embarrassing

1386
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,940
I mean in the in the internet reviewer

1387
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:05,540
Like bubble that everybody on the internet see on youtube seems to think is the only reaction to the the star wars movies

1388
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:10,500
It seems like the force awakens was the star wars is the last terrible

1389
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:14,340
And will never work um like there are fans of the rise of skywalker

1390
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:20,260
But the rise of skywalker was the worst performing one yet and that's what i'm trying to speak to this trend this downward trend

1391
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:26,500
It's a downward trend. I think I think in 10 years it will still be limping along it will be around fair enough

1392
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:31,860
Nearly be as hype as it used to be but it people the the the the big guys at the top

1393
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:36,500
they they will continue to scramble for any scrap of of

1394
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:41,300
You know, I think the remaking ability they can get I hear you and I see that but I think the remake

1395
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:43,940
It will be more of a catastrophe than anybody expects

1396
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:50,020
specifically because they do not have a plan beyond the first game and they they might they might succeed

1397
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:55,860
Extremely well with this first game just like the force awakens, but I really think with well if it keeps going

1398
01:44:56,580 --> 01:45:02,980
They just have to remake the rest of the story and they will fail and they will fail in doing so in spectacular fashion because they only

1399
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:07,540
Think about midgar. It's the only thing on their mind. They have no plan for the rest of the game

1400
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:09,860
And it's going to people are going to not give a shit

1401
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:11,940
I don't think I don't think that parallel

1402
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:18,900
Is quite the same because the last jedi and rise of skywalker where they're not based on the original star wars

1403
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:22,740
They're not remaking them. They're making a new story and the fact that the story

1404
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:24,500
wasn't very good

1405
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,900
Is separate from it being

1406
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:31,300
You know the same property. I mean these are there are different challenges

1407
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:34,260
But I'm just saying that there are challenges one of them being

1408
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,900
There was no plan

1409
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:43,300
I mean sure the story of final fantasy 7 exists, but like the game game development is very different from movie development

1410
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:46,340
I guess I just don't really see why the

1411
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:50,660
They're not having a quote-unquote plan. I don't know where you're getting the information from

1412
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:56,020
I mean that has been explicitly stated by the developers that they have not planned what the next games are going to

1413
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:00,580
Be about I think that really just means it's going to be a few years between

1414
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:02,820
the parts

1415
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:08,340
Which is I mean I would assume they're going to have to like change things up anyways because they'll be switching platforms after this one

1416
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:14,740
Like that's true. That's true. Look you can disagree all that. That's fine. I just think it's going to fail

1417
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:18,580
I just think your your reasoning is I don't agree with your reasoning

1418
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:24,180
Okay, fair enough plan is is the reason like it the parallel to star wars is not quite the same

1419
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:25,780
I think it will

1420
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:29,780
I'm not saying it's exactly the same situation. I'm saying there's some similarities

1421
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:32,820
I think the reason it would become less

1422
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:37,300
Successful financially is just because

1423
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:44,180
People will realize that a remake of final fantasy 7 is not actually that interesting and they were mostly hyped when the trailer came out

1424
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:46,420
And that's it and that's how it's always going to be

1425
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:53,220
The trailer is the moment where the money should be spent and I think even yeah, they might even like

1426
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:58,980
Well, they kind of already do that don't they they do pre-orders like extremely early. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah years ahead

1427
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:03,940
That's why they go ahead. So they take the money as fast as possible. But I mean, hey, it's coming out in a couple months

1428
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:07,300
I think in march is when the remake episode one is coming out

1429
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,700
Um, so I mean people

1430
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:13,860
March is gonna be a packed month. I think I will be very curious to see

1431
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:15,780
Regarding that game

1432
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:18,980
What like everyone's really excited everyone's just like the remake the remake

1433
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:24,980
But what they don't talk about as much is that hard cutoff. This is not a complete game

1434
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:29,300
It is a piece of a game and how many years are you gonna have to wait for the next one? God knows

1435
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:30,660
God only knows

1436
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:37,380
So I kind of hope this doesn't do well just because I don't want that because like as soon as this model is proven

1437
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:40,580
You like EA and Activision are going to immediately be like we can sell

1438
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,220
A game in three parts

1439
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:48,100
Okay, and then go back through their back catalog and they'll just all the classics

1440
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:52,500
So like we're going to make a trilogy out of all of our classic games and it's going to be bullshit

1441
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:55,220
Is there a game series that's done a trilogy story correctly?

1442
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:58,820
Maybe like god of war did pretty good for its first three games

1443
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:03,860
Max pain. I don't know. I never played it. Yeah crash bandicoot

1444
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:10,660
Um, well, I mean how many of these like were it like mass effect was designed as like a continuing story over three games

1445
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:16,180
God of war wasn't even designed that way. I don't think spiral was I don't think crash was they just as a story

1446
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:20,500
I have no David jaffy created god of war was only involved. I believe right

1447
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:25,140
And I mean a fucking mass effect was a huge catastrophe in the finale as everyone knows

1448
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:32,980
I honestly feel like any game series that starts off thinking they're going to be a trilogy is doomed to be just subpar

1449
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:38,260
I couldn't agree more. That's what that's what happened with fucking ratchet and clank on the ps3

1450
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:38,740
Really?

1451
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:42,020
They had the trilogy on ps2 and then they were like, how cool

1452
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:44,340
Uh, ratchet and clank is a huge

1453
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,340
Thing people will love the next

1454
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:50,580
Trilogy ratchet was not intended the first game was a standalone. It wasn't intended to be a yeah

1455
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:54,660
So that was that that was just like a natural trilogy. It was a very well-selling game

1456
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:58,100
Three of them then ps3 comes around they make the first game

1457
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:02,100
It has a cliffhanger ending a terrible story and I really hated it. I was completely

1458
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:07,700
Disillusioned with ratchet and clank and I did not ever buy a single other game in the franchise after that

1459
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:12,660
I stopped there too. I stopped there too. The second one was ironically a lot better, but uh, maybe I played that

1460
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:16,020
I don't know. Yeah. Well, they fucked up. Yeah, let's do that. We lost a customer

1461
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:20,340
I mean, I bought them both for five dollars in the bargain bin as I do with all the ps3 games

1462
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:24,020
I mean, I put it on release. I'm just curious stupid

1463
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:28,180
The the only game that ever lived up to its hype that I can remember

1464
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:32,660
Is I mean, it wasn't a sequel, but it was like the the demo of Undertale

1465
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:38,180
And then the actual game shocked me by actually being beyond my expectations. You know what you know what?

1466
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:40,020
No, no

1467
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:42,020
Did Undertale demo?

1468
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:46,900
Let me down because the because the demo is the best part of the game in hindsight in hindsight

1469
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:50,420
The moment with toriel is the best part of the whole game. I talked about this in great detail

1470
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:53,940
And I agree that is the best usage of the time reversal thing

1471
01:49:54,180 --> 01:50:00,500
But like all the stuff about the multiple pathways and like being able to do a genocide and how those time

1472
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:04,500
Rewinds they do impact things if you like do a genocide

1473
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:08,580
Then revert it and then do a pacifist and then you get that extra little thing

1474
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:11,940
Where it like confirms you're like still have the soul of a demon or whatever

1475
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:16,500
Once I understood like every detail. I was like as a package

1476
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:18,740
I'm I think that this is it has

1477
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:20,660
greater highs or whatever

1478
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:26,900
But like you you get your best bang for a buck if you just play the demo to its full extent. It's it's true, but um

1479
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:30,340
I don't know whatever. Anyway, love Undertale great game. Etc. Etc. Uh

1480
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:36,900
Fuck me can't wait the delta room to come out so that there'll be more porn of susie draw. That'll be great

1481
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:41,060
Very exciting. That's the only reason is it coming out soon. No. No, I don't know

1482
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:46,100
There's no there's no news at all, but like it's it's likely that he's working on it right now

1483
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:50,660
Probably I wonder if you ever put together that team that he was talking about of uh of capable individuals

1484
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:56,020
He's got all that sweet smash money now. So yeah, yeah, he probably had to fucking pay to get sands in there

1485
01:50:56,900 --> 01:51:03,540
Please put my skeleton son in the game. I'll do anything sakurai proceeds to filet furiously. All right. Anyway

1486
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:06,180
skeleton son

1487
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:13,940
All right, uh, let's go to another voicemail. We got two more. We got uh, like a little troglodyte tip diddling

1488
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:15,860
bitch

1489
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:19,540
Okay, damn. I love I love this guy. This sounds great. My favorite guy

1490
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:23,060
Go last episode in response to my cry for help

1491
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:30,500
Nate bestman asked me if I had asked anyone specifically a girl out before and the answer is fucking yeah

1492
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:31,940
but

1493
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:38,500
In a pretty pussy show way, you see there were two kind the first one was a couple years back a year or two

1494
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,180
I think and

1495
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:46,420
I I really I really fucking went went went zero zero powers zero masculinity in this one

1496
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:50,660
Through a string of fucking, you know doing like this and holy gets homework

1497
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:57,540
I managed to get her fucking medical files and found out that she liked me and I did not I would not until then

1498
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:59,940
Ask her out, but I did

1499
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:02,340
And the pussy is the way

1500
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:09,300
So I fucking instagram dm to like a little little little little bit of fucking tip diddling

1501
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,700
creepy bessen bitch

1502
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:14,900
And instagram, huh?

1503
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:20,660
Luckily enough she responded with a yes. I had a date in time as a movie. She hated the movie

1504
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:27,300
She like fucking watched anime and like fucking listened to kpop and shit. So dodged that bullet, but you know

1505
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:29,540
Slut I did something

1506
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:31,620
Second time asked him about kind of

1507
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:36,100
They were like really into furbies and like poor and shit. So that that wasn't gonna happen

1508
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:38,660
But then they asked me to concentrate after I asked them

1509
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:45,460
So the answer is yes kind of in a pussy way, but basically my fear is now that in this game or age

1510
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,260
It'll be circulated if I do

1511
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:50,260
So

1512
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:55,860
Okay, uh, okay. I got it. I got it. He's got the typical fear. Yeah, so this is teen cp

1513
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:59,860
All right, teen cp translate from zoomer for me. All right, no problem

1514
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:03,460
He just uh, we last time he was asking about like advice or something

1515
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:08,260
Talk girls, blah, blah, whatever and uh, I was like, have you ever talked to a girl?

1516
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:13,300
Have you ever asked one out? It sounds like no because you don't sound very confident, etc

1517
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:19,060
Okay, so apparently he has on a couple of occasions. Great literally twice. Good job. Uh, all right

1518
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:22,580
So your fear about asking girls out and word getting around

1519
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:30,580
G you just got to not worry about that because it doesn't matter. Oh my god. He asked a girl out. How embarrassed

1520
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:35,940
I remember feeling that exact same fear. What if no, no, no, I get it, you know

1521
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:39,860
But when I say it out loud, it sounds pretty fucking stupid, right? It does it does

1522
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:45,940
And and when you're in that situation, do you hear that guy? He he he asked a girl out. He's like interested in romance

1523
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:52,020
Dude, what a fucking loser dude like that guy wants to get his fucking dick wet dude. That's fucking shitty, bro

1524
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:59,620
Cancel him. Yeah, he needs to be cancelled. Kill him Matt. Kill him now. That's a rapist in the making right there. He has a desire

1525
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:01,540
That's disgusting

1526
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:06,180
Um, he has that man is driven. Yeah, that's that's no good. That's no good

1527
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:10,020
He's just a me too moment in the waiting and uh, that's no good

1528
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:13,300
How you should drive him over? You just gotta

1529
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:16,260
Okay, I like I don't know. I remember in my youth

1530
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:22,420
Grappling with this very same issue and what it really came down to was just my deep insecurities

1531
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,580
about like

1532
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:29,060
Like putting any risk out there or having like anything negative happen to me

1533
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:31,540
But these things are so

1534
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:33,540
Inconsequential

1535
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:38,020
Like you're a guy who's done two approaches basically and has been terrified

1536
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:43,140
Those times and I get it. It's terrifying every time you do it. You need to up that number to like a hundred

1537
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:49,700
Then you will stop caring and then you'll be like, yeah, it's fine. It doesn't matter. Uh, I don't know you just gotta

1538
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:55,300
You just gotta lose your fear if you're feeling if you're feeling nervous and you need a confidence boost

1539
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:58,500
Consider bringing a gun to school. Yeah, yeah, that'll do it

1540
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:01,220
You've got nothing to fear then

1541
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:06,660
Yeah, make sense to me. All right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said it. I should have said it on the show

1542
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,900
real answer here is

1543
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:16,820
There is very there basically I share this fear, but there are almost no negative consequences as a result

1544
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:19,780
I understand biologically there's the instinct in us that like, oh no

1545
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:26,340
We've been ejected by the females in our little 30 man tribe word will get around and I will not be able to carry on my genetic legacy

1546
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:28,260
And my bloodline is doomed

1547
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:32,740
But luckily, not only is it not the case that that's true

1548
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:39,780
If if you are perceived to be more of an outgoing person who maybe even asks girls out somewhat that probably

1549
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:45,540
Will improve your reputation as opposed to make it worse because then you're like an actual human being

1550
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:47,780
Who it's the sort of thing

1551
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:52,500
It's the sort of thing where like the the the other guys would say we'll try to put you down

1552
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:55,940
Like, oh my god, this guy asked a girl out. Haha. Let's pull any guy

1553
01:55:56,660 --> 01:56:00,340
And and like all all of the boys are like, hey, yeah, fuck you loser

1554
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:03,460
You yeah, how many girls have they asked out that day? You know, what are they doing?

1555
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:08,340
Yeah, but like it's not that it's like the the girls in the class are like listening to this and they're like, huh

1556
01:56:08,980 --> 01:56:11,620
You know that they might be bitchy, of course

1557
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:16,420
But there's there's some like, you know, the way boys bully is very different

1558
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:22,420
In their in their in their hearts, these guys are thinking like wait, should I be doing that? Yes, that's true

1559
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:26,020
Should I be doing that too? Wait, what does he know? What does he know?

1560
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:28,820
We have to we have to question as fast as possible

1561
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:31,860
We have to get the secrets that he got on the pcp and the procrastiners plaque

1562
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:36,420
Is I have to give five dollars a month for those precious bonus episodes for all that secret information

1563
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:41,380
Uh, I I would boil this down to they wish they were on they were on the voicemail

1564
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:43,380
I'll boil this down to them. They do. I'm sure

1565
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:49,780
Uh, uh, obviously I want to be respectful and not a creep and be reasonable and ben's point about like inviting people to do specific things

1566
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:53,460
Is is a winning proposition. That's that's like a good a good way to do it

1567
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:56,100
But I will say this in summary

1568
01:56:56,260 --> 01:57:00,020
People in general women men everyone everyone loves a man of action

1569
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:02,500
So like there's nothing wrong with taking a shot

1570
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:07,940
Just roll in the dice because you are first of all you're conditioning yourself to be more willing to do cool things

1571
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:11,700
And also people will just respect you for doing anything

1572
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,500
There you go

1573
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,620
So, uh,

1574
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:19,940
Fucking go for it, dude. Just just talk to people

1575
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:24,420
Meet people who you think would be fun to hang out with invite them to do something casually and then do it and that's it

1576
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,900
And just be a cool guy. There you go. There's your life advice

1577
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:32,580
Congratulations. All right now go live your life. Go live your life or end it up to you

1578

01:57:56,260 --> 01:57:58,020
masturbated

1587
01:57:58,020 --> 01:58:00,020
ASMR gets repeated

1588
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:02,260
I fear insomnia though

1589
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:06,580

We'll either have it out or be very close to having the Kickstarter ready. I would think and uh, we beseech you

1625
02:00:41,060 --> 02:00:42,580
We're trying just to set

1626
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:47,460
Financial goals at reasonable levels so that we are we're not like losing money for every pledge

1627
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:50,180
Which I think we definitely did on some of those old pledges

1628
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:53,700
Um, and so we can just make the make the thing feasible

1629
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:56,820
And we don't just lose money and lose time whenever doing it

1630
02:00:56,980 --> 02:01:01,700
I personally love if we could actually just get hype for lectures get high for rad content

1631
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:04,900
If we broke even as a result of that that's fine

1632
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:09,060
But I am in fact losing time I could spend working on my own content

1633
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:13,700
So I would love to make a little bit of money from radcon if possible

1634
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:17,540
Just to cover that week of expenses on my fucking rent and shit

1635
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:20,180
Radcon case and exposure

1636
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:22,980
Don't be a little bit. It's all it does

1637
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:24,740
It actually does

1638
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:31,540
You know, it's fair to say that the content that we're then able to post like the lectures does generate revenue for some time afterward

1639
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:34,500
So that that is a that is a net positive. They're not immediate

1640
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:40,820
I mean most importantly it justifies the existence of this podcast. You are so right. You are so right

1641
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:43,460
So let's let's keep that going for

1642
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:48,020
Another thousand year rike everybody. Let's hear it. Keep it going here on the episode
