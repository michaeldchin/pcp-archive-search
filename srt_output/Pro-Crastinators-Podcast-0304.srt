00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Welcome to the PCP for all your game and developer needs. Game and for you.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,720
There were bells, do do do do, but I never heard them ring. No, I never heard Elden Ring.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,520
Elden Ring.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,280
Hit the Takamizaki.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,240
Elden Ring, soon it will be Elden Ring.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,480
Oh, let's go then.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,240
Okay, let's go. All right. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,120
Welcome.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,520
The only podcast where we didn't play Elden Ring.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
We didn't play it.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,440
Sorry.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,680
No, we're not sorry.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,880
Call this episode cool.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,240
It's cool because it's unusual and mysterious and exotic to have not played Elden Ring.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,360
What if we called this episode Elden Ring and we just talk about Elden Ring as though we'd

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,640
played it just based on things that we picked up from the internet and pretend that we know what

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,440
we're talking about?

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,040
I mean, it would be so easy because Elden Ring is Dark Souls again, but there's a horse and jumping.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,480
It's Dark Souls. Is there jumping? I know it's Dark Souls. It's Breath of the Wild Dark.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,480
Can you climb stuff? Can you climb up walls?

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,880
No, no, no. The jumping is like Sekiro jumping. You just sort of go up and down.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,480
I didn't play Sekiro.

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,480
I didn't play it either, but I saw it.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,960
But like, I was like, a lot of games come out and it's like, oh, no, no, no, no.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,480
Don't spoil. But like, what the hell could I be spoiled for with Elden Ring?

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,240
There's Dour Knights and Sad Castleman, and they're like, this is so bad.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,120
And then you kill them, or you don't, and you get experience points. There's nothing to spoil.

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,560
I know exactly what it would be like. It's just a lot of it, you know?

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,600
I know that if you hug the lady, you get an HP debuff, but you should do it anyway

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,680
because it's the right thing to do or something.

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
Why'd you get a HP debuff? Is she poisonous?

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,000
I think she might. I mean, you know, having expert on the game that I am, I believe she's

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,320
like a demon or something. She's some kind of, she's evil, but like, you should do it anyway

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,680
because it's like a moment of like human connection in a video game, and you, the player,

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,520
are a virgin and you want that. I'm going to roll a Sigma as my class.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:53,840
It really, it really makes you think about Ludo narrative dissonance.

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,160
Yeah, yeah. You have a play, hey, you have a play Ludo.

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,600
Is that a card game?

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,680
It's, I think it's a game with a popping, like a little dome with a popping like dice in it.

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Like trouble?

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,600
And you click the thing and it's like, you got your color pieces.

42
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,000
No, I don't know what that is.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,080
I think, I think, wait, I think they might call Ludo trouble in America.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,520
You have little colored green, yellow, whatever. You've got to get them all the way around the

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,480
board and the back into your thing. And if somebody lands on your space, you get sent back.

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,680
You have to roll a six to get them out of your starting position.

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,360
It is, trouble is derivative of the Indian board game Ludo.

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,800
Okay.

49
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,120
But is Ludo derivative of that or is it?

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
This is now the Ludo show.

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,280
Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four players.

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,640
The players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the roles of a single die.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,600
Okay, it's very clearly the same game.

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nelly.

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,760
Oh, you're seeing what I'm seeing?

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm I, are you seeing this far right propaganda?

57
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,800
I haven't had a board like that. I had like a circular one. I guess they changed it.

58
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,760
We have to return to tradition.

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,800
God, cancel culture strikes again, cancel culture strikes again.

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
They took the swastika off my Ludo board.

61
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,480
Wait, where's my Ludo?

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,080
Where's my Ludo?

63
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,440
Give me back my Monji.

64
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,520
I want my Monji, bro.

65
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,640
They're all, they're all this like, they're all the symbol, the funny symbol.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Ludo UK, let's see if there's a different one.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
No, no, they're all the same.

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,160
Oh, whatever.

69
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,720
I could swear there was like a circular one that we went in a spiral instead of like,

70
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,120
like right angles.

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
Well, never mind.

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,600
Yeah, we can no longer play this game because it is all right.

73
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,880
And therefore we will be corrupted and instantly become racist by playing it.

74
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,600
I agree.

75
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
That I couldn't have said it better myself.

76
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,560
Trouble is just that, but they put the die in a little bubble that you got to pop

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,160
and it flops around.

78
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,400
And I think there's fewer, fewer spaces.

79
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,520
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,160
Man, the whole, man, the whole gimmick of trouble is, is literally just

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,360
that the die is in a little bubble that you push.

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,240
Okay, I guess I had trouble, but they called it Ludo in the UK.

83
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
Whatever, fucking, fucking names of things.

84
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Do you, they call it soccer over here.

85
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,200
They call them, they call them biscuits, you know.

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,240
They kick the biscuit bowl in the soccer field.

87
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Do you ever watch, do you ever watch a movie called, oh fuck, was that movie called?

88
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,640
Like pick any movie that I know the name of?

89
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,720
No, there's a, but was one in particular.

90
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
It's, fuck, it's based on a comic.

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
I didn't know it was based on a comic.

92
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,480
Spider-Man.

93
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,840
No, it's about, it's about an author.

94
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,640
It's about a, it's about like a, it's about like the main character is like a struggling author.

95
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,200
Tin tin.

96
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,280
And, and like the bad guy in the movies is like famous author dude and they're, they're in England.

97
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,240
And there's like a romantic triangle and a spoiler.

98
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,960
Like the movie ends when the evil, rich, famous author gets like, I think he gets like crushed

99
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
to death by like a stampede of horses.

100
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,640
Fuck, it's called like, um.

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,000
Idea of what this is.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,520
It's not Notting Hill.

103
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,800
It's not Bag End.

104
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,640
It's uh, it's the furry movie.

105
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:24,480
Fuck, movie based on a comic about authors in England.

106
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,440
I bet this will find it.

107
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
No, not V for Vendetta.

108
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
No, not Sin City.

109
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
Jesus fucking Christ.

110
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,240
Um, the, the, the real life exploits of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his real life nemesis,

111
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,240
Moriarty, who's real.

112
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:54,000
I saw this movie, uh, someone just put it on one time and uh, I watched it and I was like,

113
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,200
that's pretty good, I guess.

114
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,680
Do you remember any of the actors from it?

115
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,160
No, because they were British actors and none of them were like big stars.

116
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,160
Um, I was just surprised because I learned like years later, I saw the comic book version.

117
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
It's, it wasn't like a comic book comic.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,720
It was like an indie like graphic novel and it's just not the, not the kind of thing that gets,

119
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,800
not the kind of thing that gets uh, it gets a movie, it gets a movie adaptation.

120
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,760
Yeah, I'm, I'm looking through these Google search because I really just want to say the name.

121
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,880
Uh, I'm going to lose my shit when I, when I find it.

122
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:46,000
I read this cool, um, graphic novel slash document, uh, like biography of this photographer who

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,080
went to like, um, I think it's just called the photographer and it's like half pictures of this

124
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,680
photographer's expedition to Afghanistan.

125
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
Oh, Over the Hedge was based on a comic book, that's weird.

126
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,920
Over that, uh, Dreamworks or I think it's Dreamworks.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,440
Um, and it's like, he, he's like a photographer for this expeditionary force of like,

128
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,000
um, medics who go into help people regardless of affiliation.

129
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,680
They just go into like a war-torn country.

130
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
I think it was Afghanistan or Syria or something.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
The fountain?

132
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,400
What the fuck?

133
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,160
And it's like, it's photographs that he took and then like illustrations of explaining the,

134
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,880
you know, like comic book, like sort of tinting looking.

135
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
Really good, really good, cool story.

136
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,000
Real life.

137
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,680
The photographer.

138
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,080
The photographer never heard of that.

139
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,800
Graphic novel.

140
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,120
I recommend that one.

141
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:58,240
I did, when I was, when I was on my kick of watching, uh, movies about people that just

142
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,720
talk, someone recommended Ghost World, which I did know was based on a comic book by,

143
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,280
not David Klaus, uh, fuck, who's, no, maybe it is by, by David Klaus.

144
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,880
Ghost, I don't know, it's pretty good.

145
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:27,200
Ghost World, film, uh, Scarlett Johansson, based on, yep, yeah, Daniel Klaus, not David Klaus.

146
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,400
Yes, the guy, same guy who, uh, who, uh, Cheesy gave me that comic book of, which I really liked,

147
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,800
uh, David, David Boring.

148
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,480
David Boring was the name of the book.

149
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,520
Daniel Klaus was the name of the, of the creator.

150
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:54,560
Um, I am going to perish searching for this, uh, it's, how many, how would you describe what it

151
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,040
looks like?

152
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:06,080
The comic, the comic book looks like a, it's very like, it sort of has like a very kind of

153
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:14,000
Euro comic drawing style, sort of like, like Matilda or like a road, road doll book illustration.

154
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
And it's, and it's not, it's not in panels.

155
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,080
The pages are text, but with, you know, sort of like illustrations, sort of in little

156
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,320
pockets, you know what I'm saying?

157
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,880
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,800
So it's, it's almost more of an illustrated novel, but it's, it's illustrated enough that

159
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:39,920
it's basically a graphic novel, not Persepolis, a ghost world, not The Invisibles by Grant

160
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
Morrison, not From Hell.

161
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm, okay, I'm, I'm looking for, like, I'm looking through art, love and rockets.

162
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,600
Okay, it's, it's this kind of thing.

163
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm in like a, a, a, a, I'm on an article, The Rolling Stone.

164
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,680
Oh my god.

165
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:07,040
Graphic novels made into movies set in England.

166
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,720
I just remembered because there's a line, because the British comics adapted into film,

167
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,880
because they're, they were the, like the shitty douchebag author.

168
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,840
The, the main character is an American guy who's living in England and he like mentions cookies

169
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,760
and the, the douchebag is like, we call them biscuits here.

170
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
This guy fucking sucks.

171
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,520
But wait, we have cook, oh, whatever.

172
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,760
Do you have, are they different?

173
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,040
We have cookies, which are the, we call it, like chocolate chip cookies are cookies, but

174
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,680
other types of cookie are, we call them biscuits.

175
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,760
Like the default, like nondescript biscuit is a biscuit.

176
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,880
But when it's got chocolate chips, there are cookies instead.

177
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm going to make some two ingredient cookies.

178
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,520
I'm not keto anymore.

179
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,720
I've given up on keto.

180
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,760
I'm just, I'm just low carb and I have, I'm not, I'm just low calorie and I avoid carbs.

181
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,280
I avoid unnecessary carbs.

182
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,720
Oh shit, no, no more keto.

183
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
Your, your character traits are, are dwindling.

184
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,400
Yeah, I know.

185
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,280
I have, without all my stupid little affectations, like what, what do I even have left?

186
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,240
Uh, you know, um.

187
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,120
A shell of a man.

188
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,400
Shell of a man.

189
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,920
It's true, sad, but true.

190
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Um, I'm going to make some two ingredient, I'm going to make some two ingredient cookies.

191
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,080
You know what those are?

192
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
I assume a thing you put two ingredients in.

193
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560
They're usually circular.

194
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,320
Do you know what, do you know, do you know what the two ingredients are in the two ingredient cookie?

195
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,880
A flour and egg, I don't know.

196
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,800
No, egg and oats.

197
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
No, no, sorry, I'm stupid.

198
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,360
Banana, you mashed up a banana.

199
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,240
Mashed banana and oats.

200
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,000
That sounds pretty good.

201
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
Uh, it's okay.

202
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,680
It's a bit, uh, it's not very like, it's a bit, uh, a bit chewy.

203
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,160
You know, it's not very like, it doesn't really taste like a cookie, but like whatever.

204
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,640
Um, and then you, I'm good, but I got, I bought mixins.

205
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,280
I'm going to be a little, I'm going to be a little naughty.

206
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,240
I'm going to be a little naughty.

207
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,280
I'm going to have mixins.

208
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
Uh, uh, I got, I got some chocolate.

209
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,120
I got some chocolate and I got some, uh, Reese's cups.

210
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm going to chop them up, put them in there, see if that, uh, see what happens.

211
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,240
We'll never know.

212
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,840
I've also, I've also been thinking about making some biscuits.

213
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,880
I kind of want to bake some like really thin, like extremely snap snappy biscuits,

214
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,560
but I don't know of what flavor.

215
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
I just want to be able to snap a biscuit.

216
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,280
Cause usually when I bake biscuits, they're too thick.

217
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,400
Are they ginger snaps?

218
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,320
Ginger snaps would be good.

219
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,560
Yeah.

220
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
I love ginger, I love ginger snaps.

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,360
Ginger snaps with like a very thin layer of dark chocolate on one side.

222
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,000
Now that would be epic.

223
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,960
You know what's not epic is that I can't find the name of this goddamn.

224
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
This is going to be like the whole, the whole podcast.

225
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
You're going to be Googling.

226
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:17,920
Wait.

227
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,240
Okay.

228
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:27,280
Movie where a snooty British author is killed by horses.

229
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,480
Oh, we have a trope for that.

230
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,280
And TV tropes.

231
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,920
Charge of the light brigade?

232
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,160
No.

233
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
Why don't you search for that clip?

234
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,360
Like we call them biscuits over here.

235
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,880
Hmm.

236
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,800
We call them biscuits here.

237
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,680
It's called something like, like Notting Hill or like Buckingham Palace or uh,

238
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,120
Oh yeah.

239
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,840
In Australia, they got Anzac Bickeys.

240
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,880
Those sick fucks.

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,120
Anzac Bickeys.

242
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,200
Anzac, Anzac Bickeys.

243
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,320
What?

244
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,000
It's just, it's like, it's like, it's a particular type of cookie.

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,560
I don't even know what kind it is exactly, but like,

246
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,760
it's named after like, it's named after some,

247
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,840
it's like a military battalion or something.

248
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,400
It's named, it's like named after some shit that happened in some war or another.

249
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,160
I don't know.

250
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,320
I, I, oh, I typed in, we call them biscuits and I got C biscuit, but that would not be

251
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,720
the right clip movie.

252
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,480
I can't do it.

253
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,880
I can't.

254
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
This is all I got this week.

255
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,480
This is all I have to talk about this week.

256
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,760
Well, you know what?

257
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,600
While you're thinking about that, I will reiterate.

258
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,560
People play the punk and alley video game.

259
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,640
If you didn't catch it as the last episode, I am making a video game now,

260
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,360
which apparently means I'm copying Ben St. yet again.

261
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,080
Oh yeah.

262
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,880
One comment.

263
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,000
It's like, uh, just doesn't whatever Ben does.

264
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,760
The mouth.

265
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,120
True.

266
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,400
I mean, like making comics.

267
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,160
I think was kind of inspired by you, but I wanted to make a video game since I was like 10.

268
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,920
I mean, Tom was making, I said this in the chat.

269
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,960
Tom was making video games before either of us were.

270
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,880
So I guess I'm just copying Tom.

271
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,240
Yeah.

272
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,680
So I don't know what that guy was thinking about, but very funny.

273
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,880
Yeah.

274
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,720
Fucking it's where there's going to be a, I got it.

275
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,360
I found it.

276
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,320
I found it.

277
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,960
I was wrong.

278
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,360
It's, it's not named a place name.

279
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,960
It's named Tamara Drew.

280
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,040
Tamara Drew is the name of this fucking.

281
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,440
Oh my God.

282
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,320
Like Nancy Drew.

283
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,960
It's not spelled the same way.

284
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,640
Oh my God.

285
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,480
Tamara Drew.

286
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Well, let me find a picture of the comic.

287
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,880
And you'll hear a comedy by Stephen Frears.

288
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,680
Here we go.

289
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,800
You know, you didn't, you didn't specify, but the fact that you talked about authors in England,

290
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,880
I assumed it was Victorian England and not like contemporary.

291
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,800
I mean, maybe in like the seventies, but yeah, it's more, more or less contemporary.

292
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,280
We call them, we call them biscuits here.

293
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,240
You son of a bitch.

294
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
And then you fucking yank.

295
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
We call them biscuits.

296
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,360
Oh, you call them biscuits, do you?

297
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
I'll kill you.

298
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,680
I'll show you.

299
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,760
I'll let my, I'll let these damn horses out of their corrals and stampede you to death.

300
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah, it's like, it's been a while since you've seen the movie.

301
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,840
Is that a young George R.R. Martin in that image?

302
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,680
It looks like it, doesn't it?

303
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:53,680
But he, I think the, I think the plot of the movie is like the guy is a dick.

304
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,880
The guy's a dick and he sucks.

305
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,200
And then in the end, he's like, he's gonna like, yeah, heck, heck, yeah, I'm gonna do it.

306
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
Yeah, I'm gonna cheat on my wife.

307
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,560
Yeah, I'm gonna run away with this, with this interloping younger woman, this Tamara Drew lady

308
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:17,440
who's got us all, who's got us all, who's thrown our social circles into disarray with her raw

309
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,320
sexual energy.

310
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm gonna fucking elope with Tamara Drew.

311
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,760
And then in all that kerfuffle, like some, something happens and a bunch of horses escape

312
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,400
from around the stampede, this guy just killed, he just dies in an accident.

313
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,400
And everyone's like, well, that's funny that that happened because that guy sucked actually.

314
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,080
He didn't like die because he's an asshole, except like, sort of in a very indirect way.

315
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,680
It just so happened that he died in an accident and we're all just like,

316
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,080
shame, but like, fuck that guy.

317
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,640
You know what?

318
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,400
The fact that I remember this movie like a decade later should tell you that it was great.

319
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,320
I never read the comic.

320
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,920
I never read the comic though, yeah.

321
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,440
Comic looks pretty good.

322
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,280
It's got a some, what, what do you call it, quality?

323
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,080
Like it's realistic, but like, not too, they're not worrying too hard about everything.

324
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,760
It's put it together well, but like, you know, literally trying to be realistic is nice.

325
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,800
Now this is a movie that's just about people talking to each other about stuff.

326
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,000
Now, here's a, now here's a film like that, if ever there was one.

327
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,520
Did I ever talk about, did I ever talk about Locke,

328
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,360
ever talk about the movie Locke on here?

329
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,600
With an E.

330
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
Yeah, with an E.

331
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,120
I don't think you have.

332
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,160
It's the one where the entire movie takes place in the guy's car while he's on a drive on the highway.

333
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,160
I don't know that.

334
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,160
Oh, that movie rules.

335
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay, well, if I didn't tell you about it before,

336
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
yeah, it's what I just said.

337
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:10,720
The whole movie is just set like, in this guy's car and he's just taking calls and making calls

338
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
and he's on his way.

339
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,120
I don't think it's a spoiler to say that he's on his way to see his son be born.

340
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:27,040
He's about to have a son born and like, he's getting calls from his wife,

341
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
who is not the mother of the child.

342
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,960
So he's got to like break the news to her and he's got to like talk to his kids because he was like,

343
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,880
because he was like supposed to be like watching the big game with them.

344
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,480
And he's got to like call this woman who he had like a one night stand with and he's got to like

345
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,520
talk to her on the phone and be like, yeah, I'm on my way.

346
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,240
Want to see that son be born and whatever.

347
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,360
He's got to talk to like the doctors.

348
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,720
And then also at the same time, there's like, he's like a construction contractor

349
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,280
and he's got like a build like, like this building is about to be started.

350
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,600
The construction is about to be started.

351
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,200
They're about to do a pour.

352
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,640
They're going to do a big pour, which means they're going to lay down like the concrete

353
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,840
foundation for this building.

354
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,760
It's going to be like the highlight of his career.

355
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,200
But he gets like fired over the whole thing.

356
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,520
He gets fired, but the poor is still on.

357
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,200
So he's got to like be talking on the phone to his like assistant guy who's like drunk.

358
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,880
He like got drunk and he's like, oh God, like it's all, it's all going to go,

359
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,760
it's all going to go pear shaped unless you can, unless you can reach like some guys I know and

360
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,480
they can like, and they can sort like the details out before it happens or else it's all canceled

361
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,560
and my life's work goes up in smoke.

362
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,400
So he's, he's just in his car, just making all these phone calls about all this shit that's

363
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,800
happening.

364
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
Is he like stuck in traffic?

365
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,680
No, he's just driving.

366
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,080
He's, he's just driving, but it's all, it's all very like time sensitive.

367
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,800
It's all like, this has to get sorted out tonight because like the poor is happening

368
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,080
in the morning and like, you know, it's very tense.

369
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,920
The stakes, the stakes are well established.

370
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
It do be like that.

371
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:23,920
And that is, I don't, feels, feels like, I mean, I'm sure it's a fun movie, but I can't

372
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,440
help but feel like, like I would remind me of all this shit that's going on in my life,

373
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,600
even though it's not nearly as like intense as that.

374
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,640
And I'd be like, Oh no, more than two things are happening.

375
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,360
Oh geez.

376
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,720
Oh God.

377
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,320
Can't deal.

378
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,760
Well, yeah.

379
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,280
I mean, I guess so.

380
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,840
But like, it's fun when it's someone else.

381
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
That's, I kind of want to watch that.

382
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
It sounds like a fun.

383
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,560
I really like it a lot.

384
00:23:52,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Like a, I guess sort of a challenge to make it engaging visually, even though it's,

385
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,120
yeah, it's just a car, guy in a car.

386
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,640
Well, have you ever, have you ever seen, have you ever seen my dinner with Andre?

387
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,600
Nope.

388
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,280
That's another one.

389
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,800
It's just two guys sitting at a table talking about stuff.

390
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,560
And it's just the stuff they're talking about is interesting enough.

391
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,160
Is that feature length?

392
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,680
Yeah.

393
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

394
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:20,960
Dang.

395
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,600
Uh, they have stars.

396
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,080
Scenes set in like, like a tool, like shown any other place or is it just that one set?

397
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Well, while the beginning is like, it's the guy who plays the Sicilian in The Princess Bride.

398
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,680
You know who I'm talking about?

399
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,400
Nope.

400
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,520
I've never seen a film.

401
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,240
You've never seen The Princess Bride?

402
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,680
No.

403
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,120
Damn.

404
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,440
Okay.

405
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,240
Well, he was also the teacher in Clueless.

406
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,320
Never seen that.

407
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,160
Oh God.

408
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,400
He was also, um, oh, he's in a bun.

409
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,280
He's in a lot of movies.

410
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,400
You'd probably recognize him.

411
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,360
Okay, whatever.

412
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
Anyway, I forget his name, though.

413
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,680
But it's that guy, like the beginning is him like walking to the restaurant to meet Andre,

414
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,760
to have the titular dinner with Andre.

415
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,600
And then the movie is just them at the table talking about stuff and Andre telling all this

416
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,560
weird shit that he did for the past like 10 years.

417
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,560
Oh, it's this guy.

418
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:32,800
Is he in the guy in that film with the guy who says, you don't know what you think it means,

419
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,920
the word, you killed my father, you know?

420
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,840
Yeah, that's Princess Bride, you fuck.

421
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,600
Oh, I haven't seen it.

422
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,200
I just know that clip.

423
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,640
That's the guy, you know, one of the two rules of engagement.

424
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,280
Never get involved in a land war in Asia and never go up against a Sicilian when death is on the line.

425
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,480
He-man.

426
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,240
Yeah, that's, uh, that's him.

427
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
William Sean on Andre Gregory.

428
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,560
Classic line.

429
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,720
Is Andrew Gregory that guy?

430
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,040
I remember he's in...

431
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,840
That's the other guy.

432
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,720
It's, um, I...

433
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,040
Sean?

434
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,920
Something Sean?

435
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,720
Wallace Sean.

436
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,920
Wallace Sean.

437
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,960
That sounds familiar.

438
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,680
He's in some movie, and I forget what movie it is, but I remember he plays a, uh, like a casino,

439
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,920
like Blackjack dealer or something.

440
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,680
And it might be like one of, it might be like one of the vacation movies,

441
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,920
like Chevy Chase in Vacation maybe.

442
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,760
And he says like, like, the main character loses all his money.

443
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,080
He's got like one chip left, and he asks, and he asks Wallace Sean, the black, the dealer,

444
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,200
like, how much, how, what can I do with one chip?

445
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,920
I've got one chip left, and he says, oh, I don't know.

446
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,640
Buy a bullet and rent a gun.

447
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,800
Oh, whoa.

448
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,640
I, I went to his, I love that line.

449
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,920
I went to his IMDb, known for the Princess Bride, my dinner with Andre.

450
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,280
The Incredibles.

451
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,120
He was the voice of, of, uh...

452
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,160
Syndrome?

453
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,000
No, Robert Parr's boss, like, I'm not happy, Bob.

454
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,960
Oh, the little, the little shorty.

455
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,600
Not happy.

456
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,640
Yeah, like that guy.

457
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,600
Oh, wow, okay.

458
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,400
And also, he did the voice of Rex in Toy Story.

459
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,720
Yes, I knew that.

460
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,360
I knew that.

461
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,400
Yep, that's him.

462
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,800
And also Young Sheldon, something, something, I'm scrolling through.

463
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,280
Is he, is he, is he in Young Sheldon?

464
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,160
Or is he the narration?

465
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,600
He's done so much.

466
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,880
Two hundred starting credits.

467
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,720
Yeah, he's in a lot of stuff.

468
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,160
Wait, what does he do in Young Sheldon?

469
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,480
Dr. John Sturgis?

470
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,360
Oh, he's just, oh, he's just some guy.

471
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,240
Oh, he's old now.

472
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,960
Oh, shit.

473
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,640
I hate when actors get old.

474
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,360
Yeah, it's funny.

475
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,240
You, you Google it and think, oh, I've seen it in that movie.

476
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,240
And then it like, close to death, like skeleton face, like, oh no.

477
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,360
Time passes.

478
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,680
Yeah.

479
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,120
Yeah.

480
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,480
I mean, he's, I was, I mean, he's, he's kind of always looked old.

481
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
But now he looks really old.

482
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,440
He's not like, he's not like, like, who's the guy who plays, what's the name

483
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,600
of the Star Trek Enterprise?

484
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,680
Um, Picard?

485
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,560
Picard.

486
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,520
Fuck, what's that actress name?

487
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,080
Oh, uh, the Patrick Stewart.

488
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,800
I knew it.

489
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,920
Yeah, Patrick Stewart is, it was the example, everyone.

490
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:31,040
Patrick Stewart and, uh, uh, the guy who was, uh, uh, James Bond and Indiana Jones'

491
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,400
dad, uh, Patrick Stewart.

492
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,720
No.

493
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:34,960
No.

494
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,480
Fuck, I know this.

495
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,560
He looks like Alec Guinness, but he's got a Sean Connery.

496
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,280
Sean Connery.

497
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,440
Yes.

498
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,040
Those are the two everyone says, uh, they just like, they've always looked old and

499
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,320
they've just continued to look old in the same way until now.

500
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,120
Although now Patrick Stewart is getting all squinty.

501
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,360
And now that he's like fucking 90, uh, damn.

502
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,040
I hate it when people get old and die.

503
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,400
Lemau.

504
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,960
That sucks.

505
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
Well, it's better than getting young and dying.

506
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,120
That's true.

507
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920
That's true.

508
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
Wallace Sean is looking, uh, no, he's.

509
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,080
He's looking all right.

510
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,520
It was just sort of like, uh, I didn't know what he, I didn't know what he looked like.

511
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,400
And then it's like the most recent photo when you type in his name.

512
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,880
It's like, oh, yeah.

513
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,840
I mean, he's, he's visibly, he's, he's visibly much older.

514
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,880
So he's not, he didn't stop aging like those two did.

515
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,440
Fucking.

516
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,160
But that's okay.

517
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,160
Uh, marriage story.

518
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Wait, marriage story was a good film, wasn't it?

519
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,880
I didn't, I didn't see that one.

520
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,080
This is the, the, when, when Kylo Ren gets married to, to Black Widow.

521
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,640
Oh, just like in, just like in Ghost World, it's got, right?

522
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,560
Scarlett Johansson is the lady, right?

523
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,640
I think so.

524
00:29:51,440 --> 00:30:00,080
I saw Scarlett Johansson is the girl in, uh, she's the friend, the blonde friend, I think in, uh,

525
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,600
in Ghost World, it's, yeah, Scarlett Johansson is the blonde friend, and the main character is,

526
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,960
I forget her name, but she was also the girl in, uh, American Beauty.

527
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:19,040
Um, and then also, also, um, I don't know, that one's got, uh, the guy, that one's got the hello,

528
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
how do you do a fellow kids guy in it?

529
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,280
Oh, um, I don't know, that one's got the guy, that one's got the hello, how do you do a fellow

530
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,600
Oh, um, I, uh, Steve Buscemi.

531
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,360
Steve Buscemi, yes, there we go.

532
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,280
This is fun trying to remember who the fuck these people are.

533
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,400
I'm, wait, I was gonna, there'll be a video game about this, our, our normal game.

534
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,840
What's, what do you call it when it's like a video game, but it's not on a television?

535
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,000
Uh, oh, shit, what's the word?

536
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,960
Uh, that is pastime, uh, uh, the, the Ludo something?

537
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,680
Oh Ludo, that's how we got on all of this.

538
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,560
Um, I was gonna make another connection to something else that was in something else that

539
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,840
some, someone was in and degrees of Kevin Bacon.

540
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,120
Uh, was I going somewhere?

541
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,680
I just want to do, I just want to remember the name Tamara Drew.

542
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,240
Yeah, I think it was because of the guy we were talking about Britishisms.

543
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,560
We call them biscuits over here.

544
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,960
I'm going to see, I feel like maybe the guy who played the douchebag.

545
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,400
No, he's not that famous.

546
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,880
He's, he's an actor named Roger Allam.

547
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,120
So no, not, not someone I've heard of.

548
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,520
Yeah, I don't, they didn't get, you know, this was not a high budget movie.

549
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,080
They didn't have a, they didn't, they didn't have A-listers, but that's okay.

550
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,800
I like it when a movie doesn't have A-listers.

551
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,360
If I see an A-lister, I'm like.

552
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,040
Gay-lister.

553
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,160
Takes me up, more like, yeah, more like gay-lister.

554
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,480
It takes me out of the movie.

555
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,160
Uh, it's pretty rare.

556
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,920
It's pretty rare for, for there to be an A-lister and for me to, you know.

557
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,960
I think it's.

558
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,280
Not just, not just see him as the actor, you know.

559
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,840
Sure.

560
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,560
I mean, that's for some actors.

561
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:13,920
Yeah.

562
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:20,320
Like when you've seen Orlando Bloom before, every time you see Orlando Bloom again,

563
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,080
you're like, oh, it's Legolas.

564
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh, it's that guy.

565
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,480
I feel like.

566
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,880
Or it's like Bill Will Turner or whatever.

567
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,280
Like the, or like Leonardo DiCaprio.

568
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,080
Oh, it's Leo.

569
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,640
You don't see the, you don't see the character he's playing.

570
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,640
But some, some actors that are prolific and like A-list, like Gary Oldman always feels

571
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
like whatever character he is.

572
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,240
Yeah.

573
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:43,920
Yeah.

574
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,720
Uh, I mean, Gary Oldman, I get, now I guess he's an A-lister.

575
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,240
Yeah.

576
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,280
Uh, I mean, I guess if you're a good actor, I don't know what I think.

577
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,760
Yeah.

578
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,080
But I think more, yeah, true.

579
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,320
But I think more, you can, you can do it.

580
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,960
You can do it.

581
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,480
But I think more movies, I wish that more movies and higher budget movies just hired

582
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,720
actors that nobody had ever fucking seen before.

583
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,920
I think that would be cool.

584
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,480
Yes.

585
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,200
Although I don't watch movies, so I don't really have a stake in this at all.

586
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,280
I guess that's, I guess I don't watch a lot of movies.

587
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,000
Well, I was watching movies for a little bit there.

588
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,800
Maybe, maybe one of these days I'll watch a bunch more movies.

589
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,880
No, you know what I think I want to do is a, I made a little note on my to-do list.

590
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,720
I kind of want to go to the library.

591
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,000
I kind of want to go to the library and get some books, some actual physical books for

592
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,080
pages.

593
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,360
You've talked about this already.

594
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:39,920
Have you?

595
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,880
Have I talked about this?

596
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,920
Have you still not gone?

597
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,440
Well, no, I'm doing, I'm doing.

598
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,400
You got to study up for the biggest exam.

599
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,040
I'm, I'm in doing a slime and punishment.

600
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,680
Oh, of course.

601
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:04,880
Speaking, speaking of which, I, I'm like, I'm basically, I'm on like the last one page of

602
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,880
the, I said this before, I'm, there's the game, I had to do the page leading up to the game.

603
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,840
Those are done.

604
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,720
Then there's the game.

605
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,080
Then there's the post game scene, which is basically the end.

606
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,800
And that is basically done.

607
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,320
It's, it's not quite done, but it's, it's all, it's like so close to being done.

608
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,000
And then I have an ending, which I don't know what it's going to be, but I think I'm starting,

609
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,880
I've had some ideas.

610
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,160
I have some ideas for that.

611
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,200
And I don't want that to take a long time.

612
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,680
I think I'm dragging my feet.

613
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,200
I think I'm suffering from a psychological malady that I have suffered from in the past,

614
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,320
where when something gets really close to being done,

615
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,640
I, I like resist doing it.

616
00:34:53,360 --> 00:35:00,320
You resist like the actual finishing of it, or like you're, you're, you're adding things

617
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,880
or you're changing things and tweaking shit.

618
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,800
No, that's, that's different.

619
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,360
I mean, like I just don't want to, I just don't want to do it.

620
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:15,920
I don't want to do it because finishing something you've been working on for a long time is,

621
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,320
uh, well, uh, uh, releasing it is like change.

622
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
It's like a change, it's like a change of state in your life.

623
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,680
And that's scary.

624
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,720
Yeah.

625
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,280
You transition from I'm working on this thing to, oh, that thing's done.

626
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,920
That thing's over.

627
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,040
Yeah.

628
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,600
You kind of need to, I think it's like, you've got into a rhythm with a project that you work

629
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,760
on for a long time and then you don't want to disrupt your daily, um, you know,

630
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,680
your workflow, the things you do every day.

631
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,440
Um, so sort of unconsciously, you just want to keep it the same.

632
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,560
And so having it to do was part of your, your, what you were thinking about.

633
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,920
And then, and all, but it's weird because like there's things I want to do.

634
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,680
I feel the same way sometimes, but like there's like things I want to do.

635
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,720
And I'm like, okay, well, I got to do this thing first before I can do that thing.

636
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,560
And I just don't make the jump.

637
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,640
It's, yeah.

638
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,000
Uh, I mean, yeah, obviously, obviously finishing it is, um, it's good.

639
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The most, the most reasonable thing to do.

640
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,640
It's a bit, it's a bit of like resistance because like, oh, scared of, scared of change,

641
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,040
right?

642
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,680
Obviously.

643
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,360
And then also like nervous, like, oh, what if it's a flop?

644
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
What if everyone hates it?

645
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,600
What if like it sucks?

646
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,240
What if, uh, you know, the reception is not good?

647
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,640
Uh, maybe I just shouldn't release it.

648
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,840
Uh, maybe I just shouldn't finish it.

649
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,960
Uh, never mind.

650
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,480
That and also the effect of, um, you know, uh, the like, oh, if you, if you talk about a thing,

651
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,880
it feels like you already did it.

652
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,120
Yeah.

653
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,800
I have a bit of that because like the game is, the game's done and it's been done.

654
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,000
And I've, you know, I've, I've given it to my patrons.

655
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,200
My patrons have played it.

656
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,120
So a bit, I have a bit of the like, oh, I kind of already finished it.

657
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,640
I kind of already showed it to people.

658
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:21,600
Uh, you know, I know it's, uh, I know it's not, uh, true exactly, but it kind of feels that way.

659
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,280
So I don't know.

660
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,160
For a bunch of reasons this week, uh, I think I've dragged my feet a little.

661
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,240
I haven't really been dragging my feet.

662
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,200
Like I got like, uh, I got like 13 more, uh, like pages done, which is not nothing,

663
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,240
but I feel like I could have finished it this week, uh, but I didn't.

664
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,360
So yeah, I mean, I, I feel like that sometimes a lot of the time.

665
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,840
I mean, yeah, I, I finally, I haven't like made an announcement of this,

666
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,000
but I finally finished those ghost costumes.

667
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,200
They're all done.

668
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,640
They're all, they're all done.

669
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
I saw you, uh, yeah, all 34 of them.

670
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,520
And, uh, next step is to look through the Kickstarter things and get all the addresses

671
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,000
and ship off a bunch of other packages.

672
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,840
And I'm like, but for a while there, getting the ghost costume stone was like,

673
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,800
okay, I've got to do this.

674
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,320
And I did like, I was doing them consistently.

675
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,120
And then one day I was just like, uh, I, uh, I did three instead of 10, which I did the day before.

676
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,800
Hmm.

677
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,520
Sometimes you just don't do anything.

678
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,760
I mean, heck, if you did three a day, that would take what 12 days to get them all done.

679
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,720
Yeah.

680
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,520
Whatever, whatever.

681
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,920
It took me more like a week, which is pretty good, but it's like, I, I, I,

682
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:51,040
since I did 10 in one day, I really felt it when I couldn't do 10 in another day.

683
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,320
And I'm like, what the fuck's wrong with me that I should have done this

684
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,280
in November?

685
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,680
I should have done this while I was waiting for other things.

686
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,600
But like, there are, my, my mind was like consumed by the, the pumpkin alley game demo.

687
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,800
So like, I have excuses, but it still feels like lots of things could have been done earlier.

688
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,600
If only I was working better.

689
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,520
There are, there are days, I've said this before, there are days, uh, working on slime and punishment

690
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,840
where I get like eight, eight pages done in one day.

691
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,080
And there are some, and there are some pages that take me eight days to get done.

692
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,920
The ones that I just, the latest ones that I posted on Twitter as of this recording,

693
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,760
the ones with, uh, Phantom, uh, Meeting Keg at the, at the Clover Cafe in Ponyville.

694
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,640
Uh, those ones took me forever.

695
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,440
Not because, not because they're like super complicated or anything.

696
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,320
It's not that.

697
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,840
It's like, you know, did I stop me if I said this before, but it's, it's not that, uh,

698
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,280
it's not that they were complicated.

699
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,760
The reason they took me a long time is just because I had a very specific vision for them.

700
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,640
And I just had to be, I was just very fussy about they have to be positioned like this.

701
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,760
He has to look like this.

702
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,680
And just because I had to get it right and I had a very specific idea, it took me a long time

703
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,840
versus other pages where I just kind of have a general idea of the gist of what it's meant to

704
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,480
get across.

705
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,040
And I can just kind of draw whatever.

706
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,920
And if it's like close enough, I'm like, okay, that's good enough.

707
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,480
That's fine.

708
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,920
I don't have to like redraw and redraw or anything.

709
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,840
Whereas like with those, I had to like redraw.

710
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,680
I like, I kept having to redraw Keg's like position and like this is his gesture in his

711
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,440
face and just like get it just because I want to communicate a very,

712
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,400
I don't want to communicate, you know, if the face is off, then like the whole scene is weird.

713
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,040
I mean, I mean, the whole scene is weird, but it's supposed to be weird in a specific way.

714
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,040
Yeah, that's, uh, that's it.

715
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,240
Anyway, I tweeted this week, I tweeted this week that, um,

716
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,600
or was it last week?

717
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,040
No, it was, it was, it was this week.

718
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,000
I tweeted, if you, if people end up not liking the ending of slime and punishment,

719
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,600
remember, I, it's that, it's my, my heart told me to write, I followed my heart.

720
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,200
It's, I didn't do it.

721
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,040
It's not my fault.

722
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,240
If the ending, if you hate the ending, uh, it's my heart's fault.

723
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,400
I didn't have a choice.

724
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,440
My, I've been drawing the ending and it's, I, I've talked about this before.

725
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,720
It's deeply uncomfortable.

726
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,600
The final scene makes me, makes me uncomfortable, uh, to look at it and think about it, but it's okay.

727
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,640
It's good because it's my vision and I can't, and it doesn't matter if I don't like it.

728
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,920
It's not about what I want.

729
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,080
I, I, I genuinely feel, I was thinking about this.

730
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:06,800
I feel like writing slime and punishment was not, I was not like thinking of ideas.

731
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,400
I didn't like have ideas.

732
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,760
Well, that's not true.

733
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Occasionally I would have an idea, but it was more like I just had to discover it.

734
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,920
I would suddenly realize, oh, of course, that's how it must be.

735
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,520
Yes, yes, I see.

736
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,440
Yes, of course, it was always this way.

737
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
Uh, now I just, I had just forgotten,

738
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,240
but now I remember that this is how it has to go.

739
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,480
That's how it feels sometimes.

740
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,040
Um, yeah.

741
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,440
I hope the twist is that ultimate pumpkin comes back and kills phantom horn randomly.

742
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,320
Ultimate, ultimate, you know, I was thinking about ultimate pumpkin.

743
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,600
I, I will spoil that, uh, ultimate pumpkin does not, does not make an appear, I'm sorry.

744
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,280
That's, I wish he did because I was thinking about ultimate pumpkin because when phantom is

745
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,560
walking through, uh, Ponyville, I remembered, you know, lol, all those other, all those joke

746
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,680
characters we made up on T-Bap, like horse fister and ultimate pumpkin and silver spoon,

747
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,880
or not silver spoon, uh, silver lining, silver lining.

748
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,360
Yeah.

749
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:16,640
Uh, I fondly remembered those guys, but, uh, I was like, well, I mean, there's really no,

750
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,800
there's really no need for them anywhere in this story.

751
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,160
Not even in the background.

752
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,080
Didn't they have like visuals?

753
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,200
You know what they look like?

754
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,280
I feel, I feel like, um, yeah, they could have been in the background.

755
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,680
Yeah, they could have been, but they weren't.

756
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:47,440
The, I do, I actually think that like phantom has gone on a journey and he has basically become

757
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:56,880
a super powered like monster and, uh, I kind of think that now him and him and ultimate pumpkin

758
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,840
might have, they would have, they would have, uh, maybe, maybe they would, I'm not sure if

759
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:07,360
they would have fine common ground to discuss or if they would come to, to blows and battle each other.

760
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,760
I'm not sure something would happen.

761
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,520
Ultimate pumpkin clearly is like a hero.

762
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:14,880
Yes.

763
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,960
So he would stop you if you went too far.

764
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,320
Oh, I mean, phantom.

765
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,360
Yes, if phantom went too far, perhaps.

766
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah, uh, I don't, I mean, I don't think phantom would phantom did, you know,

767
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,080
cause a, a bit of a public disturbance and lights and buildings on fire, but he didn't do it on purpose.

768
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,080
You know, he's, his, his heart's in the right place.

769
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,880
Unlike mine, which tells me to draw the deeply uncomfortable scene that the comic ends with.

770
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,600
Okay, I, I haven't reread all the slime and punishment,

771
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:54,720
but so I'm just going to summarize the, the comic and you tell me if I got anything terribly wrong.

772
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:05,040
So phantom horn and strawberry milk are looking at, uh, Pony version of Chris Chan star night star

773
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,680
night star.

774
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,720
She throws them through a portal to endless war and you know, lack of calm.

775
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,000
That's right.

776
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,040
They learn about slime.

777
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,680
They do all that.

778
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:14,960
Yes.

779
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,200
Then they love, they learn to love slime.

780
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,240
They learn to love slime.

781
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,120
They're in the slime.

782
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,600
They learn about capitalism and how when you got, when you got, and how when you got slime, it just works.

783
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,080
They go into the, the sewers and they learn about the, they learn about, they learn about death

784
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,360
and how actually with slime death is cool.

785
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,760
And so is communism, but also capitalism just works and the free market.

786
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,360
Is the most efficient way of distributing slime.

787
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,320
Okay.

788
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,080
So they learn all about that and they're in there.

789
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,480
And then I forget what happens.

790
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,440
Some sort of like multiple dimensional stuff happens.

791
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,760
Then it's, then there's a bubble and it goes flip and it goes, whoa.

792
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,440
And then, then I, I don't know what's going on.

793
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,080
I can't remember.

794
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:08,880
The mult, the multiple dimensional stuff is that, um, Chris Chan, Sonichu shows up.

795
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,680
They, they, they learn to love slime and they become productive gangsters, citizens.

796
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,680
And then Chris Chan, Sonichu shows up, uh, just because, because Chris said so.

797
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:30,320
And, and then she gets a slime sample and takes it to Nightstar and then off screen.

798
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,200
This is not seen.

799
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,960
It's, it's discovered later.

800
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,320
They develop the, the antidote for slime.

801
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,560
Bicarbonate rain.

802
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:38,800
Yes.

803
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,960
The bicarbonate sugar, soda water.

804
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,440
And then they bring the storm comes and then, uh, uh, that has multi-dimensional

805
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,680
consequences that destroys a lot of timelines or destroys the city in a lot of timelines.

806
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,680
And then, uh, they all have to reassemble back in the beta timeline.

807
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:06,240
And then S revert is moving the city from the beta timeline back to the alpha timeline

808
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,960
to resume operations as normal.

809
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,560
Uh, and then, and that's basically it.

810
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,520
That's, that was the end of the comic until recently.

811
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,880
And then the new, the new updates are.

812
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,080
And then Phantom's revenge is like, dang it, I'm going to kill you, uh, the Phantom Horn story.

813
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,840
Yes.

814
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,920
Everyone is, uh, uh, Nalakakam and Quickville are now at war, but it's hardly a war because

815
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,840
Quickville was no match.

816
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,520
And it's basically, we're just, we're just mopping up all the survivors at this point.

817
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:47,200
Uh, Chris Chan Sonichu was of course crushed underneath the city as it fell back into place

818
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,760
on the coast of the Grand Canyon and filled it with slime, obviously.

819
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,880
Uh, so they're leaderless.

820
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,760
They're like a head, a chicken without a head, just running around.

821
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,880
They're like, uh, they're like the, they're like the drone army in Star Wars.

822
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,600
When the head drone droid is, uh, is killed, they just, they can't, they don't have, uh,

823
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,320
they're fucked.

824
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,200
They're all fucked.

825
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,960
Um, uh, yes, but, but that's all kind of in the background.

826
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,280
Phantom has to go and settle his own score, uh, with, he's got to find

827
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,440
Nightstar and make her pay.

828
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:31,520
Make her pay for throwing them into Endless War or, or, or, or like killing the slime.

829
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,880
No, he, he was mad.

830
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,960
He was initially mad about her throwing him through the portal into Nlakakam.

831
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,480
And it was a pretty evil thing to do, but then he learned to love slime.

832
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,240
So he's not mad about that anymore.

833
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,600
No, he's mad that she was, he's, he's, uh, he's mad that she was complicit in the, uh,

834
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,720
in the slime, in the Soda Rain Holocaust.

835
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,120
Right.

836
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,320
Right.

837
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,080
She, she developed the antidote and she, and she must pay for her, for her war crimes.

838
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:03,760
I see.

839
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,800
And that's, and that, and that's the story.

840
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,600
That's the story.

841
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,840
It's, it's, you know, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a classic tale.

842
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:20,240
It's a hero's journey where he wants, what he initially wants is to go home to Ponyville.

843
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,040
But then in the end, he discovers that what he needs is just to learn to love slime.

844
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:26,640
Yes.

845
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,520
Uh, he's, he's, he's, he has a, he has a character arc.

846
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,920
He's in his Ponyville and he's just like, I don't have a horn and that's me.

847
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,640
That's Phantom Horn.

848
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,280
This sucks.

849
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,840
Makes me, I wish I was a unicorn, but you know, I am kind of, but it's not real.

850
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,200
That sucks.

851
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:50,160
And then at a chance encounter, he, he falls into a slime world and he just loves it.

852
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,160
And then it's taken away and so he has to fight to get it back.

853
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,600
Or the, yeah, I guess he fights, they all fight to get it back.

854
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:07,520
Uh, yeah, he, um, uh, well, he, I mean, he doesn't really, I mean,

855
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:14,000
it's like all those other characters, like, uh, the Jane Crocker with a gun and, and, and

856
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,240
the little crack and Jane Crocker with a gun and whoop, whoopity, whoopity.

857
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:20,720
Yeah.

858
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,000
God, what the fuck?

859
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,640
So many characters that are not like terribly explained in the comic that are like happening

860
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:34,000
in the, we're happening in the discord over like months.

861
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,520
Yeah.

862
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,840
A lot of, a lot of it is base.

863
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,120
A lot of it is like, um, Killer Sonichu.

864
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,800
Killer Sonichu is just Jane Crocker with a gun who had stolen the Sonichu medallion

865
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:56,800
from the beta timeline version of Chris Chan, who it, who became corrupted by slime,

866
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,360
quote unquote, corrupted, uh, who was, that was a player named Cabricon.

867
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,960
That was just their like alt.

868
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,280
Yeah.

869
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,480
That was their killer alt because they were a rowdy normally.

870
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:10,720
Yeah.

871
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,600
And they drew Killer Sonichu and I was like, yeah, I'm using this.

872
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,360
I have not seen them around, uh, but, uh, I don't know.

873
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,800
Maybe they were a good artist.

874
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,240
So they were a good artist.

875
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,160
So I hope they are still drawing.

876
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:24,400
Yeah.

877
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,800
Uh, a lot of really good, a lot of really good artists, uh, from the old, from the,

878
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,960
in the old guard of, uh, of the endless war crowd.

879
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,360
The endless war peep, the endless war people has changed.

880
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,920
There's a new, there was the old guard and there's the new guard and the new guard has

881
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,400
stayed kind of consistent for the last like year plus maybe, maybe even two years,

882
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,680
but there's, there was definitely a like an old crowd and there's a new crowd

883
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,320
and there's some crossover between them.

884
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,520
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

885
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,920
That's, I don't know.

886
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,760
I'm not, I don't have any further point to make about that other than that.

887
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,160
It's true.

888
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,680
I, I remember Uwupiti, right?

889
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,640
It was like the little mascot you made during your Vapors Kickstarter.

890
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,840
Okay, Uwupiti.

891
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,640
Got, wait, I'm trying to think where did Uwupiti originate?

892
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,480
We called it Uwupiti not because he was like Dupiti,

893
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,200
but that was just like a funny name to give.

894
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,800
Uh, Uwupiti's pronouns are it, it's, uh, thank you very much.

895
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,360
Oh, sorry.

896
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:40,800
Uh, yeah, I decided that all, all Slymoids default to it.

897
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,680
They don't default to it, to it's unless, unless they, unless specified otherwise.

898
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:53,520
And their, uh, their honorific is not, uh, Mr or Mrs, but it's a, it's Mx and it's pronounced

899
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:00,160
mixture as in like, I think that's pretty, I think that's pretty clever because they're like,

900
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,840
because they're like mixed up in a big VAT, you know, they, they come out of the slime

901
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,400
Corp of Vats.

902
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,440
I thought I was pretty proud of myself when I came up with that.

903
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,480
Um, uh, mixed, mixture Uwupiti is, uh, what was I saying?

904
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,840
Okay, I, I made, I made Uwupiti up.

905
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,280
It didn't have a name originally.

906
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,040
I keep wanting to call him a he, lol, but now I can't or I'll sound like an

907
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,440
asshole.

908
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,280
Uh, uh, uh, I came up with Uwupiti.

909
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,200
The idea, I was going to guilt Chris.

910
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,360
I think I wanted to guilt Chris into like retweeting.

911
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,880
Oh, I wanted to guilt Chris into retweeting the vapor suit kickstart.

912
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:44,960
So I made this like adorable little, little slime creature like, oh, the slime, the slime

913
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,800
Wayne killed my whole family.

914
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,920
The slime Wayne.

915
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,800
Oh, that's right.

916
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,600
That was happening.

917
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,840
The slime Wayne, uh, displaced my community.

918
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,960
Ooh, uh, oh, if only Christian would retweet the vapors to kickstart.

919
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,520
And she never did.

920
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,280
And I was like, oh, he's like Uwupiti.

921
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,440
She, it had to, uh, was like, oh, if Chris doesn't, doesn't retweet the kickstarter,

922
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,760
I'm going to kill myself and throwing myself into this vat of acid.

923
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,520
Oh, she didn't retweet.

924
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
Oh, I guess, uh, what's the point of

925
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,080
going on?

926
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,880
That's right.

927
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,280
Okay.

928
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:28,640
So I was, I remembered that during that I made a tweet where I had like Katie, my slime girl,

929
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,960
save Uwupiti and put him in a jar.

930
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,440
And that's why they're in a jar later.

931
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,840
Yes.

932
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,680
And also, I forgot it was Katie, but yes, I remember that.

933
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,000
Yes.

934
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:49,040
Later on, uh, in the alternate, in a killer, killer sonichu gives killer sonichu gives

935
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,960
phantom horn.

936
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,680
And this is the surviving phantom horn from an alternate beta timeline, uh, gives phantom horn

937
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,720
the all the alpha timeline version of Virginia, uh, whose owner was killed.

938
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,080
That's the main phantom horn.

939
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,000
The story follows was killed by the rain.

940
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,840
But his, his Virginia gets given to the alternate phantom, as well as Uwupiti, who is in a bottle

941
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:22,640
along with a bunch of piss, a bunch of, a bunch of slime court piss vats, uh, is just in there.

942
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,000
I forgot that.

943
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,080
And also, uh, Tom made that, that animation.

944
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,440
Do you remember that?

945
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,160
Of that, that 3D animation of, uh, uh, fuck, what's, what's the, what's the wreck?

946
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,120
Oh God, I got the COVID brain fog.

947
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:37,840
Azumi?

948
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,040
Azumi, yes.

949
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

950
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,280
Like that COVID brain fog, uh, of Azumi rescuing Uwupiti from the vat as well.

951
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,560
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

952
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,760
We both had that idea.

953
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,240
So I think, I think, I guess in the alpha timeline, it was saved by, uh,

954
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,800
Kate, oh my God, I can't, I can't think today.

955
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,440
Kaylee?

956
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:01,920
Katie.

957
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,280
Katie.

958
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,880
And, and that was the, the one that's in the jar with the piss.

959
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,960
And then I guess the one that Azumi saved became Forman Uwupiti?

960
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,240
Maybe?

961
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,720
I don't know.

962
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,520
Yeah, I guess that, I guess that makes sense.

963
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:22,800
At a time, I think I was like, I had written a bit of like Red Noir because it was like,

964
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:29,440
it was like, it was a big thing going on with the, the, the Chris Chan, uh, bicarbonate rain

965
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,440
colliding with endless war saga.

966
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,240
It was very funny.

967
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,920
It was very funny.

968
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,680
And so I had like, oh, it was raining.

969
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,040
What about like a noir film?

970
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,200
What if written man was a noir guy?

971
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,560
I can't remember why I came up with that, but that was part of the, the fun was that

972
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,160
it's raining and it's bicarbonate rain and he was going to try and figure it out.

973
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,640
When it, when it's raining in a, in a city, you gotta put on a trench code and solve a mystery.

974
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,080
And I remember, I remember like writing down like a big like mystery for him to solve and it

975
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:03,040
would be like so fucking in depth and it would involve slime corp and everything and red man

976
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,800
would be like solving the mystery.

977
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,960
And like, because Azumi, because Tom made that thing, Azumi would be involved.

978
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,800
Azumi would be doing things and it's like, okay, what factions are there and what,

979
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,080
who's Katie aligned with?

980
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,520
Oh my God, there's so much stuff there.

981
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,960
And it's, it was too complicated.

982
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,280
And also you hadn't finished slime and punishment.

983
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,240
So I didn't know where it was going and I didn't know what to do.

984
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,200
So I just sort of gave up.

985
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,680
Yeah. Yeah, that's too bad, but it's understandable.

986
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,960
I guess it took me like two years.

987
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,720
I didn't think it would take me that long.

988
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:41,200
I mean, now that it's about to be finished, I guess I could like retroactively finish Red Noir.

989
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,360
I did always, I did always want to see Red Noir finished.

990
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,640
I always thought it was pretty cool.

991
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,720
I like, maybe Red Man is in like one of the timelines that just gets completely

992
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,320
destroyed and everyone dies.

993
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,120
Oh, use, I mean.

994
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,240
Dimensions, what I mean.

995
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,520
I mean, yeah.

996
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:11,760
Yeah, I mean, there's, I think it's, it's a bit, I think, I'm just trying to think if there's

997
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,280
a difference between dimensions and timelines, whatever.

998
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,440
Um, the, you saw, I mean, you, I know you saw the, um,

999
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,400
the slime and punishment update that is just a Red Man comic.

1000
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,280
Yes.

1001
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,320
With the guitar.

1002
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,440
Yeah, I thought, I thought that was pretty funny.

1003
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,040
I thought that was pretty clever.

1004
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,120
I was like patting myself on the back like, haha, haha, I did it.

1005
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,200
Big iron, big iron, big iron.

1006
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,480
So all these references, all these fucking references.

1007
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:54,480
Nobody who, imagine not knowing anything about like Endless War or the PCP or anything.

1008
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,040
And you read that, you read those pages.

1009
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,600
What, what, what, I don't know.

1010
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,200
I don't even know.

1011
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,720
It's for the hardcore fans.

1012
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,320
I think so.

1013
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,520
I really think so.

1014
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,240
Man, I don't know.

1015
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,240
Man, I hope my book sells a million copies, but it can't.

1016
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,040
It's, it can't.

1017
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,600
But I hope it sells to a few people.

1018
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,200
I hope it sells to a small number of people who really appreciate,

1019
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,360
and I hope they all buy 10 copies each.

1020
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,640
That's my, that's what I want.

1021
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:27,680
Yeah.

1022
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,600
Hang on, I need to pee.

1023
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:33,520
Okay.

1024
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:40,800
Getting that, I'll just, I'll just opine to myself then that getting that book made

1025
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,880
is going to be really hard.

1026
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,960
Let's, okay, I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, we, weeks blend into each other,

1027
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,920
and I, I don't remember whether I talked about this at last episode.

1028
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,240
I say that more and more every, every time.

1029
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,040
Uh, I think I did mention this, that I decided that I think I'm gonna switch from

1030
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,200
a homestuck book, or a problem sleuth book style running commentary on the bottom of every page

1031
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:11,920
to a infinite jest style, uh, footnotes and annotations in a, in a section at the back.

1032
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,440
And, uh, that's actually gonna be a lot of writing.

1033
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,240
I mean, I guess I'll, I probably, I'll try not to overthink it.

1034
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,920
It's not gonna be like I'm writing a story.

1035
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,080
It's just gonna be like writing off the top of my head,

1036
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,440
like whatever I think about, oh, here's what I have to say about this page.

1037
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,960
Okay, but it's actually gonna be a lot,

1038
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,760
because like I'm probably gonna have something to say about,

1039
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,400
maybe not most pages, but like a lot, a lot of pages

1040
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,560
require, or at least would benefit from, some additional context,

1041
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,360
like what we're talking about today.

1042
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,560
Oh, are you talking about?

1043
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,280
That's actually gonna, the stuff?

1044
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,080
Yeah, the foot, the footnotes and annotations that I'm gonna have to write for the book.

1045
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,000
Like this, like this stuff we're talking about right now.

1046
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,680
I want to include all of this in a little like section at the back to explain like,

1047
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,680
hey, if you haven't, if you're not familiar with the context of the story, let, let me explain.

1048
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,720
Well, you see, Uwupati was created as a psychological weapon to manipulate

1049
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,400
Christian Wesson-Chantler into retweeting my Kickstarter.

1050
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,480
For an unrelated comic.

1051
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,640
Totally, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1052
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,360
Yeah, so.

1053
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:26,080
It failed spectacularly, and Uwupati died, except he didn't, except it didn't.

1054
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:28,880
I caught myself.

1055
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,960
It did fail spectacularly, but also it was a huge success because everybody loves Uwupati.

1056
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,960
And I should make a plush.

1057
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,240
I should make an Uwupati plush.

1058
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,160
Should steal your idea.

1059
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,280
I should steal your idea.

1060
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:41,680
You know what?

1061
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,360
I should just copy Gibbon.

1062
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,880
I should just like do whatever Gibbon take does and just make a plush of a thing.

1063
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,800
You'll have to play royalties because I came up with the idea of making plushes.

1064
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,160
Well, okay.

1065
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,320
Well, you have to pay royalties because I came up

1066
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:04,000
with the idea of making you pay royalties to me for doing a thing that I did.

1067
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:13,680
So you see circles, circles within circles within spheres, sparkles, sparkles within

1068
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,280
cubes within rectangles.

1069
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:22,080
I have been I've been playing a little too much Noida.

1070
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,440
I've been playing a little too much Noida this week.

1071
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,560
I've been like getting to I've been looking at a page and being like,

1072
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,960
I don't want to draw this.

1073
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:37,520
I don't want to think that drawing drawing these these these this chapter is uncomfortable.

1074
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:44,800
And for all the reasons re stated before, I feel demotivated from working on it.

1075
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,720
Therefore, oh, just a little Noida, just a little Noida.

1076
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,280
You can't do just a little Noida.

1077
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,200
It's like you can't do just little Noida.

1078
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:58,800
It's you're committing yourself to like a month straight of playing that and perfecting it like

1079
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,680
you did last time.

1080
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,000
You play you play a little Noida.

1081
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,120
Well, I'm trying I'm trying to win fast.

1082
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:10,320
I'm not trying I'm not trying to do like long runs where I make the sun and whatever.

1083
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,160
I'm trying to get I'm trying to get streaks.

1084
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,400
So I'll be like, OK, I'll just play a little quick Noida.

1085
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,600
Try and win as fast as I can.

1086
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,800
Try and win in under an hour.

1087
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,880
OK. Oh, I lost.

1088
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,920
Oh, well, better try again.

1089
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,680
I lost. Well, better try again.

1090
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,040
Oh, I won.

1091
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,880
Well, oh, I won.

1092
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,400
Well, OK, better try again and see if I can get a streak going.

1093
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,840
Oh, I lost.

1094
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,680
Well, better start a streak.

1095
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,480
Better try again.

1096
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,120
Yeah, I almost got my record.

1097
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,800
I brought my fastest win record down.

1098
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,560
It's like an hour and five minutes, though.

1099
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,080
So I could win it under an hour.

1100
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,120
You shouldn't think I had an incredible run.

1101
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,760
I had an incredible run yesterday that I died

1102
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,200
in a very stupid way, as you often do.

1103
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,320
And I was really mad game game just gave me game just fucking handed me everything.

1104
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,600
Game handed me the win on a silver platter and I still managed to die.

1105
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,760
That's the way it goes.

1106
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:14,800
I saw this video where this guy had to physically take steps in the real world

1107
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,400
and then spend those steps in a Pokemon game.

1108
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,560
So like if you ran out of steps in the Pokemon game,

1109
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,400
he would have to do like a jog and like rack up steps

1110
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,320
so that he could use them in the game.

1111
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,160
And it was like a playthrough of a Pokemon.

1112
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,720
I think it was like a diamond shining diamond or whatever.

1113
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,200
Wait, rack up steps?

1114
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,080
Like how many steps does it take to beat Pokemon?

1115
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,560
But I use the steps from real life.

1116
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,400
Was he doing like a...

1117
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,400
Wait, what?

1118
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,920
One of the Pokemon games tracks your steps.

1119
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,280
I don't know which one.

1120
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,760
Oh, like an exercise tracker?

1121
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,720
No, no, no, in game.

1122
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,280
Like how many steps you take just as a like a metric.

1123
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,200
Oh, okay.

1124
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,080
Because of that, he can like keep track and he uses his like a fitness app

1125
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,400
or whatever to track his steps in real life.

1126
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,080
So it goes on like a jog and it's like exercising.

1127
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,440
Exercising.

1128
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,000
Like you can only use in the game as many steps as you did in real life.

1129
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,440
Yes, yes, that's the idea.

1130
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,880
Maybe you should do that for Noita.

1131
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,920
Maybe you should like to put some sort of soft cap

1132
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,360
on how much Noita you can play.

1133
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,400
You have to do something to like allow yourself.

1134
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:34,880
I can only guzzle as much brine in Noita as I do in real life.

1135
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:37,840
Yes.

1136
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,200
That'll put a hard cap on my operations for sure.

1137
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,360
Yeah.

1138
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,600
But I don't know.

1139
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,360
I shouldn't...

1140
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,120
I don't blame Noita.

1141
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,080
I blame myself.

1142
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,920
The Noita is just a symptom.

1143
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,600
Me playing Noita is not keeping me from working.

1144
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,760
I'm choosing not to work.

1145
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,480
And then in the absence of that, I'm playing Noita instead.

1146
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,200
And that's on me.

1147
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,400
That's a...

1148
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,880
It's not a problem with Noita.

1149
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,760
It's a problem with me.

1150
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,840
But I literally am...

1151
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:21,520
The last page I have to do of the like post game scene

1152
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:27,360
It's four panels, but they all have the same background.

1153
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,240
Like it's four images that take place in the same background.

1154
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,440
So the background is like mostly drawn.

1155
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,680
I just have to like finish drawing the background

1156
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:43,760
and then draw Phantom walking in the four different positions in it.

1157
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,440
And then that scene is done.

1158
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,920
So like that's all I have left to do on that.

1159
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,360
And then I think the last...

1160
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,640
The ending I'm thinking...

1161
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,120
If I go with the idea that I have now,

1162
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,560
I don't think I'm even gonna like have backgrounds.

1163
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,960
I'm gonna make it very like...

1164
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,000
Very minimalist.

1165
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,000
Except for maybe like...

1166
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,200
Maybe like a scene or...

1167
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:09,760
No!

1168
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,880
Maybe it's...

1169
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,720
Actually, I'm not sure if that's true.

1170
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,640
I'm kicking around some...

1171
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,160
Taking around...

1172
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,960
I'm kicking around some ideas and they're solidifying.

1173
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,440
You know what it is?

1174
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,360
It's just gonna be the end of Neon Genesis,

1175
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,200
Save and Gillian with the White.

1176
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,400
I'm taking a long time...

1177
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,320
I'm taking a long time on purpose

1178
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,880
because it's letting ideas slosh around and cohere in my head

1179
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,480
about what the ending should...

1180
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,440
About what the final, final ending should look like.

1181
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,520
And indeed...

1182
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,160
And indeed the concept has evolved as I've just kind of...

1183
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:44,320
Yeah.

1184
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:48,080
As I've just kind of let it simmer in my mind for these several weeks.

1185
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:54,400
I feel like I get impatient for some things where I'm like,

1186
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,000
it's gonna end and I want it to be good,

1187
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,640
but I know that I can't make it be good.

1188
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,160
Oh, just fucking throw something together and post.

1189
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,600
That's how I do...

1190
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,040
That's how I write my emails to like important people.

1191
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,560
I'm like, oh, this has to be good.

1192
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,200
That's just to be professional, but I can't do that.

1193
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,720
Just send.

1194
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,720
I know what you mean.

1195
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,480
Like if it's something important...

1196
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,240
Sometimes if it's something that you feel like is important,

1197
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:28,720
you gotta just be like, well, I don't know how to make this good,

1198
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,760
so I'm just gonna do whatever.

1199
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,560
Yeah.

1200
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,720
And it'll just be how it's gonna be.

1201
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:35,680
Yeah.

1202
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,520
Yeah.

1203
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,280
Which is like, it's simultaneously a good way to get things done,

1204
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,440
but also really annoying because then...

1205
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,080
If only you spent a little more time, you could have made it so much better

1206
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,040
and I'm like, oh, that's true, but also I would have never finished it.

1207
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,480
Yeah, in the long run, it's better.

1208
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,880
It's kind of better to just do shit and not worry about it.

1209
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,680
And if you do more shit, more of it will be good.

1210
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,200
True.

1211
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:08,560
Yeah.

1212
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,920
So I'm not too worried about my approach there,

1213
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:22,720
but it does feel like people get the wrong impression of my potential

1214
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:27,440
because I stopped short of really going for something a lot of the time.

1215
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,400
And then when I actually do try a bit, it's like, wow,

1216
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,840
this is the best thing I've ever seen you do.

1217
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:37,600
And I'm like, well, you think this is impressive for me?

1218
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,640
I could do this the whole time, you motherfucker.

1219
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,800
Yeah, but you didn't.

1220
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:48,480
I didn't because I was...

1221
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,080
I was thinking, I think I was looking at some artists on Twitter.

1222
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,760
I was looking at some drawings.

1223
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,600
Drawings of a character.

1224
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,920
If you're an artist on Twitter, you might have a character that you draw

1225
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:11,040
and maybe you draw them in a cool outfit or in a cool background

1226
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,120
or just like they look cool.

1227
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:13,440
Yeah.

1228
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,040
Like just draw a character looking cool, doing something cool,

1229
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,880
or not even just looking a cool way.

1230
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,160
And I don't know.

1231
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:30,480
I think there's something wrong with me because I see something like that

1232
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,320
that's just kind of like good for its own sake.

1233
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,440
It's just like kind of just something that just sort of looks good

1234
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,360
and people just like it because it looks good.

1235
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,680
And my reaction is like, what's the fucking point of that?

1236
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,720
What a waste of fucking time.

1237
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,880
I think I may understand what that is.

1238
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,360
Yeah.

1239
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:54,160
It's like it's not part of...

1240
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:56,560
Yeah.

1241
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,120
Like it's just sort of, I think it may be that there's so much of that on Twitter.

1242
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:06,240
There's so many good artists posting good art that they made and they're skilled

1243
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,800
and you just scroll past it because you've seen it already.

1244
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,520
You've seen stuff that's similarly good.

1245
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,280
And you're just sort of numb to quality.

1246
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:22,400
And it's like, well, surely there could be something else that this good art could be doing for me,

1247
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,200
which is really selfish actually.

1248
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:34,400
But I'm numb to quality because there's so much well drawn and well conceived

1249
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,240
and attractive and cool art.

1250
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:42,480
Honestly, like amazingly good artists are just the dime a dozen.

1251
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,120
There's a billion of them on Twitter.

1252
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,320
It's like crazy.

1253
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,480
And I feel similar.

1254
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,040
It's like, shouldn't I be like plugging right now?

1255
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,960
Shouldn't I be like going insane?

1256
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,560
I'm seeing this thing and it's like, this is a really cool design, really well done.

1257
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,040
I couldn't do that in a million years.

1258
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,640
Just keep scrolling.

1259
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,760
Don't even like it.

1260
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,640
Don't even retweet it.

1261
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,320
No, we have whatever.

1262
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,280
Saw something better yesterday though.

1263
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,560
Saw something just as good.

1264
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,680
So like, yeah, it's like, I don't know.

1265
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:25,200
I think the way to succeed as an artist, I feel like, is just to churn out a lot of things

1266
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,120
that are good and that people like.

1267
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,880
You just keep making pieces that people like.

1268
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,080
That's how you make good art, I guess.

1269
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,960
Well, that's how you make social media success is that you have a consistent stream of good

1270
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,320
quality stuff that like.

1271
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,880
I would say even before social media, that was probably the way to do it.

1272
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:52,560
I mean, you wouldn't sell or show before the internet, you wouldn't do that sort of stuff.

1273
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:58,480
You would draw all the time if you're an illustrator, but you would get freelance work, I think.

1274
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,640
Well, you would probably, I mean, you would probably just like build up a portfolio,

1275
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:08,800
but you would only put like 5% of the art you actually make in that to show people to get jobs,

1276
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,200
right?

1277
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:14,960
But you would be, if you didn't have a job and you were an artist, you would probably be

1278
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,960
painting stuff and then maybe you would probably try to sell them, right?

1279
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,680
You would try to sell your paintings in some.

1280
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:27,920
I mean, an art is very broad, so it depends, but like, I guess so.

1281
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,200
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't necessarily be a painter exactly.

1282
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,160
Yeah, okay, sure.

1283
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:44,240
But I don't think, what I mean is I don't think success always, like you don't have to do it

1284
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:44,720
that way.

1285
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,240
You don't have to be putting out things that are of high quality,

1286
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:58,720
of like no specific reason, just sort of like an image, I like it, you put it up there.

1287
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:06,160
You could make images that suck, but like have more interesting aspect to it, like what I do.

1288
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:12,400
That's why I do comics is you can have a bit of context and it makes the fact that the drawings

1289
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,760
are not like the perfect drawing.

1290
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,080
It doesn't matter so much because you can get attached to the character or the story that's

1291
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:18,480
happening.

1292
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:26,400
Well, I just feel like, I feel like, you know, it's a pretty, I think it's a reasonable expectation

1293
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:36,720
of an artist that you make, that you put out a fairly consistent stream of high quality work

1294
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,400
that is attractive to people and that appeals to people, right?

1295
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:48,160
And I think the fact that I feel sort of allergic to that is probably just terrible.

1296
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:54,400
It's probably just really bad for me and my success in life.

1297
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:59,280
Like you feel allergic because you couldn't imagine you doing something like that or you

1298
01:14:59,280 --> 01:14:59,840
wouldn't want to?

1299
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:09,840
Well, because my response, because I feel negatively about that sort of thing, but that's

1300
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:17,360
like the kind of thing that is like good, that I'm like, oh, sure.

1301
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:25,840
Oh, just make attractive character art that appeals to people that people like and want

1302
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,640
to share and stuff.

1303
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,800
Well, good for you, I guess.

1304
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,240
I used to make me sick.

1305
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,800
Come back when you were a real artist like me after you've spent two years doing a fucking

1306
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:46,880
Sonichu, a fucking big, weird, stupid, like, I don't even know, it's a fan comic, but it's

1307
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:51,520
sort of like, it's sort of like, like a, I guess it would partially call it a sort of

1308
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:57,520
like performance art in that it was sort of improvised on the fly in order to evoke a reaction

1309
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,480
from a specific person, a lot of it was.

1310
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,400
I don't know.

1311
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:09,040
Whatever it is, I spent two years doing it and if you didn't fuck you.

1312
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:17,600
I mean, we already knew that like mass appeal does not come from extremely niche things and

1313
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:25,760
success often requires a bit of mass appeal or at least some avenue by which you can tap that

1314
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,400
market like.

1315
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,520
I feel like what's what's something like slime and slime and punishment needs

1316
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:37,840
like an event like evangelists, it needs like Bards like explaining it like the way that like

1317
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,880
Vati Vidya like explains Dark Souls to to people or Dark Souls in general, the people

1318
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,080
you know, it's sort of on its own.

1319
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:47,920
Yeah, yeah.

1320
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,520
Dark Souls has Vati Vidya Five Nights at Freddy's has Matt Pat.

1321
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,200
You need you need one of those for slime and punishment.

1322
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,720
I feel like on its own it will it's just it's just met with it'll just be met with bemusement.

1323
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,240
Like what what am I supposed to make of this?

1324
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,560
You know, so that's why I got a right.

1325
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,760
So that's so that's why I got a right footnotes and errata and stuff but like is that enough?

1326
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:13,840
I don't know.

1327
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,360
I guess my hope my guess my hope for like the Kickstarter right because like the way that I

1328
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:25,360
want to turn this all into a I didn't waste my time is I don't want to sell make a book and

1329
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:31,920
sell a book do a Kickstarter sell the book and so I guess I hope that just the that just the

1330
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:38,960
the niche-ness and the inscrutability of it will be curious enough of a curiosity enough of a novelty

1331
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:44,720
that maybe people who don't even know me might hear about it in some way maybe when I do a

1332
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:49,360
big push to like yeah push the Kickstarter maybe people would hear about it and be intrigued by

1333
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,680
it and be like yeah sure I'll pick it yeah what's this I guess I'll grab one let me see what it's

1334
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:58,640
all about that's what I hope and I just don't know if it's true I don't know if it'll work out

1335
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:11,040
if it doesn't I'll feel disappointed you know yeah I I've I've been feeling I've been feeling

1336
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:17,280
trepidatious about the Pumpkin Alley possible Kickstarter as well yeah because it's like

1337
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:27,120
like it's a very different thing to like fund a video game yeah and to know how long it's gonna

1338
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:34,640
take how much money is required where to put it and like yeah whether or not I have currently

1339
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:42,960
enough notoriety with this to get it to that level because like what did what did my um

1340
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:52,560
load of ghosts it got like around six thousand almost six six six six six I think pounds pounds

1341
01:18:52,560 --> 01:19:02,560
yes um which is amazing um yeah further just a lot of ghosts but like Radcon four or something

1342
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:09,760
Radcon three I forget which one they made like made like 30 grand yeah Radcon four made like 32

1343
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:16,800
or 34 thousand yeah and and like okay well we'll need a lot more than just that for a video game

1344
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:24,000
but like how do I how do I I don't think enough people know about it so what if it fails what if

1345
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,440
we just don't get we can't get enough money to make Pumpkin Alley I don't want to I don't want to

1346
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:35,200
risk that I want to risk it like oh well I guess we can't make the video game I uh so I'm a little

1347
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:44,240
scared I'm a little scared hmm I mean video game kick starters have a sort of uh track record you

1348
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:51,360
know what I mean they have a lot of them a lot of them over promise and and and things go and

1349
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:57,920
things go pear shaped well I guess a lot of them do but like I'm I'm I'm looking at things like a

1350
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:05,600
hat in time and Hollow Knight and and a lot of those projects they had a lot of publicity before

1351
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:12,400
the Kickstarter started so I feel like I need to like make the circuit make the go to some games

1352
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:19,040
conventions and show off the demo and then slowly be working on bits and bobs here and there before

1353
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:27,520
before I like actually say okay video game now but like I don't know it's it's really rough it

1354
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:34,080
seems like yeah it seems like a lot of the big success stories out of like indie uh uh crowdfund

1355
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:42,640
gaming yeah they were like already successful before they even came out like uh Lisa had a big

1356
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:49,840
push uh like Jim like Jim Sterling was pushing Lisa uh you know Andrew Hussie and a bunch of other

1357
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:56,240
people were pushing Undertale uh Toby later and then later Toby Fox and a bunch of other people a

1358
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:04,560
lot of people were pushing like Yeek uh and like how do I I guess those I guess I guess the Yeek

1359
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:10,080
guys had made a game before just like a game that nobody played so I don't know so I don't know how

1360
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,120
they got all these uh it's it's I don't know how you get I don't know how you get this shit well

1361
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:21,760
you just got to get publicity and to do that you got to have a cool thing to show people and I feel

1362
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:31,360
like starting a Kickstarter before I have any like the the PCP audience is so small now compared

1363
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:36,640
to where it was before um in terms of like people who would see the podcast and be like oh cool it

1364
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:43,760
gives making game uh so much smaller than it's it's shrank for sure yeah and like I can't rely on

1365
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:49,760
all the all the Nate all the Nate heads and the and the digi heads have all uh have all migrated

1366
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:57,440
to I don't know eat glue some somewhere else I guess yeah and then like it would be cool but like

1367
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:04,720
if the if they could shout it out but like I can't I can't rely on that and even then uh

1368
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,200
well I guess Nate is about the same but Trixie is no longer a big draw a big like uh

1369
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:16,640
force in like she tweets about something nobody pays attention anymore I don't think there's

1370
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:24,080
a small small fan base that she has no and so like her her the big the biggest the she made her

1371
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:31,200
her biggest tweet uh in a while the other day uh saying like uh my uh video is gonna be late

1372
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:35,920
because of someone in my family died and everyone was like oh I'm so sorry for your loss got it got

1373
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:42,560
a hundred likes it was it it was a big it was a big tentpole moment well I mean it sucks that someone

1374
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:49,520
did he died but yeah sure uh it's probably like probably an uncle or something uh um gotta gotta

1375
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:59,280
go to the funeral or whatever but yeah it's like uh if if there was like youtuber power I I guess I

1376
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:08,080
could message a few people but like not really I would I would need to like gain some some notoriety

1377
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:13,360
from the the ground up kind of not like completely from the ground up I'm I'm lucky and have like

1378
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:20,480
the platform I already do uh yeah so I can push it a bit but like it's gonna take some doing before

1379
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:28,320
I feel like it's it's like going to work for a Kickstarter yeah but I don't know I don't I don't

1380
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:39,200
want to wait too long either so uh duh that's been on my mind it's yeah I mean yeah I guess

1381
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:48,960
man I guess I guess trying to hmm you you make sense it makes sense to be like well I gotta you

1382
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:55,600
know I want to have want to try and have as much cloud as I can before I launch the project

1383
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:02,800
but how but how much can you get right I like damn if I knew if I knew how to get if I knew how to

1384
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:09,680
get that cloud if I knew how to get those connections get like big people tweeting about my my project

1385
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:17,520
or whatever like yeah man part of me wish I knew too part of me is like well I mean I could always

1386
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:25,440
just become a super mega star youtuber by doing hypocrite again which is like it's everything's

1387
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:33,360
a gamble that may not work at all but yeah it was it was the thing like video game reviewer of that

1388
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:41,120
sort of a type of game uh fan base built from that would be interested in a pump canali yeah so

1389
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:45,280
like that that's something I've been thinking of like should I should I cynically go back to

1390
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:50,080
making hypocrite videos for that I don't feel like the time investment is worth it though

1391
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:56,640
because to make good videos is very time intensive if your heart wasn't in it I don't feel like

1392
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:02,320
they would be good no no I mean it wouldn't be like no it wouldn't be like um

1393
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:09,440
I feel like the reason I got burnt out on hypocrite was more that I was just sort of chasing

1394
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:15,280
algorithmic success and monetization and I didn't really have a goal I was just like

1395
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:21,360
talk about this I'll talk about that yeah I feel like if I'm doing it for the purposes of funding

1396
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:28,880
a video game there could be more motivation behind it and it would be fine uh yeah so like

1397
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:37,520
I'm just thinking I just uh yeah fair enough I just I don't know if uh I don't know if it

1398
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:45,280
really makes sense to you know that's like a like I see the connection but it's kind of like a

1399
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:52,000
totally different thing like I don't feel like that's the most direct way of like getting support for

1400
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:01,680
your game dev is to like throw yourself entirely into review review videos on youtube you know what

1401
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:08,560
I mean true it's not obviously a good thing even if it is the biggest like number generator for you

1402
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:16,560
I mean it's it's really just like how do you get people to know about anything I have a youtube

1403
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:21,040
channel I don't know whether it's like because it's been dormant for so many years if it's like

1404
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,200
you have some plakarismically unviable anymore I think that sometimes that happens to

1405
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,560
dormant channels they just don't get pushed even if you start making new videos

1406
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:38,160
um but like maybe like game dev logs sometimes get a lot of attention if they're interesting

1407
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:47,840
so this is that that's like I'm torn I'm torn between stuff like I could spend my time

1408
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:55,600
working on other projects which are also niche comic stuff yeah and I don't know how much that

1409
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:02,400
would help I could stream more often I could become a streamer like I'm just thinking of like

1410
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:09,520
how do you get this shit out there I mean some people do uh like just they make games and they

1411
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:16,320
just stream themselves working on their games I haven't seen any of those I mean I've seen devlogs

1412
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,880
on youtube but I haven't seen streams about it though yeah I mean Matt yeah I was gonna say

1413
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:29,920
Matthew Matosis does that but Matthew Matosis was like a already huge youtuber well yeah sure he's

1414
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:39,760
kind of big but I mean he can't he can't be the only one uh I mean every viewer of the

1415
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,960
progress knitters podcast should share and talk about pumpkin alley and send it to all your friends

1416
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:51,680
well I agree I agree with that uh that's an easy thing to do just say hey play this demo

1417
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:58,960
there we're gonna make a hot fix actually some time in the future next few days um or maybe it's

1418
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:04,480
already out uh just to to improve a little bit of the the jumping and a few glitches

1419
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:13,120
so play the play the new version when that's out even if you played the old version it won't be

1420
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:24,800
that much different but uh do it man um I feel like damn okay I not not well I guess sorry to

1421
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:34,560
change the subject but it just dawned on me again how much I it's I think I I I would say it fucked

1422
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,760
up because I had reasons for doing everything that I did and I don't think it was like a bad idea but

1423
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:49,840
I did really I did really kind of uh uh pop my own bubble a bit with like the game because I was

1424
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:56,800
I'm I was really excited to see how everyone would respond to the game I was really excited to see

1425
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:03,360
people like maybe talk about the game maybe compare like oh how did how did it go for me like how did

1426
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:08,960
I oh how did I do it oh how did you do it wait oh does that work okay maybe I don't know I was I was

1427
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,720
anxiously hopeful that maybe I would see some discussion about it maybe it would get

1428
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:20,640
people engage right see people engaging with it uh but I really popped my bubble by sharing it

1429
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:25,840
with the patrons which I don't really regret doing but I really I don't even really think about it

1430
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:30,480
anymore I really feel as though oh everyone's seen it already oh everyone's already played it

1431
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:36,400
it's not true no I definitely they they certainly have not played it almost nobody has in the grand

1432
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:44,320
scheme of things uh only probably like maybe 20 20 people have played it if 20 something like that

1433
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:51,600
um but you know they they all told me what they thought and so like eh whatever eh never mind

1434
01:29:53,680 --> 01:30:03,840
I'm joking um but um gosh it will be pretty exciting even even though it uh it irrationally

1435
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:10,160
feels like it's already happened it will probably be pretty cool anyway when I release it for real

1436
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:16,560
I should I really what what gets me motivated is focusing on that feeling of oh but it's going

1437
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,560
to be so good when I release it oh it's going to be so good when it's actually done and I put it out

1438
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:29,280
and you know people can see it and I can hear people's thoughts about it and stuff so you know uh um

1439
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:36,080
I did kind of kill I could kill that a little bit by sharing with the patrons but I mean my patrons

1440
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:46,240
deserve it so I should not punish them by uh slacking and uh uh uh dragging my feet just because I

1441
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:59,040
did that to myself yes okay video games this I think I think definitely this week

1442
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:04,800
I think I think I definitely will have it done this week like like the final the final page that

1443
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:09,360
I was describing the four panels that have the same background I will probably get that done today

1444
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:16,560
like it's it's really close and then the final update there's no way I won't finish it this

1445
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:23,600
week like there's just no way never say that unless unless unless you play noita for another 25

1446
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:31,520
hours unless I have some wacky idea that ends up being like oh like that would be really good

1447
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:37,280
but it would take a lot of work you know it would be really good uh uh another animation

1448
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:44,800
oh another video game I was considering uh possibly some sort of um ending with kind of a

1449
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:52,080
sort of a sort of powers of 10 zoom out you know what I mean do you know what I'm talking about

1450
01:31:53,040 --> 01:32:01,120
uh no I mean I mean like like a zoom out from like oh shows the planet oh shows the galaxy oh

1451
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:07,040
shows the universe oh shows the dimensions oh shows the like you know it's all like it's all

1452
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:12,800
inside of a thing inside of a thing inside of a thing uh honestly that and then it's probably

1453
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:18,400
wouldn't even uh it's it's did you bronies eye at the end oh my god you spoiled it

1454
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:24,960
yeah I well no that's not like that was gonna be the joke but that was like one thing I was

1455
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:30,800
thinking like okay yeah what what what if I do a sequence yeah like like a zoom out zoom out zoom

1456
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:35,200
out and then in the zoom out there are a bunch of like stupid things and and one of them would have

1457
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:40,720
been yeah inside did you bronies eye uh but that wouldn't probably wouldn't have been the last thing

1458
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:45,520
I don't know what the last thing I mean it's a reference to an old t-bap joke it's a reference

1459
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:51,760
actually there were oh no no I had another idea I I guess I'll say it fuck it because I don't know

1460
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:57,040
if I'll do it but I was thinking no you know I don't want to say you know what actually I actually

1461
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,600
I actually don't want to say it because I probably will do it and I don't want to

1462
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:06,240
I don't want to spoil the feeling you know I don't want to do more of what I've already

1463
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:12,320
done to myself killing my yes my drive to complete it so I'll just I know what it is phantom horn

1464
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,120

1468
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:47,680
I'm can you west I don't know that's my week I didn't do anything

1469
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:57,200
I uh I have been as I said I finished the uh the ghosts most of the days was just sort of like

1470
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:04,800
setting up the the sewing stuff and just sitting there listening to ukraine podcasts and in the

1471
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:10,080
I still don't um uh hearing about all that stuff while I was just like sewing little ghosts up

1472
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,440
I still don't really know anything about ukraine I mean I hear stuff that's happening

1473
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:22,880
I don't uh I don't have like a I don't have like an informed opinion uh you know I guess my

1474
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:30,960
you know my take was like war bad rush is doing war that's bad so Russia bad glory to ukraine

1475
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:37,680
lamal uh but also like I don't know I've heard some people say that America and NATO kind of like

1476
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:45,680
sort of set this up on purpose I've heard some people say like uh no no no is is that I don't

1477
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:51,760
know if that's like some some nonsense what I've heard is that there are people simping for Russia

1478
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:58,000
because they've like this Russian propaganda that makes this invasion out to be like

1479
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:06,160
um like a necessary evil because of American encroachment or something NATO expansionism

1480
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:13,120
but like fundamentally Putin just wants this country to be part of his Russian empire and

1481
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:18,560
there's no like justification for that the people of Ukraine did not want it which is why there's a war

1482
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:24,800
and that's about as simple as it can get if if Ukraine wanted to be part of Russia

1483
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:30,240
then they could vote on it they could just you know they could do something about it but like

1484
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:36,480
they don't the democrat the the the democratic or democratically elected leader of Ukraine

1485
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:44,480
uh does not want to be part of Russia yeah and he was like voted in with a large majority

1486
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:51,040
and so as far as I see uh the invading to take back the like this land that used to be part of

1487
01:35:51,040 --> 01:36:02,000
the USSR has no justification beyond but I want it I it's mine I am the big Russian man I want it

1488
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:15,040
and it's like come on shut up you dumb fuck right yeah okay uh yeah I just uh you know I

1489
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:22,480
I that's mostly what I hear uh but like I you know haven't looked into it enough to have an informed

1490
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:30,160
opinion on why the like oh this is actually like NATO's fault thing people are are wrong or right

1491
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:37,520
or anything I just uh I mean NATO NATO is a coalition it's like a like an organization of

1492
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,920
countries nearby Russia who are scared of Russia and do not want to be invaded by Russia

1493
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:51,920
right and they are backed or like US is part of it um and I think people who just hate the US

1494
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:59,440
think that like the countries within NATO are like puppet states for the US and so they're like

1495
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:05,760
oh it's just the US meddling in European in European affairs when it's it's much more like

1496
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:12,960
these European countries would like to remain like themselves they don't want to be swallowed

1497
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,280
by Russia that's the whole reason they joined NATO and it was like a voluntary thing and they

1498
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,760
I don't know there's a lot there's a lot there's a lot to hear about it but like

1499
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:31,040
the the idea that these it's all the the US's fault and therefore Russian bombing

1500
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:39,520
and and killing civilians take over Ukraine is in any way justified is very strange

1501
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,720
and I don't really know where their heads at yeah because I haven't seen like any

1502
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:54,720
credible evidence of any kind that like what Russia is doing is uh good not that like like

1503
01:37:54,720 --> 01:38:00,320
you could say the US is meddling and maybe that's true but I haven't seen any evidence

1504
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:05,920
specifics but like let's say it's true Russia is still also doing a bad thing

1505
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:13,600
by meddling in Ukraine I think it would be better if neither the US nor Russia was trying to do it

1506
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:20,880
to do anything I see so it's like there's no there's no justification for the invasion even

1507
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:26,800
if America is being a sneaky beaky which is very likely because the US is a bit of a sneaky beaky

1508
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:33,440
all over the world we are we can be a bit of a sneaky beaky it's uh it's a well-known thing

1509
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:44,560
yeah uh okay that all makes that all seems cogent yeah uh I want to uh hey what are we gonna do

1510
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:53,040
about Spotify and Apple podcasts and stuff uh I don't know how to do it I Tom Tom does it

1511
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:58,080
we just got he's not we gotta he's just not he's just not answering me he just hasn't been around

1512
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:07,760
lately we just gotta go over there and get him out of his wheelchair kick him down and say where's

1513
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:15,920
the podcast and he'll say oh I'm making a video game instead I just uh I just I like I I've been

1514
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:22,640
up I've been uploading the the podcast to YouTube for the last few weeks which like you know

1515
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:30,160
it's okay I'm not complaining but like yeah I don't know how to do he had like a thing he had like

1516
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:39,120
a webhook uh rss thing set up that like I think it automatically did the uh like Spotify Apple

1517
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:46,320
podcasts uploads and stuff and I just I don't know how I don't think I even have access to that

1518
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:50,400
and I don't know how to use these uh platforms and I've never interacted with them I mean have

1519
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:57,680
you DM'd Tom about it I I haven't DM'd him but I've added him in the chat maybe he's more receptive

1520
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:05,120
to DMs I don't know maybe he has the chat he showed up or something he showed he showed up to uh oh

1521
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:12,480
he doesn't want to he doesn't want to talk about uh Spotify but he'll show up to he'll show up uh to

1522
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:20,640
when Jesse complains uh that's stupid uh but whatever I get I get I guess that's fine that's

1523
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:30,080
how you want to be um man just just uh just help just help just help me out Tom people keep asking

1524
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:36,800

1525
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:44,880
and I'm just like I don't I don't know how I don't know how to help with that uh

1526
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,680
I don't want to sound I don't want to sound like ungrateful or anything for like you know

1527
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:56,800
if it weren't for Tom uploading them to those other things then they just simply wouldn't be there

1528
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:04,000
yeah so I appreciate it and all but I can't you know I can't do it I mean I get I guess I could

1529
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:10,400
learn but I don't want to I don't want to figure I don't want to learn Spotify or Apple podcast or

1530
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:22,560
whatever uh well uh go into Elden Ring and invade him and kill him oh it's right that's the only

1531
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:28,640
that's the only way you gotta leave Elden Ring messages on the floor saying Spotify question

1532
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:38,800
yeah yeah you just gotta get soapstone messages or uh or whatever hmm it's uh it's you gotta add

1533
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:44,880
you gotta add him on Elden Ring it's the only social media he's using right now there now there's

1534
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:56,080
an idea hmm uh well yeah maybe I'll DM him about it uh might be a little could be helpful I don't know

1535
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:04,400

01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:29,440
I'll make a a kickstart a like update about that um uh and I hope you like it and I hope there's no

1539
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:38,720
problems in the postage I'm excited Ben you haven't given me your backer like uh mailing address

1540
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:46,080
stuff I don't think oh oh like on Kickstarter yeah do I have to respond to the survey yes I mean

1541

1545
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:23,280
log back into the log back into my old my Kickstarter account that I haven't uh looked at in a while

1546
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:35,440
all right uh yeah let's do uh let's do voicemails shall we huh yes okay um oh no I'm logged out of

1547
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:41,440
speakpipe uh you know I'll just post them in the chat okay because it just it just makes it easier

1548
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:49,680
because then I don't have to repost them for uh what's his name Eleazar Eleazar yeah yeah

1549
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:56,240
god I it's like I got the COVID brain fog today what the fuck you're just getting old Ben

1550
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:04,400
I'm actually got it yes I said you're getting amnesia is it co is it COVID brain fog

1551
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:11,200
I mean I didn't I didn't I didn't sleep like at all so maybe that's why but I feel it's

1552
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:21,680
worse than usual today oh god oh god you know I read an article man oh yeah I saw oh god yeah

1553
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:27,200
I had stopped thinking about it and then I saw an article about COVID brain damage

1554
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:34,880
and how like yeah it makes you stupider it damages your brain and it makes you stupider

1555
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:45,040
permanently I didn't get it well okay I guess I get permanently is I mean like you know who knows

1556
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:53,120
but they they did um they did tests right they tested people they did cognitive tests uh

1557
01:44:53,120 --> 01:45:00,000
on people like before and after uh you know infection and they did yes they did find a

1558
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:09,680
significant like change in performance in people afterwards but also did did they account for

1559
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:18,800
anti-vax status like what sorts of people are they okay I don't think it accounted for I think

1560
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:28,880
this was like pre vaccine right I think uh it it okay the worst cases like the worst cases of it

1561
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:36,240
showed like a they gave it in terms of like standard deviations of like you know a typical

1562
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,880
score on these tests you know it dropped like you know more than a standard deviation it I think

1563
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:48,960
it said that like the the effect was equivalent to about like seven IQ points uh in the most in the

1564
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:58,640
strongest cases um but on the other hand those were it did correlate like like how severe was your

1565
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:05,360
case to the effect like like it's it's like the effect was present even in people that

1566
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:11,440
had mild cases but it was like it was like much stronger it was it was stronger like the more

1567
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:16,800
severe your disease had been like like if you'd been hospitalized if you'd been in intensive care

1568
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,720
you know if you'd been put on a respirator you know the effect was stronger and all that

1569
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:27,600
so I mean I guess I guess I can take heart because my case was mild so if it was gonna happen

1570
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,840
it's probably a small effect and who knows you know some amount of it is probably not

1571
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:39,280
permanent anyway so maybe maybe I only lost two IQ points and I'll get one of them back I don't know

1572
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:50,080
you know yeah I mean whatever you can you can like grind free xp put those those IQ points back

1573
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:57,680
just take full time yeah yeah you know what you know what you're absolutely right that's exactly

1574
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:08,160
true and I don't have anything else to say about it okay anyway enough enough about that let's hear

1575
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:17,440
from the first voicemailer son of Marowak three two one let's jam given I played your demo it was

1576
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:23,280
awesome I really liked it yeah it's pretty good I collected all the uh those purple token things

1577
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:34,160
one bit of not criticism just please criticize I don't know what you'd call it uh there was a bit

1578
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:41,600
of um glitchy you like I could like I had to like reset my position because punk would just

1579
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:52,400
fall in place yeah this took place in the third the last like big room where you jumping around

1580
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:57,280
on the side point there are those two or three rocks that allow you to jump up to the highest

1581
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:08,880
platform yeah and I could not or um I uh got to a point where um was like cut in between uh the

1582
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:16,320
rocks and I couldn't jump because she was just stuck in place so figured if uh that helps you at

1583
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:22,880
all yes yes we we've looked at this uh the the hot fix that will be out or is soon to be out um we

1584
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:31,920
made a change where if you are stuck in the falling state and your position has not updated to anywhere

1585
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:36,960
significantly different the game will understand that you are stuck and you will you'll be able to

1586
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:43,200
land and you'll be you'll be able to land on that part and then from there you can jump away oh

1587
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:49,760
so we we fixed that that doesn't happen quite so much anymore really that's interesting so you can

1588
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:57,680
just so hmm that that kind of seems like that means that there's now a lot more places you can land

1589
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:04,800
um yeah maybe I mean a lot of the a lot of the geometry was just sort of like uh put it there

1590
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:10,240
whatever if people really want they can jump but it's not supposed to be there for jumping on

1591
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:17,600
um and it's fun to like not restrict the player um but like yeah like the actual level design

1592
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:23,360
we're probably gonna make it so that you can't sequence break quite so easily we're gonna like

1593
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:31,520
uh you know have like very not like super linear but like linear enough that you don't like skip

1594
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:38,480
most of the content of the level if you jump up to a certain platform um which can happen with

1595
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:43,680
with the thing you can jump over and skip a lot of stuff but that's not really a problem for the

1596
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:49,360
demo but getting stuck a lot yeah was definitely a thing so we've solved if you're infinitely

1597
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:56,720
being falling animation or or like sliding animation you you stand as long like after a few

1598
01:49:56,720 --> 01:50:03,280
seconds it'll recognize you as being stuck not moving and you're able to like being the landing

1599
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:09,200
state it will think of it as floor until you move away that you jump jump away and then

1600
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:16,080
it'll be normal again this was this was actually that was a thing actually you know what I forgot

1601
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:24,800
but I had a similar thing in the slime and punishment beta demo there was there was uh

1602
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:32,560
it was possible to it was possible to spend all your slime and all your potrons and just have no uh

1603
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:40,320
and just have no ability to do anything and you basically just couldn't take a turn uh so

1604
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:47,360
yeah and to resolve that I what I do I added the menu you can go to the menu and you can

1605
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:53,520
just restart you can just like quit uh that's sort of like the proof but oh but also there's now

1606
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:59,840
like option there's options in in there's menu options that don't require slime so even if you're

1607
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:05,280
out of slime I mean you can if you want you can just you can just dab you can just keep dabbing

1608
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:11,520
until you die I guess uh if you if you would prefer if you want to go out like a champ uh

1609
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:18,400
I mean you know obviously I couldn't you can't get rid of the I can't remove the ability to run

1610
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:24,720
out of slime because that's like a core mechanic so I was like well it was it wasn't it wasn't the

1611
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:29,360
fact that you could run out of slime and and be fucked like that's that's good that's a feature

1612
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:34,400
not a bug the the problem was that it would feel like oh well now I can't do anything and it's

1613
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:40,880
basically a soft lock uh it's not like it's not like I lost it's just like I cannot progress the

1614
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:49,040
game state uh yeah I think I mean you've already made the game but like a way to make that quicker

1615
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:57,840
would be like if you run out of slime you just die instantly uh I can you know I considered adding

1616
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:05,520
I considered adding a suicide command that would basically be identical to just going into the menu

1617
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:14,560
and restarting but it's I didn't do it because it seemed like uh it would just be I don't know

1618
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:19,200
I would have to do a bunch of work making like a whole new animation for it and adding it to the

1619
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:24,800
menu and all that stuff and it it just like kind of duplicates a function that already exists

1620
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:30,560
it's just a it's just a restart button which there already is one of those and I mean if you

1621
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:36,000
want to just kill yourself you can just you can just let yourself be killed you know it's not it's

1622
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:44,720
not it's not hard uh wait what fuck oh god brain fog covid covid's back what did you say what did

1623
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:52,000
you say what am I responding to oh my god I didn't say anything no from before that you said I said

1624
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,720
you said something you said once your slang goes to zero you could just die instantly and I would solve

1625
01:52:56,720 --> 01:53:03,520
that problem of of needing to wait for well for death like oh like if you try to attack with zero

1626
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:11,440
slime it just kills you something I bet yeah I mean in the in in endless war if you try to

1627
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:17,200
attack with zero slime it just you just don't so you know I was trying to duplicate the right

1628
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:24,240
the commands from that game so yeah so it's just you just get a little pop-up command it's like

1629
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:30,640
not enough slime to attack nope nope you can't fucking do that so let's can't fucking do it

1630
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:40,880
next one is called performance artists there it is uh three two one go one episode two nine one

1631
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:45,040
you all talked about whether dry dump December is after bringing up the possibility of it being

1632
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:49,680
performance art as well as the idea that aren't as anything intended to evoke an emotion in its

1633
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:55,600
viewers which got me thinking is bullying art it's a performance intended to evoke an emotion in

1634
01:53:55,600 --> 01:54:02,800
its audience you know you could say that somebody I would say bully someone very like there's an

1635
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:09,840
art to bullying if you want to get the the right emotion out of someone is is bullying intended

1636
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:18,000
to evoke a reaction in the victim or is bullying intended to invoke evoke a reaction in the bully

1637
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:27,840
I is it is it to make the bully feel good um I mean normally I feel like it's like the reaction

1638
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:35,120
does the job of making the bully feel good for being powerful or like putting someone else down

1639
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:42,880
right yeah yeah I think so it is for the bully's benefit that they do I think so or otherwise

1640
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:48,400
social clout you know people laughing at someone else makes them feel good I feel like you would

1641
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:56,480
bully there's no other reason yeah I feel like the point is not generally the point of bullying

1642
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:04,400
is not to evoke a a complexly nuanced feeling of self-hatred and poor and low self-esteem in a

1643
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:14,240
in a in a in an audience of one so to speak unless it's maybe it's art it's not yeah not about

1644
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:19,200
the feeling you evoke in the victim but about in like you know the people that see you bullying

1645
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:24,240
they think it's really funny like ha ha yeah that that nerd deserves this yeah you could you could

1646
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:32,160
do a performatively bullying thing yeah yeah virtue signaling they call it I don't know what that

1647
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:38,640
means what's the opposite of virtue uh vice vice signaling vice signaling vice signaling maybe

1648
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:46,320
look everyone goes whoa what a what a scowl scallywag what a what a rogue what a lovable rogue

1649
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:56,880
with a dark streak to him it's hot yeah that that's the my my art my art I'm an artist and my art

1650
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:02,880
and uh it exists to evoke a feeling in the audience that I am hot and that you should have sex with

1651
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:16,480
me uh it's it's avant garde um lamal okay next one is called uh vvv revelations to ben saint

1661
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:38,160
or maybe don't I don't know okay next next voicemail uh is called update on yig three two one go

1662
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:45,040
somebody asked trixie why did you take boy gazers off the main yig channel and she responded

1663
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:49,120
and I guess she didn't respond to it but someone else responded saying well you know it doesn't

1664
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:53,680
it doesn't really feel like it belongs on this channel or whatever you know it doesn't meet the

1665
01:57:54,080 --> 01:58:01,200
channel crazy basically meaning that you're right ben so uh yeah she's a fucking idiot of course I'm

1666
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:08,400
right I see yeah yeah uh doesn't doesn't fit doesn't fit the the direction of this channel which

1667
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:15,440
despite all that stuff I said for like a whole year uh is just anime videos now sorry just

1668
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:22,480
anime videos now never mind all that other stuff ha ha ha oops it always felt like like all of that

1669
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:29,040
stuff was clearly side channel content like new and interesting yeah like experimental content

1670
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:38,960
and and the the the digi bro the the digi nay the trixie uh main channel was always like the front

1671
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:45,440
facing the front of the store like this is where I get my viewers yeah of course and and but yeah

1672
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:50,480
of course you can't everybody but everybody told her that like bro this goes on the side channel

1673
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:56,960
this is side channel content what do you have a side channel for and I what was their logic it was

1674
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:03,600
like that's where all the viewers are so I'll put it it's yeah it's that they'll like it I guess yeah

1675
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:09,680
it's it's literally just it's like it's like a child logic it's like uh yeah it was like well I

1676
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:15,440
it's like I have more subs on the main channel though so more people will see it like okay

1677
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:21,280
okay like literally just like forgetting what the purpose of a side channel is

1678
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:29,600
subscribers are a harsh mistress it's true it's sad it's sad but true but not actually sad

1679
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:40,080
it's funny uh anyway uh there's a part two update on yig part two uh there it is three two one go

1680
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:47,920
and I say we make her do you an apology for being such a fucking tool

1681
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:57,360
yeah hey yeah why didn't anyone think of that yeah do uh uh what's the website where people

1682
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:04,560
write their signatures what change.org like oh yeah yeah yeah sort of change.org petition

1683
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:12,480
and have been uh Trixie apologized to Ben St. yes yes uh definitely uh you just need to get more

1684
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:20,560
signatures than she has subscribers get 300 000 uh signatures on that and I'm sure and I'm sure

1685
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:29,200
she will be and I'm sure she will see the error of her ways um it's okay no no hard feelings

1686
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,840
because uh I just got all her money I just got all her money that she would have made

1687
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:38,960
from being on the podcast it all just went to me instead and Gib I guess uh so you know

1688
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:49,360
water under the bridge that soothes the pain uh next next video is called uh

1689
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:58,560
Spooty Meng's Spooed Verse three two one go who is your favorite spider man

1690
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:08,160
and why is it noir noir I did is he is he one of the spider man in the spider verse the like

1691
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:16,320
oh I'm uh I'm red man noir uh literally red noir because he's red I mean there's a there is a

1692
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:23,680
black spider man right you see is that like spider noir I know I don't know the that's

1693
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:30,080
the miles morale miles tails prowl is no I mean I mean there's a I mean there's a spider man with

1694
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:36,960
like a black costume is that Miles does the did they give the black he's got a black costume okay

1695
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:42,480
okay I mean that's fine it looks cool it doesn't cool not as cool as Gwen though Gwen looks awesome

1696
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:48,960
spider Gwen's costume is so fucking cool yes we cannot we can all agree on that she's the best

1697
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:54,240
the best looking uh but if I had to actually pick my favorite spider man it would be the 60s spider

1698
02:01:54,240 --> 02:02:00,160
man from the 60s spider man tv show in color because it's so goofy looking and this one like

1699
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:06,160
a hundred thousand memes of that show oh the old one with like the them pointing at each other

1700
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:13,840
yeah that's where it's just the funniest he's just I just love him that's where the song came from

1701
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:20,240
right spider man I didn't know yeah maybe it's where it's from I it's probably the first spider man

1702
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:30,560
media that is has vision like audio so probably yeah yeah yeah probably um very funny uh yeah it's

1703
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:37,680
pretty good uh I guess I watched the tobey maguire movies or I watched like two of them and I I guess

1704
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:44,960
those were pretty good those are my close second tobey maguire spider man I don't think I've seen

1705
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:50,400
any other spider man movies than the tobey maguire like the first two tobey maguire ones

1706
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:56,800
saw the one with the goblin the one with doc ock oh you didn't see the third one where he does the

1707
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:04,000
funny like venom dance no I don't is venom in that one venom and sand man are in that one

1708
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:11,840
no I didn't see that one no so uh I've seen the the meme the scene of him like being all emo or

1709
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:20,400
whatever and like being all cocky yeah it's fun yeah yeah it seemed funny seemed funny

1710
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:25,120
seemed like one of those scenes seemed like a scene kind of like the laughing scene from

1711
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:31,040
final fantasy 10 that's awkward on purpose and like they clearly made it awkward on purpose

1712
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:36,800
but people point to it and laugh at it as though it's like awkward by accident you know what I mean

1713
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:44,480
uh I think so I feel like people make fun of that people made fun of that scene of tobey

1714
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:52,640
maguire like strutting around looking like quote unquote cool as though it's not obvious that he's

1715
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:58,560
meant to look like a doofus yeah to people yeah it's because of the way people react to him in the

1716
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:04,080
film is like oh they're embarrassed about what he's doing and he's like oh yeah it's like it's

1717
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:10,480
clearly not a good feeling that look I feel like I've seen people talk about like how the movie was

1718
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:17,040
cringe or that scene is cringe because like well it's supposed to be cringe I guess it's cringe

1719
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:22,560
that yeah like he's being cringy but he thinks he's not and that's the cringy part but not not

1720
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:28,960
from a filmmaking perspective I feel like I've seen people thinking that it's that it's that way by

1721
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:39,120
accident I don't know I think I like tobey maguire a lot because the peter parker nerd aspect of that

1722
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:46,560
performance is much more believable the other guy is like Andrew Garfield and the new guy

1723
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:53,520
tom holland they they look like pretty boys they look like like they're like they could be like

1724
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:59,840
jocks peter parker tobey maguire looks like a doofus and that's great he does look like a doofus

1725
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:04,080
a little bit I mean he's handsome he's handsome but like that the performance but he makes a he makes

1726
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:12,000
a goofy face yeah he's good at that he's good at looking like a goofy guy I mean that's a that's

1727
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:21,120

1791
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:17,800
everyone listens all the way to the end. Questionable. Next voicemail is called

1792
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:28,040
what the fuck Texas three two one go. Texas. Yeah it's about that Texas is past

1793
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:35,880
yeah a lot of some anti-trans legislation which is it like I think it

1794
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:43,840
mandates or at least makes it very much encouraged to out trans children to the

1795
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:51,240
authorities or to their parents if like a person at school teacher knows that

1796
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:56,000
they're trans they have to or a medical professional I it's some it's some

1797
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:06,600
bullshit to like get trans children like cured from their transness by parents who

1798
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:10,720
would want them to go to like conversion therapy camp you know that sort of a

1799
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:15,520
thing really stupid I haven't really looked into the specifics excellent but

1800
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:22,080
it is it is very like like explicitly anti-trans and there's nobody likes it I

1801
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:29,040
don't know how it my plan my plan is working perfectly I'm passing all this

1802
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:42,720
anti-trans legislation to kill Trixie the golden with in Texas oh fuck you mother fucker

1803
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:57,640
oh shit well better luck next time okay yeah I heard about that I also heard is

1804
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:02,520
this is it related to I think it's not just Texas but a bunch of states have

1805
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:08,920
passed up some quote-unquote don't say gay oh yeah something something like they're

1806
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:15,040
like like no books that have like gay people in them yeah it's it's like it's

1807
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:22,760
like state-approved like book burning of queer like yeah sure and and it's

1808
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:28,640
insane goddamn goddamn political correctness am I right goddamn cancel

1809
02:16:28,640 --> 02:16:34,480
culture strikes again am I right we got a fight cancel culture with am I right

1810
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:44,960
my fellow base base red-pilled disaffected liberals yeah that seems pretty

1811
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:56,880
bad yeah hopefully it doesn't happen oh no it's okay okay yeah everyone's fucked

1812
02:16:56,880 --> 02:17:02,840
up all right undo it but I don't all right anything hopefully hopefully they

1813
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:07,080
don't actually like like do it though hopefully they just kind of like I've

1814
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:11,840
seen at least one article of something bad happening as a result of the bill

1815
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:18,560
being passed already hmm I don't like it when bad things happen no no no no I'm

1816
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:25,360
I'm against those as a rule I I just want to but I just want to make my stance

1817
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:31,200
perfectly clear on bad things as a trans woman I think bad things are terrible

1818
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:37,200
terrible things are even worse as a cis man I acknowledge that bad things are

1819
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:48,520
terrible but but who am I to say really but but but but but nuclear war is actually

1820
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:57,320
very survivable when you you know yeah did you see that guy on Twitter there

1821
02:17:57,320 --> 02:18:01,080
was some guy on Twitter who had a thread about how like nuclear war is actually

1822
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:06,080
pretty survivable you just got to start preparing for it I guess he sorted

1823
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:10,360
there's sort of a point to be made there it's sort of true but also like to what

1824
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:17,800
end are you saying that I guess there is a certain there was a certain strain

1825
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:25,320
there was a certain strain of liberal at the moment that is hysterical over the

1826
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:30,800
Ukraine stuff to the point that they are like we should just we should just start

1827
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:34,960
nuclear war like we should just do nuclear war against Russia it's gonna it's

1828
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:39,280
gonna happen anyway why delay the inevitable we got to take them out like

1829
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:44,120
there's just no other solution I mean I agree that he should be taken out but

1830
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:51,080
like it's so much simpler to like keep the sanctions in place and let Russia

1831
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:56,880
just starve itself out of all its money because it's not like economically in a

1832
02:18:56,880 --> 02:19:02,000
very good position already yeah it could not the funny thing about like the

1833
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:09,440
the invasion is that it very much felt like Putin wanted to end it by just

1834
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:14,680
posturing and like bluffing about an invasion and hoping that they would back

1835
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:18,920
down and you know not talk with NATO Ukraine should not talk with NATO and

1836
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:24,360
if you do will invade and NATO was like a fuck you hey what are you doing and

1837
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:30,240
like Putin was like okay I've made the threat they've called my bluff I guess

1838
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:35,760
I'll just have to do the invasion and he's like the the initial invasion force

1839
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:42,440
was really under like prepared to go in yeah it feels like it was a bluff that

1840
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:49,360
just got out of hand I feel like we'll stop them more than actual like combat

1841
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:56,080
we don't need to start doing any of that stuff I watched I watched oh a video

1842
02:19:56,080 --> 02:20:02,440
another video by Patrick Boyle the finance guy he had a video about like

1843
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:09,120
sank the sanctions on Russia and about like yeah I guess they had he said that

1844
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:15,960
the war is costing them like 20 billion dollars a day and that like most of their

1845
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:21,520
money was in like overseas like most of Russia's like monetary assets were in

1846
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:26,640
like some of it was in Russia some of it was in China so that's safe from

1847
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:32,800
sanctions but like like two-thirds of it is like overseas and has now been frozen

1848
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:37,680
and they can't get it and they only have maybe like a few hundred billion

1849
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:46,080
dollars left yeah and like they just they just can't keep doing it unless they

1850
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:51,920
get some more money they'll keep like the the war going until they literally can't

1851
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:55,440
pay for it anymore they may take over Ukraine but they will not be able to

1852
02:20:55,440 --> 02:21:00,880
like hold it for any significant length of time to do anything I feel like they're

1853
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:07,280
going to like posture they're they're gonna threat like if you dare do

1854
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:14,160
anything we'll we got nukes you know and it's like oh shit they got nukes but

1855
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:19,600
like they do they do got nukes though they're gonna like run out of like money

1856
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:24,520
to launch the nukes they're gonna press the nuke button well there are no power

1857
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:31,360
left no like we can't we have no money to buy batteries to power the nuke

1858
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:36,760
launcher though it's it's like whether or not nukes are fired is really just

1859
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:41,200
down to whether Putin is like sane or not and we don't really know that but

1860
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:46,960
like in terms of like going to war with them like actually with our own stuff

1861
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:53,200
that would warrant nukes being used by Russia which would end the world

1862
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:58,960
wait like if we like if we use nukes on them you're saying that if we started using nukes or

1863
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:04,160
even just like missiles and Russia would have more of a reason to actually use their nukes

1864
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:10,000
but right now when they're just doing a little invasion it's just that you know we do a little

1865
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:14,000
we be doing a little invading little we do a little invading we do a little invading we do

1866
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:20,960
a little blowing up of civilian hospitals and stuff I mean I mean you gotta break a few eggs

1867
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:28,960
you gotta break a few eggs to kill a few chickens you know yes yes so but like nukes

1868
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:35,040
from Russia's perspective are such a wild like it's it's literally just a suicide button they

1869
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:43,280
would not add like advantage Russia in the the invasion they would just cause retaliation and

1870
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:49,280
world like apocalypse so like Putin would have to be actually insane to do a nuke

1871
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:57,280
unless he was being physically attacked by like an army in which case he might actually do it

1872
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:05,200
maybe so today's it seems like sensible responses just keep the sanctions on until he runs out of

1873
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:16,240
money I mean until he until he retreats that is boy gosh I mean damn though like can you imagine if

1874
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:24,640
they just started firing nukes like can you fucking imagine I could imagine I guess I probably would

1875
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:33,200
be dead very soon after I hear about it because I do you think London might be a target London

1876
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:42,000
yeah London might be a target I mean I mean I mean you know I'm a bit it's a bit uh I guess

1877
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:47,920
it depends on like what kind of bomb it is I wonder about this like like if they nuked

1878
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:52,880
Boston like am I like close enough to this to the center of the city that like I would be

1879
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:59,600
would I be vaporized would I be like you know would I get a would I get fall out like what

1880
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:07,520
what would the impact on me be the uh for instance Boston was nuked I watched a video in my recommendations

1881
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:13,360
the curse cuz I video about what if you were nuked yeah it was years old so it was like everyone

1882
02:24:13,360 --> 02:24:16,800
damn that's what I want to know that's exactly what I want to know is you watch that video

1883
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:23,280
yeah I mean fine it's it's it's graphic but it's like informative so you will you will learn uh

1884
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:30,640
what I mean because I know because I like it's like it's not like everybody in uh you know uh

1885
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:38,160
Hiroshima and Nagasaki like died I mean a lot of people did but like a lot of the city was just

1886
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:45,600
was like damaged but it wasn't it wasn't like completely like craterized you know no I mean

1887
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:51,120
there's a part in the middle where you will be turned to atoms and after that yeah there's like the

1888
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:57,440
wind uh the air pressure would like knock houses down and then the mushroom cloud would go up and

1889
02:24:57,440 --> 02:25:04,480
then the wind would be sucked back in so another like shock wave would go back and then also before

1890
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:09,840
the wind there would be like a heat wave so things that could catch on fire within a large

1891
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:16,240
radius would just spontaneously catch fire you might not die from that but like your skin would

1892
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:23,600
burn like in like a like a sunburn like instantly Jesus and then after that there would be there

1893
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:28,560
would potentially catch fire that would burn your skin right it would burn your skin it would be

1894
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:35,920
your clothes would be on fire um Jesus Christ it's like a it's a nightmare and then after that um

1895
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:44,400
there would be very little potential for aid for a very long time after like all of the because

1896
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:49,760
you can't get not because of that I mean infrastructure would be damaged a roads would

1897
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:55,440
be blocked people would be trying to get like um and helicopters can't really come any can't really

1898
02:25:55,440 --> 02:26:01,520
get that close for a while so you would have to like walk out of the city you mean for like days

1899
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:07,920
uh could be days could be months I mean I can't remember exactly what they say but watch the

1900
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:15,680
video it's it's good and scary maybe I will yeah maybe I will uh I feel like if London the center

1901
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:21,760
London was nuked I would not be hit because I'm in the suburbs but I would definitely uh probably

1902
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:28,720
get radiation poisoning afterwards and everything would be terrible forever hold on let me see

1903
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:36,080
let me just uh I'm just I'm just curious I'm gonna see like how far am I how far am I from like the

1904
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:42,640
the center of downtown Boston let me just let me just get a quick uh quick uh quick idea here

1905
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:49,200
okay uh where am I type my address in here

1906
02:26:52,080 --> 02:27:01,600
uh two that's 2 000 feet that's one mile that's that's okay I'm maybe like

1907
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:09,520
I'm maybe like four miles like three or four miles out from like central downtown Boston

1908
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:16,160
I don't know what do you think that means for my odds I can't remember the the the

1909
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:24,240
the thing in the video what are they what was that like a radius of about they yeah they don't

1910
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:29,920
put it on screen they talk about it like they say of a radius of about something something

1911
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:37,120
miles would be this then this radius would be even it would be radiation there would be like

1912
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:45,760
black rain black like toxic rain I think can happen like in like s uh rose grim dark when she

1913
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:54,160
gets the in Homestuck and and it's like it's the toxic particles from the explosion radioactive

1914
02:27:54,160 --> 02:28:00,560
would get turned into like sooty like black rain which would come down and just you know

1915
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:06,000
infect you with radiation it would be terrible reading yeah I was reading like

1916
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:12,240
I did read a little I think it was like a government uh instruction thing about like

1917
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:18,880
what to do if they're if a nuke happens and they said like number one like get inside

1918
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:25,520
stay inside if you were outside uh first thing to do take your clothes off get rid of your clothes

1919
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:30,320
wash your clothes take a shower get any like residue off of you it's like a priority number one

1920
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:37,120
yeah uh assuming that like water mains have not been burst and you actually have water

1921
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:46,080
yeah true yeah true uh geez that is actually kind of a big if now that you mention it it's it's like

1922
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:52,720
the the the the damage to infrastructure is not just like the roads will be inaccessible it's like

1923
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:59,680
power will be out water might be not running and people might like die of thirst before anything

1924
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:05,120
else jeez if they're stuck in a city in between like in rubble and and all that

1925
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:12,400
you got to be very far away from a nuke to not instantly feel the effects

1926
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:23,600
that's hold on how far is safe from a nuke how far is safe from a nuclear bomb the moon

1927
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:33,840
okay damage zones after a nuclear oh god oh hey no this is great this is not great

1928
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:41,120
oh this is no this is lovely no this is one well uh well actually

1929
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:48,720
no here this is what i wanted check check check check check check this shit out check this shit out

1930
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:58,000
i'm checking it here i posted it uh okay so it depends on the kilotonnage of the of the the um

1931
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:06,320
the payload obviously so for a 10 looks like for a 10 kiloton bomb i would be

1932
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:11,440
i would be nukes or just bonds

1933
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:19,840
uh well i mean this is from a website for uh damage zones after damage zones after a nuclear

1934
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:24,960
here i'll post the website damage zones after a nuclear detonation idealize maps

1935
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:35,680
so yeah for a 10 kiloton bomb i would be either in the light damage zone or just maybe just

1936
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:43,680
out outside of it that would be on the like on the periphery of that that that coveted light

1937
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:54,080
damage zone baby why is all right i'm trying to find sites and they're like saying um you can't

1938
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:57,920
read our site we don't want you to so i left

1939
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:08,880
wait i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna do oh you you get pay walled not pay walled it was just

1940
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:15,040
sort of like uh we're just we're just being stupid right now uh okay hold on i'm gonna

1941
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:22,560
i'm gonna i'm gonna find out exactly i'm gonna find out exactly how uh how far this is this is

1942
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:30,000
gonna be great yeah i'm about three i'm like three and three quarter miles three almost four

1943
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:37,920
miles so i'm like right on the outer edge of a the periphery of a 10 kiloton light damage zone so

1944
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:48,880
i'm good light light light damage who cares about all that all that might happen is like all your

1945
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:56,640
windows will explode that ain't nothing okay okay let's hear it light damage zone are you are you

1946
02:31:56,640 --> 02:32:01,680
reading uh what it's describing here let me let me go to the here i'll read it out loud light

1947
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:07,040
damage zone damage is caused by shocks similar to those produced by a thunderclap or sonic boom

1948
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:12,880
but with much more force although some windows may be broken over 10 miles away the injury associated

1949
02:32:12,880 --> 02:32:21,040
with flying glass will generally occur at over pressures above 0.5 psi what this damage may correspond

1950
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:29,360
to a distance of about three miles from ground zero okay so maybe there could be some injury from

1951
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:34,720
broken glass from ground zero for a 10 kiloton nuclear explosion damage in this area will be

1952
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:39,040
highly variable as shock waves rebound multiple times off of buildings the terrain and even the

1953
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:43,920
atmosphere as a responder moves inwards windows and doors will be blown in and gutters window

1954
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:47,520
shutters roofs lightly constructed buildings will have increasing damage litter and rebel will

1955
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:51,440
increasingly move towards ground zero there will be increasing number of stalled and crashed

1956
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:55,840
automobiles that will make emergency vehicle passage difficult blast over pressures that

1957
02:32:55,840 --> 02:33:01,360
characterize the light damage zone are calculated about 0.5 at psi at the outer boundary this is

1958
02:33:01,360 --> 02:33:06,640
not that descriptive all it's just saying is that yeah maybe some windows will be broken

1959
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:12,640
probably not many but yeah no shit more windows will be broken as you move closer to the damage

1960
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:17,440
zone thanks for explaining that for me just pre-break your windows

1961
02:33:20,320 --> 02:33:22,720
so yeah might have some broken windows

1962
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:33,360
but would there be fallout it might depend on like the wind like it might depend on like the

1963
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:38,880
way the wind is blowing I mean there was a little bit of a scare earlier about Chernobyl

1964
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:48,160
because Russia like took Chernobyl area and like Chernobyl like spread when it when it

1965
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:54,720
melted down you know way back when that happened like it was like radioactive dust

1966
02:33:55,440 --> 02:34:00,800
flew all over Europe and that was just that was just a power plant that wasn't even a bomb

1967
02:34:00,800 --> 02:34:10,320
yeah so like the dust from a bomb a nuclear explosion in Boston depending on on how nukes

1968
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:16,960
spread that around I would imagine the dust would spread all over the US depending on wind patterns

1969
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:25,120
and then yeah I mean all over the east coast probably yeah hmm no I'm sure it wouldn't cause

1970
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:37,680
any problems no it'd be fine talk about 9-11 talk about uh this would be this would be way cooler

1971
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:46,400
than 9-11 if they knew if they knew this is depressing uh I mean they're probably not I mean

1972
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:51,600
they're probably not gonna do that they're probably not but like we can't know that until the future

1973
02:34:52,320 --> 02:34:57,200
they're probably there's probably not gonna be nuclear war you know probably not an

1974
02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:04,320
gonna be nuclear war if there was I feel like Boston is not the highest priority target like

1975
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:09,680
what are the odds they would target Boston out of all places I mean probably not the highest

1976
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:16,240
not the lowest either it's probably like maybe eighth or ninth down the list

1977
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:25,360
Washington DC New York City uh Los Angeles probably not that's more of an entertainment hub than

1978
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:31,360
anything else uh I guess well actually I mean if they're going for the east coast

1979
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:39,040
actually Boston would probably be like yeah pretty high up on the list but why would they go for

1980
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:47,280
the east coast why not the west coast um okay well the thing I think about is like

1981
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:55,440
there's there's no use worrying in your day-to-day about nuclear Armageddon because

1982
02:35:56,320 --> 02:36:04,000
uh like I I don't think you could really do anything about it you could you could maybe prep

1983
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:11,920
for it I guess you could fill your bathtub with water then slurp it out when when the time comes

1984
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:22,720
I'm I mean yeah that's right that's correct I don't know it's not to like act like it's not

1985
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:31,280
going to happen but to not like stress out over it because yeah I mean maybe it'll be sure I mean

1986
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:33,440
I can't do anything about it

1987
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:43,280
I don't know I don't know okay well I feel like we've covered this

1988
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:47,920
I feel like we've said all there is to be said about nuclear Armageddon

1989
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:57,040
the PCP is your premier source of news and in fact you don't need any other coverage

1990
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:05,920
than what we offer you right here uh the next next uh voicemail oh sorry I skipped one whatever

1991
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:14,000
this one's called farmers have no standards three two one go dudes if you want to have like confirmation

1992
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:19,600
that kiwi farmers have no moral standards then look no further it's been saying its own thread

1993
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:24,000
people are literally defending Trixie over the fact that Ben is profiting off the blue rays

1994
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:29,760
therefore her work and clearly avoiding the fact that she's spent like half a decade procrastinating

1995
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:34,480
on making the blue rays and failed delivery on other quick start of promises yeah pretty wicked

1996
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:39,840
stuff so continue to buy more blue rays off of Ben when Trixie fun weeks through mode it'd be totally

1997
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:48,480
hilarious the the yeah kiwi farms will it's funny because obviously like in Trixie's thread

1998
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:56,560
they hate Trixie they'll say whatever they'll say mean things but then in in my thread which

1999
02:37:56,560 --> 02:38:03,600
has not updated in a while it's been dead for like quite a while uh but yeah like it in any given

2000
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:10,160
person's thread they'll just say they'll say bad things about so-and-so and they'll do they'll do

2001
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:15,440
they'll do whatever they have to do they'll praise whoever else they they need to in order to make

2002
02:38:15,440 --> 02:38:21,440
the person that they're here to hate on look bad they they'll just they're just there to hate uh

2003
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:30,720
which is you know i guess that's more like wiwi farms more you know i'm glad somebody said

2004
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:42,320

with their their husband or whatever some people talk about that all the time

2052
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:22,800
um can you imagine i well i guess so but uh wouldn't be that much to imagine i don't

2053
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:28,000
know why i would bother imagining it i just um just glad i don't have i'm just glad i don't

don't have to uh worry about like another like what another person's doing or what they're eating

2057
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:52,560
or what just for instance what they're eating i just have my shit in the fridge and i just go

2058
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:57,520
to the fridge and i eat it and i don't have to think about anything else i have no other considerations

2059
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:06,160
and that's good that's how i like it uh so that's what i think about dating

2060
02:45:06,880 --> 02:45:12,320
uh the food the food the food concerns are just too pressing i can't deal with it

2061
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:22,560
um dating is a scary um yeah i don't feel like i uh i'm cool

2062
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:29,680
women therefore bad women are bad and they should they should leave me alone

2063
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:36,480
uh that was a joke uh that was joke that's just i'm not actually

2066
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:57,040
and i'm just making it even worse for you uh i i shit is there anything else to say about that

2067
02:45:57,040 --> 02:46:05,680
i don't know uh what's the app tinder i hate it that's my opinion on dating just makes me sad

2068
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:09,920
just makes me depressed looking through that i haven't i haven't looked at it in a while you know

2069
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:15,040
i have like i have like a shit i think i might have had like a renewed a subscription to it or

2070
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:21,040
whatever uh this past year without even noticing because i just wasn't paying attention uh i have

2071
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:31,200
like that i haven't looked at it in a long time uh there was a time when i used it a few years ago

2072
02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:39,840
to pretty decent success and then i don't i don't know if i changed or the app changed

2073
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:49,200
but then like i tried using it again uh maybe a year or two ago and it was like total total

2074
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:56,960
failure like i definitely heard of like like because the whole point of their business model

2075
02:46:56,960 --> 02:47:03,920
is that people are lonely and they stay alone so you have to pay out the ass to get like actual

2076
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:10,800
matches um yeah and they've just increased that aspect of the app more and more well i well i did

2077
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:16,560
like okay i'll say it yeah i did i remember you did but like like have you did that was the last

2078
02:47:16,560 --> 02:47:21,440
time you did it were you paying that was the yeah the last no the first time when i was using it for

2079
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:28,240
free it was when it worked oh and it was fine yeah and then two years two years ago i put some money

2080
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:33,760
about two years or something like that i put some money into it whatever i got like a premium membership

2081
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:40,000
i i got some super likes or whatever whatever bullshit i think i paid like maybe 70 for like a

2082
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:46,320
year subscription or something you know whatever yeah pretty lame but whatever i did it uh and

2083
02:47:46,320 --> 02:47:53,920
it just it just i just i just i think i got nothing and it's just and it uh and i was just uh

2084
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:58,560
i swear it used to work i swear i used to get results on it and then the site when i went

2085
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:05,440
back to it just nothing just i don't know i have no i don't know why i have no again i don't know

2086
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:13,440

2087
02:48:13,440 --> 02:48:19,280
my fault um yeah i don't know i don't know about that anyway i haven't thought anyway that was

02:55:06,560 --> 02:55:15,040
yeah uh i think uh probably not streaming ever is probably a big mistake for me because like

2144
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:21,520
you know sometimes people would watch it and sometimes people would get excited and sometimes

2145
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:27,520
people would do things like pledge me some money or buy me a mini fridge uh and that was pretty crazy

2146
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:35,120
i feel like by i feel like i might gain here's it's like like 80 20 rule i feel like maybe i would

2147
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:42,800
gain you know 80 percent of the benefits of streaming if i streamed maybe 20 percent as much

2148
02:55:42,800 --> 02:55:48,240
like me if i just maybe did a stream like once a month maybe people would appreciate it yeah of

2149
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:54,240
course whereas so it's probably it's probably stupid that i that i never do it like on my channel

2150
02:55:55,120 --> 02:56:02,720
i mean when i when i stream a lot of the time i don't really know what to play yeah and then

2151
02:56:02,720 --> 02:56:08,640
i'm doing it and i'm like oh there's technical problems oh it's it's oh i don't know what to

2152
02:56:08,640 --> 02:56:14,800
say it's like it's it's not always some part of it feels like it could be nice and and relaxing

2153
02:56:14,800 --> 02:56:20,640
and just chilling out but i get i get a little worked up about like people enjoying it or not

2154
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:27,920
when i really shouldn't yeah probably just enjoy yourself and then people will

2155
02:56:29,200 --> 02:56:34,880
hopefully enjoy it as well along with you i mean no noida is like the only game that i play anymore

2156
02:56:34,880 --> 02:56:40,960
like the these days uh so i mean i guess i was gonna stream a game it would probably just be

2157
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:47,520
yeah i've been playing like Animal Crossing Pocket Camp which is a mobile game it's not something

2158
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:53,040
to stream not that i would figure out i would know how to stream it from my phone and then the other

2159
02:56:53,040 --> 02:57:00,160
thing i've been filling my time with is solitaire online and it's like what a stupid set of things

2160
02:57:00,160 --> 02:57:06,560
that i'm constantly doing uh surely i surely could be playing like some cool thing for people to

2161
02:57:06,560 --> 02:57:15,280
talk about possibly possibly i should never feel like we'll never know we'll never know yeah um

2162
02:57:18,960 --> 02:57:26,800
i i don't know maybe i'll change my life around in some way after i finish slime and punishment

2163
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:36,240
or maybe not guess we'll see uh anyway next voicemail is called gib good wow

2164
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:45,440
three wow three two one go so anyway it's kind of unfair that bin gets all the attention gib

2165
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:51,920
you are cutie and that game demo is pretty pog thanks always wanted to chuck useless liberal

2166
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:57,280
zoomers with their iPhones at collectibles as anarcho communist spitting literal fire

2167
02:57:57,280 --> 02:58:06,080
you fulfilled my childhood dream thank you hell yeah you're welcome this reminds me uh i meant

2168
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:13,120
i'm curious i was curious i was gonna say this after uh the first voicemail from uh marowak

2169
02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:21,120
uh about collecting all the fairy bits how i wonder how long it takes most people i feel

2170
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:28,000
like as i was looking for those last bits a long time i feel like i was dumb the last bits that i

2171
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:34,560
found it took me about two hours to get the last ones and the last ones that i found were in a cave

2172
02:58:34,640 --> 02:58:38,880
that were at the beginning they were near the beginning of the game so i had you said that

2173
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:44,640
yeah i had missed an early secret and then i just it took me a long time to go back and fit and find

2174
02:58:44,640 --> 02:58:50,880
it again because i had those like so i yeah i've been i've been looking at like people's playthroughs

2175
02:58:50,880 --> 02:58:56,960
and and stuff if you by the way if anyone wants to like record a video uh playing the game i will

2176
02:58:56,960 --> 02:59:02,480
watch it because i need to know what people like tend to do when they're playing the game for the

2177
02:59:02,480 --> 02:59:09,680
first time uh good good good research potentially yeah yeah for sure because a lot of people do see

2178
02:59:09,680 --> 02:59:16,000
that after a second um but some people do just what past it it is sort of you mean that secret

2179
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:26,000
that secret yeah i completely completely didn't even notice any damn thing she's gotta be super

2180
02:59:26,080 --> 02:59:33,040
smart that's what you gotta do unfortunately gib the the covid brain fog reduced my iq point by

2181
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:40,400
exactly the one point that made the difference unfortunately it uh yeah i failed my uh my spot

2182
02:59:40,400 --> 02:59:54,720
check well this game is not for you there's no easy mode no i lost i lost the game i mean i i beat it

2183
02:59:54,720 --> 03:00:02,080
but i i beat it like bad so i lost the way to the way to lose the game is to beat it oh i didn't

2184
03:00:02,080 --> 03:00:08,560
find the last lizard or no there's more lizards there's more lizards there's more lizards than the

2185

sometimes it can be sometimes it's uh i would say that i sometimes accidentally without really

2230
03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:18,000
thinking default to they them um for for for trans women um yeah not because you know of any of like

2231

2232
03:06:26,080 --> 03:06:32,480
them like for people normally anyway but when it's a trans woman you should make an effort to not use

2233
03:06:32,480 --> 03:06:38,720
they them and instead use the or trans anyone i mean if you use it for everybody like like

2234
03:06:38,720 --> 03:06:44,240
i think it's if you use she she her he him whatever i mean if you i mean if you use if you're using

yeah when they don't want to say when when you when you know it's sus when you know that they know

2238
03:07:06,960 --> 03:07:12,400
that this person is a she and you and it seems like they're deliberately not saying yeah there's

2239
03:07:12,400 --> 03:07:18,640
you just say it once it's fine but like yeah it's not it's not it's not sus it's not sus in and of

no they okay but they are actually it's low it's low-carb uh it's low-carb tortillas okay it's just

2262
03:10:01,280 --> 03:10:06,640
it's just that i'm not eating them specifically because they're low-carb it i'm eating them because

2263
03:10:06,640 --> 03:10:12,800
they are low calorie as well it's like 40 calories per wrap which is like it's nothing it's nothing

your mind all right look at this i bought some of these just because i was like i guess i'll try

2279
03:12:09,360 --> 03:12:16,400
him and just see what they're about this is from a company called dream pop plant-based dream bites

2280
03:12:17,360 --> 03:12:22,960
right yeah dream pop makes dream bites they dream pops are like a popsicle version of these

2281
03:12:22,960 --> 03:12:29,440
these are like a chocolate covered you know a little all right as you can see they don't call it corn

2282
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:36,080
as you can see they don't call it uh ice cream they call it frozen dessert because it's plant-based

2283
03:12:36,080 --> 03:12:43,920
so you know whatever that's fine um i bought a cup of these these cost the same these cost

2284
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:50,160
these are like five bucks for this cup it looks like it's a pint of ice cream it's not the cup is

2285
03:12:50,160 --> 03:12:57,120
small and it's like mostly air it's full of air there's only like a dozen of these fucking little

2286
03:12:57,120 --> 03:13:02,240
things in them and they're smaller than they look on the box and the final thing you see how look at

2287
03:13:02,240 --> 03:13:08,960
their shape they've got that crazy d20 ice isohedron shape well they don't fucking look like that

2288
03:13:08,960 --> 03:13:16,160
they're just little like rectangular blobs it's it's not even close and i'm like it doesn't like

2289
03:13:17,360 --> 03:13:24,640
man i was so mad i was so mad at these it was all air it was all fucking air they didn't even

2290
03:13:24,640 --> 03:13:32,560
fill the fucking cup it's not a flex that your cup of ice cream is only 300 calories when there's

2291
03:13:32,560 --> 03:13:41,040
no fucking ice cream in it bro when it's just empty dog you have not made a low calorie product

2292
03:13:41,040 --> 03:13:49,200
you have simply sold me very little products they got you they got me they tasted all right

2293
03:13:50,080 --> 03:13:55,200
they tasted pretty decent even there just wasn't there well this wasn't very much of it although

2294
03:13:55,200 --> 03:14:02,160
i will say it was kind of tart the like berry uh frozen dessert inside was kind of tart it was

2295
03:14:02,160 --> 03:14:07,760
nice with the chocolate i think the berry flavor is probably the only one that seems good because

2296
03:14:08,480 --> 03:14:15,440
i think that's sort of like sorbet flavor would be really weird with the other flavors that they

2297
03:14:15,440 --> 03:14:21,920
offer which is a birthday cake vanilla and a cookie dough i don't know i don't think that would work

2298
03:14:21,920 --> 03:14:29,760
as well with like the sorbet kind of kind of texture okay that's my that's what i have to say

2299
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:38,800
about dream bites i would not recommend them uh no when i say dream bites i'm talking about the

2300
03:14:38,800 --> 03:14:50,240
youtuber and i don't like him is that a youtuber do you not remember dream oh yeah no yeah no yeah

2301
03:14:50,240 --> 03:15:02,000
i remember the minecraft guy he was bad he cheated at minecraft he cheated in a speed run and that's

2302
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:11,440
bad that's bad the thing about him is is that that that animation he made where he like he he

2303
03:15:11,440 --> 03:15:16,080
treated the animators really badly and like forced them to crunch to get it finished and it looks

2304
03:15:16,080 --> 03:15:23,360
really weird yeah and he throws his weight around like he's some big hot shot because he's a big

2305
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:30,640
subscriber he's got big subscriber uh what is it adam from why adam yms said he thinks dream

2306
03:15:30,640 --> 03:15:37,120
seems like a pathological liar and uh i think that sounds that's that rings true and i don't

2307
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:42,320
see any reason not to believe that so uh i'm just gonna go with that yeah he seems like a psychopath

2308
03:15:43,280 --> 03:15:56,400
uh yeah uh fuck him uh next voicemail is called was the last one did we play the last one no we

2309
03:15:56,400 --> 03:16:06,320
didn't uh 79 it's called ben sains first album three two one go ben you have an amazing voice

2310
03:16:06,560 --> 03:16:12,400
you should make an album sing all your favorite songs or hell just do originals

2311
03:16:15,120 --> 03:16:21,040
ben sains sings the hits i would like i would like to uh i would like to be like a singer

2312
03:16:21,840 --> 03:16:27,120
i think i would like to maybe be in like a band i think that would be cool but i would want to sing

2313
03:16:28,320 --> 03:16:34,080
and i don't really play any instruments very well i mean i guess i could figure it out i play

2314
03:16:34,080 --> 03:16:38,560
instruments we could start a band but i wouldn't want

2315
03:16:41,200 --> 03:16:46,560
i would want to do gigs i don't know no i say that out loud but now i think about it

2316
03:16:46,560 --> 03:16:50,800
i was like oh but it'd be so embarrassing what if we weren't good what if it wasn't good

2317
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:59,280
what if we bombed oh no oh no it's a nice idea and i could enjoy it but like

2318
03:16:59,280 --> 03:17:07,840
i'd have to be really proud of the of the of the art that i was displaying you know i wouldn't

2319
03:17:07,840 --> 03:17:17,440
just do it like with you know i wouldn't just do it like randomly that sucks well how else do you

2320
03:17:17,440 --> 03:17:24,240
do it i don't know i'm kind of talking myself out of it now uh sometimes it seems like something

2321
03:17:24,320 --> 03:17:30,480
i'd like to do but uh also i don't know if i have the commitment to such a thing to actually

2322
03:17:30,480 --> 03:17:35,200
go through with it and i mean how would i even how would you even do it anyway uh

2323
03:17:36,800 --> 03:17:44,240
you go up to a venue and you say i got a band or can we play at the thing yeah sure sure

2324
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:50,320
but how do you get a band uh you talk to a person you go up to a person who's uh

2325
03:17:51,280 --> 03:17:55,440
standing around you say do you play an instrument do you play an instrument and eventually you'll

2326
03:17:55,440 --> 03:18:01,760
find would you would you like to play a company for accompaniment for me the star the lead singer

2327
03:18:01,760 --> 03:18:05,520
who does nothing else you write the songs and i'll just perform them thanks

2328
03:18:07,840 --> 03:18:14,800
yeah okay i knew you would like that thank you let's do it i guess i guess you just go to places

2329
03:18:14,800 --> 03:18:22,080
like open open mic nights and talk to the participants and if people say hey that was

2330
03:18:22,080 --> 03:18:29,120
really really good what you did there you do like a karaoke i'm looking for a singer in my band

2331
03:18:31,600 --> 03:18:35,280
i don't know if you know i don't know if i'm good enough i don't know if i'm a good enough

2332
03:18:35,280 --> 03:18:41,520
singer to be like a singer in a band i don't know if i have like those chops like i think i'm okay

2333
03:18:41,600 --> 03:18:47,600
but i think i'm i'm not like i'm i'm i'm okay and i don't know if that really cuts the mustard

2334
03:18:48,480 --> 03:18:56,160
uh i i then again i guess a lot of vocalists are not actually great singers you know you don't

2335
03:18:56,160 --> 03:19:04,640
necessarily you don't necessarily have to be a great singer to to be a you know i mean a to vocalize

2336
03:19:04,640 --> 03:19:12,080
a song that people like i mean famously like freddy milk mercury doesn't really have that much of

2337
03:19:12,080 --> 03:19:17,280
like a range but he's he's so good at what he does that it and it works really well for queen

2338
03:19:18,240 --> 03:19:23,600
yeah yeah i guess is that true about freddy i didn't know that but like you know i remember

2339
03:19:23,600 --> 03:19:29,280
hearing that and i guess i just believed it so maybe i'm talking out of my a s it could it could

2340
03:19:29,280 --> 03:19:33,920
be true i don't i don't know i've never i've never heard anyone say that about freddy but like maybe

2341
03:19:33,920 --> 03:19:40,800
like he's he's great and it's like i think it was some sort of singing maybe it's not range

2342
03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:46,800
i'm talking about but like in terms of like singing skill i don't know how you measure that you know

2343
03:19:46,800 --> 03:19:54,640
what yeah it's not a diss freddy mercury sounds great um i guess a better example is like uh what's

2344
03:19:54,640 --> 03:20:04,720
his face from the fucking oh ac dc oh yeah he sounds like a screeker screecher but like it works

2345
03:20:04,720 --> 03:20:12,320
so well for ac dc who's who's the i mean young or is that the other guy i don't know a lot of the

2346
03:20:12,320 --> 03:20:18,400
music lore that i know i got from a tot in the shadows videos i'm thinking of like the guy who's

2347
03:20:18,400 --> 03:20:28,320
saying um eve of destruction like that guy kind of sucks but he had a hit uh like his his voice

2348
03:20:28,320 --> 03:20:35,200
is kind of bad um same with um oh who's the guy is it bob dillon like bob dillon doesn't really

2349
03:20:35,200 --> 03:20:41,280
have much of a like his voice yeah he's a he's a songwriter more so than he is like a vocal man

2350
03:20:41,280 --> 03:20:47,680
but yeah writes really good songs right yeah you don't need to be good at anything to do

2351
03:20:47,680 --> 03:20:54,880
everything exactly that's that's my whole career in a nutshell i like i realized one day i don't

2352
03:20:54,880 --> 03:21:00,080
actually have to be good at anything just do shit and i hope it works out and you know what it did

2353
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:11,920
it was true um well okay uh next next voicemail is called is this uh yes clearing something up

2354
03:21:12,640 --> 03:21:20,000
we have like maybe six or seven left i think oh my god uh we got yeah we got like seven left

2355
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:28,320
okay oh i posted it twice okay clearing something up three two one go hey guys just clearing something

2356
03:21:28,320 --> 03:21:35,200
up here there's nothing you know last week when i said uke studio is dead i meant like trixie or riley

2357
03:21:35,200 --> 03:21:40,000
i meant like they're literally dead so all these shitty new content like i killed them basically

2358
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:48,000
kill the channel i just meant like that's the idea is dead okay okay fair enough um no i meant i

2359
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:55,680
meant i literally murdered them um next one is called the gen nine fire starter is based on a red pepper

2360
03:21:55,680 --> 03:21:57,040
three two one go

2361
03:22:00,400 --> 03:22:07,680
okay uh yeah yeah i get yeah i guess i i see i didn't realize it at first but yeah it i see it

2362
03:22:07,680 --> 03:22:14,480
it may it still makes me wonder if he's gonna be like fire grass type but i don't know people have

2363
03:22:14,480 --> 03:22:21,840
said fire ghost because ghost pepper yeah yeah that would be that would be amusing i suppose

2364
03:22:21,840 --> 03:22:28,080
i haven't done that before fire ghost yeah that'd be pretty cool um and that would mean like one of

2365
03:22:28,080 --> 03:22:34,000
the other starters would be something psychic or something dark i mean maybe people have said

2366
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:40,800
that um the cat will be grass fairy which would be pretty cool yeah yeah is there already a grass

2367
03:22:40,800 --> 03:22:47,440
fairy pretty sure there must be some i mean so lots of fairy types look like they're grass

2368
03:22:47,520 --> 03:22:54,560
type oh whimsicott yeah whimsicott is grass fairy um i like whimsicott uh

2369
03:22:56,880 --> 03:23:05,200
and uh you know i think uh was it um was it was it izzy's tweeted that um

2370
03:23:06,720 --> 03:23:13,600
the yeah red ghost pepper guy disproves the zodiac theory but like

2371
03:23:14,320 --> 03:23:19,200
not necessarily like he could turn into like a serpent there's gonna be a zodiac killer in the

2372
03:23:19,200 --> 03:23:26,240
new pokemon game do you know about like how all the fire starties are uh are um they're animals

2373
03:23:26,880 --> 03:23:33,520
all the fire starters are animals from the chinese zodiac or they have been so far i did not know

2374
03:23:33,600 --> 03:23:45,040
that was there a cow fire um i i don't think so hold on um fire you'll see for you'll see it

2375
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:51,360
and it'll be like oh yeah yeah totally totally true all right you know cindy quill is a little bit

2376
03:23:51,360 --> 03:23:58,640
of a stretch actually yeah it's not a mouse it's supposed to be uh like a like a bat like a badger

2377
03:23:58,640 --> 03:24:06,880
or like a like a like a like a wolverine right um i thought it had leaves uh what's the thing that

2378
03:24:06,880 --> 03:24:17,760
isn't a hedgehog it has the spines a porcupine porcupine maybe yeah i thought that the fire was

2379
03:24:17,760 --> 03:24:26,640
like spikes yeah maybe it's supposed to be like that i kind of thought it was a badger whatever it's

2380
03:24:27,200 --> 03:24:33,440
i mean it's not a rat yeah that's that's a that's a stretch that's a stretch and

2381
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:38,880
i don't know like i could totally see this pepper thing turning into like a serpent of some kind

2382
03:24:38,880 --> 03:24:50,240
which would oh you know could you know a finnican being the dog is wrong very wrong it's like it's

2383
03:24:50,960 --> 03:24:56,800
it's like like sort of the same but like dogs and foxes are very different like if there was

2384
03:24:56,800 --> 03:25:00,800
a dog fire starter they would definitely be using that instead of finnican and then finnican would

2385
03:25:00,800 --> 03:25:14,160
go nowhere hmm are dogs are foxes not dogs they're they're like canine adjacent like it's really

2386
03:25:14,160 --> 03:25:22,240
it's it's a very superficial similarity i feel like there like pig and pig and torchic rooster

2387
03:25:22,240 --> 03:25:29,120
like those all make sense but that one's more of a stretch than i think i think i think cindy quill

2388
03:25:29,120 --> 03:25:36,560
is a bigger stretch but bigger stretch yeah but but finnican yeah anyway i'm just i'm just saying

2389
03:25:36,560 --> 03:25:42,800
i'm not sure i feel like it's completely disproved if we if we accept it thus far i feel like this

2390
03:25:42,800 --> 03:25:48,080
new one is not you know let's wait and see what the final evolution is obviously it was some kind

2391
03:25:48,080 --> 03:25:53,920
honestly if it were some kind of fire snake i think that would be pretty cool uh yeah yeah

2392
03:25:55,760 --> 03:26:04,720
okay next one is called also ben do a soul link nuzlocke and then this is three two one

2393
03:26:05,360 --> 03:26:15,600
one okay um you know i heard about soul link nuzlocke's from um cough and a frame those guys

2394
03:26:15,600 --> 03:26:23,120
from the old rfck crowd yeah marin pan chimes in about the zodiac thing the crocodile could become

2395
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:32,320
more snake like male crocodiles are called bulls okay if that would be some real bullshit if like

2396
03:26:32,800 --> 03:26:40,000
they they tried to claim it's a bull because of some nomenclature shit so no but yeah it could

2397
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:45,200
be snake it could be snake like um i kind of hope it does i think it's cool idea uh yeah a frame in

2398
03:26:45,200 --> 03:26:52,320
cough told me they were doing a soul link nuzlocke and i guess what that is it's two people nuzlocke

2399
03:26:52,320 --> 03:27:00,320
at the same time and they each catch a pokemon you know you each catch a pokemon on your route

2400
03:27:00,320 --> 03:27:08,800
or whatever and then your the two pokemon that you each catch on the same route are soul linked

2401
03:27:09,520 --> 03:27:16,560
and then if one of you who's dies if one of you's dies then the other one has to release

2402
03:27:16,560 --> 03:27:25,600
their linked guy so it's so it's like if somebody sucks yeah so if you're if you're a partner if

2403
03:27:25,600 --> 03:27:33,920
your soul link partner sucks you just have to fucking deal with it as well crazy um i don't know

2404
03:27:34,480 --> 03:27:39,600
i don't know if i would like it very much it's very frustrating i feel like you're doing the

2405
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:44,800
nuzlocke and then you get a message like oh yeah you're gonna have to kill like that pokemon yeah

2406
03:27:44,800 --> 03:27:52,640
it's just i don't know it's it's just like a nuzlocke but also someone else is like fucking up

2407
03:27:52,720 --> 03:27:55,360
and and it's like ruining your day

2408
03:28:00,240 --> 03:28:06,320
i mean i guess i guess it could be fun but i'm not i feel like i feel like i would rather

2409
03:28:06,320 --> 03:28:12,640
if i was gonna make a nuzlocke harder i would just impose more restrictions on myself you know

2410
03:28:13,680 --> 03:28:17,760
i wouldn't put my fate in the hands of someone who might just completely screw me over

2411
03:28:18,400 --> 03:28:25,680
or completely randomly you know what i mean me yeah i think i would rather do that um

2412
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:35,520
okay next one is called i'm out of breath few uh wait here it is okay three two one go

2413

destroyed her channel and all that you also gotta talk about the fact that she would cry when she had

2417
03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:17,440
to pay taxes or she treated the boo like shit or anything you can think of honestly just destroy

her make everyone hate her completely ruin her more than she already has if i could do that

2419

if i could do that i already would have i've done the best i can i can't do anymore i'm sorry

2424
03:30:12,160 --> 03:30:24,160

sparkling water bottles filling them i guess i could take them out to the recycling if i wanted

2431
03:31:06,480 --> 03:31:12,160
but i mean i've got more floor space that i'm not using so why not just fill that floor

2443
03:32:57,520 --> 03:33:03,120
not long until it touches on ben's involvement at the very least slamming punishment and the

2444
03:33:03,120 --> 03:33:08,720
war on quickbill gino samuels doesn't you know cover every piece of chris chen media that every

2445
03:33:08,720 --> 03:33:16,000
bozo put out but these might be significant and that documentary gets about 500k views on average

2446
03:33:16,640 --> 03:33:23,360
500k really that's some you know some cue reforms people but that's also a lot of normies a lot of

2447
03:33:23,360 --> 03:33:28,400
new viewership might be coming this way i don't know we're already kind of preparing for it in rck

2448
03:33:29,120 --> 03:33:34,160
and actually what do you think about that what do you think of the documentary yeah i haven't uh

2449
03:33:34,160 --> 03:33:41,280
how it handles chris three or whatever i don't know uh brocrastinator's micro server five bucks a

we will we will do more we'll hang out on the stream on the minecraft server again in a bit

2456
03:34:22,800 --> 03:34:29,440
but anyway uh i haven't watched the geno samuel documentary i haven't literally not watched any

2457
03:34:29,440 --> 03:34:36,800
of it so is that the that's the extremely long form many the one that's 78 million parts yeah the

2458
03:34:36,800 --> 03:34:46,080
one that's like 60 parts long i think it's yeah um uh i don't know if it's gonna like yeah he might

2459
03:34:46,080 --> 03:34:55,200
mention uh he might mention um slamming punishment he might mention rfck maybe i don't know how

2460
03:34:56,560 --> 03:35:03,200
in depth he goes exactly i would imagine just based on the fact that there's so much

2461
03:35:04,400 --> 03:35:11,600
like content already in the documentary that you would get at least like a sentence because

2462
03:35:11,600 --> 03:35:19,840
christian did those like drawings for the card game well she did the cards and then

2463
03:35:19,840 --> 03:35:25,520
i mean was on a video where you it talked you interviewed her or something yeah i was like

2464
03:35:25,520 --> 03:35:32,080
in the call i can't remember what that was about that was related i think to to that stuff yes it

2465
03:35:32,080 --> 03:35:41,440
was related to the the rain and all that um yeah yeah i would i would uh yeah i think i'm likely to

2466
03:35:41,440 --> 03:35:51,360
get mentioned um you know i wonder i wonder if i have the game out by then if uh maybe uh he would

2467
03:35:51,360 --> 03:36:02,400
mention the game that would be kind of neat um so like uh geez i don't know what i don't have to

2468
03:36:02,400 --> 03:36:13,120
say about it uh the the the brain fog COVID brain fog COVID i'm more COVID than man it changed my

2469
03:36:13,120 --> 03:36:25,200
whole DNA um i don't know uh it's it's gonna be uh funny uh maybe uh i mean okay the cards the cards

2470
03:36:25,200 --> 03:36:32,720
uh i don't know like has he mentioned the cards because like a lot of what chris drew okay a lot

2471
03:36:32,720 --> 03:36:44,240
of what chris drew for the slime stuff was in the form of the twilight sparkle secret ship

2472
03:36:44,240 --> 03:36:51,360
flick folder cards and like most of those cards i don't know maybe this is just my opinion but they

2473
03:36:51,360 --> 03:36:57,120
seemed like completely irrelevant like who fucking cares uh like they do have like lore on them and

2474
03:36:57,120 --> 03:37:03,520
they do have like new characters on them honestly there probably is a lot there to like unpack if

2475
03:37:03,520 --> 03:37:09,760
you really wanted to honestly hmm you know what wonder if there's a lecture idea in that now that

2476
03:37:09,760 --> 03:37:14,720
i think about it uh those there were a lot of cards and they had a lot of like information

2477
03:37:15,760 --> 03:37:23,360
that was just like why would you ever read these fucking cards uh so i feel like maybe they the the

2478
03:37:23,360 --> 03:37:31,440
slime stuff the the rfck stuff might be mentioned along the same breath as the cards and like who

2479
03:37:31,440 --> 03:37:36,240
fucking cares about the cards so i could kind of see rfc the slime and punishment getting

2480
03:37:37,040 --> 03:37:44,160
shafted a little bit like that um but i don't know maybe if i make the video game maybe gino

2481
03:37:44,160 --> 03:37:49,680
would see the video game and maybe if he was impressed maybe he might give it a some some

2482
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:56,480
discussion in the in whenever he gets around to talking about it i don't know gino i just i kind

2483
03:37:56,480 --> 03:38:02,240
of assumed that gino was a piece of shit because like every chris chan youtuber is a fucking garbage

2484
03:38:02,240 --> 03:38:08,560
monster demon uh who i just hate with every fucking fiber of my being and i just assumed he was one

2485
03:38:08,560 --> 03:38:14,240
like that too but i've been told that he's not as bad as like the other guys so i don't know maybe

2486
03:38:14,320 --> 03:38:17,600
he's fine actually i don't know lamal

2487
03:38:21,600 --> 03:38:25,200
okay i guess that's all i have to say about that uh and that was the last voicemail

2488
03:38:25,920 --> 03:38:33,920
i want to go and eat mcnuggets so bad i guess i'll go and i'll make i can make myself a little uh

2489
03:38:33,920 --> 03:38:41,440

2490
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:49,280
oh health health food huh is it you know it's not even you know you're better than me

2491

2497
03:39:32,240 --> 03:39:40,800
uh play our video games pcp the pcp stands for play our video i don't know i don't know

2498
03:39:40,800 --> 03:39:48,320
i had this idea a while ago being like doing like p3 which is like e3 but with the procrastinators

2499
03:39:48,320 --> 03:39:53,920
and then we would like have uh like a pretend like oh we're doing video games there's a big

2500
03:39:53,920 --> 03:39:59,920
announcement we're on stage you you mentioned this i don't remember if you told me about it

2501
03:39:59,920 --> 03:40:05,200
or if you said it on the show but i think yes i put it in the chat at some point

2502
03:40:06,240 --> 03:40:10,160
because like tom was doing something it's like what what if we had like trailers what if we like

2503
03:40:10,160 --> 03:40:17,920
did a big old p3 honestly i mean why not like why wouldn't we do that like we're all

2504
03:40:18,880 --> 03:40:23,920
we're we're three podcasters who all make video games now so like

2505
03:40:26,400 --> 03:40:29,120
why wouldn't we do something with that um

2506
03:40:31,520 --> 03:40:40,080
you know uh yeah uh yeah is it rebrand time is it rebrand time is it time to change the tombstone

2507
03:40:40,400 --> 03:40:48,880
into like a pixel polygon into uh well we're not like gaming isn't low resolution that's not the

2508
03:40:48,880 --> 03:40:55,440
same thing speak for yourself i don't like i don't like how video games and low res 8 bit is

2509
03:40:55,440 --> 03:41:02,080
synonymous i'm gonna find a video game gamer i do anything but pixel art i'm gonna literally kick

2510
03:41:02,080 --> 03:41:09,360
your ass super nintendo video games peaked with the super nintendo best three solvent oh no no you

2511
03:41:09,920 --> 03:41:18,400
you said super nintendo not nintendo 64 not nintendo 64 that was bad no that was that was bad

2512
03:41:18,400 --> 03:41:26,880
well yeah yeah no no well yeah well actually yeah that's because it actually peaked with the ps2

2513
03:41:26,880 --> 03:41:29,840
and that's the where the games really are should be

2514
03:41:30,560 --> 03:41:39,200
hmm yeah i don't know um uh okay whatever you know you get what i'm saying though a video game

2515
03:41:39,200 --> 03:41:47,040
theme rebrand i don't know maybe you could have uh you could be in like 16 bit i could be ps2 model

2516
03:41:48,720 --> 03:41:57,360
and tom could be a ps1 model yeah oh yeah oh yeah true uh is that does that correlate to like

2517
03:41:58,160 --> 03:42:03,920
or ages yeah i am the oldest and tom is a little bit younger than me and you are a little younger

2518
03:42:03,920 --> 03:42:11,680
than him so yeah i guess it's uh uh the three generations three generations in one image grandpa

2519
03:42:11,680 --> 03:42:23,760
father and son all together daughter oh right sorry how dare you i saw a picture well well you

2520
03:42:24,160 --> 03:42:31,680

2521
03:42:31,680 --> 03:42:40,080
of women it was like old lady on the brink of death and then just a regular very old lady

2522
03:42:40,080 --> 03:42:50,720
and then a kind of old lady and then a middle-aged lady and then a sort of adult lady and then a

2523
03:42:50,720 --> 03:42:53,920
young adult lady and then a teenager and then a baby that had just been born

2524
03:42:54,640 --> 03:43:03,760
it was like eight generations in one picture it was gross i hated it so you know that's what we're

2525
03:43:03,760 --> 03:43:12,960
doing i wonder what it feels like to look at your past and and and future sucks i hate it

2526
03:43:13,360 --> 03:43:21,760
