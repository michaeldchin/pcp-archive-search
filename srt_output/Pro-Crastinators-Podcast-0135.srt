00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,200
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,160
I'm the best guy ever, and we've got The Boys, we've got Tom Oliver.

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:34,720
I am here to be on this podcast, but my audience is such a shit, so I'm going to listen to

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,720
like 60% or 70% of this podcast, so it's going to be fun.

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,760
I'm doing podcasts on hard mode today, I'm on New Game Plus, and I have all my extra

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,680
buffs, but I also have new challenges I've never faced before, it's going to be an interesting

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
experience.

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,960
Well that's great to hear, we've got Hippocrit here.

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,280
I think Pokemon Let's Go might literally be my favorite Pokemon game, and I haven't

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
played it yet.

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm what going to fucking kill you?

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,480
I played it, well okay.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,800
Glad someone else besides me enjoys it.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Ben Saint is angry.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
What?

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
It's, shut up!

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
There he goes.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Uh, an Endless Jess.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,320
It's me, it's me, it's Endlet G, I'm on the web because I am not free.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,680
Help me out if you are so kind.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,920
Patreon, come feed the swine.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
Collab with Lady Gaga.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,680
I can't resist a catchy jingle.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,040
Oh my god, it's another episode of the Procrastinators podcast, and here we are today to talk about

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
it.

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
Who are you?

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Did you introduce yourself?

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
What?

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Did you introduce yourself?

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,520
Well, I said my name, I suppose that's enough.

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
My reputation precedes me.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
That's true.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,160
You know, a bunch of know him well, finally back from the gates of hell, that's me.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:58,120
I have a thing to kick start this conversation, it's not about Pokemon, let's go, it is in

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
November.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:06,440
If only you had a thing to kick start my car, wait, I was thinking, what's that thing that

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
you have a crowdfunding?

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Oh good, you are very good.

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Crowdfunding.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
It's 2018.

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,920
I've been a kickstand, like I have a motorcycle, it falls over.

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,560
No, no, no, you failed, you fell flat on your face with that one.

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,760
There are so many ways you could have gone with it, and you chose the only one that

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
failed.

45
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:34,560
All right, in November, for no reason, I went on a trip to two cities in Europe, and here's

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,000
my story about it.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,120
I kind of wanted Munchie to be here, because I knew he would have things to say, such as,

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,640
oh good, so I wanted to hear him say those things.

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Wow.

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,920
Yeah, but yeah, there's basically, it was the first time I had traveled alone to another

51
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,080
country for no particular reason, like I've traveled alone before to BronyCon.

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,400
For no good reason.

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,240
For no good reason, well it was a good reason, because I have reasons, but usually there's

54
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,760
like somebody there waiting to meet me, or like it's Radcon, so there's lots of things

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:18,320
I don't have to worry about, like I can't drive in America at all, so like I don't have

56
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,360
to worry about driving around when I go to Radcon and various other things.

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:33,760
And it was so stressful, like leading up to going, because it's like, it's a different

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,680
kind of feeling where if I just decide to call it off, nobody would be mad necessarily

59
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,920
Nobody is relying on me to be somewhere for something, I can just not go if I want to,

60
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,120
and that is like really, it tugged on me, because like I'm scared of traveling, I don't

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,760
like it, it makes me wet my pants, the idea that I might leave my toothbrush on the plane

62
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,200
or something strange, and I'm like, oh no, my passport, I dropped down the drain and

63
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't speak to the locals to ask them to help me get it out, because they don't understand

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,960
me, like various things like that, and I was like, oh no, everything's gonna go wrong and

65
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,200
I'm gonna be stranded, and I could have called it off, but I ended up going and it was cool.

66
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,600
So it would have been easier if you had some kind of obligation, it would have been easier

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,800
if there were someone that you had promised this to, or something you had to do, but because

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,040
it was just a thing you wanted to do, and yet the fact that it was only your want to do it

69
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,960
and nothing else made you like, I could give you anxiety, like I don't have to do this,

70
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,680
maybe I shouldn't do this, I totally relate to that, that's why nobody follows their dreams

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,560
ever, and nobody should. Well, I ended up doing it, and it was very anxious anxiety

72
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:09,160
ridden in the first bit, but the reason I wanted to do it was various reasons, one to see a bit

73
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:17,600
of Europe before it gets locked off from Brexit, and we get like a big old fence, a big old wall

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:25,560
around the entire coast of the UK, we can't leave, also to play Pokemon Go, haha, we don't get the

75
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:34,040
wall, but you guys do, very offended. I was going to get like a Spanish Mr. Mime, and a German

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:41,840
Mr. Mime, I called it. Hadrian's Wall? Hadrian's Wall, that's a Roman thing. It's like two feet

77
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,040
high, isn't that the wall that sort of goes across like the middle of England? It was supposed to

78
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,280
keep the Scots out, I think, as the Romans built it, and it was kind of small and there's only a

79
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:04,000
little bit left, it's tiny. Hadrian's Wall makes me giggle. I'm sorry, I interrupted. No, no, it's fine,

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,760
it's cool. I expect it, and I feel bad when I don't get interrupted, it makes me uncomfortable.

81
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:18,840
Yeah, good. So I got like, haha, cool Pokemon, I got some fucking, some exclusive Mr. Mime,

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,320
some like, some bourgeoisie, like, special Mr. Mime, I got Senor Mime, and I got Hair Mime,

83
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,480
and they're gonna be like, you know, Monchi was saying, oh, I'm gonna go, you know, give all my

84
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,240
Italian Mr. Mimes over, and then Hippo's not gonna have any spending power in America, and like,

85
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,120
no, I've got special, I'm gonna go to France as well, I'm gonna get a legit like French Mr. Mime

86
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,440
as well, bitch, I'm gonna have all the Pokemon. So like, that was one of the reasons I went,

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,160
and then also, just to be more self-reliant and to be more independent, the ability to like,

88
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,440
going to another country is fucking terrifying, where they don't speak the language specifically,

89
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,000
and it's like, if you don't do anything, you're gonna die because you need to eat, so you got to

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
do stuff every day. A lot of people, a lot of people speak English though, in all like,

91
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,800
major metropolitan areas of the world. Well, alright, here's the thing, in Hamburg, yes,

92
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,840
because Germans don't have, they don't have another nation that speaks German, the German is just

93
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,960
their thing, so like, they understand that if they want to speak to anyone else, they'd better

94
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,720
speak English, because that's pretty popular, but in Spain, nobody speaks English, everybody is like,

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,480
like, they don't even have like a phrase to say, do you speak English? Like, they don't know how to

96
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:47,560
say that, they just keep speaking Spanish to me, and I'm like, I, I point, and then they're like,

97
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,200
they point, and they say something, and I'm like, I don't know whether you were saying yes or no,

98
00:07:52,200 --> 00:08:06,840
or, it's scary, Madrid was scary, I went to Madrid, but it's also cool. I have anxiety about doing

99
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,040
anything, and travel is a big thing that takes a lot of time, so if it's, if I have to do some of it,

100
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:22,640
it's coming up, I'm like, what a commitment I have to make, oh god, but I'm not afraid of like,

101
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:32,160
I'm not afraid of like, losing anything, or, I don't know, I've, I've found that like, if you have

102
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,880
money, if you have money, nothing can go wrong, if you have, I was gonna say, the only thing I was

103
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,560
afraid of of losing when I was in Japan was my like, stack of, what, like, traveler's checks or

104
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,400
whatever, that like, was my money, if you, if you have like, if you have like, let's say $1,000 in

105
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,400
like, liquid assets that are available to you, nothing can hurt you, and everything, pretty much

106
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:03,640
invincible. I had a similar epiphany, I realized that the true meaning of life, the ultimate secret

107
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:13,720
to having a life that isn't like, too much of a disaster, is just have $10,000 at all times, no

108
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,560
matter how much money you make, make sure that you always have a safety net of $10,000, and that is

109
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,760
your, if anything goes wrong, money, and yeah, that's, that's it, that's all you need. I could not be

110
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,800
more with you, I'd pretty much, that's exactly how I think, yeah, 100%. My number is 500,

111
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,400
might actually, because that's how the whole thing about like, because that's about how much I need to

112
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,480
live another month. I was, I was saving up like, my whole thing about like, when I'll go, you, for

113
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,960
full time YouTube was like, I was thinking, I put a number at 20 grand, when I had 20 grand, at that

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,560
point, I'm willing to like, you know, take the chance and do stuff. And I technically have that now,

115
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,120
but it's like tax stuff. And I'm not saying like, everybody has $10,000 lying around, I'm saying

116
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:09,640
that's the goal that you need to get to, you're fine. Like, I recently like, why will these idiots not

117
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:18,760
have $10,000? This year, I accomplished my lifelong dream of like, seeing that number in my bank account

118
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:28,320
10,000. It was during, it took me literally 29 years. So I'm not saying it's easy, but I had 10k in the

119
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
bank. I had the however many digits that is, I'm so poor, I don't even know how many digits are in

120
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,880
10,000. Five digits. Yeah, and seeing that, I bought a car, so I don't have it anymore. But yeah, it

121
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,520
was a, it was good. And so now I know that that's what I was good. That's a great goal. Everybody

122
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,800
should have a big safety net. And I mean, everybody should, when they're young, be thinking about

123
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,120
like, okay, well, when I retire, I'm not going to be able to work. So I got to like, save up money for

124
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,800
that too. Those like the short term need to be able to survive. And the long term one, people keep

125
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,040
those in mind, you're in good shape.

126
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,040
It's interesting, because like, in the anxiety I was having like, day to day, a moment to moment,

127
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,560
wasn't necessarily that I would run out of money, because I had like, the reason I went to these

128
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,520
specific places, like one after the other was because I got really cheap flights, one wave from

129
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,000
London to Hamburg, Hamburg to Madrid and Madrid back to London. And I got Airbnb. So like, I knew

130
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,040
that I had money in the bank to spend on lots of things. If I needed to, it was just like, doing the

131
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:40,360
social stuff, like going into a place and saying, you know, good morning, or, you know, and, and, and,

132
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,400
and, you know, being able to do the, the transaction with someone.

133
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,720
And then dealing with the vicious blows that rain down as you culturally appropriated their language by

134
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,120
attempting to speak it to them.

135
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,040
Ultimately.

136
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,480
Yeah.

137
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,800
How dare you.

138
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,840
You guys ever hear about that? Some people get, they don't like the whole learning of their languages. I

139
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,200
know it's a minority, but wait, wait, wait, wait, that made me.

140
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,120
Who what?

141
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,880
Yeah, I've heard, you know, I'm sure these are fringe people, but I have heard the argument that

142
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,200
learning languages other than your native one is a form of cultural appropriation that should, should

143
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,600
do it.

144
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,920
It's, no, it's funny because like fringe weirdos.

145
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,480
Yeah, you know, it is cultural appropriation, but also appropriation is not a bad thing and never

146
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,040
has been.

147
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,120
So yeah, agreed.

148
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,160
More or less.

149
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,600
Yeah.

150
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,360
Oh, I hate one thing on this whole anxiety thing. You know what this reminds me of a lot? The thing

151
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,480
that I relate most to when I went to Japan, I definitely had this anxiety.

152
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,440
The thing that comes to mind for me with this conversation about being nervous and doing

153
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,360
stuff is specifically because like you just, you went there and like you were saying, you

154
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,760
wouldn't know like dates to meet.

155
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,480
You had no like people that you needed to do stuff for.

156
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,160
There was nothing you just, you went because you wanted to go.

157
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,280
And that reminds me of when I would go out to the club and go talk to girls because that is a purely

158
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,480
selfish act.

159
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,760
And it was in those moments of being in my mind, I knew this 100% purely selfishly wanting to meet

160
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,360
people and, you know, create friendships or get sex or whatever.

161
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,520
The anxiety was at my peak.

162
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,400
Because if they say, if they were to say the simple words, why are you talking to me?

163
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,080
The answer is, Oh God, I have no just, there's no justice on my side.

164
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,080
It's pure what I want to be doing.

165
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,720
And what a, what a sin that is.

166
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,840
What a sin that is.

167
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,560
What a sin that is to talk to, to be a social animal and do the normal thing.

168
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,720
Yeah.

169
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,400
Yep.

170
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,840
Those are, I remember those.

171
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,280
I have no, I have no, hey, galley and argument on my side and no utilitarian.

172
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,720
Well, I guess it reproduced.

173
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,160
Spread my ideas and jeans.

174
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, say that.

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,480
I like that.

176
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,320
Say that.

177
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,440
I should have said that.

178
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,920
I'm looking to spread my jeans.

179
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I'm just trying to reproduce.

180
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,160
Spread my jeans, you know, gain, gain social capital, you know,

181
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,400
that I should understand.

182
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,160
Yeah, there was, there was a peak of this anxiety on the first day in Hamburg.

183
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,480
Um, well, the first day I got there was like at night, so I went straight to bed

184
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,440
and, uh, I woke up the next day and I was like, okay, how to find breakfast.

185
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,560
I Googled breakfast nearby and I found a place and it was okay.

186
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,960
It was like, I was doing all right.

187
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,640
But then it became, uh, you know, I was, I went into town and I was like, okay.

188
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,080
Google and type, how to find breakfast.

189
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,040
How to find breakfast.

190
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,400
Well, Google maps has a thing where like you click explore and it's like restaurants,

191
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
cafes and it's like, okay, I can do that.

192
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,080
I can do this.

193
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,160
This is easy.

194
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,720
So I went into town to just look around and take some pictures and all that.

195
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,960
And then I was like hungry.

196
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,240
It was lunchtime.

197
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,200
It's time to go find a place to eat lunch.

198
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,200
And I was in the center of town.

199
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,520
So there's a lot of big restaurants.

200
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,480
I was like, I don't really want to spend a lot of money.

201
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,520
Right now, I just want to find like something to keep me going for the moment.

202
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,800
And then I'll have a big dinner later.

203
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,000
But I spent a lot of the time just walking around, looking nearby the shops and the

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,320
restaurants and the, you know, the hot dog stands and being like, uh, there's not in

205
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,840
English.

206
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
I don't know what to do.

207
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,080
I go up to them and then they, I don't know what to say to them.

208
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,400
So I didn't go up to anyone.

209
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,080
I walked around for a really long time and then I saw a McDonald's and I was like,

210
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,560
okay.

211
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,640
Thank God.

212
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,200
I mean, first of all, no, I'm not going to go into the McDonald's as stupid.

213
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,480
I flew all the way here.

214
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,320
I'm going to have some, some fucking German Currywurst.

215
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,880
I'm going to have some, some legit Hamburg food, but I was, I was, I was dying.

216
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,560
I was, I was anxiety-ridden and I had like the, the lowest moment in my life.

217
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,920
I went into that, that McDonald's and I got fucking 10 chicken McNuggets.

218
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
Good old American.

219
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,200
On the touch screen.

220
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,480
Yes.

221
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,760
I don't even have to talk to anyone.

222
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,720
I didn't, I didn't have to talk to anyone.

223
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,040
I knew there'd be a touch screen in there.

224
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,840
I touched the screen.

225
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,320
I said, I got the thing and I just ate them and I felt like a fucking fool.

226
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,240
I felt like the biggest Rube in the fucking world.

227
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,320
I feel you dog.

228
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,360
Munchy would be flipping out right now.

229
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,960
That's why I wanted Munchy to hear.

230
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,840
And it's like, all right, that kept me going for like an hour because it's fucking

231
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,160
McDonald's and it's terrible.

232
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,960
Um, so like, I, I went home, uh, to the Airbnb and I was sitting in, in the

233
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,400
bed and it was a terrible room.

234
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,920
It was like three.

235
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,040
I was going to ask about that.

236
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,760
Was it just like a room in a house?

237
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,480
I mean, it, it served its purpose.

238
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,800
It was a roof over my head.

239
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,600
So it's fine, but like, um, it wasn't nice to relax in, uh, there was this, it was

240
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,240
a shared room.

241
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,200
There was three bunk beds and a TV and there was this fat girl, a German girl

242
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,240
who was like, every single time I came into that room, she was laying on one of

243
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,840
the bunk beds, the lower part on her phone, watching like really trashy German TV.

244
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,480
I didn't see her leave once.

245
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,560
I don't know what she was doing there and her boyfriend would come every so often

246
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,280
and sit next to her or something.

247
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,680
They would just both be on their phones and they're terrible German TV and they

248
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,440
never turned the TV off even until like one AM.

249
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,240
So I was like, I don't know what to do.

250
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,320
Do I beat the shit out of them and grab the remote and turn it off?

251
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,440
Or do I just, that was my first instinct as well.

252
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,920
Or do I just, uh, sit here with my headphones in, but with no music playing

253
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,720
so I could maybe sleep.

254
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,080
Since there is no objective good or bad, how could I ask them to turn off this TV?

255
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,480
That's a subjective value being able to sleep.

256
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,320
Well, the trouble is that nobody could beat up a German because they all have

257
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,760
tanks in their garage.

258
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,680
In this case, the girlfriend is the tank.

259
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,360
Got him.

260
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,120
So wait, I was, so I was in, I came after the McDonald's.

261
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,320
I was like, okay, that was a kind of terrible first day, but it wasn't even late.

262
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,400
It was like four PM.

263
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,840
And I was like, I'm hungry, obviously, and I'm going to need dinner.

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,120
I don't know what to do.

265
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,720
And I was just thinking, maybe I could sleep through like the rest of the evening

266
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,200
and through to the next day and then figure it out again.

267
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,760
Yeah.

268
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,880
And I was sitting there for like 20 minutes thinking, no, this is stupid.

269
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,720
I can't do this.

270
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,440
Oh, but I'm doing it.

271
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,600
Oh, I'm doing it.

272
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm the worst guy of all time.

273
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,560
I'm the worst at traveling.

274
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,760
I can't do anything.

275
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,080
That was me, my first couple of days in fucking in Tokyo.

276
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,000
And eventually I figured out I could go to the convenience store nearby.

277
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,400
But like, I didn't know where it was the first couple of days.

278
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
So I sat there shivering, sad.

279
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,320
It felt very like very much like that.

280
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,800
I was like, this is the worst moment in my entire life.

281
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,920
And it's all my fault and there's no one to help me.

282
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,920
Oh, and I don't even have Twitter on my phone because I got rid of it.

283
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,800
And I can't scream on social media.

284
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,760
Oh, no, I'm sad about stuff.

285
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,960
And so, but I did the same thing with Google.

286
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,680
I Googled restaurants and I just picked one that was nearby.

287
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,160
And I said, I'll just go.

288
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,560
I'll just go.

289
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,280
I got my coat.

290
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,400
It was fucking really cold.

291
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,880
So that's why I didn't really want to go out.

292
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,800
And I went to this place and thankfully the lady understood that, you know, I just

293
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,760
said, I know, don't speak German.

294
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,000
She's like, oh, English.

295
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,000
I was like, yeah.

296
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,040
And then she's like, okay, uh, to have a seat.

297
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,360
And then I ordered a food and I had a beer and it was like this sour pork and it was

298
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,400
very German and it was a very German restaurant.

299
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,920
I had like authentic German food and it was really filling and it was fucking great.

300
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,400
And I, I really enjoyed my time and I like it.

301
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,200
And it was great.

302
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,080
I felt, I felt so good that the fact that I got over this stupid hang up of like not

303
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,520
being able to speak to Germans because it's like trying to speak to anyone, but also you

304
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,440
have to look like an idiot when you say, I don't know what you're saying initially.

305
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
Um, and I, I felt great.

306
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,520
I felt great after that.

307
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,520
And for the rest of the trip, I was able to get lunch and dinner without really any

308
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,040
problem.

309
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,920
And that's, that's my arc for that, that story.

310
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,080
Isn't it weird that in Germany, they, they, they have curry versed and even though curry

311
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,720
is like an Indian thing, but curry versed is a German thing.

312
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,520
I don't know.

313
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,120
I think it was strange.

314
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,440
It's just spicy.

315
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,800
It's cultural appropriation.

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,440
Yeah.

317
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,840
It wasn't curry versed over there.

318
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,040
I probably just, I went to one of that, those hawked stands where they were selling curry

319
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,760
versed in a little plastic paper plate and I had it and I was like, this isn't really

320
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,640
spicy and it's not very tasty either.

321
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,280
I don't get it.

322
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
I don't get curry versed.

323
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,560
But that's probably a bad example of curry versed.

324
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,800
Uh, but yeah, I got curry versed one time and it was like, I got it at like a street cart

325
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,440
and they served to me in like a paper and like a paper fucking, you know, one of those

326
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,600
like paper cardboard foldup things that you might get a serving of street French fries

327
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,080
in, you know what I'm saying?

328
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,440
Yeah, it was fun.

329
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,880
Um, what the fuck's going on with the call?

330
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,680
Okay.

331
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,000
All right.

332
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,040
Let's, let's everybody's issue is flagging apparently.

333
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm glad it's not just me.

334
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,440
Yeah.

335
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,280
Well, it's not, it's, it's you and Tom.

336
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,640
I, yeah, it does seem to primarily be a Jesse and Tom, because I don't think Ben

337
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,520
Gibb and I are having it, but nonetheless, that's, that's not good.

338
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,200
That's not good.

339
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
Uh, hmm.

340
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,240
Well, that, that's my story.

341
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,680
I went to a place.

342
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,920
I had an arc on the first day and then it was all right from then.

343
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,400
Uh, hooray.

344
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,920
Fantastic.

345
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,520
Well, what about, what about Spain though?

346
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,840
We didn't hear anything about Spain.

347
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,440
Oh, well, I went to Spain.

348
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,320
Basically, the gist is that nobody or pain here's, here's an interesting, uh,

349
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,720
parallel to like the first day in Spain.

350
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,760
So like I got to Madrid and Airbnb, very cheap, uh, in a very poor part of like the

351
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:51,960
suburbs, uh, like, uh, like a really cheap, um, council house estate sort of thing.

352
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,560
And I was just living in a room with a family and the family was nice and they

353
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,040
had a dog and the dog was scared of me, but he was a good dog.

354
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:07,120
Um, and I was like, okay, I got a dog, uh, a big fluffy one with big ears, sick,

355
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,720
a big fluffy boy.

356
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,920
Um, so I was in that room.

357
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,520
I was like, okay, it's lunchtime.

358
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,800
I'm hungry and the metro is like really long from the airport.

359
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,640
And I'm really exhausted and tired.

360
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,800
I'm, I can't go on the metro again to get into the center of Madrid to have

361
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,080
lunch.

362
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,280
I'll just see what's in the local area at this point.

363
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,480
I didn't know Spanish people don't speak English.

364
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
So I was assuming they would know a little bit.

365
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,560
I go into this bar, um, and there's some guys just at the front, uh,

366
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
watching the football going on.

367
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,520
And, uh, I go up to the guy and I say, uh, do you speak English?

368
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,680
And he says, well, I don't know what he says.

369
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,880
He said something in Spanish.

370
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,760
I didn't understand it.

371
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,560
He says, uh, nobody said senor.

372
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,680
Nobody seems to say senor in Madrid.

373
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,960
I guess that's just not a thing.

374
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,040
I guess, I guess that's kind of a fancy thing.

375
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,120
Like, oh, yes, um, madams, uh, it might be more of a Mexican Spanish thing.

376
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:04,960
Maybe.

377
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,160
Yeah, there's differences there.

378
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,520
So, uh, I was in this, this, this bar.

379
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,920
There's just like three sort of oldish guys who seem to be regulars looking at me.

380
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,680
And then the guy behind the bar and he's like, so what, what are you, you know,

381
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,440
he's saying in Spanish, what do you want?

382
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,760
Do you, uh, like he's trying to understand what I want.

383
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,360
And I don't know how to, to respond.

384
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,160
And I find a menu and I like, uh, I'm looking at it.

385
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,440
And at some point he just gets frustrated with me.

386
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,600
Like he knows food.

387
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,160
So it's like, he, he does like the emotion of like, he puts his fingers and thumb

388
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,560
together and he puts that near his mouth.

389
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,440
It's like, do you want to eat?

390
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,080
Do you want to eat?

391
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,440
And I'm like, I nodded my head and he's like, okay, fine.

392
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,800
It gives me some tapas.

393
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,480
And he says, go sit down with this.

394
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm like, oh, yeah.

395
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
So, so, so let me get this straight.

396
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,560
You're sitting in a restaurant with a menu, but you can't read the menu.

397
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:57,960
No, no, no.

398
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,320
I wasn't sitting down yet.

399
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,280
It was like, I just walked into this restaurant and there's a bar in the front

400
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,600
and there was a restaurant in the back.

401
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,680
And I, I was talking to this, I was trying to talk to this guy.

402
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,200
He gives you like a, he gives you like an appetizer tray or something.

403
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,080
Like the equivalent of like a basket of bread or some shit.

404
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,680
Well, yeah.

405
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,520
I mean, it's tapas.

406
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,120
So it's like rice and I never had tapas.

407
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,640
I don't know what that is exactly.

408
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,200
It's, it's sort of like a small, it's like an appetizer for a drink.

409
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,560
Uh, you know, the sort of thing you eat while you're drinking.

410
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,400
So a little nice, little, uh, tasty thing.

411
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,560
And so he gave me that in a tiny little bit.

412
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,600
And I was like, okay, well, I'll eat this.

413
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,920
And then I sit down as a menu and I pointed a thing that seems to be

414
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,040
like potatoes with something on it.

415
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,920
And I'm like, I'll have that.

416
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
And he's like, okay.

417
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,000
And he's laughing at certain points.

418
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,040
I'm thinking, okay, I look like a fucking idiot.

419
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,160
These guys, they're just watching the game and it's complete.

420
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,440
Like this foreigner comes into this small, like residential area

421
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,760
that no English tourist would ever go.

422
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,800
And there's an English guy in here, just like being an idiot.

423
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,360
I was like, hey, this motherfucker, you're saying in Spanish,

424
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,800
making fun of me probably.

425
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,840
And I was like, yeah, you know what, it was so ridiculous

426
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,000
that I didn't actually care.

427
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,480
I didn't actually feel bad about it because it probably is really funny.

428
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,720
So like I had the food.

429
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,520
Did it feel like you were just sort of breaking all the rules of society

430
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,480
and therefore had transcended them?

431
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,480
Yeah, like it was so ridiculous a situation to me that I'd never been

432
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,120
in such an embarrassing moment.

433
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,240
There was like, there's nothing that could go wrong.

434
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,440
Like they in that moment, you cease to care.

435
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,280
Yeah.

436
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,960
And it was like a big difference to like, oh no, I can't possibly ask

437
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,720
somebody who definitely does speak English for a meal.

438
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,040
But I can go into now, I can go into Madrid, into a place where nobody

439
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,360
speaks Spanish at all and figure out how to get something in me.

440
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,320
And I was just like, yeah, just sitting there.

441
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520
I was watching the game with them.

442
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,320
It was England versus Ecuador.

443
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,240
And then England lost, haha.

444
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,640
Haha, just like you in this social interaction.

445
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,200
Yeah, I was just like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

446
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,800
And I had another beer and it was good.

447
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,040
And then I went back and it was, it was a cool moment.

448
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,920
I figured out that I'm okay in the real world.

449
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,080
I can, I can survive it.

450
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,360
That was a very valuable thing to learn.

451
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,520
How was the potato shit?

452
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:32,440
It was potatoes alioli, which is I think like garlic cream sauce.

453
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,720
So it's just a bunch of potatoes with garlic cream sauce.

454
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,600
And alioli is like a garlic mayonnaise.

455
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,320
Oh yeah, that was what it was, garlic mayonnaise.

456
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,120
And yeah, it was just a big thing of potatoes.

457
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,600
And I was like, you know, that'll do.

458
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,080
That that's just that's filling.

459
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,560
Oh yeah, carbohydrates.

460
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,560
OK, and a happy, happy ending.

461
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,000
How long were you in Spain for?

462
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,720
I was in Spain for one day less than I was in Germany.

463
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,600
They'll have two days in two full days.

464
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,520
And then one day to get to the airport and leave.

465
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,720
Hey, you mentioned you mentioned a dog.

466
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,120
This allows me to segue into how much I hate dogs.

467
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,720
I hate pets. I hate animals.

468
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,880
I hate in the same way that I hate food

469
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,720
because pets are food just at a different stage of the life cycle.

470
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,640
They're all equally boring.

471
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,520
They're all equally topics for rubes to discuss.

472
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,160
You go, you go like your food thing.

473
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,120
Yeah, it is.

474
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,000
It is the exact same thing as my food thing.

475
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,320
So I'm going to go on the exact same tangent.

476
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Like, oh, you show up, you show up to a place

477
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,560
and there's people there and you go, oh, hey, what kind of food do you like to eat?

478
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,040
Oh, you like you like fried chicken.

479
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,680
Well, I like roasted chicken.

480
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,320
Oh, what kind of what kind of you know what I kind of ice cream do you like?

481
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,480
Oh, you like chocolate with I like strawberry.

482
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,920
Oh, what kind of dog do you like?

483
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,080
Oh, you like fucking two hours with I like great days.

484
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,120
And then this is what people are like.

485
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,640
This is human society.

486
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,080
This is what leaving my house is like.

487
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,840
And I don't ever want to do it again.

488
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,320
I agree that those things like talking about what sort of stuff you like is boring.

489
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,400
And also, I don't know what the difference between dog breeds

490
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,200
are and why you would ever care about them.

491
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,400
It's just like, oh, it's fluffy.

492
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,280
That's all you need to know in my opinion.

493
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,400
Like, oh, it's a it's a half-breed Scottish bog

494
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,640
panel, like what does that mean?

495
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,120
OK, what's the what's the fucking point of that conversation?

496
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,520
Right? What's the fucking point of you?

497
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
It's small talk to break the ice.

498
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,960
We all know it's worthless and pointless.

499
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,200
It doesn't mean anything.

500
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,920
But yeah, it's just there to be filler.

501
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,960
I'll break your eyes with this ice.

502
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,880
Do I? Yeah, sure.

503
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,280
It's filler. I do.

504
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,520
I do agree that dogs are worthless creatures

505
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,600
and I don't respect them and nobody.

506
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,560
I don't stand by that.

507
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,720
I mean, I like dogs are like dogs on an individual basis.

508
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,920
Like, I've known some dogs who rise above the pitfalls of their species,

509
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,440
but very few.

510
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,040
Like, I've known like one or two dogs that were like quiet and friendly

511
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,800
and, you know, shut the fuck up and didn't shit.

512
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,400
But only, you know, but that's most of they just fucking yappy,

513
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,600
barky, fucking aggressive, stupid dogs are so fucking aggressive.

514
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,160
They have it's they have their moral,

515
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,120
their moral priorities are just ordered differently from ours,

516
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,560
which they have none.

517
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,600
Dogs have no more.

518
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,080
Yeah, that's not true.

519
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,280
When think when think no, no, no, listen, listen,

520
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,920
since good and evil are purely subjective.

521
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,560
Yeah, when something has different moral priorities than you,

522
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,400
it is evil to you.

523
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,600
It morally opposes.

524
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,720
I mean, that's your fundamental worldview,

525
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,920
making dogs object all nonhuman creatures and most humans objectively evil.

526
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,160
You know what the problem is with that?

527
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,160
That makes people in opposite political sides are correct that the other side is evil.

528
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,480
Both sides are correct about that.

529
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,800
The why is that a problem?

530
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,480
Well, I'd say that it causes some cause some commotion out in that ocean.

531
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,000
If you know what I'm saying, let me let me.

532
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,960
So I have a dog, Lord Sashomaru, and he's he's pretty good.

533
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,600
So the worst thing about Sashomaru, by far,

534
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,440
is that he's very emotionally needy and he hates to be alone.

535
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,880
And so when you're home with him, it's fine.

536
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,440
The problem is when no one's home with him,

537
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,320
because literally almost every time he will shit when we're when people are gone

538
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,160
because he's trying to punish us for abandoning him.

539
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,480
And this is confirmed because like I'll go out for 20 minutes to drop like Michelle

540
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,160
off at work or something in that way.

541
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,760
Does that work?

542
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,560
He takes a shit.

543
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,840
If people abandon me, can I shit and I'll learn not to?

544
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,880
It makes me so unbelievably angry.

545
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah, if it were if Sash were a human,

546
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,640
I would tell him to get the fuck out and don't ever talk to me again.

547
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I mean, so would I.

548
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,080
But yeah, he is not capable of moral consideration.

549
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,800
So I have to just, you know, accept that he deserves.

550
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,360
Does he deserve leeway for that fact?

551
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,040
Well, I don't know.

552
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,640
Does that earn him more goodwill?

553
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Does that earn him more goodwill?

554
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,840
People with the minds of children deserve to be destroyed because they can't,

555
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,640
you know, like maintain themselves.

556
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,040
I wouldn't destroy them.

557
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,240
I wouldn't destroy them.

558
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,000
But I would turn them out on the street and shut the door and let them freeze to death.

559
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,880
He's my responsibility, but I was prepared to accept this life

560
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,120
when I when I, you know, took this burden on.

561
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,920
And he's great in every other way, seriously.

562
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,360
But in this one way.

563
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,760
And so yesterday, so we started when we leave, we have to put him in his box.

564
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Because he's going to shit.

565
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,240
So he might as well do it in his box on some paper.

566
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,680
So yesterday I do this.

567
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,840
I'm out for 20 minutes, dropping off somebody.

568
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,800
He's alone for only that small window of time.

569
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,520
When I come back, he has shit in his box and smeared it around with his pause

570
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,560
on like the floor of his box.

571
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,800
And I have to like, so this is deliberate.

572
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,800
I guess this is definitely deliberate, definitely.

573
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,640
That's the worst.

574
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,120
That's the worst possible thing.

575
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,720
Because like, yes, my dog, my dog.

576
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,680
The family dog that we have now.

577
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,800
He's learned to ask to go outside to shit.

578
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,400
So he's good.

579
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,000
He's a good boy.

580
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,720
We're pretty good about that, but it's not about the shitting.

581
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,880
It's about it's about it's about the.

582
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,360
Yeah, like if you leave him alone for too long, if parents are watching TV

583
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,360
in the other room, he doesn't poop when we're around, he's good.

584
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,440
He will he will bark.

585
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,640
He will bark a little bit, but he's kind of quiet generally.

586
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,600
So like, I don't mind him so much.

587
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,120
The only thing, the only thing I kind of feel bad about is like

588
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,320
taking on my own walks.

589
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,520
And when I throw the ball, he just doesn't bring it back.

590
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,400
And he wants me to go bring it so that I can throw it for him again.

591
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,360
Yeah, yeah.

592
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,320
But like, in terms of like dog problems, I don't really have that many.

593
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
It's it's he's quite a good boy.

594
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,360
But that's also because my parents do a lot of the dog walking for for me.

595
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:46,880
Right.

596
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,760
So like, I'm not wholly responsible.

597
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,800
If I had to do the dog walking every day, morning and evening,

598
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,360
I would probably throw him in the into space.

599
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,480
Sometimes, you know, taking him for a session for a walk, whatever, is like a

600
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,880
fine, you know, like deviations like, you know, I could use a break.

601
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,960
I'll take five minutes.

602
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,360
But sometimes I'm in the depths of working and I do not want to be distracted.

603
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,600
I am focused on my task and leaving it.

604
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,960
And in those moments, especially when I know he hasn't pooped for a while,

605
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,160
I take him on, he will not poop.

606
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,280
And it's been like 10 minutes or something.

607
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,480
That's when the rage that I do experience in any other capacity in my life

608
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,680
got that dog rage.

609
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,600
Yeah, I get dog rage in a big way in those situations specifically.

610
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,400
And I'm like, Cecil, you you've got 30 seconds.

611
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,080
You need to poop right now or or you or you will never know what's going to

612
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,680
happen if you poop inside later after I've given you all this opportunity.

613
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,720
It's just, you know, he's a terrorist and he can't be negotiated with, frankly.

614
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,040
It's really infuriating and revolting just the amount of shit

615
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,000
that dogs get away with that other pets don't, like the amount of aggression

616
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,240
that people let their dogs get away.

617
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,560
Yeah, like no other pet in this world, if your cat attacked people,

618
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,600
you would like throw it against a wall or like get rid of it.

619
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,280
But like, I know people that are I know people that are totally fine

620
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,520
with their cat just attacking visitors.

621
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,560
I mean, like acceptable and they and they and they blame the visitors.

622
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,760
If like, if every time they can die, if every time you walked by someone's

623
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,760
house, like their other pets started making noise and yelling at you,

624
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,560
then they wouldn't want those pets anymore.

625
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,840
But for some reason, dogs are allowed to do it.

626
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,440
I hate barking.

627
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,840
If you have a dog and you allow it to bark, I want to shoot you in the fucking

628
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,480
head in front of your dog and give it to the bark about.

629
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,000
It's like, like Beanie, Nate, Beanie, who would just go nuts,

630
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,640
go into an insane, like some screaming rage.

631
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,560
Like every no, every time dad came home.

632
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,640
Oh, yeah, which was every day, multiple times a day.

633
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,160
And it's like, are you fucking kidding me?

634
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,760
Yeah, are you fucking kidding me?

635
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,280
I have friends who like, I don't want to go to their house just because

636
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,320
when you walk in the door, there's that like five seconds of the dog

637
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,720
freaking out and coming at you.

638
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,480
You know, that's just the person making a choice.

639
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,200
They care about this dog more than the impacts to lifestyle that I guess they're

640
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,160
going to suffer. Is the dog like vicious?

641
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,520
Or is it just like really excited?

642
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,120
No, it's just, well, like it doesn't, it's too stupid to recognize me right away.

643
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,080
So it needs like a moment to understand that I'm not a guy you bark at.

644
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,520
But like you walk in the door and like, even if it's just like 10 seconds

645
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,200
of a dog freaking out, it's too much for one lifetime.

646
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,200
That does suck.

647
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,440
I hate it makes me not want to go to that person's house ever.

648
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,160
Plus, I think like, oh, well, what the dogs are knowing now?

649
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,240
What's it going to be like later?

650
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,680
If I'm just like, being here, is it going to start freaking out?

651
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,720
Am I going to be uncomfortable?

652
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,600
It's going to be like, they're so stupid because it's like, even if it's a dog

653
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,920
that I know and like, like five minutes from now, I'm going to be like petting

654
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
you and it's fine.

655
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,040
Like you've seen me before, you know who the fuck I am.

656
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
Why are you barking?

657
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,320
Why are you doing it?

658
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,200
You stupid fucking animal, you know who I am.

659
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,720
Why are you making that noise?

660
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,680
I hear that's like beans.

661
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,880
Like every like, like how like beans, you've been living in this house for what?

662
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,480
Like a thousand years now and every day, the same person has walked through the door.

663
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,640
And how could you not have learned that this is a normal occurrence that is not

664
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,360
cause for alarm?

665
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,800
Man, I'm remembering that now.

666
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,480
Thank God Sessho is not like that.

667
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,560
He is quiet.

668
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,640
He's just fine.

669
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,520
That's that's the one that's beans is version of shitting out of loneliness.

670
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Yeah, you know, it's such bullshit that all my life, people told

671
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,360
me and tried to indoctrinate me to the idea that like the stegosaurus had a

672
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,040
tiny little walnut brain.

673
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,400
I know that dogs have a smaller brain than a fucking stegosaurus.

674
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,720
I don't believe that the stegosaurus would ever attack me just for coming in my

675
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,520
friend's house.

676
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,720
Probably I got a friend's house.

677
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,320
If he had a stegosaurus a lot more, you can ride that guy.

678
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,040
It'd be awesome.

679
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,280
I mean, it wouldn't be comfortable because stegosaurus has those things on his

680
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,040
back, the place.

681
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,680
I mean, maybe maybe you could like sit between them.

682
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,320
I mean, it would be the most comfortable to ride a triceratops because they have

683
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,280
like that shield in the front with the crest in the back of their heads and the

684
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,840
three horns.

685
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,400
I thought a lot about this.

686
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,160
I thought a lot about what dinosaurs are best to have own ride and be Fred.

687
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,440
Yeah.

688
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,280
I got bit by the neighbor's dog.

689
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,240
Fucking.

690
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,200
Have that kind of dog.

691
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,720
I don't know.

692
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,240
Some like not even like a good looking dog either.

693
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,320
Like I'm so sick of people with stupid, goofy looking dogs.

694
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Like he's got this like mutant and this big like this like curly white.

695
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,520
It looks like a like a cartoon poodle.

696
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,440
Only it's like as big as a big dog.

697
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,920
It's just the stupidest, fluffiest looking sack of shit I've ever seen.

698
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,520
Just looking at it makes me mad.

699
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,880
Listening to it makes me mad.

700
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,480
So I already wanted to kill it before it attacked me.

701
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,320
But like, you know, maybe it's your animosity.

702
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,360
I've fantasized about being attacked by a dog and just just clock it in the

703
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,760
brain.

704
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,160
Oh, dude.

705
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

706
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,360
Oh, that's what that's exactly what happened.

707
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,480
That's oh, yeah, good.

708
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,680
I mean, when I when I walk by a house and the dog is bar and a dog starts barking

709
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,000
at me, I like I freeze up and I think like, OK, OK, I'm ready.

710
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,320
If the dog comes barreling, it's like the fence breaks and the dog comes

711
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,040
barreling out like I got to time my swinging back so I can just clock it in

712
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,680
the face right before it gets me.

713
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,920
You get that dog fighting fantasy every time one of them.

714
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,160
I do get the dog, the dog fighting fantasy.

715
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,440
I get that every time it's a dog that barks.

716
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,920
I'm just like, no, fuck you.

717
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,480
If you start shit, I will not.

718
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,080
I'm not afraid to put you down.

719
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,240
I get that you have.

720
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,560
I'll punch a dog.

721
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,480
Yeah, I'll punch a dog.

722
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,920
Like I get that you have teeth and you think that you're a badass because

723
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,560
you've got like sharp teeth and like a long nose and shit.

724
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,520
But like, I've got fists and feet and my feet have shoes on them.

725
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,240
So like, I can't even hurt my toes.

726
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,320
My fucking feet are too strong because of my shoes.

727
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,000
I can kick you or punch you.

728
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,920
I can headbutt you.

729
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,920
I want to headbutt a dog right in the snout.

730
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,760
We're wearing cloth armor.

731
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,680
We probably, we outweigh almost all dogs.

732
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,480
I want to like, if you have, if you have like a jacket on that can be,

733
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,560
that's like leather armor and like leather armor, you know,

734
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,480
they wear that in video games so you know it's tough.

735
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,680
Like if you're playing like a fucking, like a medieval thing.

736
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,840
So if you're like a cool, if you're like a cool punk rocker or something,

737
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,600
so I feel like when I'm in my leather jacket, I feel like, like plus 10

738
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,400
to power or armor or something.

739
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,480
Cause like nothing can hurt me.

740
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,120
So come at me dog, you don't have a jacket.

741
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,720
Yeah.

742
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:39,920
Yeah.

743
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,640
Like the most, the most armor that a dog would ever have is like a sweater.

744
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,480
But even that is not like a little bit of a sweater.

745
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,240
It confers a huge.

746
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,240
Like you've got a sweater, but I could totally take, I could totally take

747
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,880
this dog, but it's fucking, it's like Christmas sweater from grandma.

748
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,200
It's like, I can't penetrate it.

749
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,600
The sweater might protect you a little bit, but hey, I've got like a shirt

750
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,360
and a sweater and a hoodie and a jacket on all at once.

751
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm like, I'm, I'm like a fucking walking tortoise tank.

752
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,920
Nothing can tell you.

753
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,520
I haven't had like the fantasy of like fighting against a dog,

754
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,080
but I have had like the nightmare fantasy of like, what if a dog is just going

755
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,000
to kill me and he wants to rip my leg off and he's big?

756
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,800
Like he probably just could.

757
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,160
Cause I, you know, I've seen, I've seen Game of Thrones.

758
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,600
I know what happens when your dog's upset and he's got a big sharp teeth.

759
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,320
They eat you.

760
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,200
Dogs like, they think that they're wolves.

761
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,600
And that's what, that's what pisses me off is that this, this, this unwarranted

762
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,960
esteem they have of themselves, where they think that they're tough and they

763
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,400
think they're like hot shit because they're like distantly related to

764
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
something that's actually tough and cool and scary.

765
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,160
You're not a wolf.

766
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,160
I don't have to be real cultural appropriation.

767
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,760
That is.

768
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,520
That's true.

769
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,080
The worst is Huskies.

770
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,200
Huskies are the dumbest breed of, of, of dog base.

771
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,120
I mean, maybe there's something.

772
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,760
And it's even more annoying because like, because Huskies are like beautiful

773
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,840
and you want them to be cool because they're like really cool dogs,

774
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,880
but they're also the most one of the most ill behaved.

775
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,880
They just, yeah, they're loud, annoying.

776
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,400
You know, I've often wondered.

777
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,080
So the only weapon that a dog, they're the jocks of dogs, they are the

778
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,080
retarded jocks of dogs.

779
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,640
Good looking, good looking, you know, you know, powerful retard.

780
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,320
Isn't it a bad, a bad design that like a dog's, so wolves have like, I guess

781
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,120
they have claws, right?

782
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,640
They could like, of course they'd hurt you.

783
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:35,960
Okay.

784
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Good looking, no, no dog has that.

785
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,320
They are, they are.

786
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,560
But like, no, I just like that.

787
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,520
It's like a title.

788
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,640
It's when it, when it tries to bite you, like a dog or wolf, it's like brain

789
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,160
dome is right there.

790
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,880
It's right there.

791
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,400
And I feel like I could definitely get a few shots in.

792
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,040
You can crack down on your arm.

793
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,640
Yeah, you could just start punching it in the eyes, you know, something.

794
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,080
That's what I would do.

795
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,480
Yeah.

796
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,520
Yeah, like this fork, this take all but the biggest dogs, even unarmed.

797
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,600
This stupid, like giant poodle fucker from my neighbor that attacked me.

798
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,280
Like what happened was, because like I had just gotten my car.

799
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,200
And you know how like, if you've ever gotten a car, like the first week

800
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,040
something goes wrong and it's the most infuriating thing in the world.

801
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,440
Sure.

802
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:16,680
Right.

803
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,120
So like, right, like the first week I had my car, suddenly the door

804
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,800
wouldn't close and I came to find that like the latch on the door was like rusty

805
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,960
and it wouldn't like latch when I closed the doors.

806
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,400
It would like bounce off the frame when I tried to close the door.

807
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,880
So I'd have to slam it shut.

808
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,720
But then if I like slammed it shut, then I would be stuck in the car

809
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,120
and I wouldn't be able to open it again.

810
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,920
So for, so like I couldn't open the door and I would have to like crawl

811
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,320
over the center console from the passenger door.

812
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,680
It was so horrible.

813
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,080
And like this is a car that I just bought.

814
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,240
It was like, you know, massively expensive.

815
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,360
I was so fucking angry getting in and out of the car.

816
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,680
Like before I fixed this, I did eventually fix it.

817
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,120
But like, like I got out, I drove into my driveway already steaming mad

818
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,640
thinking that it would happen.

819
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,640
And of course it did.

820
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,640
I got out of the car, I go to close the door.

821
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,000
It's it's slams and bounces off the frame a bunch of times.

822
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,440
I can't fucking I'm bouncing it off the frame.

823
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,200
He's going boom, boom.

824
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,480
And it's like it's making like a loud noise every time it's bouncing off the

825
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,600
frame and the loud noise of bouncing off of it is making the neighbor's dog go

826
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,160
fucking ape shit, of course, because God forbid anyone else make a noise.

827
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,880
God forbid anyone but you, the fucking dog is the only one allowed to make

828
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,480
noise in this fucking world.

829
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,760
That's that's just tacitly giving it permission.

830
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,480
Yeah.

831
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,720
So like I'm trying to finally, I fucking am trying to like slam it shut.

832
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,680
And the fucking neighbor she has a door open, I guess, or whatever the fuck.

833
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,360
So the dog runs out, runs at me, literally jumps up and like bites a

834
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:47,640
chunk out of my arm and I fucking I threw it off.

835
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,400
The neighbor lady is like freaking out because like, oh, my God, my dog is

836
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,160
she's thinking that she's going to get sued.

837
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,120
I'm not going to sue anyone.

838
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,440
I'm just going to kill you, lady.

839
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,160
So don't worry.

840
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,800
Right.

841
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,040
I'm going to kill you and your dog and your whole family.

842
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,160
Don't worry about me.

843
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm not going to get involved with lawyers or anything.

844
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,400
But so like I throw the dog off and I'm swearing up a storm and I'm yelling

845
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,040
and the lady's like, oh my God, what happened?

846
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,440
I'm like, shut the fuck up.

847
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,840
And so like the dog is like still barking.

848
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,520
And I swear to God, I had this moment where I just I turned

849
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,760
and I like pennant stared right into the fucking dog's eyes.

850
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,160
I stared right at it.

851
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,560
I just looked at it and I gave it a look and like the dog.

852
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,680
I think in that moment, the dog became aware that I am capable of murder.

853
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,600
And he feared for his life.

854
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,640
And he just like backed away with his stupid tail tucked between his legs.

855
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,560
It was it was it was, you know, annoying, but it was a little bit

856
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,400
uplifting to me to know that I could create a look on my face that

857
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,960
communicates to a lesser beast that I will fuck you up.

858
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,240
Got that you got that conquerors hockey.

859
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:59,560
Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, yeah, the ability to intimidate big power on

860
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,480
on a on a somewhat similar note to the dog fighting fantasy.

861
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,040
I have I have I think about what if my house caught fire?

862
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,000
Could I save my computer?

863
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,800
Yeah, good question.

864
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,680
And then yesterday, someone actually

865
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,120
remember Nuzlocke genocide?

866
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,520
Remember bananas, the masculine? Of course, it was that guy.

867
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,320
It was generally bananas, who was who was the names that he just tweeted

868
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,280
that his house caught fire and but he managed to save his computer.

869
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,840
And I was like, huh, I think about myself in that situation all the time.

870
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,400
So I like, you know, replied like, you know, glad you got the computer out

871
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,360
and also yourself or something.

872
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, yeah, as an afterthought.

873
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,000
And yeah, I don't know.

874
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,600
I often often.

875
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,000
It would be very difficult.

876
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,160
I feel like I mean, I could I think what I would do if my house caught fire

877
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,200
and it was like in like the house is filling up with smoke.

878
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,440
And maybe I just have like maybe a minute, right?

879
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,800
Maybe it's like I need to get out as fast as I can or I'm risking life in limb.

880
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,400
I mean, I think I would probably just, you know, grab my computer tower.

881
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,760
Right. Unplug everything.

882
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,320
Unplug, you know, leave the monitors, leave, whatever, grab my hard drives

883
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,960
and my computer tower and run outside with that.

884
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,280
You know, the other stuff is like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,240
Man, I would be like preserve the preserve the data.

886
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,640
I would be having a real Sophie's choice between my computer tower and my laptop

887
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:35,600
because like like the tower has like Vegas on it and all of my like working stuff.

888
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,680
And like my Vegas was is pirated for me by someone smarter than me.

889
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,840
So if I lose it, if I would never be able to get it back

890
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,440
because I'm not paying for it, I'm too stupid to ever pirate myself.

891
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,800
So like I would I would lose my career if I lost the tower,

892
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,880
which might be a blessing in disguise, but like true.

893
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:01,240
The but the laptop has like everything I've ever written for the last 10 years on it.

894
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:06,800
So like, do I save like 10 years of ideas or do I save the fucking machine

895
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,080
that allows me to put them into use?

896
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,760
Oh, you could get Vegas again.

897
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,640
Do you know like right in Google ducks?

898
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,800
No, I don't because I'm you know what?

899
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,920
I write I have the worst fucking system.

900
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,720
If something happens to the laptop, I'm totally fucked

901
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,600
because I write everything in this MacBook notes program.

902
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,080
And you cannot convert those to anything else.

903
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,040
You can't get them in like a real file.

904
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,440
You can't like move them to the to the tower or back them up.

905
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,000
I figured out I had to look up how to back them up,

906
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,880
but they're still in like a weird format.

907
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,960
I'm fucking so I guess I'm just lying.

908
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,680
I guess I'm fucking make it shit up, but the point is it's like

909
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,840
it's slightly difficult to back up the files.

910
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,040
It's like one extra step so I can never do it effectively impossible.

911
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,440
I have, you know, I have like a lot of the times I will

912
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,400
I have redundant copies of things like I have show on my computer.

913
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,920
I have some of the stuff is backed up for my old computer.

914
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,800
Some of that stuff is backed up for my old laptop.

915
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,600
Some of that stuff is backed up on Google Drive or, you know, in Google documents or whatever.

916
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,240
Yeah, I have no idea.

917
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,720
Like it's it's a lot of it is redundant, but I have no clue where I saved anything.

918
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,880
Like I have a bunch of email accounts and like, you know,

919
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,440
who fucking knows where like which account I saved what in.

920
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,760
Right. Right.

921
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,920
So like a lot of stuff probably would be recoverable,

922
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,760
even if my computer was destroyed, but it would be a huge hassle.

923
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,800
And then not everything, especially the newer stuff.

924
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,360
Yeah, I mean, I'm basically the same, but I do basically organize things by like category.

925
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,240
Like I've got like best guy ever, then I've got like a bunch of personal ones

926
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,800
and I've got like a professional one and yeah, so like I keep them separate.

927
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,560
I'm pretty good. I'm pretty good on that.

928
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,640
You guys's file management sounds terrifying to me

929
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,840
because I'm constantly paranoid about my data being deleted

930
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,960
because I've had too many bad experiences and I know it's a matter of time.

931
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,120
So what I did any of us long ago and thank God I did it when I did

932
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,120
because they don't do this anymore is the dropbox.

933
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,880
Right. I have all my important shit in Dropbox

934
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,520
and Dropbox is the best program ever made because what it does

935
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,800
is that everything's backed up to the cloud, but it also makes a local copy on your computer.

936
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,040
So it's always local, you never have to download anything,

937
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,520
but it's always being backed up all the time.

938
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,920
And then everything on Dropbox has revision history.

939
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,320
So if I ever accidentally save something I don't want to,

940
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,200
I just go to Dropbox.com and just roll back to the previous version.

941
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,680
And it's right back on my computer.

942
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,400
So it's the best thing ever made by even.

943
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,120
That's pretty good.

944
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,840
But here's that's pretty here's the problem.

945
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:43,440
The problem is Dropbox is only two gigs for free, which is not enough space.

946
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,680
So what they had back in the day was a referral program back when Dropbox was new.

947
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,680
It was like everybody you get to sign up for Dropbox,

948
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,240
you get an extra 250 megs on your free space.

949
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,760
And I'm like, and this is back in the pony days.

950
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,120
And I was like, I can abuse this.

951
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,640
So I go on D and I go on Twitter and I'm just like, use this link, just do it.

952
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,120
And now I'm up to like 25 gigs for free on Dropbox and that's enough.

953
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,000
That's enough for all my essential shit.

954
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,960
So I've screwed the system over.

955
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,600
And now every time I get a new computer or set something up, which is all the time,

956
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,280
I just download Dropbox and everything's there.

957
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,640
And I feel like God and I don't worry about files ever.

958
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,160
Well, I'm a little jealous.

959
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,920
That's pretty good.

960
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,040
Although, I mean, 25 gigs is not.

961
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,840
I mean, like I just I got a new I just got a new hard drive.

962
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,400
And I think it was Fat 32, that fucking villain.

963
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,960
The ultimate arch nemesis of the PC.

964
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,440
Yeah, yeah, because like there was some video files that I was moving

965
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,880
and I think it wouldn't take them because they were over four gigs.

966
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,800
Ugh, maybe it's actually like a squad.

967
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,480
It's the Fat 32 and it's 32 fat dudes.

968
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,840
Well, Fat 32 is evil and he's fat because he ate one through 31.

969
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,720
Can't wait for him to make his official debut in the Royal Rumble at Rat Cross.

970
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,240
The Royal Rumble. Hell yeah.

971
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,440
So, but I reformatted it.

972
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,680
You know, I finally finally I can use it now.

973
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,560
So I've got new space.

974
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,720
The problem is just choosing what I want to get off my main because

975
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,960
because like recording this, I only have like nine gigs free

976
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,720
on my main hard drive for some reason.

977
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,960
I don't know why that is because I had like 15 yesterday and I don't know what happened.

978
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,080
You got to download Windows, stat, Windows, directories.

979
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:16,960
You know what?

980
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,840
I'm going to empty my recycle bin right now.

981
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,760
Maybe that will help.

982
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,400
That's a good idea.

983
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,520
That's great.

984
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,720
But, you know, at work, you know, because I software program and all that,

985
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,720
we we we heavily and strictly control all file updates that get checked

986
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:37,880
into our our VCR or VC, whatever, our version control software, VCS, I guess.

987
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,960
Oh, you know, you know, Hippo, I do I do use Windows stat that you recommended to me.

988
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,000
It's great.

989
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,520
Yeah, it shows you like a visualization of your hard drive in terms of like how

990
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,280
much space is taken up by what and you can sort of like look.

991
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,920
Yeah, yeah. And I want that right now, dude.

992
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,320
It's the best it shows you like a grid and you can just look at like

993
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,600
the biggest squares in the grid and it'll tell you like, Oh, yeah.

994
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,760
This is, you know, HTTP colon slash slash pornography folder.

995
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,800
Oh, hell yeah.

996
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,960
Hell, yeah, yeah, yeah.

997
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,800
I have a funny story with Windows stat, which is not really funny,

998
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,840
but I just find it in music because I'm a tech guy is that I bought this

999
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,000
like I bought a tower when I when I moved in with the digits.

1000
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,360
Now I can have a tower again.

1001
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,400
And I got this like HP workstation like super cheap because it's like old,

1002
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,640
but it's still like super powerful.

1003
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,680
It's one of those computers that used to cost like $6,000 when it came out.

1004
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,120
So now it's only like 500, but it's still good.

1005
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,600
So I was like, I'm poor, so I'll get that.

1006
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:35,360
And it has 48 gigs of RAM and two six core processors.

1007
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,640
Dang, that's not very much.

1008
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,680
It's a lot. It's a lot.

1009
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,760
It's a fuck ton.

1010
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,400
Oh, oh, oh, of RAM, 48 gigs of RAM.

1011
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,320
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1012
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,160
So so I was using it and I realized immediately that I was running out of space.

1013
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,600
And I'm like, how is this possible?

1014
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,440
Because I have a 250, 60 SSD.

1015
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,760
I should have space.

1016
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,640
And then I opened up Windows that I was like, oh, of course,

1017
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,760
what Windows does is every time what it does, it makes like a swap file

1018
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,960
on your hard drive, like has like reserve space and it defaults to double your RAM size.

1019
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,200
So I just have 96 gigs of my 250 SSD is a swap file.

1020
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,560
And I'm just like, oh, fuck.

1021
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,560
I guess when you have this much RAM, you need more hard drive space now.

1022
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,000
And it was just like this huge fucking enormous square on Windows.

1023
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,960
That like what in God's name is that?

1024
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,320
And it's just like the fucking cache file that you can't get rid of.

1025
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,400
I'm like, OK, well, shit.

1026
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,880
I'm your fuck, dude.

1027
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,080
Your fuck. But I have 48 gigs.

1028
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,080
I feel I feel like I should mention just in case people don't know.

1029
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,880
But on Google Docs,

1030
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,480
documents that are just writing take up zero space.

1031
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,120
They do. You can have an unlimited amount of those.

1032
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,120
It's a very valuable thing to know, which is why I think, Jesse,

1033
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,520
if you can, like try to copy paste all of those onto there.

1034
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,200
Yeah, that's a really good idea. You'll never run out.

1035
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,120
What if what if what do you know how like on Microsoft Word,

1036
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,480
you can like embed music and stuff into documents and things like that?

1037
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,480
What if you could do that on Google Drive and they still took up zero space,

1038
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,640
just have this crazy piracy network where it's just like every MP3 ever in a document.

1039
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,360
It takes up zero space on your drive.

1040
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,520
That would be pretty dope.

1041
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,960
Hey, hey, I've got the system works.

1042
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,360
I've got an update for people from last PCP.

1043
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,080
If you recall, Redaway, run every day until I'm hot.

1044
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,160
Yeah, the program I'm doing now, I just want to give everybody an update.

1045
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,440
I'm doing it so far. No flaws. Perfect job.

1046
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,160
I am the best.

1047
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,240
But I have something retarded to say about that.

1048
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,720
When you when I first heard Redaway run every day until I'm hot,

1049
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,520
I did Redaway.

1050
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,280
I did not. I did not realize that the hot was your physical experience.

1051
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,280
I thought you just meant run until you felt hot, like got hot.

1052
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,920
Oh, I'm like, that sounds like a really pushy running regimen.

1053
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,120
That'll take like a minute.

1054
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,760
What? No. God damn it.

1055
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,560
It's a lifestyle change.

1056
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,840
Until you start to say, yeah, that's not like, whoa, that's enough, man.

1057
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,040
That's initially what I thought it meant.

1058
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,760
And I was like, well, I guess that will slowly get better as your endurance increases.

1059
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,640
But but then I realized, oh, I'm being a fool because I'm not thinking of Nate that way.

1060
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,880
Well, apparently, other people thought that too.

1061
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,760
So OK, OK, OK, OK, well, no, it's about about changing lifestyle.

1062
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,280
So so actually, a dude messaged me the other day.

1063
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,120
This was yesterday and he sent me he heard of my epic tale

1064
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,120
from the last PCP episode.

1065
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,240
Wait, which epic tale about how I'm doing this, how I'm doing this.

1066
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,840
OK, this is Captain Suppey.

1067
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,560
I've heard the name somewhere before.

1068
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:45,080
But he apparently is like a dope ass run boy who runs like,

1069
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,400
I don't know, it's not professional.

1070
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,160
He's not his college team or something.

1071
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:55,160
He sent me a big old document illustrating how my efforts are are going to overtax my body

1072
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,280
because I'm going to fuck myself up if I actually run every day as as like a noob, which I am.

1073
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,840
And so he just broke it down into like a bunch of sections for like for your first

1074
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,040
like two to three. What would he say?

1075
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,080
Let me let me let me.

1076
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:07,800
This is funny, actually.

1077
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,080
Let me read like the little intro thing you put here.

1078
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,680
Let me see. OK, so this is his intro paragraph, which is I like this a lot

1079
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,480
because what he's doing is he's establishing why I should care about his opinion,

1080
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,520
which is the most important thing with this.

1081
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,840
So yeah, that's the stick.

1082
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,200
That's the sticking point for me.

1083
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,040
Yeah, of course, because like he could just be some fat nobody who doesn't know a goddamn thing.

1084
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,240
But he says, OK, I want to preface this by saying I know my shit.

1085
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,600
Oh, by the way, he wrote this whole thing yesterday while high

1086
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,840
as he explained to me as he was doing it.

1087
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,360
OK, so I've been a runner since I was 12.

1088
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,840
I've done everything from track to cross country, have ran three half marathons,

1089
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,520
have a 455 mile and an 1820 five K PR.

1090
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,600
But I'm going to give you advice based on the fucking casual.

1091
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,720
I know you are. Don't worry.

1092
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,400
I'm not trying to have you break records.

1093
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,120
I know all you want us to lose those annoying small but noticeable flabs.

1094
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,320
So with that, let's just jump into it.

1095
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,000
And then he just breaks it down for like a couple of weeks.

1096
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,760
And he says to run like starts off two to three times per week

1097
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,960
and then up to like four to five times per week and shit.

1098
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,680
But it's good. And you see, I just I want to use this as an example.

1099
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:21,120
People of even though my program definitely was not optimal, it was not perfect.

1100
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,960
It got me going and it gets people.

1101
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,320
I know I have an internet presence, so like I'm more likely to get things like this.

1102
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,360
But like, maybe you know somebody in your life.

1103
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,360
I'm just saying the the power of doing something as opposed to nothing

1104
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,120
to get you moving in the right direction is a very strong thing.

1105
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,720
I appreciate this guy's effort and his credentials do seem good,

1106
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,520
especially if they're assuming they're true, which I don't know.

1107
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,560
But on the other hand, you got to you got to think about our boy

1108
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:52,560
Saitama, who just ran every day and became the strongest man in the universe.

1109
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,520
So I don't know. One of these people.

1110
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,680
So this guy wants this guy wants you to miss out on that.

1111
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,960
Yeah, that's trying to sabotage.

1112
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,080
You know, the one thing about this is I was saying this last time

1113
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,960
and I still think this is true.

1114
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:10,520
It's easier for me to just say I need to run every day like to myself as a rule

1115
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,640
as opposed to, oh, yeah, I'm going to run like three times per week.

1116
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,520
And I'll just mark those on the calendar because then like I might just fuck up and be like, oh, I feel the same way.

1117
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,640
Do you have the problem that I have?

1118
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,800
Do you have the problem of like universal willpower?

1119
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,280
Do what I mean by that is that, OK, I'll just use an example.

1120
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,360
Thanksgiving just happened a couple of days ago.

1121
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,160
And broke Keto to do Thanksgiving.

1122
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,320
I was doing right. Are you back on Keto?

1123
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,520
I kind of thought you had quit.

1124
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,320
I was I'm considering it still.

1125
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,680
I'm trying to like I'm trying what I'm trying to do right now is before I just quit completely.

1126
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,440
I'm just trying to cut out diet soda entirely because I don't know if it's diet.

1127
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,240
So that's making me sick or just the diet in general.

1128
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,440
And feel sick, Ben. So that's the priority, whatever.

1129
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,320
OK, yeah, but the thing is the point of coming with like universal willpower is that

1130
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,320
so I broke Keto to like, you know, be with family, have have food,

1131
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,960
be a disgusting degenerate, eating sugar.

1132
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,760
Yep. Sugar actually tasted odd and I didn't like it.

1133
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,160
But that's great. That's a side point.

1134
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,480
But but after that, like for the last couple of days,

1135
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,880
I have like been significantly weaker, not only in my diet, but in everything.

1136
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,720
Like getting to work takes more effort now.

1137
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,120
Being like getting up at a decent hour, which has always been bad, is more difficult.

1138
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,880
I rolled out of bed because I got a message from my phone,

1139
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,040
which was Nate saying it's PCP time.

1140
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,200
I'm like, fuck, it was like eight, like three seconds ago.

1141
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,000
So just just just one breaking of like habit has ruined everything.

1142
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,640
Everything's all tied together. It's the worst.

1143
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:44,240
And if you want to be a god, you have to be perfect because that's what a god is.

1144
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,080
Yes. I mean, yeah, yeah.

1145
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,400
Yeah, as soon as you succumb to one weakness of the flesh,

1146
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,320
it all comes crumbling down like that.

1147
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,320
I definitely feel like the big way went out to Boston.

1148
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,320
It's the way what what did you fuck up in Boston?

1149
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,040
We went to Boston and we were playing Jenga

1150
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,720
and I totally fucked it up last minute and it was it was sick.

1151
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,360
Did did you lose?

1152
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,760
I was the one who lost Jenga.

1153
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,080
Yeah, it's my hand tremble because I had I remember I had a good move

1154
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,160
where I hand trembled and it all went to fucking shit.

1155
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,360
And Munchy was playing.

1156
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,480
I was trying to do it to put way more pressure on me.

1157
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,480
In we played Jenga in that in that like China Chinatown like bubble tea shop

1158
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,720
and they had like all the the bricks for the Jenga set had like shit written on them.

1159
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,640
And some of them just had people's phone numbers written on them.

1160
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,200
And I just picked one up and called in in in the store.

1161
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,920
Is it a local hot mom looking for a quick sex?

1162
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,000
It sounded like no joke.

1163
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,520
It sounded like a cutie Asian honey pie.

1164
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,400
Yeah, it sounded like a cute Asian girl who was like really shy.

1165
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,200
And like she was like, hello, like I didn't even hear any words.

1166
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,920
Right. I heard like some kind of whisper, some sort of like vague whisper

1167
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,440
of like acknowledgement that a phone call had been received.

1168
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,680
And I just said like, hello, you know, I found your number on a Jenga block.

1169
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,680
And I just wanted to say that you're that, you know, have a

1170
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,200
they want to wish you a happy day and let you know that you're a good person or something.

1171
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,360
And she just started laughing.

1172
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,400
That's funny. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1173
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,640
She literally should have married this woman while you had.

1174
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,640
I mean, I made, I took pains to make this not a traumatic or scary experience.

1175
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,720
It was an oddly upbeat interaction.

1176
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,560
Yeah, you've got her number, though, and she can't escape that.

1177
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,880
It's true. I guess so.

1178
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,640
I guess it's in my phone somewhere.

1179
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,720
If I wanted to wait a little bit longer, then you just hit her up again.

1180
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,440
You're like, so what are you doing?

1181
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,480
No, why not? Remember that time?

1182
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,320
Remember that time I found your number on a Jenga block.

1183
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,120
Well, it's time to pay the pipe. Yeah.

1184
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,160
She could be 45 or, I don't know, who knows, with these Asian ladies

1185
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,960
sounding young when they're not, I don't know.

1186
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,520
But anyway, hey, hey, Captain Suppy, I'm sure that he's like correct in his plan,

1187
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,440
but I still feel a desire to do it every day.

1188
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,360
So I'm going to probably keep doing that, at least for a little while.

1189
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,880
Although my left ankle, something's going on there.

1190
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,920
That's not great.

1191
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,840
But it's it's it's the muscle.

1192
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,440
It's not like the bones or anything.

1193
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,960
I just I probably need to just stretch if I just do that.

1194
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,600
Because, you know, my runs are pussy shit.

1195
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,240
They're half an hour and I take a like a bunch of breaks.

1196
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,520
And I just like, I'm tired, I need to walk for a minute.

1197
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,200
So whatever, I'm working on it.

1198
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,520
But I'm going to follow this Bible.

1199
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,480
He sent me some good shit, some good shit.

1200
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,920
Anyway, there's your update, people.

1201
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,640
I am a good to be a god.

1202
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,640
By the time I get to Hawaii, I need to be hot.

1203
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,400
That's my goal. So I'm losing weight.

1204
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,120
Keto Keto Keto story.

1205
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,120
I went to Thanksgiving.

1206
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,640
Didn't break Keto.

1207
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,320
Well, I kind of did a little bit in the sense.

1208
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,680
I mean, I eat I eat turkey and I eat like, you know,

1209
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,240
Brussels sprouts and, you know, green beans.

1210
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,480
You know, I basically just ate turkey and greens.

1211
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,800
And the only questionable things ate where I ate pumpkin seeds,

1212
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,600
thinking that they were keto.

1213
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,200
But I looked it up later and they actually you have some carbs.

1214
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,040
And all they, you know, I didn't eat that many of them.

1215
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,880
So whatever. OK, that wasn't great.

1216
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,240
But it was and then there were these things that there were these weird

1217
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,440
things that like aunt Sonny made or someone made them.

1218
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:12,400
And they were made of almond butter rolled with like some kind of seed.

1219
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,360
And they had like they had some dried cherries in them.

1220
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,480
And they said a little bit of maple syrup.

1221
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,480
And I had one or two of those.

1222
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,360
This is so they had a little bit.

1223
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,240
Are they good? Yeah, they weren't they weren't super sweet.

1224
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,600
Like they weren't sweet like a dessert or anything.

1225
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,960
So I felt like these can't be too bad.

1226
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,400
Um, yeah, they were all right.

1227
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,840
I mean, I just really like almond butter, really like I love nut butters.

1228
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,520
All about those nut butters.

1229
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,040
Hey, listen to me talking about food.

1230
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,120
I'm like some kind of idiot talking about a dog.

1231
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,520
What a fucking joke.

1232
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,760
Hey, hippo, why don't you fucking celebrate Thanksgiving?

1233
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,960
Oh, why don't you?

1234
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,320
Why don't you? Why aren't you thankful for America?

1235
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,920
Because I don't care.

1236
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,480
I'm not that thankful.

1237
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,600
What have you made for for the rest of us?

1238
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,240
I've got peanut butter.

1239
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,240
You ever heard of George Washington Carver?

1240
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,240
Inventor a peanut butter.

1241
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,840
Have you ever heard of Pokemon Go?

1242
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,480
I ain't never eaten a peanut butter ever.

1243
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,160
What about freedom? We invented that.

1244
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,800
We invented both slavery and freedom.

1245
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,760
We invented bald eagles.

1246
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,240
We probably invented guns.

1247
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,280
That might even be true.

1248
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:29,840
I don't know.

1249
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:33,840
Oh, right.

1250
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,960
I saw I saw Princess Mona.

1251
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,160
All right, please, please enlighten me because we do.

1252
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,520
Obviously, we don't celebrate Thanksgiving

1253
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,080
because it is an American tradition,

1254
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,840
but I don't actually know what I like.

1255
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,480
It's something to do with the Native American.

1256
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,880
It's literally a celebration of genocide.

1257
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,680
No, it's not exaggeration.

1258
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,000
I mean, that's just how it's started.

1259
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,920
It's an exaggeration, but I mean, yeah, it is.

1260
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,480
I was arguing with Michelle about this.

1261
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,800
What you celebrate on Thanksgiving

1262
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,960
is specifically the event

1263
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,400
where the Pilgrims and the Indians work together

1264
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,680
and were harmonious.

1265
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,840
You're not celebrating.

1266
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,480
Look, yes, there were genocides later,

1267
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,400
but you're not celebrating that.

1268
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,520
It was like that first year or something

1269
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,520
when the Indians or the Native Americans

1270
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,800
shared with the Pilgrims so that they wouldn't start.

1271
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,520
So it was like a thank you

1272
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,200
in the form of giving food from one to the other for like, okay.

1273
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,840
It was like coming together with people.

1274
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,720
It was like a thanks for sharing harmony.

1275
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,800
Nobody really cares about the Pilgrims, though.

1276
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,320
It's mainly like a celebration of family

1277
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,720
and hanging out with your loved ones.

1278
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,040
Well, yeah, I know that from watching

1279
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:46,000
all those funny American cartoons about families.

1280
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,720
Is there a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving?

1281
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,280
Yeah, there's gotta be, right?

1282
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,120
Yes.

1283
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,240
I think I've only seen the most offensive video version

1284
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,760
of that and all other Charlie Brown specials.

1285
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,680
Is it, suck my big black ass Charlie Brown?

1286
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,960
Is that, that's actually the name too.

1287
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,480
There is one that is called that.

1288
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,120
I think it's the Valentine's Day.

1289
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,960
I don't know.

1290
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,320
You know, there's a thing about Thanksgiving.

1291
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,240
It's like a small gripe

1292
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,680
because it's not really a thing

1293
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,040
that has ever been like pushed.

1294
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,920
But I get this feeling that on social media,

1295
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,800
people don't, you know, they say thanks.

1296
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,640
They say a funny meme thanks

1297
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,720
because it's Thanksgiving where they are.

1298
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,720
And it's like, there's this slight implication

1299
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,400
that you should be saying thanks in general.

1300
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,320
Like it's not about Thanksgiving necessarily

1301
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,160
on the internet.

1302
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,800
It's just about saying thank you for stuff you have.

1303
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,800
And I'm like, well, I mean, I know it's Thanksgiving

1304
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,080
because everyone talks about it.

1305
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,400
And I'm like, I'm thankful for things,

1306
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,760
but I don't wanna be involved.

1307
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,480
It's not my culture.

1308
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,800
I don't know what to do.

1309
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,640
It would be cultural appropriation.

1310
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,640
It's not even about like cultural appropriation.

1311
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,840
I just don't wanna be associated with this American,

1312
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,200
this gross.

1313
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,360
I mean, yeah, I don't think any,

1314
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,400
I wouldn't expect outside cultures

1315
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,920
to like recognize American holidays or anything.

1316
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:11,520
Yeah, I mean, it's just hard to like, to look away.

1317
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,560
Imagine like you don't celebrate Christmas.

1318
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,680
And then every year there's a lot of Christmas stuff

1319
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,360
on everything and you can't really get away from it.

1320
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,240
And it's like, I don't really wanna do about this.

1321
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,680
I understand why I have to commit acts of terror.

1322
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,480
This cannot stand.

1323
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,320
We have to cease this, this oppression and bullying.

1324
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,800
It's not bullying, I don't feel bad about it.

1325
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,240
I was just thinking about it.

1326
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,840
Cause like I don't wanna say,

1327
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,840
oh, I hate being thankful cause I don't.

1328
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,800
I like being thankful, but it's just, it's not the time.

1329
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,240
It's not yet the time.

1330
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,080
Rattitude is a virtue in my humble opinion,

1331
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,840
but yes, I understand your point.

1332
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,080
It can be annoying.

1333
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,280
By the way, I've opened up this Winder Stat shit,

1334
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,200
it looks insane and it's pretty cool.

1335
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,200
I don't get it, but I like it.

1336
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,920
It's like hover over the squares

1337
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,960
and you'll see at the bottom,

1338
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,800
it'll show you like what files you're gonna get.

1339
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,400
You click on, you click on the squares

1340
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,280
and it will show you where that file is and what it is.

1341
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,440
Let's link this in the show notes.

1342
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,040
Let me, I'm gonna give people a screencap

1343
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,240
of my breakdown of my drives.

1344
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,360
Hopefully this doesn't contain secret information

1345
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,640
that you shouldn't know.

1346
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,440
But like if you look on the right there.

1347
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,280
Best guy air videos from 2013

1348
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,720
that still haven't been made yet.

1349
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,200
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

1350
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,440
Look at this, look at this.

1351
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,880
What do you think those,

1352
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,160
the biggest ones here are those blue squares

1353
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,240
on the top right.

1354
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,600
What do you think those are?

1355
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,360
I mean, I would imagine that they're probably

1356
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,160
like system files or something.

1357
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,000
No, they're not.

1358
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,880
They're actually, well, I'll just tell ya.

1359
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,000
Those are the video files

1360
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,600
specifically of the Final Fantasy lecture.

1361
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,880
That's what those are.

1362
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,120
Oh, okay.

1363
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:44,960
Yeah, sure.

1364
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,160
That's dope, that's dope as shit, dude.

1365
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,480
Fuck.

1366
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:53,680
VLC media files, 1.4 terabytes, yeah.

1367
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,200
This is so good, cause okay,

1368
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,720
one of these is Tom's lecture backup.

1369
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,040
So like that lower blue square,

1370
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,080
that's the backup file that I was holding on to

1371
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,560
of Tom's lecture backup of the Guilty Gear.

1372
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,680
I could probably fucking delete that at this point.

1373
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,520
Don't need that anymore.

1374
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,720
I think anyone needs that.

1375
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,040
That'd be nice space to have.

1376
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:10,880
It's cool, right?

1377
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,200
It's good to see it visually.

1378
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,240
It is so good.

1379
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,280
It's great.

1380
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,160
You completely forget like,

1381
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,400
cause every time I render any video,

1382
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,040
I usually hand break it,

1383
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,400
which reduces the file size,

1384
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,400
but often I forget to get rid of the original.

1385
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,240
Yeah.

1386
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,080
And seeing that is like,

1387
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:26,920
oh, that huge thing,

1388
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,040
that's the podcast from a few weeks ago

1389
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:29,880
that I forgot to delete.

1390
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,880
I have so sick.

1391
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,840
I have so many files from old PCP episodes.

1392
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,680
Me too, me too.

1393
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,120
Do not need to be saved.

1394
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,680
They definitely are not necessary anymore.

1395
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,280
Yeah, I probably have like 50 or more gigs of that shit.

1396
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,040
Yeah, this is Tom Black's program.

1397
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,680
Yeah, this is the Black Friday deal.

1398
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,640
Get this for zero money because it's free.

1399
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,920
Instead of buying a new hard drive for Christmas,

1400
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,560
get this and get rid of old shit.

1401
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,400
You know what though?

1402
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,280
On this subject,

1403
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,680
one other factor of this is,

1404
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,800
I am terrified of deleting source files

1405
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,600
and then the project disappeared.

1406
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,280
Like I've backed up like all best guy ever videos in places,

1407
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,280
but almost like all their components.

1408
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,880
What if I delete like my audio from a PCP episode

1409
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,200
and then like the episode is taken down

1410
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,280
and we need to re-render it or something?

1411
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,120
I feel the same.

1412
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,840
Yeah, I have the same thing.

1413
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,080
Yeah, I have all that shit.

1414
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,960
I've thought about that,

1415
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,200
but I also think having the original files

1416
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,880
is something that you would need

1417
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,960
if you're like the Beatles

1418
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,680
and you want to remaster the fucking Beatles albums.

1419
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,280
A PCP episode, it's not really that important.

1420
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,120
You're right on that.

1421
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:41,960
You're right on that.

1422
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,040
People have been able to download the MP3s forever.

1423
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:45,880
That's true.

1424
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,400
Things are saved in ways that...

1425
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,640
Even if like our channel disappeared tomorrow,

1426
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,160
like we would still have all the necessary...

1427
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,200
Yeah, and also we'd also be still here.

1428
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,960
We could just make new episodes.

1429
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,880
We can download at our leisure at any point.

1430
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,720
You know what though?

1431
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,320
I'll give you the biggest example.

1432
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,840
The most ancient thing I unearthed and like re-rendered

1433
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,080
was at one point,

1434
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,480
I can't remember what it was for,

1435
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,320
but at one point,

1436
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,520
because I still have all the original files

1437
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,200
for best anime ever,

1438
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,520
Gurrenlog in part two on my currently,

1439
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,760
not my current machine, my old machine,

1440
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,800
which is still hooked up.

1441
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,120
Like I re-rendered a certain section.

1442
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,960
Oh, you know what it was?

1443
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,560
I had to re-render the personal fucking responsibility clip

1444
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,560
for the Mia Maffova song that I did

1445
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,320
for Mia Maffova last year,

1446
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,080
because I wanted to render it without the backing audio track,

1447
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,160
but I wanted to keep the visuals and stuff.

1448
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,800
So that particular section,

1449
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,520
I'm sure glad I still had that,

1450
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,200
so I was able to reproduce it for the highest quality.

1451
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,600
But like, even if I hadn't kept it,

1452
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,480
all that would have changed

1453
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,160
is that I would have used a clip

1454
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,920
that just had the music in it

1455
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,960
and then just kind of like fucked with the levels

1456
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,160
to like lower it and shit.

1457
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,600
Or you could have just re-recorded saying that.

1458
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,720
I can't do that.

1459
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,200
I need to preserve the quality of the originals.

1460
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,560
Yeah, yeah, that would be like remastering fucking,

1461
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,600
that would be like remastering a symphony of the night

1462
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,680
and changing the dialogue or something.

1463
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,040
He went there late in the year.

1464
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,520
I don't know.

1465
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,960
I feel like if you still have a microphone or a tablet,

1466
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,400
you can recreate things,

1467
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,960
like things get lost all the time.

1468
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,160
I don't feel, I feel like...

1469
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,920
Nate, I feel your same dedication

1470
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,080
to preserving the original.

1471
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:30,920
Thank you.

1472
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,760
Thank you.

1473
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,600
Yeah, I get it.

1474
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,440
I get it.

1475
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,040
Like I feel that way about the original versions

1476
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,520
of certain video games where every digital version

1477
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,720
sucks for some reason.

1478
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,000
I don't know why.

1479
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,280
All the remasters of Final Fantasy IX

1480
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,640
have like really shitty background art now.

1481
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,960
Yeah, I've seen those.

1482
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,200
I want to buy the original just for that reason.

1483
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,880
But like for videos on the internet,

1484
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,960
like I mean specifically my videos on the internet,

1485
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,040
I don't really care.

1486
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:04,840
I'm sure people do care, but like if my channel gets deleted,

1487
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,240
it would take a lot of my time and effort

1488
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,680
to re-upload the files I have.

1489
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,520
Yep.

1490
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,120
I don't know whether I'd even try.

1491
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,560
Damn, well, I mean,

1492
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,120
I definitely don't feel that way personally.

1493
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,000
But it would, I don't know.

1494
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,360
Not everything that's on there

1495
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,560
would I feel the need to resurrect probably,

1496
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,520
though I'd want to.

1497
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,320
I have zero backup of any of my video content

1498
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,520
because I care that little about it.

1499
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,360
Oh, God.

1500
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,360
Oh, that's time for ya.

1501
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,520
Hey, speaking of the lectures,

1502
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,520
you mentioned the lectures looking at these files.

1503
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,480
So here's something that I'm going through.

1504
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,720
Here's something that I'm dealing with right now.

1505
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,920
So over the last while,

1506
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,000
I have been sort of talking to Laserbot,

1507
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
a Camry Blankenship, the creator of Tales Gets Trolled.

1508
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,640
And I friended him on Facebook

1509
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,120
and like he knew he'd seen the lecture,

1510
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,000
like he knew who I was more or less.

1511
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,320
Yeah.

1512
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,880
And we sort of start like casually talking,

1513
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,080
like every few days we'd send a message

1514
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,640
back and forth or whatever.

1515
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,360
And I tell him like,

1516
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,440
hey, it would be really cool to have you on our podcast.

1517
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,880
And he was like, okay, cool.

1518
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,800
Well, I don't have any internet right now.

1519
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,880
I don't have a good microphone.

1520
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,080
I don't have a good internet connection.

1521
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,520
But when I do, I'm interested.

1522
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,480
And I would like to talk about this new project

1523
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,320
that I'm working on.

1524
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,160
Well, it's not new.

1525
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,480
He's remaking an old series

1526
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,800
that he had on his YouTube channel.

1527
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,800
I think I've mentioned it before.

1528
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,960
It's called Micorat.

1529
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,800
Right.

1530
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,080
And I'm like, yeah, we can talk about Micorat.

1531
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,720
Like I'd love to get you on the show.

1532
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,880
I'm like, we can talk about whatever you're working on.

1533
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,400
Just want to fucking chat and it would be super cool.

1534
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,560
So that we proceed under that pretense

1535
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,640
for maybe like a month or two.

1536
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,520
And then fine, like I watch all of Micorat.

1537
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,560
Like I tell him, like, you know, it's interesting,

1538
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,560
you know, it's interesting to see

1539
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,440
how you've evolved as of whatever, you know,

1540
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,800
I want to know, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.

1541
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,040
Let's talk about Micorat.

1542
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,680
You know, I want to talk about

1543
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,720
Tails Goods Troll and all that too.

1544
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,280
Like, but yeah, we can get on, talk about Micorat.

1545
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,440
We can promote the remake of Micorat.

1546
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:23,520
And then, and then he's just like, oh yeah.

1547
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,920
This was so infuriating to me.

1548
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,760
He's like, well, I still don't have a good internet connection.

1549
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,800
I still don't have a good microphone.

1550
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,520
The best I can, the best I can do for you

1551
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:40,520
is give you permission to talk about Micorat on.

1552
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,800
And I'm like, I have not responded to this

1553
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,680
because this is so infuriating because that's nothing.

1554
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,800
What he's saying he can do for me is nothing.

1555
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,000
I mean, you know, that's an acceptable amount

1556
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,840
if he just doesn't want anything.

1557
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,760
Oh, sure.

1558
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,680
Okay, but then what the fuck have we been talking about?

1559
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:00,960
He's like, he doesn't need to give me permission

1560
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,280
to talk about his fucking YouTube series.

1561
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,600
True, true.

1562
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,400
I'm so fucking mad.

1563
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,680
He fucking strung me along.

1564
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,520
Well, that's understood.

1565
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,360
For what?

1566
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,000
You were the one doing all the work there

1567
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
because we've been talking about getting him on possibly

1568
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,520
or talking about his stuff for a while.

1569
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,120
Well, look, I mean, if he didn't want to be on,

1570
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,600
why didn't he just say, first of all,

1571
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,760
I don't understand why not?

1572
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,200
Because no one has ever heard of Micorat.

1573
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,760
Okay, I think it comes down to this.

1574
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,520
Sure, in the abstract, yeah, he'd like to be on.

1575
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,600
I think it's just not that important to him,

1576
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,200
which is fine, which is fine.

1577
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,040
Oh, well fine.

1578
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,360
And it would be nice if he had been clear with you on that.

1579
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:37,560
Well then why did we even have this fucking exchange?

1580
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,520
What was the point?

1581
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,480
I'm so, I'm so annoyed.

1582
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,320
I'm so annoyed about it.

1583
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,040
I mean, the whole like internet thing,

1584
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,200
like I understand people,

1585
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,120
maybe they don't really have control over that,

1586
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,440
but yeah, I mean, you got control over this other stuff.

1587
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,040
I mean, if he didn't want to, then, you know,

1588
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,040
it would have been nice to let you know a little sooner.

1589
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,080
I don't know, I just,

1590
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,080
I wonder if he even really has no internet connection

1591
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,240
or if he just doesn't feel like doing this,

1592
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,080
and that's just impossible.

1593
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,680
How is he messaging you on Facebook?

1594
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,160
Well, he said he didn't have a stable internet connection.

1595
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,280
So like, whatever that.

1596
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,840
I didn't have a stable internet connection.

1597
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,720
I'm still doing the show today.

1598
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,960
I would literally, if having no microphone,

1599
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,760
if having not a good microphone is the problem,

1600
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,800
I would literally buy him a microphone,

1601
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,680
send him like a $50 microphone,

1602
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,520
which would be good enough.

1603
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,280
I feel this way a lot with people,

1604
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:28,200
like I am a guy who when there's a thing I want to get done,

1605
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,640
I find the points that are the issue,

1606
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,600
we resolve them as quickly and efficiently as possible

1607
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,880
and get to it, but that all hinges on the fact

1608
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,320
that this is actually something people want to happen,

1609
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,880
and maybe that's not the case.

1610
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,720
Maybe that's not.

1611
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,440
Well, yeah, and it's fine.

1612
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,200
Just if he was not interested in doing this,

1613
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,240
why did we proceed for all this time on the idea?

1614
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,080
Here's the theory.

1615
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:48,920
Here's the theory.

1616
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,400
I don't think he's much of a podcaster.

1617
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,520
Maybe he's nervous, and he just doesn't want to,

1618
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,040
a lot of people wouldn't want to say that.

1619
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,320
I'm not talking shit on the guy,

1620
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,480
just some people are like that, so.

1621
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,320
Well, I don't know.

1622
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,640
I might give it another shot.

1623
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,480
I might talk to him again and be like,

1624
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,560
I don't know, I probably shouldn't give up.

1625
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,680
Just level with him, just level with him here.

1626
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,440
Yeah, yeah, I didn't respond to that.

1627
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,560
This was a while ago, actually.

1628
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,760
I didn't respond to that because I was very frustrated,

1629
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,640
and I didn't want to come off as a jerk by saying,

1630
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,040
okay, what you're saying you can do for me is nothing,

1631
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,000
because that's what I wanted to say.

1632
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,840
Because that is.

1633
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,320
So instead you just put on the podcast

1634
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,760
that you wanted to be on that he might listen to at some point.

1635
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,080
His permission to talk about his work is nothing,

1636
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,080
because that's something that I don't need permission to do.

1637
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:34,920
That's true.

1638
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,640
Because someone who already did a huge lecture

1639
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,120
was sorry this whole thing in the first place,

1640
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,120
clearly his permission is not necessary.

1641
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,640
Yeah, but I don't know.

1642
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,120
I mean, God, it'd be so cool, it'd be so funny.

1643
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,280
It'd be so funny to have him on.

1644
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,120
No one's here.

1645
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,040
Because he's not anywhere.

1646
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,280
There are no interviews with him or anything on YouTube

1647
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,480
that I could find when I looked.

1648
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,480
Give it an old college try there, Ben, one more time.

1649
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,760
Yeah, I shouldn't give up.

1650
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,840
I shouldn't give up just yet.

1651
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,320
Look, I mean, if he doesn't want to do it, that's it.

1652
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,720
That's fair enough.

1653
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,400
There needs to be a bro talk here about,

1654
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,480
let's get real behind this wheel, dog,

1655
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,520
and just you want to be on this thing or not.

1656
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:21,040
I want to talk about Micorat, right?

1657
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,800
But I want to talk to you about it, sir.

1658
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,680
I don't have that much to say about it on my own.

1659
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,240
That's not the point here.

1660
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,360
I feel you.

1661
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,640
That's been on your mind.

1662
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,760
That's been a thing you've been dealing with for a while.

1663
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,600
A little bit, yeah.

1664
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,000
I'm glad it's, yeah.

1665
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,360
I was really looking forward to maybe getting Camry on.

1666
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,960
I was a little bit crushed.

1667
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,880
I was a little bit crestfallen when I got that message

1668
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:54,880
being like, actually, oh no, it all comes tumbling down,

1669
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,840
tumbling down, tumbling down.

1670
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,320
I don't want to believe the man who made

1671
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,200
Tails Gets Trolled isn't a man who executes

1672
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,200
on his goals and dreams and ambitions.

1673
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,340
So please prove us all wrong.

1674
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:15,300
I will say the idea, okay, having watched Micorat,

1675
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:20,660
the idea that he wants to remake it is totally baffled.

1676
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:27,100
Maybe there's some core idea that he wants to really change.

1677
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:28,700
That's what I want.

1678
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,820
I want to know, are you just gonna re-remake it

1679
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:34,740
or are you talking about a reboot with the same character?

1680
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:35,900
Like that would make more sense

1681
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,100
because I'm pretty sure that the characters in Micorat

1682
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,420
are animalized versions of him and his brother

1683
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,780
and their real life friends.

1684
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,060
So like a reboot of it with the same characters

1685
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:45,940
would make sense.

1686
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:49,420
A remake would not make sense because I'm pretty sure

1687
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,860
they just sort of like fucking rift,

1688
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:55,540
sort of improv the whole thing and like, yeah.

1689
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,660
We'll see, we need him on to answer these questions.

1690
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,460
These are the questions I want to ask him.

1691
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,300
Of course, of course.

1692
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,020
Well, get on it, man.

1693
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:06,500
Yeah, okay, I've been reinvigorated in my quest.

1694
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,820
Excellent.

1695
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:10,980
I had one thing.

1696
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,900
I had just a thought, just a thought.

1697
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,020
I was philosophizing, you know,

1698
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,860
just riffing with my own brain.

1699
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,020
What do you guys think about this?

1700
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:21,020
This is my little philosophical thought

1701
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:23,900
of the other day that I'm raising now.

1702
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:28,900
I was thinking about why everybody is so upset,

1703
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,780
specifically I was thinking about bullying.

1704
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,780
I was thinking about bullying, but it applies to other stuff.

1705
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:37,340
And I was like, the world hates bullying so much

1706
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:40,620
and bullies specifically are vilified,

1707
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,100
you know, understandably so.

1708
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:47,100
But like, the whole world despises bullies intensely.

1709
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:50,820
And it's because bullies are a very tangible thing, I think.

1710
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:53,700
Like, okay, so you got a situation about a kid being bullied.

1711
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,540
It's like, okay.

1712
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:57,620
Everyone's been bullied in one form or another, right?

1713
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,180
What I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about like,

1714
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,820
how do we resolve like bullying?

1715
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:03,780
Or you'll see how this extrapolates outward.

1716
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,220
And I was thinking about like,

1717
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,900
when you've got a situation where like,

1718
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,620
let's say a weak little kid is being bullied

1719
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:10,620
by like a larger kid,

1720
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:15,060
like how do you fix this problem in the real world?

1721
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,700
Because you got two, there's two options here.

1722
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,940
One is that the outside world intervenes

1723
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:25,940
and maybe like, separates them, punishes the bully,

1724
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:27,860
does something like that.

1725
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:31,700
And in some way, it stops the aggression from happening.

1726
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:34,620
There's another way this situation can be resolved,

1727
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:38,020
which is that the person who's bullied in some way,

1728
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:41,420
like steps up or like proves that they won't be bullied.

1729
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,780
They won't tolerate it.

1730
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:44,260
You know, maybe fights back physically

1731
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:47,260
or you know, whatever's appropriate for the situation.

1732
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:49,860
And I was just, I was thinking about this equation.

1733
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:53,980
And I'm like, man, the whole world just seems

1734
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:57,020
like such a place where people want to do something.

1735
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:57,860
The only-

1736
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,700
To intervene?

1737
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,540
Yes, yeah.

1738
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,020
This interventionist mindset.

1739
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:02,380
I think I see where you're going with this.

1740
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,220
Yeah.

1741
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,060
I was just thinking about how the,

1742
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:06,540
the world has only, of that equation,

1743
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,460
where there's two things that can change,

1744
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:12,460
the entire world can only operate on one axis there.

1745
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:15,580
And that is the interfere with the bully

1746
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:18,780
and like stop them from doing the bad thing.

1747
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,460
Yeah.

1748
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:24,420
But it's, we have to admit that a big factor here,

1749
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:27,980
a big way that this can change is for,

1750
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:30,700
I mean, maybe like he gets like a talking with his dad.

1751
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,380
He, you know, pulls up some thing from inside himself,

1752
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:36,220
but the person who's being bullied,

1753
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,860
they are the one, they change.

1754
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,340
They change their mindset.

1755
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:43,580
They change their, you know, internal mechanisms

1756
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,180
or they just get like a really good lecture

1757
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:46,940
from their dad or mom or whatever.

1758
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:48,580
And then they're like, no, I'm not gonna be bullied anymore.

1759
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,060
And then they fight back.

1760
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,340
Cause most bullies, as I understand it,

1761
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:56,220
they'll pick on the people who are like the weakest targets.

1762
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:58,740
So if you just won't roll over, you know, theoretically,

1763
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,780
and as long as they're, it's capable of some backlash,

1764
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:02,020
like online, there's a different thing

1765
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:02,980
where everyone's anonymous,

1766
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,860
can't really fight back very well.

1767
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:07,660
And I was just saying, so like people want,

1768
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:10,940
the world wants to intervene and punish the bully,

1769
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:15,220
but the better outcome really is that the bully,

1770
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,380
the bully with two E's, you know,

1771
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:20,020
like a trainee or an employee,

1772
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:21,940
there's the bully and the bully.

1773
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,660
Like the key blade.

1774
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:29,460
So the bully E changes for the better, you know,

1775
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:32,660
learns something and corrects the situation himself.

1776
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,620
I mean, that can't always happen, right?

1777
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:37,140
Some kids, like sometimes the size difference

1778
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,980
might be so vast that like the small

1779
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,420
and just can't fight back,

1780
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:43,580
that he can't stand up to him in any meaningful way.

1781
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,740
I'm sure there are situations like that.

1782
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:47,580
I happily agree.

1783
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,820
I mean, most bullies do not bully

1784
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:54,260
unless they have a comfortable position of power

1785
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,380
or anonymity on the internet,

1786
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,940
which is a power in and of itself,

1787
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:00,140
or in real life, like size or money

1788
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:01,780
or like a job above the person.

1789
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,380
Like bullies are fucking cowards.

1790
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:07,940
They, in most cases, they only exist in situations

1791
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,380
where the other person cannot fight back

1792
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:13,780
because unfortunately, at some point,

1793
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:15,580
a bunch of idiots got together

1794
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:18,100
and decided that murder should be illegal.

1795
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:21,420
And so there will never be any justice ever in the world

1796
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,540
because you're not allowed to kill people.

1797
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:26,300
So the world is fucked.

1798
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:27,500
I hear what you're saying.

1799
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,460
I hear what you're saying.

1800
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:33,180
Like the point I wanted to make about this

1801
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,020
was less about bullying specifically,

1802
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:38,420
but it's that I feel like the whole world

1803
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:41,700
is kind of possessed by,

1804
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,940
like our actions are so guided by the fact

1805
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:48,500
that we can only intervene on the one side.

1806
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,380
We can't empower anyone

1807
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:52,940
to change their internal mindset.

1808
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:56,260
Even though that, I, like, let's say that this kid...

1809
01:25:56,260 --> 01:26:01,260
Is it like, you're risking victim shaming at that point?

1810
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:02,180
Is that true?

1811
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:03,900
And that people don't want to do that?

1812
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:07,900
You can't make someone change their mindset,

1813
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,580
but like, you know, others' actions

1814
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,780
can lead to a change in attitude.

1815
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:16,780
Like, by example, for example.

1816
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,260
That's definitely true.

1817
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:21,100
It's not like we can do nothing to change others' mindsets,

1818
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:24,860
but we can't intervene directly in them.

1819
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:28,100
It just often seems like those who fight back

1820
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,060
are usually the ones punished.

1821
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:34,020
You know, that, I suppose, I don't, you know...

1822
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,420
And I think the way to fix that is that,

1823
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:38,580
I think the way to fix that is,

1824
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,540
just have no more laws.

1825
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:43,700
Just like if someone is fucking with you,

1826
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,340
you should be allowed to fucking cut their head off.

1827
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,900
I don't think that's reasonable.

1828
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,500
Who in their right mind?

1829
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,900
Look, I don't know how much this happens.

1830
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,860
Like, I don't know what kind of bullying is more common,

1831
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:54,820
though they say bullying is on the rise,

1832
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:56,260
but I think it's more like emotional

1833
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:58,100
and like mental abuse and stuff.

1834
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,740
I mean, that's the same.

1835
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:01,900
Well, I'm talking, like, I guess that's true,

1836
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:05,100
but if you've got a person who's, like,

1837
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,300
you're a kid, you've got no friends,

1838
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:07,660
like maybe you're a new kid at a school,

1839
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:08,620
and like, there's a big kid,

1840
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:10,020
and like, he's got like two or three friends

1841
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:10,860
that always hang out with him,

1842
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:12,980
and they just call you names every day,

1843
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,220
and they call you names every single day.

1844
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:15,660
Yeah, I saw Bart the General.

1845
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:17,060
You saw what?

1846
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:17,900
I saw Bart the General.

1847
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:18,740
Right, right.

1848
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,780
And like, if you like,

1849
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:24,060
like, what happens when it comes to a head?

1850
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,860
Like, you can't, I think this is more to Jesse's point.

1851
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:29,660
Like, if you like, punch the kid one day

1852
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,700
because you've just had enough,

1853
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,340
I like, like, he never got physical,

1854
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,740
and for some reason, well, okay, understandably,

1855
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,780
it's harder to quantify like,

1856
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:41,740
emotional abuse or like, mental bullying or whatever.

1857
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,620
So like, you are the one who took it

1858
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,420
to like an actual violent place,

1859
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:47,540
so like, I feel like people are gonna be like,

1860
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:48,860
oh, well, you're the real bad guy, thank you.

1861
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,540
Yeah, I mean, society talks about it.

1862
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,380
I mean, you should believe it.

1863
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:52,220
I mean, you should believe it.

1864
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,580
I mean, that kid is wrong.

1865
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,900
It is wrong to attack someone.

1866
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1867
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:59,300
It is not, like, the thing that I hate

1868
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:02,180
is that physical violence is held

1869
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:04,780
as like, more dangerous, more bad

1870
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,660
than like, emotional abuse.

1871
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,500
It is, it is though.

1872
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,340
No, no.

1873
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:10,540
Yeah, okay.

1874
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:12,740
It's because of the context of which people

1875
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:16,500
like, take physical and mental abuse.

1876
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,460
Like, you can't quantify it when it's emotional,

1877
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,100
and because you can't quantify it,

1878
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,780
you can't weigh the amount of physical abuse

1879
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:27,620
against the amount of emotional abuse.

1880
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,380
If somebody deserves to get punched in the face,

1881
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:34,100
you can't like, you can't clarify that after the fact

1882
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,900
and say, well, he did, you know, yell at you

1883
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,940
as this specific amount, so one punch is okay.

1884
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,460
Like, that never happens.

1885
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,500
So like, everybody who is like,

1886
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,220
the most annoying person in the world,

1887
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,540
but they don't throw a punch,

1888
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,100
can get away with that forever,

1889
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:52,300
and somebody who throws a single punch is a villain.

1890
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,980
Society says it's against bullying,

1891
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:58,020
but the way that we, like you said, quantify like,

1892
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,540
oh, because the person was violent,

1893
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,860
that automatically is worse than the emotional abuse,

1894
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:05,780
it's not, so like, you're almost not allowed

1895
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,140
to stand up for yourself or be a man.

1896
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:09,020
You're encouraged to be a rat motherfucker

1897
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:11,220
and a coward and bully heroes.

1898
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,420
There's like, if you think of like,

1899
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:16,620
every TV show where like, somebody gets punched

1900
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,780
and you're like, oh yeah, they deserve that.

1901
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:21,180
Or like, you know, a Game of Thrones,

1902
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:22,860
somebody dies and you're like, finally,

1903
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:25,820
like, the things he's done, I mean,

1904
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,420
in Game of Thrones, everyone kills everyone,

1905
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:28,660
there's always physical violence,

1906
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:31,860
but like, if somebody like, there was that moment

1907
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,980
in the Harry Potter movie where Draco gets punched

1908
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:35,980
by Hermione and everyone cheers at that,

1909
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:38,460
they're like, oh yeah, cool, girl power,

1910
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,380
and it's really cool and it's fucking sick, but like,

1911
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:45,100
listen, it's like, Hermione didn't do a good thing,

1912
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,540
but like, we all agree that, well,

1913
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:50,900
we all generally agree that he kind of deserves that

1914
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:53,700
and it's not like, she shouldn't be thrown

1915
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:54,900
out of school for that.

1916
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:59,340
Well, I mean, that's fiction, right?

1917
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,820
In fiction, you can get punched in the face and it's fine.

1918
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:04,820
No, the reason I was saying fiction is because

1919
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,400
in fiction, you're reading it or watching it

1920
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,160
and you can get a sense of like, how it feels

1921
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,360
for the one person being bullied

1922
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,480
because that's how like the narrative is like,

1923
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,320
oh, this is the villain.

1924
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,600
Yeah, you kind of can quantify the bullying in a book

1925
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,760
where we can see their heads.

1926
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,440
The only person who can quantify the amount

1927
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:25,600
of emotional abuse in real life is the person being abused

1928
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,080
and you know, an outlier and an onlooker

1929
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:32,160
can't really gauge it perfectly.

1930
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:36,060
Physical violence in the real world, you know,

1931
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:40,460
despite how it looks in media is ugly and gross

1932
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:45,020
and bad and like, in real life, a bully getting,

1933
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:46,740
yeah, sure it is.

1934
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:49,180
I don't know, I don't think that like,

1935
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:51,860
I think the amount of emotional abuse someone would have

1936
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:55,060
to inflict to deserve to get like physically struck

1937
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,540
or injured is like, insane.

1938
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:59,220
I mean, you know, like super hot,

1939
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:03,020
like why is hurting someone's feelings

1940
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:05,460
more okay than hurting someone's face?

1941
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:07,900
Emotions aren't even real, dude.

1942
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:11,740
Well, Bill Burr, I think summarized this well

1943
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:14,100
in one of his little bits, which was like,

1944
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,700
okay, you come home from work,

1945
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:17,220
I don't know, you've been married to a woman

1946
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,380
for like, I don't know, let's say 10 years,

1947
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,780
I don't know, let's say you have kids

1948
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:25,180
and you just find her like fucking the neighbor

1949
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:29,020
and you're like, okay, like sure, it's not good

1950
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:31,980
to like attack her or be violent to her, obviously,

1951
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,260
would never condone it, but like,

1952
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:36,020
you can understand why this is bad

1953
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:39,180
and like what one's motivation would be

1954
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:42,900
for like, you know, being physically violent here.

1955
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,180
To want to be fit, yeah, sure.

1956
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,940
In this case, it doesn't like, that's not justified,

1957
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:49,140
it's not, you're gonna fix anything to attack a person.

1958
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:52,660
And like, and like that's, that's,

1959
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:57,660
I mean, God, like, I mean, that would be like a crime.

1960
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:58,860
That's true.

1961
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,700
And it would not be a crime.

1962
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,660
It's not a crime what she did, on the other hand,

1963
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:08,220
but it is bad and it is damaging in other ways.

1964
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,500
And I understand we can't compare them,

1965
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,540
they're kind of non-overlapping magisteria,

1966
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:17,580
but I mean, yeah, I don't know, it's sort of similar.

1967
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,900
It's sort of, you know, emotional abuse.

1968
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,780
Yeah, yeah, it's sort of, I mean,

1969
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:26,620
she's hurt, she's hurt this man emotionally,

1970
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:28,420
so yeah, it's comparable there.

1971
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:31,060
What are we, what are we?

1972
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,700
You know what, what's the point we're driving at here?

1973
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,300
I mean, there's a point is like,

1974
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,380
do we want like physical violence to be okay,

1975
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:41,820
or do we want like emotional abuse to be not okay

1976
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,460
to an equivalent amount?

1977
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,580
Like, it would be lovely if we could quantify

1978
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:48,700
the emotional abuse and then deal out punishment properly.

1979
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,900
Right now, what we're doing,

1980
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:52,460
it just doesn't work, it's kind of impossible to do that.

1981
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:54,300
We've already said, physical violence is out,

1982
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,140
we can't do it.

1983
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:57,060
And now, we're trying to do the same thing,

1984
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:58,620
at least like Twitter with their,

1985
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:00,820
like Twitter just made it a rule,

1986
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:05,220
where you are, it is now a reportable and banable offense

1987
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,900
if you like misgender or dead name someone,

1988
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:09,300
and so that's like a trans thing.

1989
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,020
So, like, so what they're,

1990
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:13,100
I mean, the point of that policy is to stop you

1991
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,940
from hurting people's feelings, and like, I get it.

1992
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:17,260
God, I better fucking get my shit together

1993
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:19,900
and start remembering that his name is Christine

1994
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:20,740
Weston Chandler.

1995
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,660
I mean, that he could report you.

1996
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:24,780
It all comes down to like, we all are,

1997
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:26,580
I'm sorry, she, whatever.

1998
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:30,300
We all agreed that if a dog is barking at you,

1999
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,020
you should be allowed to fucking punch it in the brain.

2000
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:36,100
I mean, that's a, if a dog is emotionally abusing you

2001
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:38,300
by annoying you enough,

2002
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,620
then you should be allowed to be as violent as you want

2003
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:44,580
and have a fucking dog meat sandwich for dinner.

2004
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:46,740
I can't agree with that.

2005
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:51,580
Now, you've found, yeah, okay, I do want to hurt dogs.

2006
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:53,220
I do.

2007
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,980
It's like, like, the reason you would go

2008
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:58,940
to physical violence is not because you love to kill,

2009
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:01,420
it is because that is the solution.

2010
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:04,500
The dog will not bark as much if it sees you glaring at it

2011
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,460
and punching it.

2012
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:08,020
I mean, like, in theory, and when we'll have fantasies.

2013
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,700
Dogs are the original bullies.

2014
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,180
They fucking bark and bark,

2015
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:14,100
and they act like they're tough shit, but they're cowards.

2016
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,420
Well, like, a technical dog may or may not

2017
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:17,700
fix the problem long-term.

2018
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:20,260
Like, standing up to a bully, even physically,

2019
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:23,060
that may in fact fix the problem long-term.

2020
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:24,740
It might cause more violence.

2021
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:26,260
You know, I don't know.

2022
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,900
I mean, it might sometimes, yeah, it might scare them off.

2023
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:30,420
It might create other problems, that's true.

2024
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:33,980
It would make, like, okay, I don't think that you,

2025
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:36,620
I don't think that you solve the bully problem

2026
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:39,100
by, like, fighting the bully and hurting him

2027
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:41,620
so that he's like, oh, if I fight this kid, I'll get hurt.

2028
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,020
Like, I don't, I don't know.

2029
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:45,340
That's a really clean narrative that you see in media.

2030
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:46,420
You've changed the situation, but you haven't technically

2031
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:48,700
solved it, it could go in other ways.

2032
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:52,100
Yeah, like, it could just make him hate you more.

2033
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:54,660
It could just make him even greater.

2034
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:56,500
Yeah, it is, it is the cycle of violence.

2035
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,300
I know that, like, yeah, in some cases,

2036
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:00,900
it might fix the situation, but yeah, the cycle of violence.

2037
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:01,940
Okay, you know what?

2038
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:03,340
This is an interesting topic.

2039
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:05,540
This actually was not my point at all.

2040
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:10,100
And my main point was just that I would just,

2041
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:13,820
I was thinking about bullying as an example of how,

2042
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:18,180
like, outside people, we want to,

2043
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:20,300
our only power here, if we, like,

2044
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:22,220
see someone getting bullied,

2045
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:25,140
all we can actually do to change the situation

2046
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:28,300
is to, like, intervene personally

2047
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,740
and, like, do something to, like, stop the bully.

2048
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:33,140
We can't change what's going on inside the person

2049
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:34,380
who's being bullied.

2050
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:36,780
And I guess my only point is I think that's, like,

2051
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:40,580
kind of an underserved and an underrepresented

2052
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:44,260
important element that I just think deserves more

2053
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:47,140
consider, I don't know what's to be done.

2054
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:49,740
I guess it's kind of like, instead of just, like, shitty,

2055
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:53,420
I could go on Twitter and, like, shit on Trump, I guess.

2056
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,820
But, like, I just think a better,

2057
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:57,660
even if Trump is the worst president, the worst person ever,

2058
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,980
I just think a better thing to do is to, like,

2059
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:01,900
think about, like, okay, guys, the world sucks,

2060
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:04,500
here's what you can do to improve yourself.

2061
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,620
And, like, these are the ways that no matter what happens,

2062
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:08,060
you'll be in a better place to deal with it.

2063
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,300
It's like giving someone a fish versus teaching them to fish.

2064
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:14,060
Like, if you take the bully out of the equation,

2065
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,740
the person who's getting bullied is still emitting

2066
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:18,860
that kind of energy that attracts bullies,

2067
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:21,700
and they're just gonna continue to get bullied.

2068
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:22,540
Great point.

2069
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:25,100
And it's like beating up their bully

2070
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:28,380
instead of teaching them how to beat off bullies in general.

2071
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:30,220
Beat them off, huh?

2072
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:32,180
Or beat off your bully.

2073
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:33,660
Guys, we found the solution.

2074
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:35,300
Beat off your bullies.

2075
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:37,660
It's what they're really looking for.

2076
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:38,980
Love, love, not hate.

2077
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,780
I pretty much love that.

2078
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:42,460
I guess that pretty much sums it up.

2079
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,820
Break the cycle of violence and beat off your bully.

2080
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:46,660
With love, with love, guys, do it.

2081
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:49,940
Yeah, I guess punching people is not the solution.

2082
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:54,700
I just feel like the punishment for punching

2083
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:59,220
and the punishment for emotional abuse

2084
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:06,780
is skewed very far in harsh penalties for physical.

2085
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:10,220
And I guess, after a certain point, there is a threshold.

2086
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:12,140
There is a threshold beyond which it's like,

2087
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,380
well, this guy's broken his leg.

2088
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,620
That's fucked him up, and he's gonna break that leg again,

2089
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:19,300
because the bone will never heal quite as strong

2090
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,580
as the first time.

2091
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:24,340
So that's irreparable damage.

2092
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:25,900
That's kind of fucked up.

2093
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:28,140
So there's a threshold beyond which physical violence

2094
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:28,940
is always worse.

2095
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:31,900
I mean, physical violence just aren't usually observable.

2096
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:37,420
The small stuff is like, if a kid shoves another kid,

2097
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:40,820
the kid who shoved should not get sent home,

2098
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:43,820
and then the bully who was teasing him

2099
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:44,940
should get off scot-free.

2100
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:46,700
That's basically what I'm getting at.

2101
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:47,980
Which is why I think they generally

2102
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:49,740
write up both kids whenever there's a fight,

2103
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:50,780
no matter who started it.

2104
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:53,180
That's why I got sent home, and suspended

2105
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:55,180
for getting punched in the face.

2106
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,460
Classic tale.

2107
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,900
You shouldn't have had such a punchable face their time.

2108
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,100
It's your one mistake.

2109
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:05,420
Big and ugly, and I was just asking for it.

2110
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:06,100
What can I say?

2111
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:06,600
It's right.

2112
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,380
Teachers had been just clamoring for an excuse

2113
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:12,220
to write you a pink slip and send you home today.

2114
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,340
And he got punched perfect.

2115
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:16,380
Now we can insult him as an injury.

2116
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:16,740
I don't know.

2117
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,340
I didn't have to do homework for three days.

2118
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:19,700
It was fine.

2119
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:20,500
That was a good decision.

2120
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,500
I was glad I was able to generally articulate the point.

2121
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,860
That's an interesting topic.

2122
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:27,740
I just think the problem is that just to cap it off

2123
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:33,180
is that we, as a society, do undervalue or don't put

2124
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:37,460
enough weight on mental stress and emotional abuse.

2125
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:40,500
But the reason we don't, and the reason it's such a problem,

2126
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,980
is that we're all emotionally weak,

2127
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:44,740
and our culture makes us emotionally weak.

2128
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:49,900
And so the way to fix emotional bullying

2129
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:53,980
is to strengthen everybody, to not be such a little bitch,

2130
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:56,180
because we're all little bitches when it comes to our fee

2131
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:56,700
fees.

2132
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,620
And that's bullshit.

2133
01:38:57,620 --> 01:39:01,540
And we regularly, based on the least resilient people.

2134
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:02,900
I don't even know how we would possibly do that.

2135
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:05,460
Yeah, yeah, because I mean, and of course we do,

2136
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:06,340
because it makes sense.

2137
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,940
Those are the people who need protection.

2138
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:10,900
But then the whole system caters to them,

2139
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,380
and is that necessarily?

2140
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:14,580
Then we get all this padding on everything.

2141
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:16,180
And so people don't have as much opportunity

2142
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:19,260
to build up resilience.

2143
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:21,020
I heard a summary that apparently this

2144
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:26,940
is true, that in the wake of Trump getting elected,

2145
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:30,500
there were actually a large number of millennials suffering.

2146
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:34,660
This is not a joke, actual, real symptoms of PTSD,

2147
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:36,100
just from Trump getting elected.

2148
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,020
I think I know some of them.

2149
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:38,780
Oh yeah?

2150
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:41,500
And I mean, you look at the world, it's like, OK,

2151
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,140
things seem OK.

2152
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:47,460
Like I know people who have mentally gone downhill

2153
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:49,300
since the election of Trump.

2154
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:51,940
I was actually assaulted by one of those people.

2155
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:53,260
But I guess I shouldn't think of it.

2156
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:54,260
Oh yeah, the subject of what?

2157
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:55,580
Oh, that was when you were like, you

2158
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:57,500
had a joke where Trump's a party.

2159
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:02,420
On the subject of what happens when you stand up to bullying,

2160
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:05,180
yeah, I went to a costume party, a Halloween party,

2161
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:08,180
like around the time that it was 2016.

2162
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:10,460
And I didn't really have a costume.

2163
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:12,060
So I thought, oh, it'd be funny if I

2164
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:13,900
went as a Trump guy, right?

2165
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:17,220
So I put on the Make America a Great Again hat,

2166
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,340
and I put on a denim jacket.

2167
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:21,260
And I went around like, I'm a Trump guy.

2168
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:27,420
Well, it was a party with a lot of young, early 20s women

2169
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:30,020
who don't like the Trumper.

2170
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:32,420
So a lot of them.

2171
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:33,620
They can't bump to that Trump.

2172
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:35,260
I got a lot of nasty looks.

2173
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:37,380
And I got a lot of people yelling at me

2174
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:40,300
to fuck off just for being there.

2175
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:42,820
This one girl who was very drunk.

2176
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,220
You would have gotten less attacked

2177
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:46,980
if you'd literally gone to this costume party as a Nazi.

2178
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:48,940
You would have been more beloved.

2179
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:51,500
There was this one drunk girl who came up to me

2180
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:54,220
and started pushing me and putting her hands on me

2181
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,580
and hitting me and trying to scratch at me.

2182
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:01,340
And I kept trying to push her off of me.

2183
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:05,820
And I finally said, if you put your hands on me one more time,

2184
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:08,020
I'm going to hit you back.

2185
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,340
And she is like, oh, yeah, fucking.

2186
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:13,860
And to test me, she does it again.

2187
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:17,980
And I just fucking, I fucking hit her.

2188
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:21,060
And you would have thought that I shot a puppy.

2189
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:23,180
Like the entire party stops.

2190
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:27,860
Everyone, it instantly became the most chaos I've ever seen.

2191
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:29,900
The whole party descended on me.

2192
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:33,580
Like three guys bum rushed me out of nowhere.

2193
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,700
And like, I suddenly, I'm fighting three guys,

2194
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,580
like a fucking Jackie Chan movie.

2195
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,500
And the whole time that I'm fighting three guys,

2196
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,260
she's also like pulling my hair

2197
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:43,380
because I had long hair back then.

2198
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:44,540
She's pulling my hair.

2199
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:46,300
She's scratching me, screaming at me.

2200
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:48,820
All these guys who like don't know what happened at all.

2201
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:50,740
They don't know the situation.

2202
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:52,020
All they know is that.

2203
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:55,220
All they saw was that a girl got hit by a guy

2204
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:56,660
and they were like, well, this will be a fucking night.

2205
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:59,180
So they got a fucking white night and they got to come up

2206
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:02,260
and I fucking, I fucking, there was,

2207
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:03,500
I'm proud of this though.

2208
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:06,060
Cause there was one guy who like dressed as,

2209
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:07,340
there's this guy who like,

2210
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:08,860
I think runs for president every year.

2211
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:10,780
One of those crazy homeless people who like wears a boot

2212
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:11,620
on his head.

2213
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:12,460
I don't remember his name,

2214
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,740
but his thing is that he wears a boot on his head.

2215
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:16,660
And there was like a guy dressed up on a ass

2216
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:18,260
and with a fake beard and a boot on his head.

2217
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:20,300
And like, at some point in the fracas,

2218
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,980
in the melee, in the brawl,

2219
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:23,940
in the other fucking Smash Brothers words,

2220
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:28,740
I fucking, at some point I threw a perfect uppercut.

2221
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:31,020
And it was like, it was like a shuriyuken that,

2222
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,100
and like I connected with this guy.

2223
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:34,540
I was gonna say, did you say shuriyuken?

2224
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:37,300
I knocked his fucking boot off his head

2225
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:40,860
and his fucking, his fake, his fake beard went flying one way.

2226
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:42,260
The boot flew the other way.

2227
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:45,540
He like, he like went up in the air and fucking,

2228
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:47,100
like I'm not saying that I'm like,

2229
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,580
that I killed all three guys,

2230
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:50,860
but I fucking connected with that uppercut

2231
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:53,660
and that fucking boot motherfucker went flying.

2232
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:55,060
And it was beautiful.

2233
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:57,020
But yeah, I like, it was literally,

2234
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:01,100
I started a riot by wearing a costume to a Halloween party.

2235
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:02,820
I mean, I can see,

2236
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:06,420
I can see how every step of that story progress

2237
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:08,380
and why it progressed the way it did.

2238
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:10,300
Here's the frustrating thing.

2239
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:13,140
Here's what, here's why like,

2240
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:14,700
you like, yeah, you told that girl like,

2241
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:16,420
don't assault me or I'm gonna hit you.

2242
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:17,920
She assaulted you and you hit her.

2243
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,820
I don't think that was wrong.

2244
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:21,260
But here's the frustrating part

2245
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:23,540
and why the cycle of violence is a problem.

2246
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:25,220
Like, justified or not,

2247
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:27,020
you know that girl's story is.

2248
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:27,860
Oh yeah.

2249
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:29,340
A crazy MAGA Trump guy hit me at a possible.

2250
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:30,620
Oh yeah, absolutely.

2251
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:31,500
But you know what?

2252
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,340
And that's the story she'll repeat for the rest of her life.

2253
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:34,860
You know what makes it worth it though,

2254
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:37,460
is that I heard the next morning

2255
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:39,820
from my friend who's house it was at the party

2256
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,580
that she drove home drunk and crashed her car.

2257
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,540
Holy fuck.

2258
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:45,460
So.

2259
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:47,540
Not into any innocent people.

2260
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:49,900
No, just into like a tree or a pole or something.

2261
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:51,180
But yeah, fuck her.

2262
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,380
Oh, but you fucking know.

2263
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:56,260
This was only due to the severe concussion

2264
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:59,220
delivered upon her by a vicious Trump supporter.

2265
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:00,980
This was due to the PTSD,

2266
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:04,300
the flash that you gave her flashbacks.

2267
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:07,020
And she was like, she had to jump in that car and drive

2268
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:08,860
because Charlie was in the fucking tree.

2269
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,100
She had to escape.

2270
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:14,140
There was an agent orange was closing in on her.

2271
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:15,580
She had to fucking escape the car.

2272
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:17,700
The true agent orange himself.

2273
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:18,540
Oh my God.

2274
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:20,380
It was full.

2275
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,220
Oh my God.

2276
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:22,740
Yeah, she wrecked her car that night

2277
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,300
and like ran away from the accident

2278
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,660
and got picked up by the police later and got arrested.

2279
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:28,340
So I win, I guess.

2280
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:30,820
I guess at the end of the day.

2281
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:32,820
She couldn't trump the stump

2282
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:34,580
as she fucking ran into a tree.

2283
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,420
It's true.

2284
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:36,900
Oh fuck.

2285
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,900
It's just, it's so,

2286
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:41,180
there's no way to fix this problem

2287
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:43,180
that people just read into situations

2288
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:45,260
what they want to get out of it.

2289
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,860
That's just what we all do and I don't know.

2290
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:50,580
I just really like the imagery

2291
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:53,020
of like a brawl at a Halloween party.

2292
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:53,860
Yeah.

2293
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:54,860
Like the scary people.

2294
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:56,700
Yeah, all the ghosts and ghouls come out.

2295
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:58,220
I was fighting off goblins.

2296
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:02,140
Like that would be in like a Jackie Chan movie

2297
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:02,980
or in some like hilarious movie.

2298
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:04,420
Or like a Ninja Turtles movie.

2299
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:05,260
Yeah.

2300
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:06,340
You get the Casey Jones mask

2301
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,860
and you got all the ninjas coming out.

2302
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:10,780
You have like Freddy versus Jason

2303
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:13,260
but they're like shitty Halloween costume versions

2304
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:14,660
or something, you know.

2305
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:17,460
Jason's costume is a shitty Halloween costume already

2306
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:18,740
but fair point, fair point.

2307
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:19,580
That's true.

2308
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:20,420
That's true.

2309
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,140
Damn, that was a good story.

2310
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:23,340
All right, well good.

2311
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,180
Yeah.

2312
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:25,020
Let's, let's.

2313
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:26,140
Don't know what the answer is though.

2314
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:26,980
There is no answer.

2315
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,900
Don't know if we've, don't know if we've learned them.

2316
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,620
I think we didn't find an answer.

2317
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:33,340
It's kind of a funny story to fix.

2318
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:35,220
That's the most, that's the best we can do.

2319
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:37,140
You can't really fix human nature.

2320
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:39,060
People are gonna want to punch each other.

2321
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:42,140
There's a reason why philosophers have not cracked this code

2322
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:43,660
over the, you know, thousands of years

2323
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:44,980
of human civilization.

2324
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:47,340
Cause it comes down to human fucking nature

2325
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:48,660
as long as that's the same.

2326
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:52,180
As long as people are selfish, willfully ignorant

2327
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,740
and, you know, form teams, which we all do

2328
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:57,020
and basically always will do,

2329
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:58,980
this will continue to be a problem.

2330
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:01,340
And social media has just made it that much easier.

2331
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:03,180
So, you know, there's no fix in it.

2332
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:06,140
It's unfortunate cause like I like being in a team

2333
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:08,580
as in like people I like and like people

2334
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:10,820
who I respect and trust.

2335
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:13,860
Like, like I like being in that the team of people I like.

2336
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:17,180
But the reason I like that is because there's a possibility

2337
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:19,940
that there are people who are, you know,

2338
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,660
like if we were all robots,

2339
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:23,380
we would all be self-sufficient,

2340
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,100
but we would have no friends.

2341
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:28,780
And it would be like, eh, you know, as a human,

2342
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:31,780
I kind of don't want to live in a world where I'm by myself.

2343
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:32,620
Yeah, it sucks.

2344
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:33,540
But it sucks.

2345
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:34,380
Can't help that.

2346
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:35,820
Oh, just as an addendum,

2347
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:39,340
I looked up to clarify the name of the costume

2348
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,740
the guy was wearing with the boot on his head.

2349
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:44,220
The guy's name, so everyone knows

2350
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:45,940
I'm not making this story up.

2351
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:48,420
Is it Slavo, is it Slavo?

2352
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:51,100
It's, no, his name is Vermin Supreme.

2353
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:55,100
Oh, oh yeah, yeah, Vermin Supreme.

2354
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:56,460
That's the guy who's dressed up as a doctor.

2355
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:57,580
Yeah, I have heard of that.

2356
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,420
Yeah.

2357
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:00,700
I'm very proud of myself.

2358
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:02,820
Oh, that's fucking sick.

2359
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:04,020
All right, well, how about we get

2360
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:06,060
to those fucking voicemails now, gentlemen?

2361
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:07,500
Yeah, I think it's about time.

2362
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,340
All right, let's do it.

2363
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,940
We're closing in on two hours.

2364
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,020
Okay, let's see.

2365
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:12,060
How many do we have today?

2366
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,940
We got 10, we got 10 here.

2367
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,780
Oh, I know, I know.

2368
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,940
Oh, and after the whole thing went down,

2369
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:23,700
one of the guys who had jumped me in that fucking fracas

2370
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:25,340
after it was all dying down

2371
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:27,540
and everyone was trying to separate everyone

2372
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:32,100
and it was one of the guys did that insufferable thing

2373
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:34,780
that guys do where after a fight,

2374
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:37,540
they try to shake hands and apologize

2375
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,500
and I was having none of it.

2376
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:40,900
I fucking looked at that guy

2377
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:42,860
the same way I looked at that fucking dog.

2378
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:44,700
I just gave him the look.

2379
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,700
I gave him that, that Enlip G look of.

2380
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:48,540
The conqueror's eyes.

2381
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:50,140
Yeah, you should take your fucking hand out

2382
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:51,900
to shake it, fuck you, buddy.

2383
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:54,500
And I'd fucking said, fuck you and suck my dick

2384
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:57,460
and I walked away and there you go.

2385
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:00,100
And he sat there with his hand out

2386
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:01,540
like a fucking goofball.

2387
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:05,180
Oh yeah, I'm surprised it ended.

2388
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:07,220
I mean, so relatively amicably,

2389
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:09,540
like people were still able to like shake hands

2390
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:10,380
instead of like the whole thing

2391
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:11,220
just floating off and floating out.

2392
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:12,900
Well, they tried, but I didn't shake their fucking hands.

2393
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,780
Right, they tried to make it amicable,

2394
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:16,620
but I was like oh hell no.

2395
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,460
The only thing to do with me

2396
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:19,460
is to fucking flee from this fracas and never return.

2397
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:22,020
Does that mean they recognize their mistake at the end?

2398
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:26,580
I think it's just like a self-defense mechanism.

2399
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:28,020
Like they wanna be able to say,

2400
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:29,940
well, I try, you know, I was a good guy at the end.

2401
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:31,660
I don't know if they recognize their mistake

2402
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:34,420
or if they just because my fucking boy,

2403
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:36,100
butt chugger Cody LaRue came out

2404
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:38,660
and fucking yelled at him because it was his house.

2405
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:39,500
Oh, okay.

2406
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,300
So, you know, you don't wanna incur the wrath

2407
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:43,380
of the fucking butt chug, man.

2408
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:44,220
He'll,

2409
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:46,060
No sir.

2410
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:48,500
He'll dunk your fucking head in the butt juice.

2411
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:51,220
And there was a tub of butt juice at the party.

2412
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:54,540
He fucking, it was one of those like when people make

2413
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:57,780
the big alcohol concoctions with the fruit in them,

2414
01:48:57,780 --> 01:48:59,180
but it was labeled butt juice.

2415
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:01,740
He'll fucking dunk it in there.

2416
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:02,640
It's fucking sick.

2417
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,660
I'm sorry, I just keep uncovering layers

2418
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:05,620
to this fucking story.

2419
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:06,700
No, it's good, this is good.

2420
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:08,180
This is a tasty onion.

2421
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:10,380
I just want more layers.

2422
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:13,700
All right, let's visit in with our friend,

2423
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:15,300
Racist Forest Gump.

2424
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:16,540
Once again today,

2425
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:18,540
he's got another message for us that we need to hear.

2426
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:19,700
He's becoming a member.

2427
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:20,540
Sure.

2428
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:21,380
Yeah, basically.

2429
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,920
Jenae.

2430
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:23,760
Jenae.

2431
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:27,060
I got a pile of Jenae.

2432
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:27,900
Oh no.

2433
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:28,820
What is it, Forest?

2434
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:30,340
What is it?

2435
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:31,660
Jenae.

2436
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:36,660
The SJW Neo-Marx's, they found it.

2437
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:37,860
What did they find?

2438
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:40,220
What did they find, Forest?

2439
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:44,380
They found, they doxxed me, Jenae.

2440
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:46,820
They did, but they took my balls.

2441
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:49,180
I was a racist.

2442
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:52,900
They got it coming after me, Jenae.

2443
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:54,980
No, Forest, that's horrible.

2444
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:56,620
What are you gonna do?

2445
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:57,740
I don't know, Jenae.

2446
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:00,620
They outside my door with pitchforks.

2447
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:02,220
With pitchforks.

2448
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:04,940
What am I gonna do, Jenae?

2449
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:07,140
You gotta run, Forest.

2450
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:08,640
Run, Forest, run!

2451
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:13,200
I just love hearing from racist Forest Gump

2452
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:14,520
so much every week.

2453
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,920
That is the perfect end to that arc.

2454
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,400
He began the cycle a while ago,

2455
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,200
but he wasn't prepared to finish it.

2456
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:27,760
What's the, oh, fuckin', what's the Twitter alternative?

2457
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:28,600
Gab.

2458
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:29,920
People that could ban from Twitter.

2459
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,600
Yeah, yeah, he better make a Gab account.

2460
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:33,560
That's the only way, it's the only way.

2461
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,480
Poor racist Forest Gump.

2462
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:40,800
He didn't do nothing wrong, except for the racism.

2463
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,320
Except for being racist, yeah.

2464
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:44,960
All right, next call, we got...

2465
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,680
He's defining characteristics.

2466
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:51,200
The PCP Medical Consultant is calling in

2467
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,960
with some updates for us.

2468
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:54,880
Tell us how we're working.

2469
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,400
Okay, look, look.

2470
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,040
As a fuckin' six year medical student

2471
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:03,080
listening to this podcast, I'm so fuckin' angry.

2472
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:07,200
In episode 134, you are saying that

2473
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:10,600
the goldbladder secretes bile.

2474
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:14,280
It stores bile, fuckin' ass idiots.

2475
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,160
Sorry, I'm sorry.

2476
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:17,240
It stores bile.

2477
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:19,080
Doesn't digest fiber.

2478
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,800
Fiber is indigestible.

2479
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,720
Fuck.

2480
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:22,560
Oh my God.

2481
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:23,400
I knew that.

2482
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:25,600
Please, you are the reason people are dying.

2483
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,200
Okay, okay.

2484
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:33,680
I'm pretty sure that I corrected the appendix thing,

2485
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:36,960
but yeah, I misspoke about the gallbladder.

2486
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:37,880
I'm sorry.

2487
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:40,440
That's where the pee is stored, as I recall.

2488
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:41,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, in the test,

2489
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:43,240
the gallbladder's in the testicle,

2490
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,080
and it stores the pee.

2491
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,000
It's filled with piss.

2492
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:47,320
That's why women...

2493
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,960
Where does bile come from?

2494
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,280
Okay, the gallbladder stores bile.

2495
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:51,120
I don't know.

2496
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:51,960
Where does the bile come from?

2497
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:52,800
It's made in China.

2498
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,640
It's the pancreas.

2499
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,360
Is it the spleen?

2500
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:57,800
It might be the spleen, actually.

2501
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:58,640
It's the brain.

2502
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,680
It's gonna come back, even matter.

2503
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,320
Oh, it's all...

2504
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:03,160
The brain is full of bile.

2505
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,560
My brain is where you get all the skeleton from.

2506
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:07,720
Perception is reality,

2507
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:10,280
so it all comes from the brain anyway.

2508
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:11,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

2509
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,200
Okay.

2510
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,640
All right, well, we're the reason people are dying.

2511
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:15,960
Sorry about that, dude.

2512
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:16,800
Thanks for calling in.

2513
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,120
Let us know if we fuck anything else up.

2514
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:18,960
Okay.

2515
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:19,800
Yeah.

2516
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,200
We're the reason people are dying.

2517
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,120
If it wasn't for us, death would be a non-issue.

2518
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,480
That's an tagline for the show,

2519
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,000
the Procrastinators podcast,

2520
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,920
where the reason people are dying.

2521
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,480
Dude, that's really good.

2522
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:33,040
Okay, here's our next call.

2523
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:35,920
This is from Shraft Vortex.

2524
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:38,040
Shraft Vortex.

2525
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,160
Oh, yeah, sure.

2526
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:41,840
I've been killing Rowdy's with him.

2527
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,680
Oh, really?

2528
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,520
Oh, you know?

2529
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,360
Once in a while.

2530
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,200
Okay, I didn't know.

2531
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,040
Okay, let's see what he's got.

2532
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,080
Hey, guys, just wanted to ask real quick.

2533
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:50,080
Do you think that everyday situations

2534
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,320
have been made to be political,

2535
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,400
or do you think that they have always been

2536
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,960
and are just talked about in that way way more often now?

2537
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:58,800
Cool.

2538
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,640
Discuss.

2539
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:01,400
That's it.

2540
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,240
I don't like this question,

2541
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:03,280
because it's too big.

2542
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,760
Wait, is he asking why everything is so political?

2543
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:06,600
Though it is?

2544
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:07,440
Yeah, yeah.

2545
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,640
Because I said this on one,

2546
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:11,400
but I wasn't recording because I was an idiot,

2547
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:14,200
so I guess I'll reiterate the point that I made the last time

2548
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,280
because I thought it was a good point.

2549
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:20,840
I figured out why everything is so fucking political

2550
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:23,640
and horrific nowadays, why you can't get away from it,

2551
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:28,140
why everyone's sucked into the one side versus the other.

2552
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:34,100
It's because you know that fucking guy on your Facebook,

2553
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:37,580
you guys heard this story,

2554
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:39,180
but pretend you're hearing this for the first time.

2555
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,220
I'm hearing it for the first time.

2556
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:41,540
You know that guy.

2557
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,380
I wasn't listening.

2558
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:43,660
On everyone's friend's list,

2559
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:45,700
who's always posting like I'm depressed,

2560
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:47,100
please someone hang out with me,

2561
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,620
I hate my life and I hate myself,

2562
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:50,780
and I'm the person who's always having

2563
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,540
like a pity party for themselves on Facebook.

2564
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:54,380
That's me, that's me you're talking about.

2565
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:56,260
Everybody knows that person,

2566
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:58,540
and we feel bad for him for a while,

2567
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,580
but nobody wants to be that person.

2568
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:03,260
Nobody wants to go on Facebook all the time

2569
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:05,220
and make themselves into an object of pity

2570
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:08,220
by saying how bad their life is, right?

2571
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:11,020
But everyone feels that way,

2572
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:14,420
and everyone wants, deep down,

2573
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,220
everyone wants to go on Facebook

2574
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:18,300
and just let it loose.

2575
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:20,740
I've got problems and here are my problems

2576
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:22,660
and I'm lonely and I'm sad and I'm heartbroken

2577
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:23,500
and I'm miserable.

2578
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,200
Everyone wants to do that,

2579
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,440
but we're all kind of like we have that level of shame

2580
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:28,760
where we don't do it.

2581
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,360
So people all day are going around

2582
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:32,840
with this thing inside them

2583
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:35,000
that they just want to express their pain,

2584
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,680
but they're embarrassed to.

2585
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:40,280
So they have to latch on to some other way

2586
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:42,360
to express their discontent.

2587
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:44,480
And the most acceptable way to do it

2588
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:47,080
is to latch on to politics

2589
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,040
and make all of your problems

2590
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,240
because of the opposing team.

2591
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:54,600
So that's why all anyone talks about anymore

2592
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,400
is politics and complaining and fighting about politics

2593
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:58,920
because they're just sad.

2594
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:02,560
I do think that you're onto something.

2595
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:07,560
Yeah, it's become maybe a little more in vogue

2596
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,360
to be political, I guess,

2597
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,240
and a little more socially acceptable

2598
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:13,920
and commonplace to talk about these things publicly.

2599
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:17,760
However, I think that the issues that are politicized

2600
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,120
were always political.

2601
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:22,920
It just, they weren't as discussed in the same way.

2602
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:25,600
Is it literally because like, you know,

2603
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:28,760
millennial people who grew up with the internet

2604
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,680
as it started are like now adults

2605
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:34,280
and people just use the internet more?

2606
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:36,560
That definitely adds to it, I think.

2607
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,560
Yeah, because like...

2608
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:41,320
Like now it's so easy to bump the ideologies

2609
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:43,960
with different people because of Twitter and stuff.

2610
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:46,200
Yeah, like it's weird to think

2611
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,440
because internet has already, you know,

2612
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:49,360
it's been around for a while

2613
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:52,920
and people have been on it talking about political stuff

2614
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:56,280
for a while, but it does feel like in recent years

2615
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:57,400
that it's just more.

2616
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:02,280
And I guess it could just be that Trump was a big upset,

2617
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:05,040
like, oh, who saw that coming?

2618
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,120
Like it was, it's not just a new politician

2619
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:08,640
doing the same old shit.

2620
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:10,560
It's someone that's like,

2621
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:15,160
you get good boy points for saying the politicians are bad

2622
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,160
and then suddenly once you get good boy points

2623
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,760
for saying the politicians are bad,

2624
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,080
now you want to talk about politics more.

2625
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:24,320
Once you get one good boy point, it's a slippery slope.

2626
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:25,560
You just crave more and more.

2627
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:28,400
It's just way easier and way less vulnerable

2628
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:31,120
to be outraged about like what the president is doing

2629
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:33,520
or what insert political group here is doing

2630
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:37,320
than it is to be like openly sad and asking for comfort

2631
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:39,600
and help because your life sucks.

2632
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:40,640
Yeah, yeah.

2633
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:41,480
There's something to that.

2634
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,440
Yeah, it's a good point.

2635
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:46,200
Yeah, if you can just add your personal issues

2636
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:47,360
onto political problems

2637
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:49,960
and then you can talk about it guilt-free.

2638
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:50,800
Yeah, exactly.

2639
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,120
This is why.

2640
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:55,180
And that's the other thing, like why I can't really,

2641
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:58,800
why I, like people use the term centrist a lot.

2642
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,560
I don't really believe that that's a thing.

2643
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:02,240
I think it's kind of a straw man.

2644
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:07,840
Like people's idea of like a person who is neutral,

2645
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:10,480
I guess, is that they just think that like,

2646
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,680
both sides are wrong about everything.

2647
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,280
I don't think that at all.

2648
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:17,280
I think that both sides are right about most things.

2649
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:20,160
I think that every, and this is the reason

2650
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:23,440
why I don't get invested too much in political issues

2651
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:27,920
is because everyone feels the way they do for a reason.

2652
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,600
Something fucking happened to them.

2653
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:34,480
When someone is outraged about like Trump

2654
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,480
and is saying that like all Trump supporters

2655
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:40,920
must be rapists or like misogynists,

2656
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:43,720
like yeah, you can say that that person is crazy,

2657
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:47,000
but something fucking happened to that person,

2658
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,160
to make them feel that way.

2659
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,160
So you-

2660
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:52,000
Some crazy guy punched her for no reason

2661
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,280
in the Halloween party.

2662
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:57,440
Like during the Brett Kavanaugh thing,

2663
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:01,640
like I was pretty not into how it seemed like

2664
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:04,200
there were a lot of pretty baseless accusations

2665
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:07,240
being made, but like, of course people

2666
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,600
who like had any kind of personal experience

2667
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:10,880
are gonna be like, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2668
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,960
we're gonna fucking air on the side of caution,

2669
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:15,080
just as there's even a fucking hint

2670
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:17,240
that there was some impropriety.

2671
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:20,040
No, this man is clearly not, you know, and then-

2672
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,800
Yeah, like I get it, like no issue is really

2673
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,880
about the issue, like the Kavanaugh thing.

2674
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:27,400
I don't even know what it is or what it is.

2675
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:29,240
I'm assuming he like did something at a party,

2676
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:30,720
like raped someone, I don't fucking know.

2677
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,240
That's the accusation, yeah.

2678
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:35,040
Like the issue that people are arguing about

2679
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,960
isn't really about him, that guy,

2680
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:42,200
it's about there's people who have been sexually assaulted,

2681
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:44,120
who feel one way and there's people

2682
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:48,120
who have been falsely accused of being like sexual predators

2683
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:50,800
who feel another way and like they're arguing

2684
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,400
from their own experiences.

2685
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,240
The guy, Kavanaugh, doesn't fucking matter,

2686
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:56,520
he's nobody, but people are saying,

2687
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,760
this happened to me, well this happened to me,

2688
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:01,040
so fuck you and we have to fight about it.

2689
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,200
Yeah, and then everyone else falls into like,

2690
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:05,200
oh, I hope that doesn't happen to me or like,

2691
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,840
I'm afraid that might happen to me

2692
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,160
and then they fall on one side of the thing.

2693
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:09,160
So it's not both sides are wrong,

2694
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:12,840
it's both sides are right, the world is really fucked up

2695
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:16,120
and it's fucked up in so many like interconnected,

2696
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:18,840
convoluted, criss-crossing ways

2697
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:21,360
that like everybody can be right

2698
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:24,480
in how they perceive the problems in our society.

2699
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,000
Because it's all happening,

2700
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,840
all the bad stuff is happening all the time to everyone,

2701
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:31,080
every bad thing you could possibly imagine

2702
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:33,560
it's happening to everyone.

2703
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:35,160
That's true, that's what I said before,

2704
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:38,600
like to every side, the other side is,

2705
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:41,400
they're correctly being identified as evil

2706
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:43,720
because they don't share their values

2707
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:45,600
which makes them evil in their mind

2708
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:48,560
and that's it, you can't argue with that, that's there.

2709
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:53,320
I'm interested in like, why happy things,

2710
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:58,240
like good things happening is just uninteresting as news.

2711
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:00,880
Because anger is a stronger, like it's our,

2712
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,240
there was a thing about how anger is the most vulnerable.

2713
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:03,400
Yeah, but why is it a stronger?

2714
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:05,080
Why is anger stronger?

2715
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:07,960
Disasters happen fast, like good things happen gradually.

2716
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:09,480
I think the reason why Gib

2717
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,960
ties into probably like biology really,

2718
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:14,400
cause like, if there's something good happens

2719
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,360
to like your tribe of like a hundred Neanderthals,

2720
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:20,080
like, oh good, my son was born, hooray,

2721
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:24,000
whereas, oh no, we're being invaded by the enemy,

2722
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,920
we're all going to be wiped out,

2723
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,800
like that's gonna trigger like a stronger.

2724
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:30,080
We need to be, yeah.

2725
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:30,920
That's just a guess.

2726
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,200
I agree with what Ben said too,

2727
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:34,040
that was a good point about how like,

2728
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:36,840
bad things happen fast and good things happen gradually.

2729
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:41,360
Like there's no nice equivalent of a school shooting

2730
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,960
where like someone comes into school in a trench coat

2731
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:46,520
and starts hugging everybody, like that never happens.

2732
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:47,800
That's not everything that's true.

2733
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:52,800
Yeah, I mean, all the positive news stories you read,

2734
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:55,520
like they're either boring, like, oh yeah,

2735
02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:00,520
that bill that was in town hall election, it got passed,

2736
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,280
we did it, like that's boring.

2737
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:03,560
Like you never see a volcano.

2738
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,920
Or it's something dumb, like, oh hey,

2739
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:08,360
the fucking Christmas parades in town,

2740
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:09,760
and Santa this year is-

2741
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:11,720
Oh, there's a cat who's a mayor of a town,

2742
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:12,880
like it's next to you, right?

2743
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:15,560
You never see a volcano erupt with doughnut sprinkles

2744
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:16,840
and confetti.

2745
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:20,600
Yeah, yeah, oh shit.

2746
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:22,760
It's always lava, for some fucked up reason,

2747
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:24,080
I don't know why.

2748
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:25,680
Yeah, it is, it's always,

2749
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:26,840
there's some reason it's always lava.

2750
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:27,680
It's like trying something new for once.

2751
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:28,520
It's always metaphorical lava.

2752
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,720
He's doing video games, what the fuck, no.

2753
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:33,040
You know, actually in Mario Odyssey,

2754
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:35,200
there's a volcano full of like, gravy or shit.

2755
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,440
Okay, all right.

2756
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,560
This is why, left or right,

2757
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:43,840
I don't think it makes sense to tie them into good and evil.

2758
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:46,760
But I do kind of think you can link good and evil

2759
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:49,200
to the top and bottom of this two A,

2760
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:52,160
which is authoritarian versus libertarian.

2761
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:55,320
Because I just think that the solution to all these problems

2762
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:57,760
is for everyone to be self-sufficient,

2763
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:00,280
not worry about what other fucking people are doing,

2764
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:02,440
and just mind their own goddamn business.

2765
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,640
I think that is just the best way to be.

2766
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:06,480
Stop telling me what to do.

2767
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,320
If everyone did that.

2768
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:08,160
Like, let the racist be racist.

2769
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:09,000
It would probably be good.

2770
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:09,840
Who gives a fuck?

2771
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:12,080
Because I got my shit going just fine over here,

2772
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,800
they have no influence on me,

2773
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:15,120
and those people can feel the same way

2774
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:16,840
about these trans-degenerate, you know,

2775
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:18,160
whatever's on the other side.

2776
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:20,520
I mean, I mean, it's just,

2777
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:23,120
if you let the racist be racist,

2778
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:24,400
then they vote for fucking-

2779
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:26,400
It's only a problem, it's only a problem.

2780
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:28,760
If then authoritarianism comes back,

2781
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:31,120
and they have leverage over the people.

2782
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:32,880
Which they will vote to make happen.

2783
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,480
I don't know, well, that's why I'm saying

2784
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:36,880
that libertarianism is the good.

2785
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:38,160
That is the way to be,

2786
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:40,280
so that people don't have this shit hanging over them,

2787
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:42,160
and there's no threat to anyone.

2788
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,480
That's whatever.

2789
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:45,560
I know that's idealistic and not practical,

2790
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:48,280
but I'm just saying, that's what I've ever seen.

2791
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:49,120
I gotcha.

2792
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:50,600
How many fucking voicemails do we have?

2793
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,000
We got seven more.

2794
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:52,840
Like, four, like, oh boy.

2795
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:55,200
We don't have to do them all that long, let's go.

2796
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:59,280
Okay, next one, this is from Cholo Jones.

2797
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,080
Let's see what he's got for us.

2798
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:05,200
You know, I have a real problem with people just saying,

2799
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:08,480
they're so irresponsible, they can't do anything.

2800
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:11,440
They all just need to get a responsibility board,

2801
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:13,840
get just a fucking white board or a cork board,

2802
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:15,080
and stop being so gay,

2803
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:17,040
and just write down all the things you get done.

2804
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:18,360
And if you don't accomplish them,

2805
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:19,400
you'll have something right there

2806
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:21,320
to remind you of what a failure are.

2807
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,360
You should get off your ass.

2808
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:24,760
Also, I have a problem with,

2809
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:28,720
did you think that animals just shouldn't exist?

2810
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:32,080
You won't find that sympathy here.

2811
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,200
Pokemon that are, like, you know,

2812
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:37,000
just not quite as cool, because they're like the same thing.

2813
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:42,000
You know, animals are Pokemon, is my point.

2814
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,200
No, dude.

2815
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,880
Did you use a known Pokemon, Robert?

2816
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:47,440
You don't wanna collect all the animals.

2817
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:50,400
Can you imagine how hellish that would be?

2818
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,280
I'm gonna come down hard on the didgy side

2819
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:54,520
of this today, animals against them.

2820
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:57,320
I mean, me and, I'm with Carl Pilkington,

2821
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:58,880
who thinks that animals are redundant,

2822
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:02,360
and most of them probably don't need to exist.

2823
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:04,720
Like, how many slow insects do you need?

2824
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:07,320
Like, yeah, we've got the snail and the inchworm.

2825
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,960
Like, what do we need both for?

2826
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:11,520
They do the same thing.

2827
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,120
You're not wrong, you're not wrong.

2828
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:15,720
Shit, did I title this one wrong?

2829
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:17,320
Oh, no, sorry, I've got the next one open.

2830
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:20,760
Yeah, I like animals, so I'm on this guy's side.

2831
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,760
They're cool, you know, mostly dogs.

2832
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:23,600
Don't really care about the other ones.

2833
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:26,200
I like me some chicken wings.

2834
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:27,800
Agreed.

2835
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:28,800
All right, let's just move on to the next one.

2836
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,720
All right, let's fuck this whole gay shit.

2837
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:32,480
All right, here we go, play.

2838
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:34,680
This is from Free Patreon Money.

2839
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:37,360
This is from Free Patreon Money.

2840
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:38,200
Oh my God.

2841
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:39,640
I like this call already.

2842
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:40,480
Answer this one.

2843
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:41,600
Here we go.

2844
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:45,280
All right, I have the deal of a fucking lifetime right here.

2845
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:46,120
Sounds like monthly.

2846
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:47,000
This is the epic deal.

2847
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,840
I thought it was monthly for a second.

2848
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:51,000
I like this girl, I like her a lot,

2849
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,440
and we talk sometimes, we're friends.

2850
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:55,320
And I wanna be her girlfriend, I wanna date her.

2851
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:56,640
So give me some advice,

2852
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:58,440
and if she becomes my girlfriend,

2853
02:04:58,440 --> 02:04:59,520
then this is what you receive.

2854
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,280
You get Patreon donations galore.

2855
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:06,560
I'll donate lots of money to every single Patreon

2856
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:10,080
for the everything, all the links that are in the description.

2857
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:12,440
This is one of her other links that exists.

2858
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:14,200
I'll get all of the money,

2859
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:16,320
and I'll do it real good.

2860
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:17,560
Just give me some advice.

2861
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:18,680
I want this girl so bad.

2862
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:20,680
Okay, I know exactly what to do.

2863
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,760
I know the answer to this.

2864
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:25,040
So like, okay, she's a girl,

2865
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:28,160
she's your friend, and you really wanna be with her.

2866
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:29,560
And you don't know how to, here's what you do.

2867
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:34,560
You don't, you fucking, you sneak it in a little bit.

2868
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:36,600
You fuck, like a little bit at a time.

2869
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,800
Like you just kind of, you know,

2870
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,640
you're hanging out with her like normal,

2871
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:40,880
and you're laughing and you're joking.

2872
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:43,200
You're being cool, you're being your regular cool self,

2873
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,320
like nothing's different.

2874
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,000
And then like, you sort of slip in,

2875
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,760
like you look nice, or you look,

2876
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:49,480
you look, your hair is nice today,

2877
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,240
or something that she'll like notice, you know?

2878
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:57,080
Yeah, just to acclimate her to the idea

2879
02:05:57,400 --> 02:06:00,000
of seeing you as a sexual being.

2880
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,720
You've gotta, you've gotta like,

2881
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:04,600
and when you finally do like sort of pop the question,

2882
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:07,000
like hey, you wanna kind of like be together,

2883
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,720
like a fucking like you and me, and like a romantic thing.

2884
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:12,040
You gotta say it, you gotta be casual about it,

2885
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:14,200
and if she's not cool with it, and she's not okay with it,

2886
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,040
you gotta act like it didn't even really matter to you.

2887
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:17,440
It was just a dumb stray thought in your head,

2888
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:18,640
and just drop it, and then like,

2889
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:20,360
you maybe ask it again like six months,

2890
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:22,560
but you know, if, whenever she rejects you,

2891
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,280
just act like it doesn't even fucking matter,

2892
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:28,040
and it's just dumb, because if you say to her,

2893
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:30,400
all of a sudden, I'm in love with you,

2894
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,960
and we really have to be together,

2895
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:33,360
and I want you to be my girlfriend,

2896
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:36,440
and I want to be in love with you forever,

2897
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:39,240
that's, you're gonna be in a bad situation,

2898
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:40,080
if you fucking do that.

2899
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:40,920
You won't want that, you won't want that.

2900
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:42,600
Don't do it, yeah.

2901
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:45,320
And especially if you do that, and she says no,

2902
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:48,040
and then you take it like, hard,

2903
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:51,120
then here, you're really in trouble if you take it hard.

2904
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:51,960
That's a bad look.

2905
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:52,800
That's true.

2906
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:53,640
That's a bad look.

2907
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:54,480
Ask yourself this question,

2908
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:57,560
and you have to be honest about this.

2909
02:06:57,560 --> 02:07:02,360
It's, am I, do I, am I willing to risk my friendship

2910
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:04,320
with this person to date them,

2911
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:05,840
or to phrase it another way,

2912
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:10,840
it's like, is this person's friendship important enough

2913
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:13,160
to me to not jeopardize the date?

2914
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:15,680
It's like, do you want this person as a friend,

2915
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,240
or do you really just want to date them,

2916
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:18,600
and you're kind of just killing time

2917
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:19,800
until you can get them to date you?

2918
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:20,640
Yeah.

2919
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,000
If you really want to date them,

2920
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,120
and you're just being friends with them in the meantime,

2921
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:25,640
like as the stopgap measures,

2922
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:27,320
you should just go ahead and fuck you up.

2923
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:29,800
The question you've got to ask is if they were a dude,

2924
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:31,600
would you still be hanging out with them?

2925
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:34,600
And if the answer is no, you're fooling yourself.

2926
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:39,280
You just got to pretend to be really totally confident,

2927
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:41,400
and just be like, yeah, agreed.

2928
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:43,440
Hey, I want to go out with you, how about that, huh?

2929
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:44,280
What, no?

2930
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:45,120
It doesn't matter.

2931
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:46,640
I'm just being cool, whatever, baby.

2932
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:48,000
I'm just being cool.

2933
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,200
Yeah, exactly that.

2934
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:53,560
Write that down and practice it in the mirror.

2935
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:55,880
Hey, guys, I'm just being cool.

2936
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:58,080
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not trying to be weird here,

2937
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,040
and I'm just being cool,

2938
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:00,760
but I thought maybe it all in you and me,

2939
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:01,600
and I'm just being cool.

2940
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:04,080
Here's the thing, here's the thing.

2941
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:06,960
On some level, I think that that might actually work,

2942
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:09,600
because humans are very weak and susceptible,

2943
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:13,000
and I think that if you insist that you are cool enough,

2944
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,440
I think that some people will come to believe it.

2945
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:18,280
It's all confidence.

2946
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:20,080
Yeah, confidence is just a repeat.

2947
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:20,920
You need to have the volume as well.

2948
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:22,240
If you just repeat the association,

2949
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:23,640
just repeat the association.

2950
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:24,840
Me, cool.

2951
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:25,680
Wait, what?

2952
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:28,560
It gives it how long to be assertive and confident.

2953
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:31,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's like me, cool.

2954
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:33,600
Every time I've tried to be cool in that way,

2955
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:35,800
people associate you with coolness.

2956
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:38,800
Yeah, I've attempted little things like that.

2957
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,720
But that's how advertising works.

2958
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:42,760
I've attempted little things like that before,

2959
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:44,920
but it has come always down to the fact

2960
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:47,120
that I have a small, meek voice,

2961
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:49,400
and it doesn't work, no matter what I say.

2962
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:50,240
People, girls, and...

2963
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:53,280
I have to be louder in order for people to give it to me.

2964
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:56,920
Some people would find it cheesy and make fun of you,

2965
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:59,400
but I guarantee you at least some people

2966
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:01,040
would begin to associate you with being cool.

2967
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,760
Well, it was like that time,

2968
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:03,600
I think that's interesting.

2969
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:05,880
That blessed interaction I had in line

2970
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:08,680
to get into the food court or whatever at college,

2971
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:10,520
when I was talking to my friends about,

2972
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:11,360
I can't remember what it was,

2973
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,520
something about like, I don't know,

2974
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:16,120
I think making out, I think it was unrelated,

2975
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:17,680
but whatever we had said,

2976
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:21,640
the guy in front of us in line interpreted as this.

2977
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:22,480
And he's like, turns out, I was like,

2978
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,480
whoa, you guys do that too?

2979
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:27,480
Just go up to girls at parties and ask them to make out?

2980
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:29,320
One of them's gonna say yes,

2981
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:31,320
and the thing is, he's right.

2982
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:32,480
The thing is, he's right.

2983
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:34,400
And I love that, man, he's a brother.

2984
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:37,120
I mean, the drunk ones probably.

2985
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:38,880
Yeah, well, I mean, what's your goal here?

2986
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,360
Is your goal just to make out?

2987
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,520
And that gets, sure, go for it.

2988
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:43,220
If your goal is to form a relationship,

2989
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:46,520
this might not be the best way to do it, or whatever.

2990
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,640
What if you go up to every girl,

2991
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:50,280
he's like asking them to make out,

2992
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:53,280
forgetting that you are wearing your Trump hat,

2993
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:55,840
and all of them attack you?

2994
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:58,800
They'll say, I'll tell you what you do.

2995
02:09:58,800 --> 02:09:59,640
I'll tell you what you do.

2996
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:00,480
I'll tell you what you do.

2997
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:02,080
Just go, hey, baby, I'm just being cool.

2998
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:03,560
I'm just being cool.

2999
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:05,000
I'm just being cool, I'm just being cool.

3000
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,880
You're in New York City, walking down a lot of traffic.

3001
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,480
Hey, I'm being cool here.

3002
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:11,320
Hey, I'm being cool here.

3003
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:13,080
You just turn your cap backwards,

3004
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:15,400
and they can't see they're making America great again,

3005
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:17,320
and it's just really cool.

3006
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:18,720
You come out of the voting booth,

3007
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:21,360
just fresh after voting for Trump and your MAGA hat,

3008
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:25,760
and you get mobbed, you get mobbed by SJW cucks,

3009
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:29,240
and they're like, hey, man, I'm just being cool, guys.

3010
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:31,200
I'm just trying to be cool here.

3011
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:33,520
They think you're a Trumper seeing the front of your hat,

3012
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:37,120
but you just, you turn your hat backwards,

3013
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:38,320
and it's like, oh, he's just being cool.

3014
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:40,160
He's just being cool.

3015
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:41,000
He's in the backwards.

3016
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:41,840
That's cool.

3017
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,440
Now, that's what Trump himself should do.

3018
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:44,400
He should get out of the podium.

3019
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:48,920
Lib Tards hate this one weird old tip to just be cool.

3020
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:50,240
Turn your hat on that MAGA hat.

3021
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,840
Trump should give a speech next time,

3022
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,400
like the whole nation is mad at him

3023
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:54,720
for something that he did.

3024
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:57,440
He should just be like, hey, I'm just being cool.

3025
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:59,720
I don't know, I'm just trying to be cool.

3026
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:02,160
Look, America, I'm just trying to be cool here.

3027
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,720
I like, like, instead of saying I'm trying to be cool,

3028
02:11:07,720 --> 02:11:10,680
just to say I am being cool, I'm just being right.

3029
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:13,360
Like, the declaration is part of why it's so serious.

3030
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:14,200
I'm just being cool.

3031
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,480
Look, I'm just being cool.

3032
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:17,200
I'm not being an asshole.

3033
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:18,880
I'm just being cool.

3034
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:21,840
It's on the news.

3035
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:23,360
It turns out President Trump is cool.

3036
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,360
I swear, I swear it'll work.

3037
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:26,200
Yeah, at last.

3038
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:28,120
The human brain is simple enough.

3039
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:29,400
He skates skateboard onto the podium.

3040
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:31,680
I believe that the human brain is simple enough

3041
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:34,400
that that would work and have its desired effect.

3042
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:35,320
Yeah, I think so too.

3043
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:36,160
I think so too.

3044
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,720
I'm just being cool.

3045
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:39,760
Did you guys see that guy?

3046
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:42,200
There was a Democratic challenger to Ted Cruz

3047
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:44,920
in Running for Senate during the election,

3048
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:46,320
who like, Beto O'Rourke, that was him.

3049
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:49,720
He literally skateboarded out, I think, multiple times

3050
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:53,080
to the podium to, I think he's the genesis point

3051
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:55,520
of this whole just be and cool thing.

3052
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,760
It didn't work though when he lost.

3053
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:59,760
I mean, people have been, well, it wasn't that cool.

3054
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:02,200
Yeah, it wasn't cool enough.

3055
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:03,040
Wasn't wearing a backwards hat.

3056
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,440
People have been being cool since the beginning of time.

3057
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:08,240
All right, let's move on to our next question here.

3058
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:11,680
This is from Been There Since Day One.

3059
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:12,720
What's the name of this guy?

3060
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:13,560
All right, let's see.

3061
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:16,360
Oh boohoo, I'm a Gen 1 PCB watcher

3062
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:18,320
and I want the original theme back.

3063
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:28,320
Yeah, me too, dawg.

3064
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:29,320
Yeah.

3065
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:47,320
Welcome to this show.

3066
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:51,320
I want to do it.

3067
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:53,320
Is this the same guy who did the megalovania

3068
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:55,320
because he's good on piano?

3069
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:56,320
Yeah.

3070
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:59,320
Man, you know, every once in a while,

3071
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:03,320
I remember that I put together some fucking dumb piano loop

3072
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:07,320
that people cover and it fills me with the weirdest ride.

3073
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:08,320
It's nice.

3074
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:13,320
So, you know, I mean, not to poke holes in your story,

3075
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:15,320
Mr. Been There Since Day One,

3076
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:18,320
you know, we didn't have the theme song in the beginning.

3077
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:19,320
Oh, Christ.

3078
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:22,320
That was like 50, what was that, like 50 episodes in,

3079
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:23,320
that we got that?

3080
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:24,320
Maybe like, maybe not that.

3081
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:28,320
Something like that, maybe 20, 30, I don't know.

3082
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:33,320
Well, I do, I like, yeah, I don't understand people

3083
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:34,320
that whine about the old theme.

3084
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:35,320
I mean, I like the old theme song.

3085
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:37,320
The new theme song incorporates it.

3086
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:39,320
You know, maybe you liked the runner up better.

3087
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:40,320
You know, I'm sorry.

3088
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:42,320
I guess they could just think it straight up just sounds better.

3089
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:44,320
I suppose that's fair.

3090
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,320
I don't know.

3091
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:48,320
You know, I think it's kind of funny how divisive.

3092
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:50,320
I think maybe that makes me like it more,

3093
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:51,320
just how divisive the...

3094
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:52,320
I kind of agree too.

3095
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:55,320
I will continue to use the runner up every time I edit.

3096
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:56,320
That's fine.

3097
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,320
That's fair enough.

3098
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:58,320
Fair enough.

3099
02:13:58,320 --> 02:13:59,320
I am the rebel.

3100
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:00,320
All right.

3101
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:01,320
Join my team.

3102
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:02,320
Join my tribe.

3103
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,320
Next one.

3104
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:05,320
This is from Mookies.

3105
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:06,320
Mookies.

3106
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:07,320
Speak.

3107
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:09,320
Okay, Tom, I know you're there.

3108
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:11,320
You're on every single episode.

3109
02:14:11,320 --> 02:14:12,320
You need the money.

3110
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:13,320
I know you're a poor boy.

3111
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:14,320
I love you.

3112
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:20,320
Now, a long time ago, you promised that you'd be making a Splatoon 2 I Am Games video.

3113
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,320
Where is it?

3114
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,320
I need it.

3115
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:24,320
Splatoon 2 is the best game on Switch.

3116
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:25,320
Mario Odyssey?

3117
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:26,320
Dog shit.

3118
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:27,320
Breath of the Wild?

3119
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:28,320
Okay.

3120
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,320
Octopath?

3121
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:30,320
Really fucking fun.

3122
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,320
Fucking Pokemon Let's Go?

3123
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:32,320
Meh.

3124
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:36,320
Probably not worth $60, but fucking Splatoon 2 is the Switch.

3125
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:37,320
It is everything.

3126
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:38,320
It is the best.

3127
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:39,320
I need that video.

3128
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:40,320
Make it now.

3129
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,320
Thank you.

3130
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:48,320
I'm on your friends list on Pokemon Go and the nicknames, like the puns you give your

3131
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:50,320
Pokemon, your buddy Pokemon, they're funny.

3132
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:52,320
I love them and I love you.

3133
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,320
Okay.

3134
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:54,320
Bye.

3135
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:55,320
Whoa.

3136
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:56,320
Thank you.

3137
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:57,320
I have something to say about Pokemon Go.

3138
02:14:57,320 --> 02:15:01,320
I don't know when else I'll get a chance to say this, but you know who I'm friends with

3139
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:04,320
on Pokemon Go is none other than Russell.

3140
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:05,320
Oh, yeah.

3141
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:06,320
Okay.

3142
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:09,320
And he is decked out in Gengar Atalia.

3143
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:11,320
He is all Gengar all the time.

3144
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:13,320
He's real fucking scary.

3145
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:14,320
So Tom, how about it?

3146
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:16,320
Yeah, I'll get to it at some point.

3147
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:22,320
There was a while when I was, I planned on doing it like God, like months ago, but then

3148
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:27,320
I, they brought Nintendo Switch online, the online service up and I didn't have it.

3149
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:30,320
So I'm like, well, I can't even play Splatoon 2 anymore.

3150
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:31,320
Fuck.

3151
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:35,320
But then someone generously gave me access to their family plan thing.

3152
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:36,320
So now I have it again.

3153
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:39,320
So I have like notes for a script kind of written up.

3154
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:43,320
The idea is just like, it's the most comfortable multiplayer game ever and it's not gay and

3155
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:44,320
it's fun.

3156
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:47,320
And it doesn't make you feel like shit when you lose because it's just happy and good

3157
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:52,320
and all the aesthetic and everything like, like, like the lobby just like, like you,

3158
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:55,320
you go and do these fights and everything and then like go back to the lobby and everything's

3159
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:56,320
kind of chill and everyone's just hanging out.

3160
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:59,320
Like all the people you were just fighting just like populate the lobby and it's like

3161
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:01,320
kind of reminds you it's just a game.

3162
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:02,320
It's fun.

3163
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:03,320
Don't, don't get mad.

3164
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:04,320
It's not worth it.

3165
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,320
Like you don't, it's just better.

3166
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:06,320
It's the best.

3167
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:07,320
It's fun.

3168
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:08,320
It's comfy.

3169
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:09,320
It's great.

3170
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:11,320
And it began and ended multiplayer gaming.

3171
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:13,320
Splatoon 2 was the Alpha and the Omega and it's great.

3172
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:14,320
So there you go.

3173
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:15,320
There's a Cliff Notes version, dude.

3174
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:16,320
I got you.

3175
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:18,320
I feel you on that.

3176
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:20,320
Did you play the DLC?

3177
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:22,820
You don't have the DLC yet.

3178
02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:24,320
I just want to go on record.

3179
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:32,040
I beat the main game and I beat the DLC recently and I beat all 80 levels in the DLC and I'm

3180
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:37,640
on the secret super duper uber final boss and it's so fucking frustrating.

3181
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:43,680
It's a piece of, Splatoon kind of has terrible controls and I kind of hate everything about

3182
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:45,040
how you play that game.

3183
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:50,040
Oh, it was great up to this secret boss and now it's shit and I'm mad.

3184
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:52,040
Your problem is you're playing a single player Splatoon 2.

3185
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:53,040
Why would you do that?

3186
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,040
I know.

3187
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:55,040
I've never touched the campaign.

3188
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:56,040
I don't even care about the multiplayer.

3189
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,040
You don't care about the multiplayer.

3190
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:58,040
Oh my god.

3191
02:16:58,040 --> 02:16:59,040
No, no, no.

3192
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:00,040
The campaign is great.

3193
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:01,040
I love the campaign.

3194
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:05,040
Splatoon is worth it just for the single player for me personally.

3195
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:09,040
The single player in Splatoon 1 was pretty fun, but I mean the game's about the multiplayer.

3196
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:11,040
I literally don't care about the multiplayer.

3197
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:14,040
I can't use the ink brush in the campaign.

3198
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:16,040
It gives me the guns and I don't want to use the gun.

3199
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:18,040
I want to use the ink brush because that's fun.

3200
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:19,040
Well, in the DLC.

3201
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:21,040
I want to use the roller.

3202
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:27,040
Yeah, I want to use the bus story, the lore, the song at the end of the fucking DLC.

3203
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,040
Can you beat it?

3204
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:30,040
I played through the whole game.

3205
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:33,040
The main story is about Marie and Callie.

3206
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:35,040
Marie's disappeared.

3207
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:36,040
I think that's her.

3208
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:37,040
Callie disappeared.

3209
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,040
Callie disappeared.

3210
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:39,040
No, Callie disappeared.

3211
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:40,040
Yes, that's right.

3212
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:43,040
I'm gonna play this and I know it more than you.

3213
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:44,040
I just forget the names.

3214
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:45,040
That's it.

3215
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:48,040
The new Squid Girls or whatever, the black one and the little one.

3216
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:49,040
I forget their fucking name.

3217
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:50,040
Pearl and Marina.

3218
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:51,040
Pearl and Marina.

3219
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:52,040
Yeah.

3220
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:56,040
You don't know anything about them, but the DLC gives them character and fleshes them out.

3221
02:17:56,040 --> 02:18:02,040
They like them now and they got cool songs and they're cool guys and the levels are fun

3222
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:04,040
and it was a real challenge to beat it.

3223
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:07,040
And this final fucking boss is just so fuck.

3224
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:12,040
I hate Splatoon's combat system so much despite everything I just said.

3225
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:13,040
It's shit.

3226
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:14,040
It's a multiplayer game.

3227
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:16,040
It's not designed for what you're doing.

3228
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:20,040
I want 100% believe everything you just said, but are you telling me that you don't play

3229
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:21,040
the multiplayer?

3230
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:24,560
Like every once in a while I will fire it up for a little bit, but I weigh disproportionately

3231
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:28,560
more enjoy to the single player than I enjoy the multiplayer every once in a while.

3232
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:29,560
Incredible.

3233
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:31,320
Which is just because I love the single player so much.

3234
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:32,800
It's got so much style.

3235
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:33,800
It's got so much personality.

3236
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:35,800
I mean that oozes in every facet of Splatoon.

3237
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:36,800
Sure.

3238
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:37,800
Splatoon is aesthetically.

3239
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:38,800
Yeah.

3240
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:39,800
Yeah.

3241
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:42,060
The aesthetic is unbelievable.

3242
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:43,060
I love it so much.

3243
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:44,060
It's so, it's perfect.

3244
02:18:44,060 --> 02:18:45,060
It is perfect.

3245
02:18:45,060 --> 02:18:48,560
The whole, the urban, the hip, the hip urban youth culture.

3246
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:49,560
It's great.

3247
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:50,560
Shit.

3248
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:51,560
I cannot wait to play as Inkling.

3249
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:52,560
The neon, the neon colors.

3250
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:59,000
My one upset thing is that Inkling is in Splatoon, is in Smash, New Smash, but that

3251
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,560
Octobitch is not like a, you know, not a costume.

3252
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:05,560
Like an alternate costume.

3253
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:08,560
I mean they could make it a fucking Echo Fighter I guess, but just make it a costume.

3254
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:09,560
I just want the costume.

3255
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:10,560
That's all I care about.

3256
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:14,560
Because Octolingirl is an 8 out of 8 and I love her.

3257
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,560
Agent 8.

3258
02:19:15,560 --> 02:19:16,560
That's her name.

3259
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:17,560
Basically the second.

3260
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:18,560
No.

3261
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:19,560
Her hairstyle being different.

3262
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:20,560
They just have different hair.

3263
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:21,560
And her different eye makeup.

3264
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:22,560
It's a huge difference.

3265
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:23,560
Okay.

3266
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:24,560
But anyway.

3267
02:19:24,560 --> 02:19:25,560
All right.

3268
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:26,560
Fine.

3269
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:27,560
Let's move along.

3270
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:28,560
I will beat it though.

3271
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:29,560
I will beat that fucking boss.

3272
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:30,560
It's a piece of shit though.

3273
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:31,560
All right.

3274
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:33,560
Next, next call is from, oh wait.

3275
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:34,560
You know what?

3276
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:35,560
This is from Munchy.

3277
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:36,560
It's this guy.

3278
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:37,560
Enlightened history major.

3279
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:39,560
Just saying how cool Munchy is for being in history.

3280
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:41,560
I'm just going to skip that one since he's not here.

3281
02:19:41,560 --> 02:19:42,560
Yeah.

3282
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:43,560
All right.

3283
02:19:43,560 --> 02:19:44,560
Let's go to the next one.

3284
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:45,560
This is from, here we go.

3285
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:46,560
This is a good one.

3286
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:51,560
This PCP fan is calling in to update us on his current situation.

3287
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:54,560
I used to be the biggest fan of the PCP.

3288
02:19:54,560 --> 02:20:00,560
Every day I would listen to Digi Bro's Toofless, gummy voice echo from my brain.

3289
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:04,560
And when I say fan, I don't mean triple Joker LMFAO.

3290
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:08,560
No, I was deep into that PCP war.

3291
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:09,560
I was here.

3292
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:10,560
Triple Joker's trip pretty deep.

3293
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:15,560
I think that Collins played the role of me app on the world famous web series inanimate

3294
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:16,560
insanity 2.

3295
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:17,560
You're more just a Digi.

3296
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:19,560
I personally find that to be underrated.

3297
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:22,560
And there I say, rad.

3298
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:24,560
Funny joke.

3299
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:28,560
But back to my story.

3300
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:30,560
I had this internet discord GF.

3301
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:31,560
Oh no.

3302
02:20:31,560 --> 02:20:33,560
And one day I showed her the PCP.

3303
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:34,560
All of it.

3304
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,560
The entire PCP.

3305
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:37,560
No.

3306
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:39,560
Did you tie her up and make her listen?

3307
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:40,560
No.

3308
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:43,560
And she sent me and said that this podcast is shit.

3309
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:47,560
And will never be as real or interesting as the Jill Rogan experience.

3310
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:48,560
Oh come on.

3311
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:49,560
That's not right.

3312
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:50,560
No.

3313
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:56,560
Left me for a red pill to YouTube commentator who makes fun of autistic people for easy money.

3314
02:20:56,560 --> 02:21:00,560
And that's when I decided to drop out of school and become my own internet personality.

3315
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:06,560
My own superhero from the depths of the underground internet scene.

3316
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:10,560
And well now I'm homeless.

3317
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:12,560
It didn't work out I guess.

3318
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:16,560
Jinkling change on the sidewalk of Skid Row.

3319
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:18,560
And I blame you.

3320
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:20,560
This is all your fault.

3321
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:21,560
Fuck you.

3322
02:21:21,560 --> 02:21:22,560
No, no, no, no.

3323
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:25,560
The only response to this is the procrastinator's podcast.

3324
02:21:25,560 --> 02:21:26,560
Where the reason people are dying.

3325
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:27,560
Next call.

3326
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:28,560
Right.

3327
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:29,560
Yeah.

3328
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:30,560
We are.

3329
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:31,560
We are.

3330
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:32,560
This guy's not long for this world.

3331
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:33,560
God.

3332
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:34,560
She cut us deep.

3333
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:35,560
Cut us deep with that.

3334
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:37,560
We're not as good as the Joe Rogan experience.

3335
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:38,560
How could we compete with Joe Rogan?

3336
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:39,560
God damn it.

3337
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:40,560
He's got.

3338
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:41,560
I don't know.

3339
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:42,560
He gets interesting guests.

3340
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:46,560
We have too much hair to compete with Joe Rogan unfortunately.

3341
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:47,560
That's true.

3342
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:48,560
He's too powerful.

3343
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:49,560
We can't beat him.

3344
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:50,560
We gotta join a little crowd.

3345
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:52,560
We gotta get Joe Rogan a PCPist.

3346
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:53,560
Clearly.

3347
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:54,560
Can we get.

3348
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,560
Here's the idea.

3349
02:21:55,560 --> 02:21:56,560
Okay.

3350
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:57,560
Joe Rogan podcast.

3351
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:58,560
Next episode.

3352
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:01,560
It's the entirety of the PCP is the one guest.

3353
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:05,560
Oh, and every word is spoken by a different member in a circular order.

3354
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:07,560
That'd be good.

3355
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:08,560
Let's make that happen.

3356
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:11,560
Oh, like the kids from code name kids next door.

3357
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:12,560
Oh, yeah.

3358
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:14,560
The lovely children from down the lane or whatever.

3359
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:15,560
The delightful children.

3360
02:22:15,560 --> 02:22:16,560
The delightful children.

3361
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:17,560
God.

3362
02:22:17,560 --> 02:22:18,560
I loved those.

3363
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:19,560
God.

3364
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:21,560
That's the best fucking show code name kids next door.

3365
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:22,560
Literally great.

3366
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:25,560
Literally insane pathos and character development.

3367
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:27,560
The best.

3368
02:22:27,560 --> 02:22:31,560
I also remember when Digi was on inanimate insanity too.

3369
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:33,560
What a weird, what a weird time.

3370
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:35,560
Doesn't he still regularly do that voice?

3371
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:37,560
I mean, I don't know when they last did it.

3372
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:40,560
Well, I haven't heard about it in forever, but maybe.

3373
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:43,560
He plays like the, what, like the fucking iMac Pro or something.

3374
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:48,560
I gotta imagine that they wrote like tons and tons of scripts and he probably recorded

3375
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:50,560
lines for way in advance.

3376
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:51,560
Probably.

3377
02:22:51,560 --> 02:22:55,560
To the extent that they might still be animating new episodes with like lines that he recorded

3378
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:56,560
like who knows how long ago.

3379
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:57,560
Yeah.

3380
02:22:57,560 --> 02:22:58,560
Yeah.

3381
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,560
All right.

3382
02:22:59,560 --> 02:23:04,560
Well, Joe, I have actually dreamed about Joe Rogan bringing me on the podcast and I'm

3383
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:07,360
just, I think about that and I'm like, I am not interesting enough.

3384
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:11,560
I have nothing to contribute to, to be invited on this podcast.

3385
02:23:11,560 --> 02:23:16,560
It's kind of funny how like we're focusing on the Joe Rogan aspect of this guy who's

3386
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:18,560
I do listen to him a lot and blaming us.

3387
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:23,560
Oh, I forgot about his whole girlfriend and his girlfriend ruined his life because we,

3388
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:29,560
not because we were bad, but because we weren't as good as the Joe Rogan experience.

3389
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:30,560
Yeah.

3390
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,560
Have me on Joe.

3391
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:33,560
We'll make it happen.

3392
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:34,560
You know what?

3393
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:38,560
This actually makes me actually sad to think that I am not an interesting enough person

3394
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:40,560
to be on Joe Rogan's show.

3395
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:41,560
Well, I was good.

3396
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:42,560
I was just gonna be sad.

3397
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:43,560
I was just gonna be sad.

3398
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:46,560
Like there's, that's, that's quitter's attitude and like what, why is it low?

3399
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:47,560
Okay.

3400
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:48,560
Well, here's the thing.

3401
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:49,560
I guess that's a good question.

3402
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:54,560
They had MKBHD on Joe Rogan and MKBHD is not exactly an interesting guy.

3403
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:57,560
He just like, dude, he's got tons to talk about.

3404
02:23:57,560 --> 02:23:58,560
He just, he just knows about tech.

3405
02:23:58,560 --> 02:23:59,560
He just attacks you.

3406
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:03,560
No, listen, listen, there's not, there's nothing interesting.

3407
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:08,560
If there's nothing, like the people, I don't know what kind of guests Joe Rogan or anyone

3408
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:09,560
else gets on.

3409
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:10,560
Like anyone, right?

3410
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:11,560
Yeah.

3411
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:12,560
Like these people are not inherently more interesting.

3412
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:14,560
They do all the same shit as everyone else.

3413
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:17,560
They're only interesting because they have a cloud, you know, which let's be honest is

3414
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:18,560
just an accident.

3415
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:19,560
You know what?

3416
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:20,560
It's just an accident of history.

3417
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:24,560
They're interesting inherently because of their cloud and because people previously know them.

3418
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:26,560
It's not that these people have more interesting experience.

3419
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:31,560
We're gonna try and sweep all this under the rug and be like, Joe Rogan, whatever, Joe Rogan

3420
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:32,560
on a good deal, it's fine.

3421
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:36,560
And then next, the new episode is gonna come out and it's gonna be fucking laserbot on

3422
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:39,560
the Joe Rogan experience and then it's all gonna fall into place.

3423
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:40,560
Damn it, laserbot!

3424
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:44,560
Oh, if Joe Rogan got fucking laserbot, I would fucking kill myself.

3425
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:45,560
You know?

3426
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,560
He's mine, damn it, he's mine!

3427
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:51,560
You don't want your ceiling to be the H3 podcast.

3428
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:53,560
You wanna strive for Joe Rogan.

3429
02:24:53,560 --> 02:24:54,560
I agree.

3430
02:24:54,560 --> 02:24:55,560
I agree.

3431
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:58,560
Which I think we've pretty, you know, this is maybe a little sad as well.

3432
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:01,560
I think I've settled into a hierarchy of podcasts in my mind.

3433
02:25:01,560 --> 02:25:02,560
Number one is Joe Rogan.

3434
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:06,560
And then quite a bit down there is the H3 podcast.

3435
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:09,560
I've never listened to Joe Rogan, by the way.

3436
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:10,560
Just putting that out there.

3437
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:11,560
Yeah.

3438
02:25:11,560 --> 02:25:12,560
There's a lot of good stuff.

3439
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:13,560
I don't know.

3440
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:14,560
I recommend it.

3441
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:16,560
It's on the Stone Cold Steve Austin podcast.

3442
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:17,560
Now, there's a goal.

3443
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:18,560
Now, there's a goal.

3444
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:19,560
You know what's funny, though?

3445
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:24,560
My years ago, my buddy Doug told me about how great the Joe Rogan podcast was.

3446
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:25,560
It was probably four or five years ago.

3447
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:27,560
And I was like, oh, who the fuck's that guy?

3448
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:29,560
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

3449
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:31,560
And now I listen regularly and I'm a huge fan.

3450
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:33,560
I have never once spoken to him about this.

3451
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:35,560
I should do that at some point.

3452
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:36,560
All right.

3453
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:38,560
Anyway, let's move on to that.

3454
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:42,560
And he'll probably be like, oh, you're still listening to Joe Rogan podcast, bro.

3455
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:44,560
I'm moving up in the world.

3456
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:46,560
It's all about Harmontown now.

3457
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:48,560
Yeah, that's true.

3458
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:53,560
These fucking Big Shot podcast, they're fucking, I'm so sick of them.

3459
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:54,560
No, I'm not.

3460
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:55,560
I love them.

3461
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:56,560
I love listening to podcasts.

3462
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:59,560
I'm sick of them being bearded.

3463
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:01,560
I really love Fat Man on Batman.

3464
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:02,560
That's the only thing I hate about them.

3465
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:03,560
I don't know.

3466
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:04,560
It's the Kevin Smith podcast.

3467
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:05,560
Oh, Kevin Smith.

3468
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:06,560
Yeah.

3469
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:07,560
Kevin Smith's, yeah.

3470
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:08,560
I didn't know he was still doing it.

3471
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,560
He does it, but now it's a video podcast and he films it.

3472
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:18,560
Way in the past when he had Tara Strong on, and now I liked Tara Strong because of Twilight Sparkle.

3473
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:23,560
No, no, on the Fat Man on Batman had Tara Strong because she does Spat Girl, I think.

3474
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:24,560
And she's also a fucking Harley Quinn.

3475
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:25,560
Yeah.

3476
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:26,560
Oh, yeah.

3477
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:28,560
She's like every female voice.

3478
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:29,560
He does it now.

3479
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:32,560
Like they film it in like this special bar with like an audience.

3480
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:37,560
So it's like, they're standing up microphones and it's really, really cool.

3481
02:26:37,560 --> 02:26:39,560
That's a good thing.

3482
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:40,560
That sounds cool.

3483
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:41,560
I should check it out.

3484
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:47,560
I just want to say for fun that the reason why this is solidified so much in my mind,

3485
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:51,560
it's kind of like an alpha male dominance hierarchy thing that makes me think that Joe

3486
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:55,560
Rogan is so much better than H3, even though H3 is pretty good when I've listened.

3487
02:26:55,560 --> 02:27:00,560
It's specifically that H3 had Bill Burr on who's like an equal, a contemporary of Joe

3488
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:01,560
Rogan.

3489
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:02,560
They're both comedians.

3490
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:08,560
And that Bill Burr podcast destroyed Ethan's like status in my mind.

3491
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:16,060
Because he just got so blown over by Bill who was just so, he was like so like not interested

3492
02:27:16,060 --> 02:27:19,560
in being there and was just like bulldozing Ethan.

3493
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:20,560
It's so sad.

3494
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:21,560
I'm sorry.

3495
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:23,560
I didn't mean to like, you know, it was sad.

3496
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:24,560
It's too bad for him.

3497
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:29,560
It's sad seeing the difference between like a top comedian and a top fucking YouTube comedian.

3498
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:30,560
You know, it is.

3499
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:31,560
It's fascinating.

3500
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:33,560
It is fascinating to see that.

3501
02:27:33,560 --> 02:27:34,560
I got to see this.

3502
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:35,560
I want to see Ethan square him.

3503
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:38,560
Not because I hate him, but I've never heard of this.

3504
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:39,560
Yeah.

3505
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:40,560
Check it out.

3506
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:43,560
Ethan is, you know, I don't mind Ethan or anything, but he is pretty smug.

3507
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:44,560
Yeah.

3508
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:45,560
I suppose.

3509
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:46,560
I think it would be fun.

3510
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:47,560
Yeah.

3511
02:27:47,560 --> 02:27:48,560
It's interesting if nothing else.

3512
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:49,560
It always like, yeah.

3513
02:27:49,560 --> 02:27:56,560
It always weirds me out just to think of like, all the comedians are like sort of, like

3514
02:27:56,560 --> 02:28:01,560
they all know each other, like all the big, like Joe Rogan and Bill Burr and Dave Chappelle

3515
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:06,560
and Mark Maron and like, they all are like friends somehow because they've all like intersected

3516
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:07,560
in their careers at some point.

3517
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:09,560
It's just a weird thing to think.

3518
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:14,560
I like these like totally different people who are all like huge, like A-list comedians

3519
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:17,560
and show business guys are all fucking.

3520
02:28:17,560 --> 02:28:20,560
I kind of, I kind of covet that community of theirs.

3521
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:22,560
It's pretty fucking cool.

3522
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:25,560
And you know, I've thought a little bit about, I mean, I don't know.

3523
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:28,560
I've been thinking about like, okay, where does YouTube go eventually?

3524
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:30,060
You know, maybe it goes somewhere great.

3525
02:28:30,060 --> 02:28:31,060
Maybe YouTube is great forever.

3526
02:28:31,060 --> 02:28:33,060
The thought has crossed my mind.

3527
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:36,060
Maybe one day I could like literally be a comedian.

3528
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:40,560
I don't even know if that means like a stand-up comedian, but like, you know, something along

3529
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:41,560
those lines.

3530
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:45,560
I really love to do a stand-up night like you did, Jesse.

3531
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:46,560
Yeah.

3532
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:47,560
Just try it out.

3533
02:28:47,560 --> 02:28:48,560
Get out there.

3534
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:53,460
I happened to log on to Reddit the other day on the comedy and someone had posted in the

3535
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:57,060
comedy my bit on meeting women that I did.

3536
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:58,060
Dude, no way.

3537
02:28:58,060 --> 02:28:59,060
Yeah, that's dope.

3538
02:28:59,060 --> 02:29:00,060
I watched it again.

3539
02:29:00,060 --> 02:29:04,260
I watched it back for the first time in years and like I was like blown away because like

3540
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:08,060
I forgot that I did that and that it was so funny.

3541
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:12,560
Like I think back to it like, you know, people tell me it's funny, but like there's no way.

3542
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:15,060
Like I didn't have any planned material.

3543
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:19,560
I fucking, I made up the whole bit like sitting in the audience before I came on stage like

3544
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:24,060
ignoring everyone else's bit while I was like writing it in my head in my seat.

3545
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:27,560
Like Cody looked over at me and he's like, are you like, okay, are you sick?

3546
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:31,160
Cause I was like, I was like so in my own head like, like formulating what I was going

3547
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:32,560
to say for the next 10 minutes.

3548
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:35,860
So like I didn't, I never remember it.

3549
02:29:35,860 --> 02:29:39,300
I never like think of it as some like great thing that I'm proud of, but like I was watching

3550
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:44,360
it the other day cause someone had linked it on Reddit and I was like, yes, this is fucking

3551
02:29:44,360 --> 02:29:49,960
one of the best things I've ever done and I'm really proud of it and like I want so

3552
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:55,840
bad to do more of that and like I want to elevate myself beyond the, this muck of YouTube

3553
02:29:55,840 --> 02:30:02,360
because like it really seems like because of a lot of what gets popular on YouTube and

3554
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:07,480
people are wise to the fact that most big YouTubers are kind of talentless narcissists.

3555
02:30:07,480 --> 02:30:08,480
I mean, let's be honest.

3556
02:30:08,480 --> 02:30:11,560
I mean, you know, I know what you mean, but I mean, like you've got, you know, like your

3557
02:30:11,560 --> 02:30:14,760
Logan Paul's like it's always in the news and that's what people think of when they

3558
02:30:14,760 --> 02:30:16,240
think of a YouTuber.

3559
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:19,000
So like there's this like huge YouTuber stigma.

3560
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Like even if you're really talented and really funny and really good, if you're doing it

3561
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:26,520
on YouTube, people just think less of you.

3562
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:33,320
And like I think about that, um, that, uh, that guy, Jordan Peterson, who's like always

3563
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:37,080
in the news and like he's always, you know, on everyone's big podcasts, he's like a big

3564
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:38,440
deal now.

3565
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:46,520
And like, yeah, he's a, he, he, people take him seriously because he's a psychologist

3566
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:47,520
and he's like a doctor.

3567
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:51,640
He went to like a real school, but like, but he's also a YouTuber.

3568
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:57,040
So like it really makes you realize that you have to go do something in the real world

3569
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:01,960
in order to carry that clout over to YouTube because YouTube alone has no clout because

3570
02:31:01,960 --> 02:31:04,680
of the stuff that's risen to the surface on it.

3571
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:09,040
So people just like, you have to go out and be a real standup comedian or be a, or go

3572
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:14,280
to college to be a real doctor to be taken seriously as a, on YouTube at all.

3573
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:15,280
I know what you mean.

3574
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:17,280
There, there's definitely something to that.

3575
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:21,240
If you, if you, I mean, if YouTube's all you do, then what is there to you?

3576
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:29,280
And it sucks because like, like, it's hard when, cause like to think that in a lot of

3577
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:34,480
people's minds, you're just a YouTuber because YouTuber is YouTube is all you do.

3578
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:38,240
But like in my mind, I never think of myself as a YouTuber.

3579
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:42,480
I think of myself as like a songwriter and a rapper and a comedian and a director and

3580
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:46,160
a fucking this guy and this guy and like all these different things I do.

3581
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:49,520
And like, where the fuck else am I supposed to post that shit?

3582
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:55,000
Like I, I don't really have much opportunity to post my work anywhere but YouTube.

3583
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:58,440
So I have to live with this fucking YouTube stigma.

3584
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:05,480
Well, it's, it's like the part of the problem is not just that normal people who don't really

3585
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:09,760
look at YouTube, hear about what YouTube is in the news and they have a stigma is that

3586
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:17,400
YouTubers don't like care about quality in their own community necessarily.

3587
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:23,720
Like if you want to get a good, a big podcast, you bring on other YouTubers and other people

3588
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:28,280
who are big, not necessarily because you're a big fan of them, but because you need the

3589
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:29,280
views and you need to-

3590
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:34,240
Yeah, cause like the primary focus is not to like necessarily like, like a fucking direct

3591
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:37,320
like a Stanley Kubrick exaggerating example, but whatever.

3592
02:32:37,320 --> 02:32:40,600
Like his goals, make the best movie possible.

3593
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:46,160
The goal of like a YouTuber is play the algorithm is make them, the goal, yeah, the goal of

3594
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:47,160
YouTubers make the most.

3595
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:48,160
Yeah.

3596
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:49,160
And that's, that's a bad incentive.

3597
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:50,160
I don't like that.

3598
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:51,160
Yeah.

3599
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:57,440
If, if, if we were incentivized to like, to collaborate between like the best of the

3600
02:32:57,440 --> 02:33:05,800
best and like quality was like more at the forefront, then YouTubers would like at least

3601
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:11,520
within themselves have some sort of cloud and like as more people grow up with YouTube,

3602
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:16,960
understand that YouTubers are not inherently, you know, terrible and the stigma would eventually

3603
02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:17,960
fade away.

3604
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:22,480
And this goes to Tom's, to Tom's like proposed platform of like you can only post one video

3605
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:27,240
per month on that platform, which means it better be the best possible video it can be

3606
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:28,240
to, you know, get-

3607
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:33,480
There's a, there's a term that is like, that has risen in popularity that everyone uses

3608
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:38,120
now that drives me crazy and like makes me like a little bit frustrated every time I

3609
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:39,120
hear it.

3610
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:45,200
And it's sound cloud rapper because when people talk about like popular rappers or rappers

3611
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:50,480
who are, you know, coming up, they, they always say the term with so much derision, like it's

3612
02:33:50,480 --> 02:33:51,480
so much lower.

3613
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:56,160
Like, oh, one of these fucking sound cloud rappers, well, what the fuck else is a rapper

3614
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:58,920
supposed to do to fucking get his music out there?

3615
02:33:58,920 --> 02:33:59,920
Yeah.

3616
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:01,920
Where, where would you, where would you put your friends?

3617
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:06,680
Not everyone is going to have a fucking like a record company behind them or like a fucking

3618
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:09,200
P-Ditty, like promoting their shit.

3619
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:10,200
Like, yes.

3620
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:13,440
I mean, it's the same as, same as YouTube, same as YouTube.

3621
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:15,040
You know, how much of this is just kind of-

3622
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:19,120
You gotta post it somewhere and you're not, you can't just expect to have like a fucking,

3623
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:20,120
yeah, like a, like a-

3624
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:23,080
So like is every rapper now, so, you know.

3625
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:25,440
Thought of as a sound cloud rapper and thought of as less?

3626
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:30,600
I guess it's the same, I guess it's the same kind of stigma as like a self-published author,

3627
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:31,840
you know?

3628
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:34,360
And now the things are just so similar.

3629
02:34:34,360 --> 02:34:38,920
And we have so much control at like the low levels and we don't need like to be either

3630
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:44,680
literal the top, you know, top 10 musicians in the world to like get on a major label.

3631
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:49,240
Instead, you just publish and you know, probably can get more like, I suppose it's kind of

3632
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:54,240
a dream that there's like a middle class of artists that can survive, you know, not necessarily

3633
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:59,800
as literally the top, but that, because we have access to posting shit on YouTube and

3634
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:01,560
soundcloud and all that stuff.

3635
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:04,560
It's kind of created an atmosphere of more, you know-

3636
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:05,560
Everybody has-

3637
02:35:05,560 --> 02:35:06,560
That's juvenile.

3638
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:07,560
That's juvenile.

3639
02:35:07,560 --> 02:35:08,560
Amateur.

3640
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:12,080
It's not, it's, there's no more gatekeepers, you know, content just flows and people will

3641
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:16,920
find it and you can find your own little cult micro audience and subsist off that and I

3642
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:17,920
think that's a good thing.

3643
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:19,400
I think it's a great thing.

3644
02:35:19,400 --> 02:35:22,360
I guess I just, I get why because that exists.

3645
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:27,520
There's been an erosion of like the clout of like any given profession, because like,

3646
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:31,000
if you were like a musician, you're like, do you hear the new whoever?

3647
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,000
They're going to be like, who?

3648
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,480
And you're going to be like, oh, you know, they're like the new one who was fucking signed

3649
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:38,880
by, you know, P Diddy or whatever, fucking Motown or something, you're like, oh, shit,

3650
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:39,880
that's impressive.

3651
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:42,240
But you're like, no, it's this guy I'm listening to on soundcloud.

3652
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:45,480
They're like, oh, so that means nothing to me.

3653
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:47,080
That means, you know, whatever.

3654
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:50,920
I mean, it means more and I guess it means like culture, culturally, I think it means

3655
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:56,320
more, that means more and more and like record label is less and less meaningful as like,

3656
02:35:56,320 --> 02:36:03,560
you know, as the, as the, the, you know, the undoing, like the removal of like limiters

3657
02:36:03,560 --> 02:36:07,520
on like, I think it's all just like, creating your own cloud, right?

3658
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:11,480
Because like, I think, for example, Ben, like your work, right?

3659
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:14,880
Like you make comics, and that's fucking sick.

3660
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:17,920
And you have like physical books and stuff, people can buy them.

3661
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:23,440
But like the thing that, that like, I think works in your favor is that like, you go to

3662
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:28,920
thesaintcomics.com to read your comics, go to Trigomoitopastic, or I post them on Deviantart.

3663
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:34,400
You know, like that's like different mindsets, but like, you can, you can use social media

3664
02:36:34,400 --> 02:36:39,440
as like an advertising platform, essentially to like get the funnel people to like a platform

3665
02:36:39,440 --> 02:36:40,440
you control.

3666
02:36:40,440 --> 02:36:44,400
And like, once you do that, like the image is all your own, and like, it gives you an

3667
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:49,200
air of authority to be like, oh, they have a dot com, you know, like that's like their

3668
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:50,200
place.

3669
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:51,200
Yeah.

3670
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:58,520
You know, I happened to tune into Market How Do the other day, as you were talking about

3671
02:36:58,520 --> 02:37:03,880
this exact thing about about, yeah, owning your audience and using social media, not

3672
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:04,880
in itself.

3673
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:08,440
Because yeah, I don't, I don't want my main platform, like a lot of people's main platform

3674
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:12,120
for their art and stuff is like their Tumblr, and like, I don't want my main platform to

3675
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:13,120
be my Tumblr.

3676
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:15,760
I want to have my website that's got my shit on it.

3677
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:17,520
Will fewer people find it there?

3678
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:18,720
Yeah, sure.

3679
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:24,280
But like, you know, the people that are going to only look at it on Tumblr, they can see

3680
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:29,880
it on Tumblr, or I almost said Tinder, I almost said Tinder, but Twitter or whatever.

3681
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:33,840
And you know, but the people who want to follow the links and like go and find my actual, see

3682
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:38,080
my actual website where I do have full control over the experience and all that.

3683
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:42,320
And yeah, I do think it gives it an air of like, yeah, I own this, this is mine.

3684
02:37:42,320 --> 02:37:46,600
I made not only the content, but the platform you're viewing it on.

3685
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:48,920
It makes it feel more legitimate.

3686
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:56,160
Like I have in the past said, I have a comic friend who makes comics, you go to stcomics.com,

3687
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:57,960
and then they've gone and read it.

3688
02:37:57,960 --> 02:37:59,960
And it was like, yeah.

3689
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:00,960
It's pretty great.

3690
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:09,200
And the experience of going to a tailor-made like specific site is so much nicer than going

3691
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:14,280
to a social media platform where you may or may not have an account and it's like...

3692
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:18,160
Using someone's comic on Tumblr is like, it's annoying because you usually have to

3693
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:19,160
read it backwards.

3694
02:38:19,160 --> 02:38:23,280
You have to like add in like hyperlinks for the buttons and it never works very well

3695
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:25,440
and Tumblr just sucks.

3696
02:38:25,440 --> 02:38:29,000
This is something why I'm kind of interested like why I'm personally big on this like whole

3697
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:33,840
web 3.0 thing that me and Digi keep talking about because like, I want the pendulum to

3698
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:37,640
shift back towards people making their own websites because I think the internet's just

3699
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:41,360
more interesting that way because like everything's a new experience.

3700
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:42,720
Yeah.

3701
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:45,320
It was interesting because I was talking to Munchie about this and he didn't understand

3702
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:48,800
what web 3.0, like what we were talking about until I explained it to him, like there's

3703
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:50,640
no servers, it's all peer-to-peer.

3704
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:56,400
So like you just make an HTML file and instead of having to go to Bluehost and pay X100 dollars,

3705
02:38:56,400 --> 02:38:59,480
it just hosts on your own local system.

3706
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:03,800
So like that financial cost of having to host a website is gone.

3707
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:09,360
So then like it's still harder than social, but like you don't have to like pay a year

3708
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:12,320
up front of hosting space and keep paying every year.

3709
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:14,840
It's just like a torn and it just runs on your computer.

3710
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:19,920
I think that's super powerful and really interesting.

3711
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:23,720
You know, if I could bring up just one more fast, I was just thinking about this.

3712
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:28,240
I'm thinking about the experience of being a YouTuber to kind of go back to that side

3713
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:29,480
of things.

3714
02:39:29,480 --> 02:39:33,640
And I've been thinking about this for a while and it's that so maybe I've been a little

3715
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:38,400
bit charmed by listening to so much Joe Rogan, he has a lot of comedians and they like talk

3716
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:44,160
about their experiences and it sounds really nice because as a YouTuber, even working towards

3717
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:47,560
being more of a YouTuber and putting more videos out, it's real.

3718
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:53,000
I don't mean to be disrespectful to anybody, but I do actually kind of feel like a whore

3719
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,120
in some ways.

3720
02:39:55,120 --> 02:40:01,760
Yeah, to a degree because like here I am, I'm selling like my inner self to a degree,

3721
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:02,760
you know.

3722
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:07,360
And like when I think about like podcasts are definitely there's an element of that

3723
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:08,520
there for sure.

3724
02:40:08,520 --> 02:40:15,600
Like we Agua again, there's an element of that there and I compare that to like a practiced

3725
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:18,320
routine of a stand up comic.

3726
02:40:18,320 --> 02:40:20,800
Like yes, you're going there, you're like doing your thing.

3727
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:24,880
But what you're actually selling is like it's a product.

3728
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:29,800
It's not literally like your soul being like removed from it's something that you've prepared

3729
02:40:29,800 --> 02:40:34,560
to distribute as opposed to like being like a daily vlogger and like to turn your whole

3730
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:35,560
life into that.

3731
02:40:36,200 --> 02:40:43,400
I want a big, thick old wall between me and like the people who I, you know, sell content

3732
02:40:43,400 --> 02:40:49,040
to essentially and because I'm I really don't want to have that kind of barrier be like

3733
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:50,040
thin.

3734
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:55,400
I like having my my life, my private shit going on and it does make me a little uncomfortable

3735
02:40:55,400 --> 02:41:02,120
sometimes exposing a lot of my inner self sucks that you really can't have that wall

3736
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:03,120
as much as you want.

3737
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:07,880
You have to have a Patreon and in order to sell the Patreon, you have to have a Discord

3738
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:11,480
server and in order to how different are we from like, I don't know, like Instagram

3739
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:14,680
thoughts or whatever, who are selling their like private Snapchats.

3740
02:41:14,680 --> 02:41:18,000
Like in their case, they're selling like literal pictures of their bodies.

3741
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:21,720
At least they're not selling their like inner thoughts, you know, they get to keep that

3742
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:22,720
shit private.

3743
02:41:22,720 --> 02:41:25,880
And I I'm just saying that's a different sort of feeling, but there's probably something

3744
02:41:25,880 --> 02:41:26,880
enjoyable about that.

3745
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:29,640
Now I'm not trying to like exaggerate and be like, oh my God, what was me?

3746
02:41:29,640 --> 02:41:30,640
This is so terrible.

3747
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:35,120
It's just it's just a vague sense that I've been having and I don't know.

3748
02:41:35,120 --> 02:41:37,200
Let me know what you think of the comments down below.

3749
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:43,600
Please like comment and subscribe, ring that bell and sub for so and sub for so but I'm

3750
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:44,800
not only use up.

3751
02:41:44,800 --> 02:41:48,160
I'm gonna let's sub for so but like the part where only you subscribe.

3752
02:41:48,160 --> 02:41:49,160
Let's do that.

3753
02:41:49,160 --> 02:41:50,160
That sounds right.

3754
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:51,160
That's right.

3755
02:41:51,160 --> 02:41:52,160
That's right.

3756
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:53,160
That's the way to do it.

3757
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:56,960
That's the way to sub for so we got one more question real quick.

3758
02:41:56,960 --> 02:42:00,600
We are we are we are going in towards our last question.

3759
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:03,720
Here and and we will wrap it up.

3760
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:06,160
So this is from bad rap.

3761
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:07,160
Joe.

3762
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:10,160
Give it to us.

3763
02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:11,160
Soundcraft hero.

3764
02:42:11,160 --> 02:42:12,160
Here you go.

3765
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:17,000
Hey, yo, it's me, the biggest piece of shit you ever did see open your mouth and let me

3766
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:18,000
take a pee.

3767
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Don't work by the charge.

3768
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:20,000
It's full free.

3769
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,600
I like to stick my fingers on my ass just for fun.

3770
02:42:22,600 --> 02:42:23,600
So you better run.

3771
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:28,160
I'm about to paint balls with my cum push my prostate with my thumb.

3772
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:29,160
Boom.

3773
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:30,160
Wow.

3774
02:42:30,160 --> 02:42:31,160
I'm the king.

3775
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:32,160
Fuck with me.

3776
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:33,160
And I'll knock out the ringing.

3777
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:34,160
I don't play fair.

3778
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:37,160
Kick your nuts and pull out your hair shut on your chest without care.

3779
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:38,160
More like a bear.

3780
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:39,160
So you better be aware.

3781
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:40,160
I swear to be worse.

3782
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:43,960
The wear and I take it down to my layer and tear off the skin and begin to touch myself.

3783
02:42:43,960 --> 02:42:44,960
Rip off your fingers.

3784
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:45,960
Put them on my shelf.

3785
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:46,960
That's it.

3786
02:42:46,960 --> 02:42:47,960
Yeah.

3787
02:42:47,960 --> 02:42:51,760
I'm I'm really like the Donkey Kong review.

3788
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:52,760
Okay.

3789
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:53,760
So far.

3790
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:54,760
Yeah.

3791
02:42:54,760 --> 02:42:56,760
The new rap is on point.

3792
02:42:57,760 --> 02:43:02,760
That was a great follow up to that whole discussion we just had.

3793
02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:03,760
Yeah.

3794
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:04,760
It was.

3795
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:06,760
This guy.

3796
02:43:06,760 --> 02:43:07,760
This guy is selling his innermost stuff.

3797
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:08,760
He really is.

3798
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:10,760
That was a wonderful bad rap, Joe.

3799
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:12,760
What a what a note to end the podcast.

3800
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:14,760
I think there's no need for comment.

3801
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:15,760
Let's just end it right there.

3802
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:20,760
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for joining us this week on the Procrastinators podcast.

3803
02:43:20,760 --> 02:43:25,760
Head on over to patreon.com slash the procrastinators where there will be a new episode.

3804
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:28,760
I think tomorrow for when this episode is posted.

3805
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:31,760
So the bonus episode.

3806
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:32,760
That's right.

3807
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:39,760
I worked all night making the bonus episode look great and I am still I have much more

3808
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:40,760
to do.

3809
02:43:40,760 --> 02:43:42,760
It is going to be it is going to look be so sick.

3810
02:43:42,760 --> 02:43:43,760
Damn.

3811
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:44,760
I'm fucking excited now.

3812
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:45,760
So Ben's editing.

3813
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:46,760
It's going to have good art.

3814
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:48,760
It's a whole big thing that we did.

3815
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:49,760
Get ready for it, people.

3816
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:52,760
It's a whole big production that we did.

3817
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:56,760
It's not it's not ASMR episode or you know.

3818
02:43:56,760 --> 02:44:01,760
This is this is instead of this is the opposite of the usual the usual thing that the bonus

3819
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:02,760
episode is.

3820
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:04,760
Let's see how we can ruin this episode on purpose.

3821
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:07,760
This time we actually said what if we tried making it good.

3822
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:10,760
Basically, so if you want to experience that novel.

3823
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:12,760
So we're trying something new.

3824
02:44:12,760 --> 02:44:13,760
Get in there.

3825
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:16,760
Quality quality at TP procrastinators on Twitter.

3826
02:44:16,760 --> 02:44:21,760
Oh, and you got to give $5 for the bonus episodes on the patron fyi and $1 for the for the for

3827
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:22,760

Oh, it's fine.

3829
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:25,760
Give us money, please.

3830
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:26,760

Enjoy.

If you're a good boy.

3848
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:48,760
Hello, and goodbye.

3849
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:49,760
And goodbye.

Bye.

3853

Thanks for listening.
