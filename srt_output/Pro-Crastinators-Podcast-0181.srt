00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,780
the best guy ever and today we are joined by the likes of Digibro- oh wait no I'm not

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,800
him Bob. I was about to turn the podcast off but now it's okay. We can keep with him. Saved

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,840
in the nick of time. We've got Ben Saint, there he is. Yeah, hey what was that really funny

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,560
joke I made before the show started and I said hey I'm gonna say that on the show. Don't

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:39,440
tell anyone that I said it before. Anyone remember? No. It was a punchline of a joke

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,480
I think so. It was something about on my podcast what are you doing in my podcast. Oh yeah

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:53,800
with the steamed hams. Oh oh oh yes yes okay introduce someone else. Gibbontake is here.

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,320
Hello. Gibbontake in this part of this part at this time of day in this part of the country

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:11,440
located entirely within our podcast. You did it. Yes. What's the joke? You know steamed

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,560
hams. Steamed hams reference. It's just a reference the lowest form of comedy. No no

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,680
it subverts the original. Ben you have to say may I see him. You have to say may I see

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:31,800
him. Oh may I see him. No. Then I disconnect from the call and I leave. Someone else had

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,200
to say may I see him. You may have noticed mage is there. Hey I am here I am excited

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,640
I want to talk about anime, yes and other things. Oh that's a big oof from the audience.

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,920
You can leave, you can all leave. And of course Tom Oliver is here. MLP died yesterday and

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm not emotionally bothered by it. Was it the finale? It was the finale, it was yesterday.

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,280
But it continues in the comics as I understand. The journey never ends. Yeah whatever. Did the

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,400
thing I watched be like a leaked finale then? Yeah that was leaked a while ago. I watched

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,600
the finale a while ago and I thought it was stupid but whatever. Stupid. You know I don't know

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,000
anything about these new characters but I do want to watch the final episode because I have a

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,640
feeling I will enjoy it. I'll get some chills. I got a thought on the finale of MLP and it's

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:34,400
I think I may have said this somewhere else but the finale of MLP it sort of goes against the

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,440
whole message of the show at the final moment when you think it wouldn't because you know they've

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,520
been like redeeming villains and that's been cool. In the last season three of the previously

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,960
defeated villains Chrysalis, King Sombra and Cozy Glow from season seven. Who the fuck is Cozy

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:02,040
Glow? She's a little Philly Pegasus. She's a Philly Pegasus pony who tries to take over the

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,840
school and thus the world. With her toxic femininity. Wait what? The school? Is this from

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,880
Equestria Girls? No they're the school. They make a school of friendship in season seven and she's

30
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,520
the villain of that. Anyway they come back right? Season eight they come back. They're gathered

31
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,800
together and they have to work together. There's a number of episodes where they work together,

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,680
learn to you know care about each other a little bit just so that they can get further in their

33
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,640
goal to destroy the main six and kill Twilight. And you think what's happening is that they're

34
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,200
gonna go they become super powerful. The season ender Tupada is like ridiculously over the top

35
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,080
way like super big you know Dragon Ball Z but like even more. Okay. Was it like like the

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,840
Tyric fight? Yeah Tyric but like a million times. Too damn. Imagine it's an army of Tyric showdown.

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,520
Like if you if you're into that it is very cool but yeah it was alright but like it's it's all

38
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,960
this stuff it's leading up you know these villains are learning the power of friendship to combat

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,960
the Princess of Friendship. Yeah it's a real force. You would think that by the end having learned

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,480
friendship they'd realize they'd have some sort of redemption moment where it's like oh right

41
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,080
right being a friendship is good and friendships and maybe I could be friends with more than

42
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,280
just the obvious place to go. Yeah instead they just kill them and they turn them into stone.

43
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,920
Princess Twilight and all her friends all of the friends she's made on her part of the season

44
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:44,720
come together and they do a gigantic beam blast like like exactly how they go to Discord except

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,240
Discord participates in this one and they Celestia Luna all the Alicorns all the ponies all the

46
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,520
characters every single person in the world like Lenby our energy this is the Goku moment this is

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,880
the you know the spirit bomb she just turns them to stone that's it no redemption kill them is the

48
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,040
end and that's the end of the show. If there's any kind of people that can't be redeemed there's of

49
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:16,840
course you know literally Hitler, Sombra and those goddamn turfs Chrysalis and Cosy Glow like a child

50
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,960
yeah this is why it's so strange. Straight off murder she's just she'll be back in the future when

51
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,680
they've got a way to fucking you know fix your mind yeah sure it feels like it feels like it's

52
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,720
leaving it open for them to be back but it's just sort of like I mean Sombra comes back at the

53
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,800
beginning but he immediately enough in the two putter in the beginning he decides to not work

54
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,760
with the others he goes out on his own and he gets not like blown apart like last time but like

55
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,240
literally disintegrated you see a skull in the like a few frames whoa wait wait wait you're

56
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,320
saying in the final episode in the in the in the in the opening episode of season 8 Sombra

57
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,760
comes back with all the four villains but he says no I don't care season 9 whatever he comes back

58
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,880
and he's like I don't need friendship to defeat the main six and he goes to do that and that's like

59
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:15,160
the the villain of of the opening and he gets completely killed disintegrated you see a skull

60
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:22,200
it's really kind of oh you see a skull jeez it's great as his skin gets ripped up in the blinding

61
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,960
flash of light and it's like wow they did that um so it's like it's it's set the president at the

62
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:35,240
end of brunswick yeah indeed indeed so like it says the president for the villains not being redeemed

63
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,920
but it seems like chrysalis terek and cozy glow they have like funny moments you see more of their

64
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,680
character they're not totally evil they have a song in this season together that they sing and

65
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,760
there's like why do they get blown to well turn to stone so maybe the real maybe the real world

66
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,000
conquest with the friends we made along the way oh wait no they're all turned to stone

67
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,600
you're saying that it's at the beginning of season nine somber doesn't join them and these

68
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,800
over the course of season nine these terek cozy glow and chrysalis they do their little friendship

69
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,960
thing and at the end of season nine they in fact are turned to stone not redeemed and that's the

70
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,440
last place we leave that's it okay gotcha gotcha that's not the finality of season nine though season

71
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,200
nine is just like this like flash forward right yeah at the end of the episode that well here's one

72
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,640
more episode after the two part which is right twilight's old and she's an alicorn and then we

73
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,080
see the rest of the main six come in who are they're all wrinkly and old and they're visibly

74
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,840
they're not they're not like they're not like granny smith they're not granny smith they're

75
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,880
sort of like they're getting up there though they're like they're like uh they're like milfs

76
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,480
they're like milfs in this stage uh applejack wearing granny smith's like fucking scarf

77
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:56,040
thingy because granny smith is dead fucking dead shit yeah yeah i caught that so yeah and dragon

78
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,040
spike spike looks like the the buff spike that he imagined himself being way back in a dog and

79
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,480
pony show circle of life so it's like spike's gonna live for a thousand years twilight's gonna

80
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,320
live for thousands of years everyone's gonna fucking and everyone else is gonna die and but

81
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,920
you know that's i i i mean i like i like that they went with that instead of like trying to not do

82
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:23,320
that because i i like when they do endings like this famously the final episode of star trek the

83
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,120
next generation is a two-parter i forget what it's called till we meet again i can't remember um but

84
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,600
it is it is the same kind of flash forward it's actually like it's like a time travel-esque kind

85
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,160
of episode oh my god it's like the best episode two part it ties into the very first episode it

86
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,320
ties into the whole series and the finale oh my god it's so fucking sick friends or my thing of a

87
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,960
different episode i you know i gotta fucking i gotta get the name right but the point is it's it's

88
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,280
it's a great way to end your series right he's like tabs in front they say that i know i don't

89
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,280
think so i think i'm thinking of a different episode isn't that isn't that a reference to doesn't

90
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,080
spock do you like this don't they do the same thing they do that in in the original and it's a

91
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,400
reference they do they do yeah that's okay that's when that's after spock dies kirk does two absent

92
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,480
friends yes yes that that's what that is this is um by the way the episode's all good things it's

93
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,160
all good things dot dot dot and it's uh it's okay i just want to say yeah for the record all good

94
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,440
things dot dot dot come to those who wait uh something like that but listen to this though

95
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,720
they i just this episode is so brilliant okay for example i'm gonna spoil it a little bit

96
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,800
in the episode and things could change it like with the it's a time travel kind of episode a

97
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,480
little bit they have to mix up some timelines and match them up whatever it doesn't matter

98
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,000
fix the time space continue them it was a big deal um in that episode we see that in the future

99
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,840
like picard's back on his vineyard in france um he if you don't know everybody uh star trek

100
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,240
has picard who is has a british accent but canonically he is from france because canonically

101
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,120
france was conquered by england so despite the fact that he is in fact yeah it was about time i'd say

102
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,760
so he is french but you know british too or whatever okay point is we see the flash forward

103
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,600
spock has left starfleet has become like a professor has like sorry i said spock i meant data data best

104
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,160
character of all time data is the greatest character ever conceived by man uh he got some

105
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,600
emotions he got his chip going he's he's grown in so many different ways he's left starfleet to pursue

106
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,280
his new passions because despite what you may think he wasn't programmed to be a starfleet

107
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,160
officer he's an autonomous free being who chose to join starfleet of his own free will because

108
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,440
that's what he is um and in that we see him like as this he's a professor at oxford i believe

109
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,320
and he's doing great he's older but that gets hard retcon in star trek nemesis where data just

110
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,440
fucking dies in the fucking piece of shit movies and it's just blown to fucking smithereens in the

111
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,440
last didn't you like rant this exact rant like like i know i know that's all i have to say about

112
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,040
it it's just the most retarded i'm just saying like the show is perfect very recently the show

113
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,520
ended perfectly so i don't want to what my point is i don't want these cowardly mlp fucks to go back

114
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,560
and start changing continuity oh like different things happen after the end before the flash forward

115
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,880
i mean they're going to i'm sure it was perfect comics they're already doing it it's gonna well

116
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,360
maybe those are before the end of the last episode i don't know whatever it's okay anyway it's

117
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,160
i like star trek that's what i have to say and i like anime and i want to talk about anime okay

118
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:31,080
go for anime do you want to talk about a lot a lot of several enemies have you have you have you

119
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,800
been guys like looking at the most recent uh new anime seasons a season i don't know i'm sure i'm the

120
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,600
only one who's even potentially doing that but i actually did look a little bit but not much

121
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,720
okay oh which ones have you seen no like none i think i watched like the new

122
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,600
season of uh of demon slayer is like the only one though i am looking for new ones i'm checking

123
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,280
them out okay it's just because i'm so excited about this like season because we i i don't know why

124
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,960
it just feels like it has better better like a lot better shows than last season did or at least i

125
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,240
the ones that i prefer and uh one one one of them is uh we called

126
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,480
and that's the one that has me in it just to remind you right oh i love that screenshot yeah

127
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,440
yeah i just i love this anime like um the first episode i laughed so hard just i was unable to

128
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,160
like communicate to bite her with words so i just started making noises through laughter

129
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,160
he said like what are you saying and i said i can't i can't even words

130
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,440
because it was so fun and then then second episode i just i just laughed till i cried and i don't

131
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,040
remember the last time an anime made me cry laugh i can just imagine you sitting there just sitting

132
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,880
in your own filth just going literally me literally me pointing at the screen maids no that that

133
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,920
no no that character is just a background character she barely spoke i don't know well

134
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,480
that's good it means you can imagine we can project that it really is i don't know like the

135
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,960
fact that i'm in it isn't consequential it's just like the rest of the anime is really good what

136
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,800
what sort of uh comedy is it is it like your typical anime uh bullshit comedy or is it actually

137
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,440
funny of course it is okay yeah it's a little hard to say um it's it's a little bit like

138
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,640
i can't i can't even say how do you describe anime comedy it defies words that's why they

139
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,240
invented a visual auditory medium to express these feelings with known as anime i mean you

140
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,320
could talk about like a specific joke i don't know because it won't be funny when i say it just

141
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,320
just one you gotta give the people a taste so they'll go watch the show they're like more like this

142
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:55,480
please no no you can't explain jokes no you can't explain you can analyze and explain jokes

143
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,960
you have to be as serious as possible no the only joke on my mind is like the most recent one and

144
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,120
it's like super funny and i don't want to spoil it because it's hilarious and that's the one that made

145
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:11,240
me cry it makes you cry okay with laughter i assume with joy okay all right i think it'll make me

146
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,040
cry okay but the premise is the premise is it's a very sad premise and it reminds me of another

147
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,040
anime that i never watched it's like okay so there's this boy and he's such a pushover and his parents

148
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,480
just sort of like use him make him work while they they're absolutely dead beats until they

149
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:34,280
eventually sell his soul to a demon just for some money okay so the poor poor boy sounds like typical

150
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,720
capitalism at right boys that's what yeah so the poor boy is busy like on a fishing boat in the middle

151
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,280
of like a storm or something like that and he's being like crushed by giant fish because of the

152
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,040
storm and like he suddenly whisked away into the demon world and the demon is like hi your parents

153
00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:00,680
sold your soul to me so be my grandson and he wants to say no for once in his life he wants to say no

154
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,640
but then the demon cries and he begs and is like please i don't i don't have children i always wanted

155
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,800
to have grandchildren please my be my grandson and so he agrees reluctantly and he said oh good

156
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,640
i knew you were a good kid if if if if you had declined i would have had to eat you so yeah so

157
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:23,240
he's now a yeah now he's now a grand kid of to this demon he has to go to demon school where

158
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,160
everyone chants about how much they like eating humans and suck them dry and and heal them and

159
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,800
stuff and and yeah he's a human and he has to endure he has to be uh he has to go to the school

160
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,640
and be there and pretend he's a demon and the funny thing is it's like he accidentally becomes an

161
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:48,040
absolute badass that runs the school in a way without meaning to it's just it's just great it's

162
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,520
like it's sort of like absurd comedy in a way but like it makes sense in a way like it escalates into

163
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,600
things but it doesn't it doesn't go past a certain point where it becomes too ridiculous to be

164
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:08,440
unbelievable for the setting all right is it is it just sort of like uh the demons are uh they they

165
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,040
because they're like a different race the the the logic they have can be anything so it's just whatever

166
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:21,960
is really funny uh i mean they have their own logic uh that they follow they follow their own uh

167
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:29,080
the the the universal logic so it's not like low random i don't it's not it's not nature joe i would

168
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,040
say i i'd never like nature joe i know people like nature joe but it's not i'm surprised yeah i'm a

169
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:41,000
fan i if there's something i could compare it to for some reason like kaguya love is war it comes

170
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,160
to mind if anyone saw yeah okay yeah i i really love the comedy there and just like how it's a

171
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,920
that's kind of serious comedy for the for the baku man readers out there it's just like it's

172
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,920
it's such a simple premise and the comedy is just like how absurdly convoluted things yet

173
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,520
between them even though it's such just a simple matter in a way and it's something i don't know

174
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,240
why but it just like reminiscent to me of that and and i just did you ever did you ever play

175
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,920
diskaya i think it's it's either three or four which is about like a um ma i think it's a diskaya

176
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,160
i that's exactly right i think it's diskaya four where you play is no it's number three

177
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,760
fuck okay where you play as mau who is an honor student at like demon academy uh which means

178
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,360
that he has been truant every single day because in demon world you're a delinquent if you show up

179
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:39,160
to class so the number one what a twist what a twist so like the uh it's you you're mau you're

180
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,600
like an ace student so you never go to class or do your homework and uh like you're you're like

181
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,080
little friend you're like childhood friend girl is is a delinquent so she goes to school every day

182
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,840
and aces every test and is really committed to the bit and it's it's pathetic it's embarrassing

183
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,960
but you guys ever read helk i don't think so helk is a manga it starts off really strong it's about

184
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,040
like the demon world is holding a tournament to determine who will be the new demon king

185
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:15,320
and the demons hate humans but this dark horse candidate appears in the demon tournament competing

186
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,880
to be king and he is a human but all the demons love him and it's like what what's the deal and

187
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,840
like between rounds like and this human just like crushes all these demons at like every contest like

188
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,960
he's like damn he's really showing out he's really impressed and like between rounds like this

189
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,440
the demon reporter goes up he's like uh mr helk was it uh why are you why are you here in the demon

190
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,520
world competing like what's what's your story and he's just like looks at the crowd he's like

191
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:51,000
humans suck and everyone in the crowd's like yeah we love helk why does he hate humans uh he's got a

192
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,800
whole fucking backstory he's from like a kingdom that turned evil basically and he's like okay he's

193
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:03,080
like an exile for it it kind of gets worse as it goes on because he and like he and like the demon

194
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,480
like uh this like demon um accountant who works for the kingdom get like they get like teleported

195
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,800
somewhere and they have to like make their way back to the demon world to is this the guy turns

196
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,720
into like an episodic little like buddy comedy like uh you know travel uh fantasy kind of i don't

197
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,800
so it is this him is this human man the guy uh sorry let me let me look at what you're

198
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,880
with what you're doing yeah it's in the discord looks like an abby both gross discussing in the

199
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,800
normal pcp one yeah that looks like an absolute unit okay yeah that's helk that's helk uh it's pretty

200
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
it's pretty funny although i i quit reading it after a while because i was like yeah i think i

201
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:48,040
i get it you get the chan test what's another anime okay that you're loving oris key uh it has a

202
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,720
big all ass name uh but it translates to are you the one who loves me and initially initially it is

203
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,600
not gonna lie it had me in the first half i thought it was gonna be like a harem or love triangle or

204
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:08,120
something uh you know just your basic bitch anime uh but uh but oh it's so good it has it's it's

205
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,320
quite interesting i i also don't want to spoil the premise but like okay so it starts like this this

206
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:20,680
guy right he uh he's just a normal everyday school school guy he has a best friend named son

207
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,160
kunwal that's his nickname anywho so he has a childhood best friend and she's really cute and

208
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,120
happy and ganky and and there's even a panty shot it's just got annoyed by and then like this is

209
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:37,000
school school school school president that's also really pretty and and and she's cute and stuff and

210
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:46,440
he's like he he and it it and it looks like it looks like both of the girls have a crush on him

211
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,240
and um the he sort of sets up a date with each of them one day with one the other day with the other

212
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,320
and but it turns out that both of them have a crush on his best friend and they want his help with it

213
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,360
and it's and it's just like and there's a girl that likes him but he hates her

214
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,640
and it's just and it gets complicated sounds like a wacky situation but like the comedy there

215
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,000
comedy there is insane because like initially i i i didn't know what i was expecting but god

216
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,320
i was so surprised it was just he gets traumatized by a bench and out of context that sounds really

217
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,680
silly but it makes sense but even with with context it's also really silly and it's hilarious

218
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,480
it's even more hilarious with context because you know why that bench traumatizes him and i

219
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,680
wonder if they're gonna keep the bench coming back every episode will the bench be a recurring

220
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,360
character yeah exactly it's in the opening it's in the opening the bench is in the open yeah i

221
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,280
like that all right it's great i love it it's it's it's definitely a comedy i would recommend

222
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,560
because not only is it like top-notch comedy it's also like it has like it ends in such a

223
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,600
suspenseful cliffhanger on the first episode and and then like the second episode also ends in a

224
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,400
cliffhanger and just like oh shit what's gonna happen next and it's just like i'm so intrigued

225
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,480
because there's like one of the characters is weaving a web of lies and deceit and it's just it's

226
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,440
i want to see how it plays out because everyone is playing into it like puppets on strings and it's

227
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,680
just oh boy it's so good i didn't expect it to be so good also the art is really nice as well

228
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,080
the way they draw the lips for the girls is is quite interesting it's a bit different it's a bit

229
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,920
more detailed what's it called uh oresuki it is in short but also i can't spell this

230
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:43,000
fuck bullshit okay are you the one who loves me that that one i want to see these so-called lips

231
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,720
as do i you really should have procured an image for us mage it was very unfortunate i'll google it

232
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,360
and find you well mage hey here go ahead and do that or or a suki or a suki

233
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,080
any fucking day now oh i see i see what you mean oh they got little they got little baby lips

234
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,360
for the love of god link it ben plush plush little okay well this is not a high particularly

235
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,960
high res it's fine

236
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,760
i love talking about visuals on an audio podcast

237
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,480
we can just describe we can just just like describe the pixel by pixel by pixel like

238
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,120
say that it's just like out loud oh that's good that's good there's enough there's a bonus episode

239
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,960
idea just we just talk about images the whole time and we don't link any of the images at the end

240
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,720
oh that's a good idea no it's a good idea here's a better bonus episode idea um we show images on

241
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,480
an audio show but we don't say anything oh good call good call it's even less work i mean more

242
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:58,920
avant-garde oh hey why don't we why don't we put in like two thousands like music just to go

243
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,280
like uh like a link in park am v this like with like the transition of like the spinning images to

244
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,080
transition between the still and we just get like like for whatever topic we talk about we just have

245
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,640
an image on screen but like no audio and then it changes to a different image and people have to

246
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,280
guess what we were talking about this episode of the procrastiners podcast is brought to you by

247
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:26,280

00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:37,720
web of lies this was not an intentional lie i'm i'm so glad that munchie isn't here munchie would uh

250
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,240

251
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,440
something it's probably gonna learning to do god it's sunday it's the lord's day not in my america

252
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,960
well so so here's the here's the cinch everybody so we had to take sesho to get his uh it was like

255
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:16,280
to know what he's supposed to be like oh i saw a dog whoa no way um the other the other the other

256
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,640
day there was a hole into your conversation that's no go on go on there was a dog here uh uh some

257
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,440
some people were over one of them brought one of not their dog but like a friend of a friend's dog

258
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,880
and this dog oh what's his name

259
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:37,160
his name was buttons and he was a pug doxon do i say doxon right or is it dash dash

260
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,160

262
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,400
and he i don't not look much of an animal lover but boy this was a cute dog this was a well-behaved

263
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,640
dog he's quiet he just like flopped over on his belly whenever you went and go pet him

264
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,800
he couldn't go he could only go upstairs but not down them uh it was pretty cool pretty cool

265
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,960
dog sorry just over the course of his life he just keeps getting higher and higher

266
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,360
that's really an aspirational way of living i only go up i never yeah i respect that he's

267
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,600
literally incapable okay oh it's like that time in one piece where uh zoro was fighting me hawk

268
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,400
and me hawk was like why do you not step back zoro and zoro said i feel like if i step backward

269
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,760
i'll lose everything so me hawk he didn't step back yeah that's that's that's buttons that's one

270
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:44,040
piece um that's my that's my uh catchphrase okay so here's the deal i took my dog to the vet sesho

271
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,160
lord sechomaru please address him by his full name and they said so he got his shots he was fine

272
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,440
he was a good brave little soldier but then at the end they were like okay so when you first

273
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,120
got sesho all right he weighed about 17 pounds he may have been a little bit underweight he may

274
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,720
have been a little bit underweight at that time well they they looked into it and they were like

275
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,680
um sesho's probably a little bit heavier than uh he should be and i've been we've been lowering his

276
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,320
who could have seen this coming it this is no one could have possibly not no it's not true

277
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:27,960
and damn that's one rubenesque dog in short in short sesho went from 17 pounds to 27 pounds

278
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,280
i was gonna i was gonna say do we want to guess do we want to like okay well i guess i was gonna

279
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:39,400
guess like 30 but no okay he was he's 20 in this very picture here snoozing his life away

280
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:46,040
it's in the gross links chat or whatever he's 27 pounds apparently that fat second shit you

281
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:52,280
gotta hit the gym sesho you gotta hit that's a potato and uh in short he needs to lose probably

282
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:58,440
about like five pounds i mean imagine you weigh let's say like 180 pounds that's you know approximately

283
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:05,160
average for a male and then you go to 280 pounds like that's approximately the the the change of

284
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:12,680
look what you've done yeah so i sesho i apologize uh i didn't realize if only someone someone

285
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,120
close to you could have given you warnings weeks or months ago i just didn't trust you guys i just

286
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:24,760
don't trust your judgment on any of this i have a dog and he's extremely healthy if only if only

287
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:32,120
someone could have told him so on his special day you might say with the greatest gift of

288
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,400
honesty yeah there you go there you go it's like that calvin and hobbes strip where he's just

289
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,280
sitting at the booth and he's selling for five cents and it's like a lemonade stand but instead of

290
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:51,480
that it's a frank appraisal of your looks ooh that's a good one oh what a fucking best

291
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,920
mediocre at best that's uh that's a what do you do when you take him for walks do you like throw a

292
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:03,160
ball does he run around no we pretty well the the longest walks we do we just take like a longer

293
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,760
walk that's maybe like a 15 to 20 minute just you know walk we just walk no really he's got he's

294
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,400
got to get sprinting he's got to get chasing something he does race around inside some but

295
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,080
i mean obviously that's going to be a limited he'll he'll just he'll do the neumes where he just

296
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,600
runs up and down the hallway for no reason uh don't know why he's doing it but getting one of those

297
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:28,040
exercise machines like where were you we can get like a uh get like a tennis ball that squeaks or

298
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,360
something that he'll like yeah we got we got things of this nature all right well we well

308
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,120
was just um we went to a pumpkin patch yesterday and we were walking around saw those images oh

309
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,920
this is a good michelle's post and some of those this is a good segue for my next topic okay well

310
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,680
good this will be brief uh you know uh here there are michelle posted some on her twitter uh let me

311
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,280
let me see if i can get them while i'm saying this it was just the funny thing about it was

312
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,080
me and michelle uh we took sessho to walk around we we thought it was the same one we'd been to

313
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:55,160
four turns out it was different didn't really matter it was a good time and um uh dogs actually

314
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,720
were not allowed in but like no one said anything so we just got in anyway so i mean that was convenient

315
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,640
and good uh so we were in we were walking around doing stuff and um we noticed that like okay so

316
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,520
i'm it's it's it's one of these things where i'm noticing that i'm at the point in life where people

317
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,880
approximately my age maybe a little bit older are there like with their children

318
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,680
and it's me and michelle there with our dog and like this you say that like it's you say that

319
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:27,240
like it's weird that's not weird it's not super weird but like i am noticing this difference uh

320
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,080
you know between me and these other people no i feel you i have a cat i have a senior

321

326
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,760
and we were just giving him a little bit too much food you're reducing his rations we are

327
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,280
that's correct that's correct and look at that that last pic he's just all head

throwing the ball thing and off he goes i'm watching it i'm here in this room

341

342
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,840
device yeah for like maximum distance for greater ball leverage he's very fast so you need that to

343
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,240
throw it far enough he's so cute look at me so happy ego oh what's the proximity of this dog park or

344
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:53,480
just normal park to your house i'm just curious it's like a i don't know like five sort of minute

345
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,360
walk from my house not that far that's like five five to ten don't duck yourself yeah he went into

346
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,240
the river because he likes to like like cool off every so often just toss that ball into the river

347
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,360
and get him get him going downstream he used to he used to like not bring the ball back but it was

348
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,680
like it's funny because like you know we had him since he was a tiny puppy and we've been training

349
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,640
him to like like obey orders bring the ball back or we won't be able to throw it for you you idiot

350
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:24,440
and he eventually learned how he learns to bring it back he's um oh he's a little bit more than one

351
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:31,080
year old oh okay so he's a new dog how nice yeah he's even younger than sesha right yeah yeah yeah

361
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:29,080
how halloween is the worst holiday what no there's plenty worse but i was loving the vibe i mean

362
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,960
the vibe yesterday at the pumpkin patch was great we had we had hot a apple cider

363
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,880
when we walked around in the cool air it felt great so you're gonna be i'm a hard sell on

364
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:44,600
this i don't mind the fall aesthetic i like think i like cider the colors are fine uh you know i

365
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:50,920
don't mind that it's getting cold um i don't still nice i don't um i was gonna say something oh like

366
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,400
i'm not a snob about like pumpkin spice lattes or whatever like that's fine pumpkin spice tastes

367
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,000
good um i just don't like halloween i don't i don't like it there are there are less consequential

368
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:08,040
holidays like there's um i don't know uh uh uh veterans day i don't celebrate veterans day like

369
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:14,280
who cares like whatever okay um hates the troops understood i just i just i just i don't want to

370
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,800
do any of the things that are associated with halloween you don't have to i don't you gotta you

371
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,760
have to fuck sluts on halloween it's the thing it's the american tradition and you're not going to

372
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,160
do it i don't you'll just go unfucked ban and is that pumpkin spice is good i'm i'll i'll i'll

373
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,880
i'll stand up i'll put my neck out for pumpkin spice but um i don't want to put on a costume i

374
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,480
don't want to see other people in their costumes i don't want to trick or treat or to receive trick

375
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:48,120
or treaters i don't want i don't like uh uh uh plastic skeletons the home invasion aspect of

376
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:54,120
halloween has always been a bit like move out of usa all your problems will be solved uh i mean

377
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,080
i don't like carving jack-o-lanterns uh i don't like i love carving jack-o-lanterns that's the

378
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,440
best bit i want to carve one one it's it's because it's like it's like a sculpture thing but like

379
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:11,960
it's not weird to do it like like you can't cut i mean i you can technically like buy like a pineapple

380
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:18,360
or like a watermelon and carve it at any time um but you never think unless it's halloween

381
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,720
yeah like i didn't think it was out and like lighting it like making like a reference to

382
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:29,320
like homestuck or bail jpeg or whatever uh really fun one year i did one year i did carve a uh

383
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:36,680
candy corn vampire uh problem sleuth jack-o-lantern which was good it was good um the i did like in

384
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,680
in um what's in gravity and gravity falls they do summer wean and they just do it with with uh

385
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:51,480
yeah uh uh watermelons maybe yeah that's pretty cute um no i'm the i am the grinch of halloween

386
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,880
and i know that the grinch had a halloween movie but that doesn't count what yeah yeah yeah there's

387
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,640
this i i don't know the night before the grinch i didn't know grinch is in a halloween movie where

388
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,000
he i don't know tries to hashtag cancel halloween or whatever didn't you learn a lesson the first

389
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,400
time i don't know if dr seuss was involved with that one at all or if the studio is just like

390
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,880
we gotta make a sequel guys so wait a minute what what like does he like forcibly make people not

391
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,480
scared as that like he calms everyone down that's what he does i haven't seen it so i couldn't tell

392
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,720
you what the plot is but i have some guesses from the love from the love that he learned from

393
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,120
christmas he decides to spread it to halloween and ruins the spirit of the whole thing by making

394
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:43,400
people feel okay apparently it's called halloween is grinch that's what i just said and it's written

395
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,960
by dr seuss it was written by dr seuss how bizarre and about that and the grinch has like

396
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,560
orange eyes he's got scary orange eyes in this one maybe the grinch's grievance is that like this

397
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,760
is like his people's holiday and this is cultural appropriation as a ghoul or goblin himself uh

398
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:07,000
which i presume that he is he's an abominable gremlin is he just like a fucked up whoville

399
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,640
citizen who you know moved away and i think you know i think that the the implication is that he's

400
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:21,480
like he doesn't shave and he's green because he's ugly and stinky i agree i agree i think he's one

401
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,120
of the whoville people just fucked up or something isn't that what happened in the jim carrey movie he

402
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,320
was like adopted or something he was like one of them but uh well jim carried the actor uh yeah when

403
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:38,520
he played the grinch you know what i'm saying i'm reading the plots in opposite it was just overgrown

404
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:46,200
with hair good it's just like no okay so the grinch does not steal halloween and in fact

405
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,320
in spite of the name of the movie there is no halloween in this world there is only

406
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:58,280
grinch night which just is their version of okay and it's basically just grinch fucking abducts a

407
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:07,240
child and puts him in his drug wagon and gets the kid high and the kid just has a bad trip

408
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,680
but he doesn't like he i guess he he doesn't like actually die of terror and so the grinch has failed

409
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:21,880
in his quest and is defeated and that's it so all the spook of halloween is condensed into one

410
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,720
small child and the idea is just to spook this one guy as hard as possible to whatever effect his

411
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,920
desire dude that's like that time in one piece when luffy got pulled put all the shadows in him to

412
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,840
like as much halloween as possible to defeat like that to defeat us that place was definitely

413
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:45,480
halloween coded so there's no doubt about that um thriller bark that is of course so i guess i'm

414
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,800
not the grinch halloween because it seems like the grinch is actually like the grinch is out and

415
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,960
about like yeah grinch night is his night you're you're that child on on grinch night yeah i'm

416
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:01,160
that child who refuses to get spooked who doesn't whose toes don't come off because i guess that

417
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,560
that's the challenge is like i'm gonna scare your toes off but his toes don't come off so he's like

418
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:13,800
darn time let me get my axe i'll get you i have been making a slight effort to uh uh do spooky

419
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,080
things i've watched several horror movies including uh the exorcist three after red letter media did

420
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,320
their review and it was revealed to me it's not a completely terrible movie saw that review good

421
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,000
review good movie liked it um and i watched last night i watched mid samar i was finally able to

422
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,720
acquire mid samar and uh that that did indeed spook me to my core mostly because like because

423
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:41,560
like the bad guys just won and that made me sad and like feel bad about humanity and i lost faith

424
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:48,040
for a while but then i got it back uh so that was all right speaking of spooky i finished watching

425
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,560
like season nine of of the walking way i was gonna talk about oh you're still talking about i was

426
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,400
i was going to talk about what i think about halloween but if walking dead is okay we'll get

427
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:05,880
there yeah yeah so i and it just it it wrecked me i knew i knew it was coming i knew like why

428
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:12,680
does nine seasons of that so far nine seasons that just terrified me i'm so still going yeah it's

429
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,960
still going there's wait i said the wire right talking about the wire zombie scare me the walking

430
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,680
dead okay yeah i've been saying that has to end for as long as it's been going on as far as i

431
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,880
funny thing is okay they just started season 10 there's a spin-off called if you're the walking

432
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,040
dead it's on season five and i think there's gonna be another spin-off uh starting at some point

433
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,800
and that's not counting all the little smaller spin-offs that's already been i remember watching

434
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,960
season one and thinking like hey this is a pretty cool show it's it's gotten it's gotten really good

435
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,680
like at first it was okay then it got really bad and then it started getting better now it's quite

436
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:58,360
good again is it good again i'm i'll believe you i'm i'm willing to believe that but i think my

437
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:04,200
window of care has definitely passed i mean it's fine yeah it's fine i don't expect anyone else to

438
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,560
care but it's just like with season nine it's just like the way the end it is just i hate how they

439
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,840
i hate how they make me care about characters and then you just kill them off like that like the way

440
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,040
they did i just spend nine seasons since you get the pattern by now i think they call that the cock

441
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:29,400
carousel huh what nothing is uh is fan favorite norman readus still a character is alive

442
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,440
do you mean like he regrams or what no i don't know what his character's name is

443
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:42,360
from um he's the guy with the crossbow yeah yeah deal yeah yeah he's still alive he's one of my

444
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:47,960
favorite characters and there's no norman readus from um that that kojima um yeah he's the main

445
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,400
character and death stranding who's the other no no i wasn't norman rockwell who's the other

446
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,080
guy who worked on death stranding i mean of many people guillermo del toro guillermo yeah guillermo

447
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,280
del toro aka norman rockwell why the fuck did i almost say norman rockwell okay whatever moving on

448
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,160
okay but what do you think of halloween i just want to quickly say it's like the daryl uh and and carol

449
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,040
are my two favorite characters and they're all in carol yeah uh they are they're also best friends

450
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:19,720
and then i think carol's still alive yeah she's such a good character though i love her she and and

451
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,920
and the character and i'm so mad huh wasn't she like dying or something did she have like some

452
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,000
sort of like sickness and now she's not dying anymore no no i don't remember about any sort of

453
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,560
sickness no maybe i'm making this up maybe you're misremembering the character it's been a while

454
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:42,520
sounds like it uh i mean she died she dies in the comics but uh maybe i'm gonna do that i did

455
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,000
read those for a little bit yeah but she she's such a good character he's one of my favorites and

456
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,680
they hurt her and i'm mad like i the character the character they oft didn't care too much about him

457
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:58,120
i mean it's sad but like but they hurt her and that's what makes me angry because like she's finally

458
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:04,920
she was finally happy she was finally happy and they hurt her so i'm mad how can you be happy

459
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,880
again the world of zombies it's impossible she she managed to find happiness she was so

460
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,880
wrecked she went through so much the things were so bad for her and she was finally i mean that's

461
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,280
the that's the thing as soon as the characters arc is complete and they achieve happiness they can

462
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,800
either kill them off or fuck with it because they just or ignore them i know there's the three options

463
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:34,200
it was just i i know i that's why i knew it was coming but i'm still mad i'm mad it's it's the

464
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,240
it's one of those things like whoever finishes the arc at the same time the show ends is the only

465
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,360
person who gets to live in something like this like if they finish their arc earlier they're

466
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:50,760
dead wait so they either have to die or they have to leave the show in some other way indeed it's the

467
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:56,600
only way to stay alive like uh rick protecting his son or did he die i don't you know i don't know

468
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:03,000
okay okay rick is assumed to be dead but there's gonna be a movie with him so yeah well yeah there

469
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,240
you go but like he's been missing like canonically from the story for like several years now

470
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:16,200
oh i like how movie is still a term we use like it's such an old fashioned old-timey

471
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,960
sort of it is how it's not i try i try to say i at various points i've tried to switch to saying

472
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:28,200
film but it's never stuck i mean film i think i used to say film yeah but film makes more sense

473
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,920
film is like a more what's the difference honestly tell me explain the differences i mean they mean

474
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,600
the same thing they mean the same thing but like movie is derivative of of like talky

475
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:46,040
because like a movie is like it it's moving pictures wow and a talky is like oh they added

476
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,600
sound now you can hear it that's that they called them talkies for a while but that was stupid so

477
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:56,200
they changed back to movies and film is like the the thing they used to film it on that's what it's

478
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:03,320
called um so like both are like i guess movie is more descriptive of what you're what it is

479
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,480
because it's not shot on film anymore unless it unless it's quentin taratino

480
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,680
but yeah i don't know i think about that a lot of how the words are weird like computer it's just

481
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,640
like it's computing it's a computer it's doing quite a bit of computing still it's just like it's

482
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,880
such a simple term you know it's just like we didn't like we didn't really come up with a word for it

483
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,160
we just kind of like described what it did and said it's and then like other other languages and

484
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,160
like other languages like okay correct me if i'm wrong but i think in japanese the word is just

485
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,480
like komputa or something that's correct that's and like it's like they could have they could have

486
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,680
just uh used like you know made up their own word that also describes its function like nah

487
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,840
this word standardized we'll just take this one is there is there like a japanese word for cake

488
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:50,200
because all i've ever heard is this cakey yeah cakey i mean there are there are many japanese

489
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,240
desserts but they use the word cake all the time i mean i mean i mean cake cake cake as we normally

490
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:02,440
think of it as like a western dish so yeah that's makes sense it's the same way that a cookie no

491
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:09,480
actually that's not the same or whatever uh but like words right where was i going with this what

492
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,160
was the thing well like how about like a waffle like a waffle is a very specific dish and you know

493
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,480
you can't call that anything but what would be awful because a cultural shit we could make up a

494
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:26,680
new word for it the dutch word i think right yeah oh yeah computer like i think did computing exist

495
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,640
before computer did they have to come up with a term for what this is yeah yeah i mean i mean you

496
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,400
can do i mean it's math called computation in your head or on paper i mean that's what they

497
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:42,920
they designed a computer initially to take the heavy lifting out of doing traditional mathematical

498
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,440
computation hence the name computer i would assume okay i i always assumed it was like named after the

499
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:54,200
device and like maybe the first ones were called like uh electric uh abacuses or whatever yeah that

500
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:01,000
would be a calculator doing calculations right uh i guess i guess calculation was already a word

501
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,400
yeah calculation yeah and computation as well see i can't i can't divorce computation from the

502
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:14,360
computer as a word uh fucking fucking zoomer back in my day we back in my day we used uh we just

503
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:20,360
counted on our hands and back in our day and then they invented the abacus and everyone got lazy

504
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,560
and it all went did you have everyone lost their minds then did you have the weird you go to math

505
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,200
class and they'd hand out the uh the blue calculators with like the white buttons and you'd have to do

506
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,200
calculations on there but then they take them away for the tests the scientific calculators like the

507
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,080
yeah the sign like the ti 83 uh that too but that's not what i was talking about like elton

508
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,480
they gave out like they'd give pass around the class these dinky little like

509
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,840
bright blue calculators with white buttons and they'd be like now do your times tables

510
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,000
bitch but you can't use it on the tests so we're teaching you how to do something that we're not

511
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,040
going to let you do when it counts mickey mouse teach you math yeah yeah that's how everybody

512
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:03,240
talked back then i know it's been said before but remember in school when they would say you can't

513
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,160
use a calculator on the test you think you're gonna have you think you're gonna have a computer in

514
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:14,280
your pocket to do all your calculations for you in the real world oh it's night it's 1992 and the

515
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:27,880
future is bleak children we're at the end of history die that's what we should have said

516
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:33,480
probably we knew before i talked about the walking dead you wanted to talk about halloween

517
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:39,560
oh yeah yeah it's not here but hippo is halloween hot take it's not really a hot take it's just

518
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:48,520
i appreciate like the aesthetic of all of the halloween e things like pumpkins ghost skeletons

519
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:55,400
the the quote-unquote spooky stuff that um but like i hate scary things anything that's actually

520
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:03,080
scary i'm like yeah i'll pass i won't thanks i'd never look at scary movies i only i only

521
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,720
like same like funny things that have scary things in them like nightmare before christmas is

522
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:15,000
obviously like a fun movie that has scary things in it um and uh that's why i like pumpkins and

523
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:22,600
vampires and ghouls doing things that are goofy rather than scary things i am so torn because i

524
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:28,600
like scary things but also i hate scary things so i just i can't i cannot exist i don't i don't

525
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,320
like scary things i'm over i'm over spooky things even things that aren't scary but are

526
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:39,400
just quote-unquote spooky no i'm over it it's done when i played silent hill 2 it opened my eyes and

527
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:45,720
i began to appreciate scary things and now i watch them they do disturb me deeply mid-summer

528
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,920
kind of fucked me up yesterday i was very spooked and scared but more than not like that there was

529
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,920
like no jump scares in the movie there's a couple but mostly it was just like in the x you know

530
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,720
actually was funny i mentioned the exorcist before i was watching i mean this was in uh like red

531
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,280
litter media's review but they talked about how the writer of the books was working with the director

532
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,360
the director just wanted to make a cool movie and like didn't give a fuck about like the message

533
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,520
behind it or anything uh or you know something along those lines and but the author was very

534
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:19,160
concerned about the message and they were doing an interview and the guy like the the director was

535
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,160
like i wanted to have like a big finish wanted to like blah blah do this because spoilers at the

536
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:28,280
end of the exorcist they the guy performs the exorcism the devil comes out of the little girl

537
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,240
possesses him and in that moment he hurls himself out the window and like kills himself

538
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:39,880
thus killing the demon which is currently in him um and like the the the the writer the author the

539
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,160
screen guy was very concerned that people would perceive this as like the devil successfully

540
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:51,560
killing someone as opposed to the priest doing a heroic sacrifice to like delete the devil from

541
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,640
this girl's brain or whatever and he's just like in the interview he's just like man i just don't

542
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:00,680
want the people to think that the devil won and you could see how deeply this was important to him

543
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:06,840
that people get the message of like hope and and goodness and inspiration as opposed to bad things

544
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:13,320
win but in fucking Midsommar there's just a bunch of human sacrifices and frankly it all goes like

545
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:19,560
clockwork and it's great and everyone yay we did it uh we killed the guys and good for us

546
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:26,840
they were kind of jerks and that's it we win happy endings aren't that scary they can be terrifying

547
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,800
i mean it depends it depends uh you know what i mean can a happy ending be scary okay i watch

548
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:37,480
the bad guys happy it depends on what you mean by happy ending like if if you it does depend it

549
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:43,960
like like in a in a horror movie a happy ending usually means uh surviving getting out safely

550
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,600
right yes but even then they'll give you a jump scare at the end i mean a great example of like

551
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,440
things with happy endings that can still be terrifying is like anything like cosmic horror

552
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,320
right because you've you've been revealed that there's so much more going on than humans even

553
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:03,400
have context or the capacity to understand and so it just recontextualizes all of like life

554
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,680
and even if you get away from it it's like well what i thought was meaningful now is meaningless

555
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,080
in the face of this greater truth i'm like that can be a happy ending but it's because like the

556
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,440
character survived they got away they didn't die but like the world's fucking totally different

557
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,840
now dude i'm not even sure i call that a happy ending necessarily but yeah what if like i mean

558
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,560
i guess it's down to the guy there's there's the guy in the monster and he guys like oh

559
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:33,000
shit there's the monster he's fucking killing my friends but then he kills the monster but

560
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:40,360
he he he was sleeping he didn't actually kill the monster he was just being eaten alive while

561
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:48,760
asleep oh no darn i hate when that happens cut to black or like at the end uh what was it

562
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,800
fucking baguille or whatever just shows up for one frame right before we cut to black with a big

563
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,760
right right the lazy you know showing off one frame it's like a youtube thing i like

564
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,440
spooky things but i hate things that make me feel sad and and like i have a very weird

565
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:10,840
capacity for what things make me sad like i cannot take it when like old people are being abused

566
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:17,640
or die or or just something like that something something about that it just makes me die boomers

567
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,760
die super upset it's just like i watched i was watching duro and i liked duro but there was one

568
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:29,560
one part one one part about like this guy he kind of banded his old mom uh and and like uh she she

569
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:34,280
clung to him but he thought it was like the monster so he swiped with his sword backwards and

570
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:40,360
cut off her hand and and he didn't even realize up until he came back uh to his village and that he

571
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:45,560
realized oh shit you know his mom clung to him for help and he was so scared that he loved her behind

572
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:50,120
not only did he leave her behind but he cut off his hand her hand when she tried to cling to him

573
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:57,320
and it's it's still hurting me it's still hurting me on the inside there's a there's a movie there's

574
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:05,000
a movie called um uh drag me to hell which is uh i watched it years ago and uh i mean it's it's

575
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,560
like over the top in a way that is like comical a lot of the time but it's still like you guys seen

576
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:16,040
it you guys seen drag me to hell i'm aware of it i have seen it that's it it is um it's kind of kooky

577
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:22,200
but it's also like genuinely scary in a lot of places and it has like a big fucking like you

578
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,800
think there's gonna be a happy ending but then it's like no everything's the worst like right at

579
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:34,840
the end and it's like it's so miserable it left me like it let me like emotionally bereft i was like

580
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:40,360
i can't i can't i can't live in a world they should have done they should have done a social media

581
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,800
campaign share your stories it wasn't fair no it wasn't fair what happened to her she didn't deserve it

582
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,960
yeah don't you i i hate that i hate that that's not cool yeah i mean i'm typically not a huge

583
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:58,920
fan of horror movies because they tend to go for like like low hanging fruit scares it's yeah i mean

584
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,480
they're a great one there are exceptions of course yeah but like there are some there on the one hand

585
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:09,080
there's like the low hanging fruit stuff like the stuff that like rate pg-13 and full of jump scares

586
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:14,200
just to like get money from children around halloween you know and then they also and like

587
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,600
good horror movies a lot of the times they rely on like the visual aspect like really like intense

588
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:24,520
gore and stuff and i'm not usually hugely into that either there's a movie called uh creep and it

589
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:30,600
is a horror movie it's not supernatural at all the premise is basically just i won't go too much

590
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:36,520
into the specifics but it's basically just our protagonist is just like hired to do a job by this

591
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:42,440
guy and he goes to meet this guy and he's for a while he's trapped he's kind of is isolated with

592
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:49,640
the guy and it's just about like this guy seems kind of off like oh he's he's really off like

593
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:56,600
why is he acting this way like what like and like it it uh it's just it's just the horror of like

594
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:03,560
i've i've met this person who is so off-putting and i am genuinely scared of like what they're

595
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:08,920
going to do but i don't know because i'm definitely more of a fan of like the esoteric or like

596
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,960
psychological horror of where it's just like instead of like presenting like a very tangible

597
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,040
physical thing it kind of lets your mind fill in the blanks with its own worst-case scenario

598
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:23,240
because you never know because like this guy is like he's like a liar but like you kind of have

599
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,800
to like like sometimes it seems like you know like in the same way that he's like he's like

600
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,640
tricking and manipulating this character into like thinking like no no no that was just a joke

601
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:37,000
that was just a joke it's like you the audience are like like how much like like what is the real

602
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,560
what's this guy actually like like is like how much is this uh like he's be he's gas lighting

603
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:49,880
you he gas lights you the audience and it's like really yuck movies are scary understood but it's

604
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:57,080
all pussy shit it's all pussy shit compared to legitimately scary video games like silent

605
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:05,560
hill too that game was so fucking hard to get through it was brutal to try like just watching

606
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:10,200
a movie it's gonna keep playing just close your eyes you'll be fine but with a game you have to

607
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:15,000
do it right you have to go into the room you have to oh my god you have to like reach in with your

608
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,800
character into the fucking hole grab the key and you can feel the fucking vibration is something's

609
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:25,720
touching you it's you playing the fucking game it's a new level if you want two spooks man go play

610
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:30,680
silent hill two and three it's a shame that they'll never be another good silent hill game well yeah

611
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,920
did you hear about the new silent hill game that just came out like a few days ago oh what is it

612
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,520
i don't care about that shit that's is it a phone game no it's not bad it's a little sucks we all

613
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,480
we all know that konami sucks well i i want to talk about video games as like okay the the more

614
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:52,520
scary medium because i lied before i do like scary things um specifically in a video game

615
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:59,960
but not just because you are like your actions and inaction like are constantly causing all like

616
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:06,680
you know you're constantly uh responsible for whether or not you're being killed right now

617
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,520
in certain video games but it's also the fact that if you if you're in certain video games if

618
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,800
there's like not really a character you can skip all of the boring parts of the movie where

619
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,760
they have to set up characters that you have to care about so that when they die it's scary

620
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:28,040
like i don't when it's you who is the character you know who you are you don't want to die

621
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
so you can skip all that and you can just get straight to the scary parts which is why

622
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,240
i love five nights at freddy's let's plays by markiplier because i can i don't have to play

623
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:45,880
the game but i can sit there with him and and look around the screen like is there a bear kona

624
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,680
is there a bear coming for you are you gonna be able to survive the night oh my god

625
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,920
wait is this a hard game just about being stalked by a bear

626
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:01,800
oh you don't know what five nights at freddy's is oh five sorry i checked out okay okay like

627
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,440
you're a hunter just in the woods and the monster the idea you just pitch sounds immensely interesting

628
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,720
though and i kind of wanted to exist now yeah like it's just as scary as anything else you could

629
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:17,640
think of it might be stalking you you'll be just you'll be just as dead whether the thing that gets

630
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:24,200
you is a bear or the babadook or whatever or freddy fazbear of fry i don't i don't like playing

631
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:30,680
hard games but uh no go ahead people the the the purest distillation of like fear in a video game

632
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:37,480
is just like a game where it's dark and you have to press a button to move forward and at any moment

633
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:42,120
something could happen and even if you don't do anything something could happen and that's it

634
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,680
it's just a game you press forward or you don't press forward and you're like oh god click

635
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,800
click like i would i would play that game i would shit myself and i would have a great time

636
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:57,720
and there wouldn't even need to be anything there i i would need to believe those the last

637
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:04,520
actual horror game that i played was fatal frame two and i loved it i to this day i still like

638
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:11,000
remember things about it that i absolutely adored um like in somewhere near the beginning of the game

639
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,040
you explore the house and you find like diary pages of like a woman searching for her husband

640
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:21,960
or something like that and she's lost in the village and stuff and and the very final final

641
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,920
piece you find it's it's like several pages like the first page is like i don't know i can't go on

642
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:31,320
it's like i i hope i i hope i i'll find you or something like that and it's like it's a blank

643
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:36,680
page and then you turn the page blank page you turn the page blank page for a few pages last page

644
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:40,920
so it's like found you or something like that and you put it down and suddenly you get attacked

645
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:46,360
like by the but the ghost of the woman that was like here and it's just like oh it was so spooky

646
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:51,960
to experience it but like it shivers down my spine like and it was such a fun experience and then like

647
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:58,840
later this house um was where there were like two twin girls and and at the one of the girls had to

648
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:05,400
be sacrificed and uh the girl was so sad about losing her sister that the dad made a doll that

649
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,760
looked just like her and the doll a doll became possessed over time or something like that and

650
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:15,880
and it's just like i love i love reading the stories of how the people happen like how the

651
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:21,240
shit creepy stuff it's just i'm sorry i'm just like i'm getting overwhelmed with my

652
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,200
nerves about the game there's one great moment so many good things such a good game there's one

653
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:30,360
moment i always remember well the first time you see pyramid head in sound hill two is terrifying

654
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:34,920
he can't even get you but you see him through a grade but in sound hill three there's a moment

655
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,320
that's probably the scariest thing i've ever experienced in a game which is just you walk into

656
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:45,720
this room and there's a big mirror and you walk in and nothing happens and you walk you like try to

657
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,160
interact like you know you're trying to look for ammo or enemies there's nothing it's totally quiet

658
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,280
and then you go to leave and you click the door and it says the door is locked and it's the only

659
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:59,800
way out and then suddenly these like worm noises start to fall creep into your ear and you go back

660
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:04,520
to the mirror and you can see that like your whole body is being covered in like these fucking

661
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:09,480
disgusting ass like bloody tendrils or something and the whole mirror is getting fucked up and the

662
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,720
whole room is getting fucked up and of course you try the door again but it's still locked and you

663
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,720
can't get out and you try it again you still can't get out and then you have to try it like a bunch

664
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,400
of times and you can't escape but the whole time you're taking damage so you're freaking the

665
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:27,640
fuck out you don't know what to do oh my god it was very very spooky is the point okay this

666
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:33,400
reminds me i heard about this a while ago but and i kind of meant to ask you about it um do you

667
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:38,760
did you hear that like um uh you know you're a twin perfect you know twin perry you show you

668
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,080
show me of course uh do you know that like um there was kind of like a backlash against them at

669
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:48,600
some point because like was it not todd howard you know in their in their silent hill videos they

670
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:55,240
they harp a lot on this one guy and like he got a tom tom tom hulet yes tom hulet yes and they

671
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,720
harp a lot on this one guy's involvement and i think at some point people like he got a lot of

672
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:06,040
hate for it and it seems like maybe he wasn't as responsible as like yeah i saw that video you're

673
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,520
talking about yeah like like yeah there's a video where they yeah they they criticize uh twin perfect

674
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:16,680
a lot for how how hard they go on tom hulet and and maybe they were i mean they didn't like directly

675
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:21,880
incite anyone to harass the guy but like i don't like i think it's there was people definitely

676
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,040
harassed him and were like fuck you tom hulet after they put a lot of the blame on this

677
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:31,080
i don't know i don't know fungo apologized fungo apologized for but the other guy the whatever

678
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:36,920
his name is didn't rosseter i don't know i was yeah rosseter i was just interested because like

679
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:43,240
you showed me twin perfect and i love that uh silent hill series and then like i was kind of

680
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:48,760
but i didn't hear like anyone talking about it in like the broader discourse or whatever and then

681
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,240
to suddenly see it come up as the center of i don't know i mean controversy would probably be

682
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:58,200
overstating a bit but like people you know just yeah it pops up on social media like people are like

683
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:03,880
uh you know this this wasn't cool this was this was dumb and then i don't know i was interested

684
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,320
to see a particular into the public consciousness i didn't expect that yeah i remember that that

685
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,560
was interesting uh and those were the guys who got me into silent hill of course it was yeah you

686
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:18,280
you know they worked with fungo at first um they they haven't been terribly active recently

687
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:23,880
fungos but uh yeah indeed fungos streamer twin perfect themselves don't really upload much

688
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,800
fungo did a lot of blood borne content but i think stopped after a while i don't know

689
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:33,400
yeah he made a ton of very popular like blood borne lore videos explain okay which i thought

690
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,640
were very good they they were i watched a lot of those i know he vaped so that's pretty cool

691
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,680
i like i clicked his channel like one time just to see like what it was about and i watched a

692
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:49,640
little bit of video and he like he vaped on i was like yeah brother in arms i actually i did do a

693
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,200
little research just out of curiosity i there was i don't even remember what the video was but i

694
01:06:54,200 --> 01:07:00,120
remember someone made like a video about this drama such as it is and i went and i looked i actually

695
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:05,000
joined the twin perfect discord which i think i'm still in just to because i was curious what the

696
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,600
people on their side of the table were saying i mean it should be noted twin perfect absolutely

697
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:17,720
went hard against tom hewlett yeah and ascribed much like uh a lot of i wouldn't say malice but a

698
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:23,800
lot of mistakes they put at his feet yeah they according to them he was like very uh he was

699
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:29,960
like very well they describe him as kind of having a fairly high like executive like like

700
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:35,160
directorial role in it and being the decision maker behind a lot of the things that they didn't

701
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:40,840
like about the direction the series took indeed that they say that like you know he doesn't understand

702
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:45,960
the lore he doesn't understand the appeal of the series he fundamentally misunderstands the the stuff

703
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:51,880
and so on this particular drama was interesting because there there is there was a very explicit

704
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:56,200
point if you watch the whole series which i have many times they there is an episode where they say

705
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,960
like who is to blame who is to blame and they quite this is years before the drama came out

706
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:06,360
and they're like if you watch this is like part 15 or something but you know such as it is

707
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:11,080
and they were like who's to blame tom hewlett bears responsibility but the main man who is

708
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:17,160
responsible for the downfall of silent hill is akiri yamaoka akiri yamaoka is the guy who's

709
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,880
done the music i believe for all the silent hill games and he at some point was put in charge of

710
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:27,880
the series and he he like they say this is the man who really did it to silent hill we love what he

711
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:32,280
did in the past because these guys these guys the hard like one two three four are great beyond that

712
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:36,680
shit you know they get them i mean they get criticism for going too hard on tom hewlett like

713
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,520
even as the series was coming out because there is like at the beginning of one video they they

714
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,920
respond to a question it's like it's not all tom's hewlett's fault and they say like we didn't say it

715
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:49,080
was all tom's hewlett's fault and then they give a bunch of like it's like you know a lot of this

716
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:53,400
they talk about other people's involvement and decision they do talk a lot about tom hewlett

717
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:59,960
though the abs okay but which i'm not saying they shouldn't do necessarily uh yeah i mean i i a

718
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:06,760
little bit feel like people are being a little bit i don't know like should they i agree they

719
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:11,480
probably exaggerated some things but like clearly these are like passionate nerdy fans or like obsessed

720
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:15,720
with the shit and you know they're looking to place blame on someone tom hewlett's obviously at

721
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:21,000
least partially responsible was it totally fair to put it on him probably not i i don't know it's

722
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,360
like fans get a little bit carried away sometimes with their excessive if they were to do it again

723
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:31,560
they'd probably be a little bit less it's all on this guy but there is some responsibility yeah i

724
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,880
don't know i don't necessarily it's like what's the i don't think twin perfect like did anything

725
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,920
wrong exactly i mean they might have been i mean they may have been somewhat mistaken in like

726
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:47,800
i mean like they might have thought that he did more than he did like they could be factually

727
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:54,680
you know i don't feel like they were in the wrong to criticize a guy for the things he did

728
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:01,080
in a video game it you know it did always strike me that even as i watched that series i thought to

729
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:07,640
myself like you know kodami is a very big presumably complex company yeah a lot of these guys say

730
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:12,120
that it's hard to maneuver in a big company they have to get approval from executives and like

731
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:18,280
how much can one man be responsible they say that in the at some they talk about how like you know

732
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:25,000
this is a like this is a corporate machine that is that is like you know that has set this up

733
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,080
you know so i mean i would just agree i would agree to his employers i think tom i think perfect

734
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:37,800
did in fact put yeah i i agree i think twin perfect did put too much responsibility on tom i agree

735
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,040
with that but i don't think they like we're deliberately trying to get the guy harassed

736
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:47,160
or nor do i like if we if we held like i don't think they expected the series to be that popular

737
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:52,040
it's like at what point you know it's it kind of come to that thing that that topic i talked about

738
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:58,280
months ago which was like what is it the journalistic concept of like not doing harm or whatever it is

739
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:03,640
like there is accountability for anyone who makes a youtube video to like be accurate and precise

740
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:09,080
that you're not like doing any negativity and i have no doubt tom got a good amount of yeah i mean

741
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:14,280
there's definitely a probably a large contingent of the silent hill fan base that now associates

742
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:19,240
tom hewlett as the guy who ruined silent hill sure the question to the interesting question

743
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:23,480
is a legitimate one is to ask like how much blame let's say tom at an absolutely terrible time as

744
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:30,120
a result of this these were a bunch of dudes making videos about silent hill how much responsibility

745
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:36,680
do they bear for simply yeah going perhaps a bit too hard on a man they feel is responsible for

746
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:41,400
a downturn of a video games i don't feel like more than zero less than i don't feel like you

747
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:48,680
can point to any like particular thing they said and say like this is unacceptable for you just for

748
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:56,760
you to say this no sir have you no sense of decency sir and you know i'll just say i always

749
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,320
found this a little bit funny they they did a thing i was always a little bit suspicious of this

750
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:06,200
where they say like here okay god it was after i think this criticisms like this began to come out

751
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:10,600
and they were having their fights with the sound hill wiki they're like okay guys new gimmick for

752
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:17,960
this episode we want you to smash the dislike button because um uh because we want to show them

753
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,640
that we hate it was like the remakes and i mean i agree there's tons of problems with the remakes

754
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:26,920
total very shitty product they go into incredible detail into all the problems and i salute them

755
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:33,240
for it but like the way they're saying like smash the dislike button it's like oh now like no one

756
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:38,200
can hold you accountable if there's any negativity to this video because if it's all positive you

757
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:43,160
can say wow even though we said it smashed the dislike button everybody loves us and if it's

758
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:49,000
tons of dislikes well you're just making that a positive now which i thought was a little bit

759
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,760
silly but i mean i get the point it's just uh an intro i was wondered if there's a little bit of

760
01:12:54,760 --> 01:13:01,320
of gamesmanship going on there you know trying to cover themselves a little bit how you play the

761
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:07,640
game i suppose i suppose what yeah i mean you know they're they're these guys were going on a big

762
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:14,680
culture war of like we want to defend classic silent hill and that that raises innumerable

763
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:21,720
issues about you know it's it's the cult it's all about the cult it's not a it's oh yeah i don't

764
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,640
think we'll remember that it's a silent according to the lore of silent hill one this is all caused

765
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:30,840
by the cult and alessa was a sacrifice alessa was not a deliberate sacrifice the fire was started

766
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:37,960
accidentally i mean these i mean you know me i made my fucking like tifa video about retardedly

767
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:42,280
overly analyzing details that's all they do this is all they do it's a good series these are the

768
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,520
it's a really good it is a good series the twin perfect silent hills is really fucking oh the real

769
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:52,280
world dark world and foggy town they all the production values on these songs they roll out

770
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:58,200
like incredible the only one with another worldly name i think about that song all the time hard to

771
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:05,960
believe it's a great song it's a great song about such minute plot details one yeah just like who

772
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:10,600
would do such a thing it's great it's great yeah and i mean just if you watch the series like the

773
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:15,160
amount of editing and the hard work that is just so apparent in every part of the video i always

774
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:20,920
thought their delivery is pretty bad they really come off like they're stiff and like the way they

775
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:25,960
read their lines it's like it really feels like they're reading cue cards you really feel that

776
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:32,440
they're reading cue cards and like their jet they gesticulate a little too much i don't know uh we've

777
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,600
had this disagreement before i've always liked rosseter he's like he moves his head and shoulders

778
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:44,680
in a very like explaining way and like a by the way twin perfect not uploaded a video

779
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:50,680
since may 4th 2018 so it's been all like over a year and a half now and i miss you guys rosseter

780
01:14:50,680 --> 01:15:00,120
please come back oh my god in my head i was thinking of dude perfect you dude perfect oh my god the

781
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:05,560
trick shot people uh yeah they do trick shots never they like they do trick shots wait what where

782
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:10,520
you throw you know like you throw a ball into onto the wall and it lands in a cup and then

783
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:15,880
they go like oh my god my guess i don't know this my guess is that they're the most profitable

784
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:21,480
youtube channel in the world that is my guess dude perfect because dude perfect yes i mean they get

785
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:27,240
insane numbers and what they do is not i mean i respect the work they put in they make props and

786
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,160
they do crazy tricks but we all know they just practice the trip over and over until it works

787
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:37,080
you like um like the jackie chan thing you seen that uh you seen that yes yeah that every frame

788
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:41,640
every frame painting with jackie chan now he would just do like hundreds of takes until he got the

789
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:47,400
shot or the hit or the perfect or broke his leg and i respect it oh yeah or or dies in trying

790
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,520
um well okay that's enough about dude perfect uh that's enough about twin perfect all right here

791
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:02,520
i got i got something to say about uh a content creator um you know andrew hussey that guy who

792
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:07,960
made homestuck and so mother things i've heard of him i've heard the name but i've never met the man

793
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:17,080
but beyond that uh he has opened an instagram account semi recently um and he is a hashtag

794
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:23,640
eboy now um for his for his 40th birthday i think it was he started being an eboy

795
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:28,520
tell me more he started to being he started being an eboy on instagram and i followed him

796
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:35,160
and the the the the posts initially were just like him wearing like extremely young people

797
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:42,200
hip trendy clothing okay um with sunglasses doing silly poses in front of horses in you know in a

798
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:48,520
place yeah uh then it was like a bunch of images from him like in a different swag outfit fresh as

799
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:54,600
fuck you know all that sort of you know and he's just sort of hashtag eboy hashtag hussey like like

800
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:01,800
is like in places being fresh and it's it's funny it's just it's unironically the best thing he's

801
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:12,280
made since uh like i don't know cascade yeah so um but then uh like more recently than he started

802
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:18,680
making these these posts he's been like doing Toblerone hot drops uh they're not hot drops but

803
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:26,360
like Toblerone secret location find the Toblerone quests he would he would take picture of Toblerone

804
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:31,480
he would sign them and he would hide them in a place he would take a few pictures of himself

805
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:37,000
and then like a zoom in on a google map and people would go out and find the Toblerone

806
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:45,880
and uh this most recent one he was in taiwan i think according to comments so he's in taiwan

807
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:52,840
put in Toblerone and it was just so funny he he took a picture of the Toblerone

808
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,240
and then he took a picture of a shop and then he took a picture of the bathroom stall of the shop

809
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:02,920
and then of a painting on the wall so presumably he just shoved a bunch of Toblerone with his name

810
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:11,080
on it in this in in this bathroom stall uh painting for people to go and find and um the

811
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:19,480
the last time the first time somebody found the Toblerone the Toblerone uh you know secret quest

812
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:26,200
thing uh they he said he'll make something canon they want to be canon oh and they said june egg

813
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:32,760
Bert just generally i guess in homestuck was yeah and and then they said uh make june egg

814
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:41,640
Bert canon and he said yeah sure june egg Bert is like uh john eggbert but trans cool so like

815
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:47,320
that's all right so so people went nuts like oh my god june is john just trans now is that what

816
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:52,120
happened or no i mean it's just it's just a bit of fun like it's not like he hasn't written anything

817
01:18:52,120 --> 01:19:00,760
it's just sort of like yeah sure that's canon and everyone's like yeah and i i just really like this

818
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:07,000
like so much of like what has followed from homestuck at the decline of homestuck in x6 and

819
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,480
then everything that's followed has been like kind of depressing but i like the fact that

820
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:17,400
hussey himself is still funny that is cool that is that he's that he's doing this e-boy stuff i'm

821
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,320
gonna i'm gonna link his instagram i just want to see what kind of fresh outfits he's wearing

823
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:33,240

828
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:06,280
basically late 30s oh him his his fucking emo striped uh some of these are almost unironically

829
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:10,280
good or like you would see yeah like people people were like laughing at first but then a few people

830
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:18,120
like damn oh no my my erotic senses all the one with like with the wings behind yeah exactly that's

831
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:24,440
the one i was thinking of in in boston there is a an alley near harvard's you're in harvard square

832
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:29,560
and in this alley on the wall are these pair of like big white wings and uh everybody every

833
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:35,400
fucking thought or whatever every every femoids gotta have their uh you know their picture of them

834
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:42,600
in front of those wings and these wings okay not only is that like a really uninspired uh picture

835
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:49,080
to take like every obviously everybody does that like there but they also suck for like one they're

836
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:54,920
at the wrong height like they look like they're coming out of your like hips so they're okay they're

837
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,920
too low they're not positioned correctly more importantly they're just bad like they're just

838
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:04,200
badly painted like the wings are not the same size like one is just longer than the other and

839
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:11,000
like they're completely lopsided it's like bad execution of a bad idea and uh i hate everything

840
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,440
perspective they look good no no no they're just no no okay no they're they're just they're just

841
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,640
like a fucking hack put them there and nobody had any better ideas so they've just been there

842
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:27,640
presumably since the dawn of time ain't that just the way it goes but it's a it's an institution

843
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:34,040
now on boston area social media you gotta see those fucking wings everywhere it's like

844
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:38,760
the london bridge exactly just gotta blow it up you take a you go to france you take a picture

919
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:18,200
were too long so this is my little summary section okay never paint heard last episode where i was like

920
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:24,920
inktober sounds like the never paint lifestyle and go never paint and so never paint left a voicemail

921
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:30,120
it was fairly long of just being like oh no i actually haven't been doing inktober and i feel

922
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:35,400
guilty now that's okay fucking tober i went and i checked i believe never paint has in the

923
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:40,120
style so the voicemail was like i won't sleep i will finish inktober now because i've been told to

924
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:45,400
you don't need to do that i absolve you of any need to do this because they were very clear she or he

925
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:50,840
was like i am busy with other things that's why i'm not doing inktober you don't need to do inktober

926
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,880
i don't want to put any pressure on you dog you're working hard already it's clear i'm not so but

927
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:02,920
but alas alas they had already caught up and clearly had been burning the midnight oil to do this so

928
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:07,720
i just want to absolve you with whatever little authority i have here since i was the one who

929
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:14,440
said go go inktober never paint man so okay there you go month tober i'm i'm like two days behind

935
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:54,120
more more draw pornography everyone please you've been destroyed uh okay last last thing i want to

936
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:59,880
say of these voicemails that were too long or boring to play which is so a mysterious man who

937
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:04,200
actually we have a voicemail of his but i like i don't know his name i don't know what he really is

938
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:10,200
there's a guy who's been leaving many voicemails and they're not bad and apparently so on my stream

939
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:15,320
yesterday he just said like he was like hey nate if someone gets five voicemails on a piece of

940
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:21,560
episode do they become god and i'm like impossible but if they did yes and apparently this guy has

941
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:27,560
in fact done that as of last episode so go listen to the last episode apparently five of those were

942
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:33,160
from one dude i'm a little incredulous though if that's actually true and this person provided no

943
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:39,640
proof so i'm just saying call it with a better voicemail and prove it does he assume that it was

944
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:45,560
like of all time like over time no i mean they said like last bcp episode that we played apparently

945
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:51,560
five of their voicemails was the was the claim here so i mean i find that's it's hard to believe

946
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:56,840
so okay there's just an opposite prove it is my point i don't believe you um okay with that

947
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:02,120
enough of the announcements let's get on to the actual voicemails here we go so first one is from

948
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:08,840
our old friend scumbag chris uh let's see what they have to say for themselves go it's been four

949
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:13,800
weeks since i left home to become part of a group of you social insects unfortunately the kamikaze

950
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:17,960
ants wouldn't let me join them since i was too much of a weeb even for them so i've had to scrap

951
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:23,560
my plan to suicide bomb the pcphq fortunately my many years spent studying the blade made me an

952
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:27,640
excellent candidate for the leaf cutters and i really did want to see what all the hype for ant

953
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:32,920
fungus mutualism was about at first they were hesitant to accept a guy who's 185 centimeters

954
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:37,640
tall and a bipedal mammal but i think they're starting to warm up to me all it really took

955
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:42,440
was for me to make my intentions clear that i was mainly just there for that sick ass ant pussy

956
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:47,400
and i landed a job as an apprentice drone so being a leaf cutter ants pretty neat all day it's just

957
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:51,560
walk to the forest cut some plants bring the pieces back to the nest and feed them to the fungus

958
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:56,280
i'm surprised by how much the repetitive menial physical labor distracts me from the systemic

959
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:01,320
inequality of this militant classist regime but more than that it's the fact that i get to smash

960
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:07,080
that sick ass ant queen pussy for real the queen cast exists to take cock especially in a colony

961
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:11,560
with no gamer gates and she doesn't even give a shit how laughably minuscule my micro penis is

962
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:19,480
compared to the other drones ants don't give a fuck okay there you go i good story they sure get

963
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:25,720
a sure as a i feel i can't wait to see here where this goes i get it too yeah scum bag chris

964
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:31,240
hey hey tell us more hey mage i see a i see a little i saw something pop up on my little

972
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:19,080
that favorable exchange rate we got to make it work while we still can slime will become the next

973
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:24,680
president yeah mage have you ever played a game called forager by any chance oh hold on i'm gonna

974
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:29,640
go but it sounds familiar it's it's it's one of these monotonous grindy games where you start off

975
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:35,240
with like no tools on an island no i haven't i looked at looked into it and like it seems like

976
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:40,360
something i would like but at the same time there's things i would not like about it so no i didn't

977
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:45,160
try it the so i first read about this game from um uh what's his name what's discount

978
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:49,320
matthew matthew matthew matthew's his name oh andrew dobbson joseph anderson joseph anderson

979
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:56,880
Yeah, I still never watched Noah, but yeah, Joseph Anderson, he made his travel logs.

980
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:01,520
I have I never watched him one day. I should check him out. But Joseph Anderson made a video

981
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:06,120
about forager. I found it interesting. So I went and I got it. And it that game is like

982
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,880
it's probably the most addictive game I've ever played. It's similar to cookie clicker,

983
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:14,200
but as a better gameplay loop such that like, there's a point where you hit like the curve

984
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,880
where you it takes a while to like increase and expand and do other stuff after you've

985
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:23,240
like bought all the land. And I've hit that. And then I just wiped my game and replayed

986
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:28,960
it up to that point, like three times, because it's just addictive. And oh, my, my famous

987
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:34,720
me a math of a two video, I have no time and I must game is about the addiction to this

988
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:40,520
to this very game. But okay, nonetheless, so it's fun, but it's a total waste of time.

989
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:46,480
It's just a satisfying gameplay loop is the only is the only good thing about it. It

990
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,600
is satisfying. Okay, next voicemail. I'm scared actually to play. I mean, it's not worth

991
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:55,400
your money. I don't play it. It's literally when I when I make fun of people who play

992
01:35:55,400 --> 01:36:00,520
games and games as a complete time sink, this is the epitome of the time sink with like

993
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:05,640
in the same way as cookie clicker or monster clicker, any of those derivative games. Okay,

994
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:13,400
whatever. Anyway, next voicemail, this is from it was an inside job. Okay, go. Hi PCP.

995
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:19,840
I've got a question. As a content creator, what do you think is the right strategy to

996
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:25,360
incorporate? Patreon, should you have it from the beginning and as your audience grows,

997
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:30,480
you grow to, or should you wait till your audience grows and then introduce it once

998
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:36,600
you've kind of developed a following? Thanks. I think what do you think that the best way

999
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:43,440
to do it wait until and this is cynical and I didn't do this, but I wish I had I wish

1000
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:50,080
I had had wait, you know, grow an audience. First, don't have it from the beginning.

1001
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:55,960
Wait until something bad happens to you and then announce that you started a Patreon because

1002
01:36:55,960 --> 01:37:02,320
something bad happened to you. But Ben, what if nothing bad happens then you're fucked.

1003
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:09,760
Pray for tragedy and strike. You can have it and if you just don't talk about it that much and

1004
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:14,200
then bring it up when a bad thing happens to you, then that could also work. Yeah, that's true.

1005
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:21,680
I think in terms of like, like actual strategy, if you're going into like making a career in the

1006
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:29,800
internet stuff, probably on YouTube, I'm assuming, then you want to like gain a following first and

1007
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,840
then announce it when it's you're pretty big. You want to be like at the peak when it's like

1008
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:39,760
you're you've made your best video yet and loads of people love you and then say, hey guys,

1009
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:45,880
if you want to support me because like if you leave the ability for people to support you off

1010
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:52,680
the table, they the yearning grows strong and people who would support you are more likely to

1011
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:59,200
support more. It seems to be from what I've seen from from the the small amount of cases where

1012
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:06,000
this has happened, where a channel has gotten incredibly like good vibes from the from, you

1013
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:11,440
know, their fan base, they got loads of subscribers, they got, you know, pretty solid niche. And then

1014
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:15,120
they announced their Patreon as just sort of like a thing. They don't even need to do much

1015
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:19,200
marketing about it. They just need to mention it. And then those people will jump on it.

1016
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:25,040
It seems seems to work in that in that order. It's kind of a complicated question. I think it

1017
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:31,520
I think there is another thing. If somebody if somebody is very small, they don't have a lot

1018
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,520
of subscribers and have a lot of stuff, and they have a Patreon link and they say at the end of

1019
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:42,960
every video, I habitually will go and click on that link to see how pathetic they are. And if

1020
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:49,120
they're extremely pathetic, I'm going to be like, right. And I don't really need to do that. It's

1021
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:54,240
not like I was planning to pledge to them if they had a lot of money already. It's just sort of a

1022
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:57,600
thing I do. And it's a it's another way people can speak. It's all about marketing. It's all

1023
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:04,160
optics, right? Like that's the entire game. And if you you don't, you if you're small, you don't

1024
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:07,600
want to advertise that you're small. And the worst thing you can do is just be starting out and

1025
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:12,640
having a Patreon with zero dollars, because it just reinforces the fact that you don't have any

1026
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:19,040
cloud. And that's a bad look. So you just don't want you don't because also, if you have like

1027
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:24,160
that one person who's interested, and they click on your Patreon, and there's nothing,

1028
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:28,480
that's the absence of social proof and will disincentivize them from wanting to actually

1029
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:33,280
support you. So sad, but true. What you want to do is you want to wait until you have people

1030
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:38,000
starving to actually support you anyway. Like you should wait till at least you have 1000

1031
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,440
followers subscribers, like a big enough volume that like when you say I have

1032
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:47,280
a Patreon, you'll get like five to 10 people do it immediately. And then the barrier is broken

1033
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:51,200
and it's all up from there. I don't disagree with that. I just like

1034
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:56,720
if we're talking about like small ish amounts of money, I mean by that, by that I just mean

1035
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:01,760
like anything like under, I don't know, like 500 bucks or like under like 1000 dollars. Like I

1036
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:06,640
guess I'm just wondering like who, what's the intention of this? Because like if your intention

1037
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:12,320
is to like make this a job, I would say that like it doesn't matter, because no matter when you make

1038
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:17,040
it, you're not going to make enough to live on until you're like significantly popular.

1039
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:22,800
Like more popular than like me at this very time. You need to be like a big boy marketing. Like if

1040
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:27,360
you're if you're trying to do it as a job and you're not making any money, like you're probably

1041
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:33,280
working a day job anyway. You don't you don't have to make enough to be like a middle class

1042
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:41,200
income for Patreon to be worth having. No, but I mean that's why that's why like the question

1043
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:45,680
it kind of depends, because if you're if you're trying to like live off of it exclusively,

1044
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,640
then I would say the answer is it doesn't really matter, because you have to get

1045
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,640
we're talking about ways to maximize how much money you'll get.

1046
01:40:53,680 --> 01:41:01,680
It's the idea is the idea is that when you're growing during that period, if you have a Patreon

1047
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:08,240
at maximum, you'll have like a few patrons. And later you will have more patrons because

1048
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:14,080
your audience will be bigger. But right, it's sort of like an explosion that happens. If you

1049
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:20,640
start if you open the Patreon, it's like when you're big, you get more than if you had been

1050
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:24,800
gradually accumulating them because of the marketing thing. Yeah, I mean, I suppose.

1051
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:31,360
But then I firmly believe that's true. It's not always like a terrible thing. Like the the

1052
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:37,280
podcast, we're not huge. Right. And we have our Patreon. I mean, people do know us from other

1053
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:44,080
things that definitely plays a part. But we can get like a couple thousand to like 10,000 views

1054
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:49,440
on a video. Yeah, pretty, you know, in that range, it falls to you know, depending on how

1055
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:54,000
hype the chapter is, it goes up and down. Indeed, indeed. But like, that's a significant audience

1056
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,600
that is consistent. You know, it's not like we're getting like 10 to 100 views per video.

1057
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:06,080
We're actually we have like a fan base in that way. So like having the Patreon at that point is

1058
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:10,800
you don't need to be having hundreds of thousands before you start. You just need to have

1059
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:16,000
some sort of audience that is, you know, not like incidental. I think it's not a number.

1060
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,760
I honestly do. Yeah. I mean, because like the problem is like it's all this is all about

1061
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:26,320
social proof. And it's all about like, before you can have it be like, this is worth paying for,

1062
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:30,720
you have to approve it's worth watching. You know, that's the first goal. So like getting a

1063
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:35,440
consistent view count and getting getting people to come back. That's the step one. Then you can

1064
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:40,560
focus on monetizing it. Because you already have people you've already you've proven that it works,

1065
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:48,240
right? Because like monetizing something that isn't proven in this kind of like method where

1066
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:53,600
you're writing on cloud and you're writing on basically like forming a cult, that's what Patreon

1067
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:59,520
is, you make a cult essentially, like there has to be like actual interest there. So if you well,

1068
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:03,360
what if you're making content that's really good? I know some people like this, you're making great

1069
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:08,880
content that you believe in, you just feel undiscovered, but like you're getting very low

1070
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:13,600
views like sub like 50 views, right? You know, that's, we're not talking about quality, we're

1071
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:18,400
talking about social proof. There's, but it's all it all matters. But there are tons of great people

1072
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:22,480
out there who make incredibly good content that nobody cares about. This is about being cared

1073
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:25,840
about. This is not about making something good. They're two separate things. I mean, but we're

1074
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:31,600
just, we're talking about like maximizing and I agree, it could match, but like, we're at such

1075
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:37,360
low percentage at like the very start of the career that I really wonder how like, is that $5

1076
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:41,680
that you might win or lose at the very beginning of your career really makes such a big difference

1077
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:46,320
when we all know what actually makes a difference at the end? Why are you, why are you arguing our

1078
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:53,840
point as though you're disagreeing? Because I think I do? I don't know. The point is to wait

1079
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:59,040
until you get at least a thousand subscribers or something to that effect before you open a Patreon.

1080
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,960
Don't start it from the beginning. Well, wait until you have an audience,

1081
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:07,600
wait until the moment when you can ride a wave of goodwill, whether you release like a really big

1082
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:13,360
project that gets a really good reception that you think will, or like I said, if like, oh, YouTube,

1083
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:17,680
I got YouTube struck, I got demonetized, my videos get demonetized, my last video got taken down

1084
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:22,640
because trolls, trolls reported and it got demonetized or something. I've been victimized,

1085
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:27,200
now's the time, whatever, we don't know. I know that's cynical, but I've seen it work.

1086
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:32,800
You know, something that will give you a wave of like community goodwill

1087
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:38,640
that you can coincide with and I've released a Patreon and that's how you do it. That's how you

1088
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:43,840
maximize your return. I just don't see that much difference between saying I just created my Patreon

1089
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:50,800
in this moment and here is my existing Patreon. Well, no, that's true. I guess. But I guess it's

1090
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:55,920
okay, you can make it whenever you want. Don't push it until you have an audience.

1091
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:03,200
I suppose. If you're putting your Patreon in front of people's eyes and you have like

1092
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:10,400
one patron and it's your mom, then it's like, yeah. It's the same thing like when you go to Amazon

1093
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:17,040
and you see a product that has like no reviews, like you're just put off by even like purchasing

1094
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:20,240
it because like there's no social proof. The social proof there matters because there's a

1095
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:24,880
quantifiable metric that you expect in that format. So if you go to Patreon and you see zero

1096
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:30,480
patrons and this is a small creator, you're just, there's no social proof. So your monkey brain

1097
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:34,800
naturally assumes that this is bad or not worth my money. And even if you were going in there with

1098
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:41,040
the intention of giving a dollar, seeing the zero, seeing nothing makes you feel less inclined to do

1099
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:45,920
so because we're herd creatures and the fact that no one else has done it makes you feel less

1100
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:50,160
likely to do it. It's all about marketing and branding and optics. Do not start until you have

1101
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:56,480
an audience. Period. Yeah. You know, I agree. I realize the only way that I feel differently is

1102
01:45:56,480 --> 01:46:01,520
because because we're talking about such beginning of career situations here, I feel like I just

1103
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:06,640
wouldn't want to encourage people to put off a job to later that they could do today. I have seen

1104
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:13,760
people like too hesitant to start. Like Nightmare Masterclass didn't start a Patreon for a long

1105
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:19,600
time, even though he had like, you know, like his Petscop investigation series was getting a lot of,

1106
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:24,000
but it wasn't until like that, it wasn't until that series, like even though it was popular and

1107
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:29,200
getting viewed and people loved it, he didn't start a Patreon until like well after it was over.

1108
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:32,720
And I think he was just like, oh, I'm not big enough yet. I'm not big enough yet. It's like,

1109
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:35,840
no, he was definitely big enough at that point. He could have been doing it. My fucking boy,

1110
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:41,760
limit breakers, like my current like favorite YouTuber, just like these crazy insane Dark Souls

1111
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:47,520
edits and they're like the best videos on the platform. He like just made a Patreon at like,

1112
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:52,560
he had like 274,000 subscribers. That's way too late. Don't wait that long. I guess he just decided

1113
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:58,080
now is the time to get money, I guess. This will be good to have. Yeah, and it's kind of a shame

1114
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,880
because it's like Dark Souls 3. I mean, I don't know whether he does Sakura videos. He's done

1115
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:09,520
some here and there. Like all of the videos that he's like, the game's really old now. Yeah. Yeah.

1116
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:14,240
I mean, hopefully Elden Ring. I mean, this guy, he's insane. He will succeed at whatever he tries to

1117
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:19,840
do. He's just that good. I love him so much, but it's Elden Ring, right? Yeah. That's right. That's

1118
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:23,920
right. Did you hear that George RR Martin is writing for it? Yeah. He's doing all the work.

1119
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,320
Okay. I don't know if I got, okay, whatever. My friend told me that and it blew my fucking mind.

1120
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:33,200
It is interesting. It's gonna be pretty legit, hopefully. Yeah, that's really cool. We'll have

1121
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:38,560
to see. We'll have to see. Okay. I hope there's dialogue that I like. There's always been dialogue

1122
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:44,400
I like. Okay. Next voicemail. Get ready for this because this is the Tom Oliver secret agenda.

1123
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:48,800
Looking forward to hearing that. All right. Here we go. Man, I kind of just wanted to

1124
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:56,160
fuck Western society and the ass bitch. That's it. That's it. Wait, and the what bitch? I think he said

1125
01:47:56,160 --> 01:48:04,160
I wanted to fuck Western society in the ass bitch. I believe was the full phrase there. Tom, what do

1126
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:11,200
you have to say? Okay. Sounds like something I can kill a first Friday night doing. Let's make it

1127
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:20,480
happen. Western society, call in with your response, please. Yeah, let us know. Oh, speaking of

1128
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:26,880
responses. Okay, good news, guys. As we requested, as a response to the grammar, was it the grammar

1129
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:33,280
Nazi, the grammar fascist, grammar Antifa is calling in with response. So let's see what grammar

1130
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:38,880
Antifa has to say in rebuttal. Okay, go. Hello, it's me, grammar Antifa. I buy books about slaves so

1131
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:43,200
I can burn them and set history free. I'm calling in to address the political enemy, the grammar

1132
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:47,600
fascist, who appeared in last week's episode. What grammar fascism fails to understand about

1133
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,520
communication is that it is a dance. An improvisational duet, the code's meaning through

1134
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:56,080
language. Unlike real dance, however, if there is not an understanding, both parties are at fault.

1135
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,840
You take an idea, you encode that idea, the second party receives the coded language and then

1136
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:04,080
decrypts it back into an idea. If the second party's idea is too different from the intent,

1137
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:08,400
both the encryptor and the decryptor failed in communication. The encryptor did not make their

1138
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:12,080
message simple and clear enough and the decryptor failed to extrapolate true meaning due to

1139
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:16,480
ignorance. Those who are good at communication are good at both standardized rule sets need not

1140
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:20,880
apply. Fact of the matter is that if true meaning is found to communication was a success. The sheer

1141
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,000
fact they were able to tell they had fucked up means that there was no miscommunication about

1142
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,920
what they were saying. English is controlled by the people and how they use it naturally evolves

1143
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:32,480
over time. Rule set doesn't fucking matter. Address miscommunications directly. Instead of

1144
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:36,800
being caught up in pedantic semantics, I imagine plague you on a daily basis. I can only assume

1145
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:41,040
you're getting pissy with your far more chad-minded friends talking casually in a discord or some

1146
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:45,440
shit. They're writing messages exclusively for the friend group and no one on the outside.

1147
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:49,520
Shut the fuck up, piss boy. The dictionary is a guideline. Your high school English teacher

1148
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:53,680
is a hack and the soy-guzzling skinhead language prescriptivist just got yeeted on by the

1149
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:58,480
Zoomer cacophony that is language descriptivism. Vote single person pronoun they as word of the

1150
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:02,960
year, hashtag dabble my haters, and dating white is not all right. Grammar Antifa signing out.

1151
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:12,720
Thank you, Grammar Antifa. Well, I love this person, and I would say that they're completely

1152
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:21,840
right. You mispronounced cacophony, so every point you made is in there. I'm sorry. I can't

1153
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:26,560
understand what you mean because you mispronounced cacophony. You failed to your half of the dance,

1154
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:31,040
Grammar Antifa. How did they pronounce cacophony? They said cacophony. They said caca- fucking

1155
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:35,840
digi-style cacophony. Was that supposed to be a digi-reference, or was that legit fuck up? No,

1156
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:40,480
no, no. That's a super bunny hop reference. Oh, yeah, that's right. Actually, do you think that was

1157
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:45,920
actually a reference, like, deliberate? No, no. I kind of think so, but I don't know. I mean,

1158
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:53,200
like, super bunny hop may said cacophony in one of his videos, like, straight face, he didn't

1159
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:57,520
realize, and then he got so much shit for it that every time there's a word that he could

1160
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:02,000
potentially mispronounce, he does, he has a robot say it, and that's like a running thing in his

1161
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:08,640
videos now. That's a good bit though. I like, I like, no, this, do you guys agree with this? I

1162
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:14,320
agree with this. It is a failure of communication. I mean, I think I would say that the burden is

1163
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:18,400
probably more on the person speaking to make their message understood. I don't know if I'd say the

1164
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:25,040
blame is 50-50. I think that like, the message here is correct, but I think all the rules and

1165
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:32,880
structures are serving to make the speaker and the recipient's job easier by having a standardized

1166
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,200
set of rules that you stick to, so you don't have to spend as much time encrypting or decrypting

1167
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:41,680
the message. That's the whole point of grammar rules in the first place. You're right. I think it's

1168
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:49,120
an interesting point that the fact that you can comment on the, on the quote-unquote mistake

1169
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:54,880
means that there was no failure, that you do know what they meant. I think that's an interesting

1170
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:00,080
idea to point out. It's probably true to some extent. Like the fact that you can be like,

1171
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:08,560
you know, obviously you meant T-H-E-Y, apostrophe-R-E means you do know what they meant.

1172
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:16,480
So fuck, yeah, that's a good point. But here's the bad news though. In anticipation of Antifa

1173
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:23,120
calling in, we have another voicemail from this person is known as grammar, a white

1174
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:29,040
identitarian with nationalist traits. Let's, let's see what this individual has to say.

1175
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:36,000
All right, go. All right, Nate said someone should send in a bash the grammar bash. However,

1176
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:44,320
I am here in having anticipated that to respond to the bash the grammar bash with my rehash the

1177
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:51,360
grammar bash. Listen, it's just really annoying when people put like use the wrong form of your

1178
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:58,320
or there. It's just annoying. We don't need to justify it. It just puts like two seconds in

1179
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:05,840
effort and just rub your fucking brains together and figure it out. Just, just don't be a fucking

1180
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:16,080
war on phones. As always, a stellar point from the far right. That's pretty convincing. Yeah.

1181
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:22,640
He used, he used simple vernacular and I understood his message. So, you know, he's got a point.

1182
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:27,280
I think he succeeded at communicating better than grammar and use too many big words.

1183
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:33,200
It scares me and intimidates me. I like that. I do like big words. I feel smart when I understand

1184
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:43,440
them like cacophony. The debate rages on. I may I'm a grammar centrist. Damn, that's a big brain

1185
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:50,320
position. I'm a grandma. All right, next one. We've got another update from a not even cluster

1186
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:56,000
punk can save me now. Let's let's check in with him. Go. Shit. Shit. I've been on the run for the

1187
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,080
last seven days straight. There's not much time. I didn't have time to leave you guys a warning

1188
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:04,800
last week. The PC police were hacking me when I leaked your search histories. So now they have

1189
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:10,240
all your locations. There's no time before they make a move. They're going to be. Wait, no. No, no,

1190
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:15,840
no, I'm not going back. You'll never take me alive. No, no, no.

1191
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:25,280
Is this thing on? Well, it is. Welcome, PCP members. This is the PC police.

1192
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:30,480
I am one of the four elite generals in charge of taking down your operation.

1193
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:38,480
Our first target will be the man we've deduced to most likely be the leader best guy ever.

1194
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,480
No, it's digi. It's digi.

1195
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:45,120
This is Dachshund.

1196
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:07,280
Early intervention can make a lifetime of difference. Learn the signs at autismspeaks.org.

1197
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:14,800
Next time, we'll be talking about Ghost in the Shell standalone complex, the best anime ever.

1198
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:26,080
How embarrassing. How did we get here? What a journey.

1199
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,800
It just kept going. Maybe that was the true attack by the PC police.

1200
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:37,840
Yeah, me too. I think that was the true attack by the PC police to shame me for my

1201
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:44,800
continued delays on certain projects. That was their assault. I don't want them after me. I'm

1202
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:50,640
glad they think you're the leader. That had about as much effect as a Kersjehame Ha on my

1203
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:58,080
soul over here. I'll try to recover. There's only one Polish guy. Once they got you either done,

1204
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:04,400
they don't need to go after anyone else. Any other guys? Don't worry about it. Yes.

1205
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:08,080
Although Poland and Lithuania. It's all his fault.

1206
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:14,240
All right. Next one, we've got PC Pi is calling in.

1207
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:25,600
What does PCP stand for? Well, I'll tell you. It stands for professional

1208
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:32,000
subit peruiners because you ruined my fucking bit. All right, let's try this again.

1209
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:42,720
Everybody come to a consensus and pick a whole number between one and 244. Thanks.

1210
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:47,920
Is there any way we can fuck him over again? Like a whole number?

1211
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:53,440
Is a fraction a whole number? Is a fraction a whole number?

1212
01:56:54,240 --> 01:57:02,000
How about 144? Is he still like 144? Sure. Yeah, that was the runner up last time.

1213
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,360
That was the runner up. Mage said 66, but that's two Star Wars referencing for me.

1214
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:14,640
Okay. Gib, Tom, what do you like? 144. I'm trying to think of

1215
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:22,640
relevant numbers that are cool in between 0 and 244. I don't think there is one. I think all

1216
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:34,640
the numbers between 0 and 244 are lame. In between 244. What about 151 in homage for the original?

1217
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:41,840
Wait, wait, wait. 119, 119. 119. That's fine. That's 9-11 in UK dates.

1218
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:49,280
Are we in agreement? 119, 119. Good. Sure. That's fine. All right, done. There it is.

1219
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:54,720
There's your answer. 119, PC Pie, or whatever you were called last time. There's your answer.

1220
01:57:54,720 --> 01:58:01,920
Okay, good. Moving on, we got... We don't know. I don't know. He's going to add 10 to it,

1221
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:05,200
and then he's going to divide it by three, and then he's going to say fuck you.

1222
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:10,000
Is this your number? And we'll say how do you get... Wow, you got the same number back after

1223
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:17,200
an operation designed to do that. Fascinating. Well, tell us, I can't wait to be dazzled.

1224
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:21,840
But in the meantime, calling in is The Spirit of Halloween, which is perfect timing,

1225
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,560
because we could use some of that. All right, let's hear you have to say. Go.

1226
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,520
Go back to Grinch Night.

1227
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:32,800
October's the season where all breathings emerge just to bring joy and horror to people's hearts.

1228
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:38,320
I'm the spirit of Halloween. I encourage you to go out and complete this Halloween bucket list.

1229
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:44,080
Kara Pumpkin, Data Witch, Give Pumpkin Spice Latte, Performance Seance,

1230
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:50,000
Watch Soulweeder, Do Graffiti, Read Edgar Allan Poe, Kill a Man, Attend Costume Party,

1231
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,040
Wear a Blackface, Go Trick or Treating, and Eat Lots of Candy. I've been the spirit of Halloween.

1232
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,240
There you go, everybody. Really? Really, that made the cut?

1233
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:02,480
It's your full bucket list. It wasn't great, but it was seasonal.

1234
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:04,880
I told you to be picky this week.

1235
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:09,040
It was seasonal. I loved the season. It was August in Halloween.

1236
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,280
The only season here is the spice latte.

1237
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:16,080
We do not endorse any of the views of the spirit of Halloween.

1238
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,120
No, definitely not.

1239
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:19,200
So just clarifying. Just clarifying that.

1240
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:19,840
Quite the opposite.

1241
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,480
This shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that Halloween season.

1242
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:25,840
Yeah, thanks for proving my point, Mr. Spirit, sir.

1243
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:30,880
This one, okay, this one's short. I can't remember what this is. It's a PC promise.

1244
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:33,840
Oh, wait, I think I remember. Okay, it's a PC promise play.

1245
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:38,240
Listen here, you fox. Vote Andrew Yang.

1246
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:42,400
I will pledge 100 a month to your fucking Patreon.

1247
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:43,840
Thank you.

1248
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:44,160
Wait.

1249
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:48,480
Well, okay, so right there. Ben, you are already possibly going to vote for Yang.

1250
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:48,560
No.

1251
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:54,160
If you just do that, I think he'll just give us $100 on the Patreon.

1252
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,960
I'll vote for Andrew Yang.

1253
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:01,120
You can give $100 to my Patreon, because I'll actually do it.

1254
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Here's all vote for Yang.

1255
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,800
Is this illegal, by the way? Is it illegal to sell your vote?

1256
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:09,440
I'm pretty sure it's illegal to sell your vote, but I'll do it.

1257
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,040
But let's do it anyway.

1258
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:17,040
I would do it if I thought I would actually get $100 or even my proportional fraction of $100.

1259
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:22,480
This is just a coincidental exclusive exchange.

1260
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:25,200
It has nothing to do with paying for the vote.

1261
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:26,480
Right, totally unrelated.

1262
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:30,320
Here's the thing. Here's the thing about buying votes.

1263
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:34,000
When you're in the booth, nobody can know what you're doing.

1264
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,520
So you could take the money and just not vote the way they want you to.

1265
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:37,760
Yeah.

1266
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:40,000
I guess they'll break your legs if they lose or something.

1267
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:40,080
Maybe.

1268
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:40,800
If they lose.

1269
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,920
Yeah, well, this guy listens to the PCP.

1270
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,280
I don't think there's going to be a problem.

1271
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:45,600
Damn.

1272
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,760
He sounds like he's 90 pounds soaking wet, if you know what I'm saying.

1273
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,080
If I thought that I stood to gain, I don't know,

1274
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:54,320
whatever fraction of that $100 would end up going to be.

1275
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:54,960
10 bucks, maybe.

1276
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:55,520
I don't know.

1277
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,200
Yeah, 10 or 20 or whatever.

1278
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:00,080
If I thought I would do it, I would sell my vote.

1279
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:02,400
Right, because my vote is individually weak.

1280
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,320
It's not yet.

1281
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:07,520
But I don't think I'll get it.

1282
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:09,280
I'm calling this bluff.

1283
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:09,920
No.

1284
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:10,560
You won't do it.

1285
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:10,800
Don't say that.

1286
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,680
It's a scam.

1287
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,560
It's a sham.

1288
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,400
And I'm a Bernie guy.

1289
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,000
It's a scam.

1290
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:16,720
It's a sham.

1291
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:17,760
Vote Bernie.

1292
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:19,120
Vote Bernie, where yang?

1293
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:20,800
That's my slogan.

1294
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:21,840
Are you at all...

1295
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,440
Bernie just had like a heart attack or something.

1296
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,800
Is he doing okay?

1297
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,760
He had an operation.

1298
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,880
He had a heart operation.

1299
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:29,040
He's doing okay.

1300
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,640
His poll number is not so much.

1301
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,120
Well, I guess I'm not surprised.

1302
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,000
Warren's the leader.

1303
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,040
She's the front runner.

1304
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,000
I hear us with one.

1305
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:39,600
Shut up, Mage.

1306
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,720
Shut the fuck up.

1307
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:41,760
No, you should have.

1308
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,520
I mean, Mage has nothing,

1309
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:45,360
has no horse in this race, literally.

1310
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:46,640
She's not even American.

1311
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:48,640
So, you know, what can you say?

1312
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:49,680
Well, neither am I.

1313
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:50,000
I don't know.

1314
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:50,960
I mean, I heard...

1315
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:53,040
It's not that I'm just falling asleep.

1316
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,000
Not because of you guys.

1317
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,280
I told, like, at the beginning,

1318
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,520
I'm just, like, extremely tired right now.

1319
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:59,040
That is a personal problem, Mage.

1320
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,800
We feel the same time every week,

1321
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,480
so we bear no responsibility.

1322
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:03,120
I know.

1323
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:03,840
Okay, we'll go.

1324
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:07,840
I set my sleep schedule just for you guys.

1325
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:08,880
I appreciate that.

1326
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,360
I heard that Bernie's heart trouble

1327
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:14,800
was not, like, an immediate life-threatening thing

1328
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:15,360
or anything.

1329
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:18,640
It's not like his heart's gonna stop anytime sooner.

1330
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:19,840
I mean, he is old.

1331
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:20,560
Well, in the great scheme of things.

1332
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:21,840
I'm sure I know he could die.

1333
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:22,720
Like, this is...

1334
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,240
Obviously, this is always a possibility.

1335
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:25,840
Anyone can die.

1336
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:26,480
Yeah.

1337
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:26,720
But...

1338
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:27,280
Yeah, Ben.

1339
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:27,840
Makes me mad.

1340
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,680
Why is he, like, I have fucking bad experience on that.

1341
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:31,120
He's still on the campaign trail.

1342
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:33,280
Pretty sure he's still doing all this shit,

1343
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,240
so that's great.

1344
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:35,120
Okay, great.

1345
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:35,440
Great.

1346
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:37,920
Thanks for ruining our country, uh, everyone.

1347
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:39,920
All right.

1348
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:41,360
Blame Bernie for not having...

1349
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,600
Oh, remember the senator from Metal Gear Rising?

1350
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:44,720
How he had that fucking Super Armistall...

1351
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:45,280
Yeah, the original...

1352
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:46,080
The original Magamon.

1353
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:47,120
...Nanomachines?

1354
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:48,720
Now, that's what Bernie should do.

1355
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:50,560
He should just pull a senator Armstrong,

1356
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:52,960
and start the war economy up,

1357
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,480
because God knows we could use it.

1358
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:55,440
All right, let's move on.

1359
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:56,880
He doesn't even like that guy.

1360
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,520
Oh, that's why he's going to lose,

1361
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,520
because he's not even utilizing the war economy

1362
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:02,320
to its full extent.

1363
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,280
Put some brains in vets.

1364
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:06,640
I always felt a senator Armstrong was like Milhouse.

1365
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:09,120
You know, Milhouse...

1366
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:11,120
In that one episode where they go to the future,

1367
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:14,240
Milhouse was canonically jacked as shit,

1368
02:03:14,240 --> 02:03:16,080
and was super ripped, and...

1369
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,200
Except his damn ankles,

1370
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:19,440
because that's the hardest place to add mass, damn it.

1371
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,360
And how dare you judge him for it?

1372
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,480
That happened in that episode.

1373
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:24,480
All right, next, next voicemail.

1374
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:26,560
Is that the one where Lisa becomes president?

1375
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:29,040
No, I don't think so.

1376
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,640
She's going to get married in this one,

1377
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:32,000
and then did it at the end?

1378
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:32,880
Is that the one with Hugh?

1379
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:33,520
Like a monkey's paw.

1380
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:38,000
Yeah, like her British fiancé or something from school.

1381
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:38,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1382
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:41,040
Do you know that according to Christine Weston Chandler,

1383
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,120
Lisa Simpson will be president in 2020?

1384
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:44,320
I heard about that.

1385
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:44,640
I do.

1386
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:46,400
And so maybe Bernie is going to die,

1387
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:49,520
but Lisa's going to show up with an equally progressive agenda.

1388
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:51,440
Okay, just point of order, though.

1389
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,560
Lisa is eight years old canonically,

1390
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:56,560
which is under the age of, you know...

1391
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:56,960
Not in...

1392
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,680
Look, ask Chris.

1393
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:00,160
Like, I don't think so.

1394
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,040
All right, all right.

1395
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:01,760
Fair enough.

1396
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:02,080
Okay.

1397
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:03,840
We got another one.

1398
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:06,320
Okay, a little baby one from Timmy Sorris.

1399
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,680
Let's see what this is about.

1400
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:09,280
She's been there for like 20 years now.

1401
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:09,680
Well, yeah.

1402
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:10,880
Maybe he's incorporating the like.

1403
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:14,160
Yeah, but in, you know, 1998...

1404
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,280
97 or whatever it is.

1405
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,720
When the episode aired,

1406
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:21,120
she would have been, you know, 30, whatever, in 2020.

1407
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:21,920
Now that...

1408
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,920
But now that it is 2020,

1409
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,760
she's still eight, but...

1410
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,200
Perhaps, perhaps like...

1411
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,920
But not in that one episode.

1412
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:32,080
Maybe when the dimensional merge happens,

1413
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:35,040
all timelines will like merge into a single streamline,

1414
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:36,960
like single time progression.

1415
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:40,400
So like, Lisa will age up to a proper age in our dimension.

1416
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:43,280
Do you know, do you remember like how...

1417
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,440
I think there was a YouTuber who did a Simpsons lore thing.

1418
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,240
Was it the real Jim?

1419
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,040
He like...

1420
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:50,800
I can't remember.

1421
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:51,920
I love the real Jim.

1422
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:52,560
There was a video.

1423
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:55,200
There's a video where he explains like,

1424
02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:00,400
or he shows that like a Homer and Marge's relationship,

1425
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,360
you know, back when they were kids.

1426
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:05,840
It used to be in the 80s or the 70s.

1427
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:06,640
Then it was the 80s.

1428
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:07,600
It was the 90s.

1429
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:08,160
Yeah.

1430
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:11,680
Soon they'll be having like a millennial childhood upbringing.

1431
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:12,560
Oh, right.

1432
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:13,120
He had...

1433
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:13,680
It's true.

1434
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:15,120
Yeah, that's the real Jim's.

1435
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:15,600
He did...

1436
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:17,280
He does Simpsons histories where he talks,

1437
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,520
looks at like the timelines, past, present, and future.

1438
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:20,320
He just released...

1439
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:22,080
Well, a couple weeks ago, he released...

1440
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:23,440
He had a series of like,

1441
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:24,880
who really shot Mr. Burns?

1442
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:27,520
And he just released like the final piece of it.

1443
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,400
And he lays out five different theories for like,

1444
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:33,360
like the canonical explanation is that Maggie shot Mr. Burns?

1445
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:33,520
Right.

1446
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:34,480
But he makes...

1447
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:37,760
He actually makes like four different compelling...

1448
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:41,760
No, five different compelling cases for why actually that's a fake out.

1449
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,680
No, actually Bart shot Mr. Burns.

1450
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:45,360
No, actually Lisa shot Mr. Burns.

1451
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:46,800
No, actually Homer shot Mr. Burns.

1452
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:47,920
What's this guy's name again, Ben?

1453
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:48,800
The real Jim's.

1454
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:49,760
The real...

1455
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:52,000
I'm watching that shit because I fucking love that episode.

1456
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:55,920
The only good Simpsons YouTuber.

1457
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:56,400
Period.

1458
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:58,160
They all...

1459
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,360
He's the only one.

1460
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,400
He's the only one.

1461
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,520
That's great.

1462
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:03,920
I just noticed that it says it's Simpsons mysteries,

1463
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:06,080
who really shot Mr. Burns finale.

1464
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,760
Was this like a series of videos?

1465
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:08,960
Well, yeah, he did five episodes,

1466
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:11,440
like one episode is Bart, one episode is Grandpa,

1467
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:12,960
and so on and so forth.

1468
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:13,200
It's...

1469
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,280
Each one is a different theory.

1470
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,120
Well, I gotta fucking check this shit out.

1471
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:18,080
Those are really good.

1472
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:19,920
Post a link of that.

1473
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,360
Here, I've got the video.

1474
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:22,080
This is the finale.

1475
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:23,600
So don't watch this one first, I guess.

1476
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:25,040
Maybe I'll find the updated one.

1477
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:26,320
Okay, boom.

1478
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:27,440
In the audio links, there you go.

1479
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:29,120
And I'm gonna go watch more.

1480
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,000
I'm gonna watch these after we run here.

1481
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:30,880
Do you like the Simpsons?

1482
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:33,040
And I love the Simpsons.

1483
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:35,040
I would encourage anyone to check out the real...

1484
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:37,920
I think he's got like 40k followers,

1485
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,320
or like 30k subscribers.

1486
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:41,600
He's got 50k, it looks like.

1487
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:43,040
Oh, okay, he's growing, that's good.

1488
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:43,600
There you go.

1489
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:45,200
I mean, it's such a niche market,

1490
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:47,040
I can't see him getting that much bigger than that,

1491
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:47,920
unfortunately.

1492
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,080
People love their big video,

1493
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,080
analyzing one possibly beloved piece of media

1494
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:55,520
in thorough detail,

1495
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:58,080
and possibly teaching us about life

1496
02:06:58,080 --> 02:07:01,360
and lessons beyond the mere panels of the artistry.

1497
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:03,040
I don't know, whatever.

1498
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:07,680
Okay, anyway, voicemail, Timisaurus, go right now.

1499
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:08,800
Son of George Soros?

1500
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,440
I feel like I'm the only fucking one

1501
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:15,040
who fucked PCP through the YouTube search bar

1502
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:18,960
by typing in meme podcast.

1503
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:21,440
That's it.

1504
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,640
That's the whole message.

1505
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:25,440
We were talking about how people found us last time.

1506
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,240
Is, man, could that be true?

1507
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:29,440
Is that possible?

1508
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:31,200
Let me try it right now, meme.

1509
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:32,240
Oh, that's a great idea.

1510
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:32,960
My podcast.

1511
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:36,080
I want to try it too.

1512
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:39,440
Let me see how far down I have to scroll to find...

1513
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:41,600
I mean, I see...

1514
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,440
Oh, wait, I'm logged in as the PCP.

1515
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:44,720
It's lots of...

1516
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:46,640
It's lots of H3H3.

1517
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:52,560
What, who are you logging in?

1518
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:53,520
Okay, to be fair...

1519
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:54,480
I logged in as myself.

1520
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:56,480
To be fair, it might not have been directly

1521
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:57,520
from the search result.

1522
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:58,560
You could have clicked on something

1523
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,000
and, like, in the related, eventually,

1524
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
it found the PCP, but it started...

1525
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,680
Yeah, I didn't know if I exactly had one.

1526
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:06,320
We must have an episode that has meme in the title,

1527
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:06,960
so I'm assuming that you found...

1528
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,240
Memes that need to die.

1529
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:08,880
It's right here.

1530
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:08,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1531
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,960
The Professor's Podcast, episode 16.

1532
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:13,120
Wait, you got it on a search?

1533
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:15,600
Yeah, it's way down, but there it is.

1534
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:16,480
Memes that need to die.

1535
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:18,080
That could be it.

1536
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:19,600
That could be the avenue right there.

1537
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:21,680
Oh, fuck, what's the thumbnail on that again?

1538
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:25,440
It's a bunch of our icons and the old logo,

1539
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,360
and it just says in green text,

1540
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,920
PCP, episode 16, Memes that need to die.

1541
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,480
Oh, yeah, it just says, like, the green text thing.

1542
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:36,080
I can't find it, but I'm sure you're not lying.

1543
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:36,800
Check the playlist.

1544
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:38,000
It's episode 16.

1545
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,680
No, no, no, I mean on the search.

1546
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:41,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

1547
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:41,840
Well, there you go.

1548
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:42,800
There's one avenue.

1549
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:45,360
Okay, we got two more voicemails.

1550
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:46,400
Let's burn through them.

1551
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:47,680
Okay, here we go.

1552
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:52,080
This is Poo's Adventures in Communist Hell, episode one.

1553
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:53,360
Episode one.

1554
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:55,200
Let's see what Poo has in store for us.

1555
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:56,480
Take it away.

1556
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:59,360
Hello, it's now time for another one

1557
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:01,680
of Poo's Adventures in Communist Hell.

1558
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:03,040
Please enjoy.

1559
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:04,160
Yay.

1560
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:06,560
I am so excited.

1561
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:10,400
There it is.

1562
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:13,600
Feels good.

1563
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,680
My dad's home.

1564
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:16,080
Yeah.

1565
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:20,960
Peglet, I've got a rumble in my tumble.

1566
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:25,440
Do you want to join me for a sport of honey?

1567
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:32,080
Dear Poo, we don't have any honey.

1568
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:33,120
You ate it all.

1569
02:09:34,640 --> 02:09:38,080
Hi, Peglet, I knew.

1570
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:41,440
But what if we went looking for some honey?

1571
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:46,960
Poo, I'm a little tender as a bitch.

1572
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,520
I'm too scared to go on a adventure

1573
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,720
to find some honey.

1574
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,520
Peglet, I'm going to find some honey.

1575
02:09:56,240 --> 02:09:58,800
And I bet to see you right behind me.

1576
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:00,480
What else?

1577
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:08,560
Dear, dear, I just hope we don't run into that

1578
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,480
Christopher Robin boy again.

1579
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:14,640
Thank you.

1580
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:17,760
And please look forward to the next episode.

1581
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:18,240
Goodbye.

1582
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:21,120
Yeah.

1583
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:21,840
I loved it.

1584
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:23,840
Guys, I cracked the code.

1585
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:25,840
Memes podcast.

1586
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,960
Memes plural.

1587
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:28,720
Third one down is our podcast.

1588
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:29,920
Oh, OK.

1589
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:30,160
OK.

1590
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:32,080
When you do memes podcast.

1591
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:32,400
E.

1592
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:34,400
I did.

1593
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:35,520
I did a venture.

1594
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:36,160
Yeah, OK.

1595
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:38,560
It's for me, it's like the eighth one down or ninth.

1596
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:40,720
But yeah, I did find it on the unjust meme.

1597
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:41,440
It was down.

1598
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:42,800
I had scrolled past it.

1599
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,640
It's down maybe like 20 or so.

1600
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:46,320
I did a good job.

1601
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:47,600
Good work team.

1602
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:50,880
More importantly, Poo, tell me more.

1603
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,320
That wasn't communist enough.

1604
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:54,560
I think he's warming up to it.

1605
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,120
Now, is it communist because of the honey shortage?

1606
02:10:57,120 --> 02:10:59,840
Perhaps that's where the honey shortage is exactly.

1607
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:02,640
They have to go foraging because the supply lines have failed.

1608
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:03,360
I don't know.

1609
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,120
The honey lines have dried up.

1610
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:05,840
There's no more.

1611
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:06,960
I don't know.

1612
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:09,520
I remind me.

1613
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:11,120
I saw Christopher Robin.

1614
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:12,720
Just reminds me of my own depiction.

1615
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:14,480
And the boy, the human.

1616
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:17,680
My own depiction of something that you might call communist hell

1617
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:20,240
in the pages of my nightstar, phantom horn,

1618
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:23,520
strawberry milk, New Los Angeles City, and less war comic.

1619
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,880
Indeed, indeed.

1620
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:26,080
And their musical number.

1621
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:28,560
Neath the city.

1622
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:29,440
Oh, yeah.

1623
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:30,720
Neath the city.

1624
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:31,520
Neath the city.

1625
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:36,720
Slime left us wanting.

1626
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,720
So now we're haunting the bourgeoisie.

1627
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:47,200
I was delighted to see that wisely strawberry milk and phantom horn

1628
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:50,800
knew better than to accept the temptress that is the human nature

1629
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,120
defying evil system that is communism.

1630
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:59,280
No, no, they are firmly entrenched in neoliberalist capitalism.

1631
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:04,160
They are in that mind cage for life.

1632
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:06,800
Well, there's always hope for tomorrow.

1633
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,400
So things you learn in a question.

1634
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:10,560
Well, OK.

1635
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:11,520
Pooh, keep us updated.

1636
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:14,480
Looking forward to episode two, Piglet Godspeed.

1637
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:14,720
OK.

1638
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,080
We've got one last one.

1639
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:16,720
This is brief.

1640
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:22,080
This is from a little guy named One Second Voicemail.

1641
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:23,360
Let's see.

1642
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:23,760
You were yesterday.

1643
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:24,960
Merciful.

1644
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:25,360
All right.

1645
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:26,800
See you in the next one, PCP.

1646
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:27,200
Yeah.

1647
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:28,240
And with that, that's it.

1648
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:28,720
Thank you, everyone.

1649
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:31,360
That's been another episode of The Proof.

1650
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,880
Crastinators podcast.

1651
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:37,920
In my head, I was imagining like the firstest dab caught on film.

1652
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:39,040
Yes.

1653
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:41,440
All right.

1654
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:42,000
You're done.

1655
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,280
Patreon.com.

1656
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:45,760
You think that was in response to what we were talking about

1657
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:48,080
before about the One Second YouTube video?

1658
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:50,240
I think it was.

1659
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:51,520
I think it was inspired by that.

1660
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:52,240
That's my guess.

1661
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:53,280
That's my guess.

1662
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:54,160
And it should be done.

1663
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:55,760
Someone should still get out there and do it.

1664
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:58,400
Maybe next time he'll give us another One Second Voicemail

1665
02:12:58,400 --> 02:12:59,600
episode two.

1666
02:12:59,600 --> 02:12:59,840
All right.

1667
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:00,240
Thanks, guys.

1668
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:01,120
See you next time.

1669
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:01,920
We can only hope.

1670
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:03,680
All right.

Do you want to talk about it?

1682
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:16,160
It'll be up by the time this goes up, right?

1683
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,440
Well, the last one's already up.

1684
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:20,320
The next one, no.

1685
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:21,360
It's only the 13th.

1686
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:22,800
We don't put it out till the first.

1687
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,960
So we might film it before then.

1688
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:26,160
But no, we're not even...

1689
02:13:26,160 --> 02:13:28,640
We're actually filming it after this episode goes up.

1690
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:30,320
So no, we'll keep them waiting.

1691
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:31,040
We'll keep them waiting.

1692
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,120
We have something more in the oven right now, cooking.

1693
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:36,960
And it'll be a good time.

1694
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:37,760
It will be a good time.

1695
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:39,040
It will be a good time.

1696
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:40,160
Something to look forward to, actually.

1697
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:42,080
I think people will be excited about it.

1698
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:44,400
And yeah, that's it.

1699
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:47,440
So also follow us at tpcrastinators on Twitter.

1700
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,520
And that's all there is to it.

1701
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:49,920
Okay.

1702
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:51,040
See you next week, everybody.

1703
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:52,080
Thanks for being here.

1704
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:53,920
Another episode in the can.

1705
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:54,720
See you then.

1706
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:55,120
Bye.

1707
02:13:55,120 --> 02:13:55,760
Bye, Dustin.

1708
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,080
Bye.

1709
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:58,160
Good night, everybody.
