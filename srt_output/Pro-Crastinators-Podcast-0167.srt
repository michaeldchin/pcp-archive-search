00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
Hello everyone, and welcome back to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's me, BGE. And what's

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,040
going on today? We've got Ben Saint around here.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,080
Mmmhmm. That's right. It's Monday. I sure hate him.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,280
It's Sunday, but you'll hear this on Friday. But that's okay. We've got Digibro.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,120
This is a real low-T intro right now.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,960
Yeah, you're right. I'm on Hormone Blockers. What can I do?

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,520
I'm making a transition in my life, if you know what I'm saying. And we've got Munchy

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,280
and Hippocrit as one horrible hydra.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,880
Poke. You poked me.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,200
Oh, check out this visual joke. Isn't this funny what I'm doing with my hands right now?

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, dude. Oh, dude, check out this sign language I'm doing right now. Read this out loud.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It says I'm a big fan.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,080
Oh, no. They want to be able to bear for it. That's not the case. The only Hippocrit

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,480
would see me because he's in my house. And by my house, I'm in his house. All the houses

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,360
are my domain once I get my claws into them.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:12,000
I hope the adoption papers go through soon. And also the disowning of Digibb happens soon

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,280
in his family. And then you are in England.

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,680
What you're hearing right now is actually a lie, by the way, because when you're hearing

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,200
this, this will no longer be the case. So this is a snapshot of a bygone era that you're

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,360
hearing right now, where I'm sitting inside of Hippo's house right now.

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,120
What's like looking at the sun? You only see the sun from seven, eight minutes ago because

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,000
of the speed of light. It's when you look at the cosmos, you see the universe, not as

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,720
it is, but as it was many light years ago.

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,240
Are you fine right now? You're slurring your words. You didn't know what discord was. You

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,160
didn't know how audio connections worked. You didn't know how voices or speech worked.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,400
And you're trying to learn how they are on the fly right now recording a podcast. It's

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,600
like you handed like an extra treasure, like, hey, make some audio content, make some like

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,440
40 hour audio book right now, and you're handing it to a fucking alien who doesn't even know

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,680
what a voice box is. This is what listening to Ben speak and think is like.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,360
You know what I'm excited for? I'm very excited to hand oblivion the Gibb Munchie audio track

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,640
and have him untangle them and separate them manually into two separate audio tracks so

32
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:28,360
that he can sync up the flashing independently. Oh, I forgot about the flashing put them in

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,320
one avatar together. That'll be fine. No, it'll be fine. Oh, you just one slightly larger

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:43,080
square. Yeah, right square like Steven Universe Fusion. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Oh, cut diagonal

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,040
like Gibb Munchie Gump Gump. The rest of this podcast, they are, we shall not think of them

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,560
as separate people, but as one entity. Exactly. We are the same. We have the same opinions.

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,080
One. I really love that race that I'm thinking of right now that you can also understand the

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:07,040
one I'm referring to because you have my same brain. Yes, the white. What's in it? Oh, no.

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,960
I propose Muncho Crit. Muncho Crit. Yeah, that's good. That's good. We've just been the whole

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,000
podcast talking about things that have happened to us. So you guys are just like peripherals.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,240
Oh, I gotta tell you, I'm most interested. I would love to hear what you guys have been

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,040
up to. I think you had like a meetup going on. I haven't followed it closely because

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,040
I'm too important, but I would love to hear it. Before we jump straight into them, we

44
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,400
should do at least one little topic. So here's what I thought of right before the podcast.

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,440
How do you shit? I want to know how everybody shits. You know, fascinatingly, there was

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,120
a voicemail asking this very question that did not make the cut, but I guess he's getting

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,240
his wish nonetheless. Because I don't know about you guys, but the way I shit has evolved

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,800
a lot over the years. Let's do our quick poop craps, Donators, you know, intro. Welcome

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,320
everybody to the Poop Craps, Donators podcast. Pleasure to be here as always. I have shit

50
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,720
the same way since I was born, but I'm recently trying to curb my unhealthy shitting habits.

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,640
You said that you shit too long. Do you take too long of a shit? So here's the thing. When

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,160
I was younger, I too took way too long on the toilet, like 30 minutes usually. I knew

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:33,080
people who took 40 plus. Apparently, I'm taking 30 seconds tops. So what I've read is, you

54
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,080
know, that whole gut bacteria autism thing I was bringing up before. I had already heard

55
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,760
about the connection between gut bacteria and autism because apparently people with Asperger's

56
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,680
take too long to shit. And it's a general problem. And I think that, I don't know, maybe I developed

57
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,840
the proper gut bacteria later because it no longer takes me very long to shit. In fact,

58
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,320
I go in there, I shit all the shit out, and I just sit there for a while because I'm still

59
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,800
reading the manga chapter that I'm trying to read before I get out the toilet. Or people with

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,360
their phones. But I think a lot of it is like, I think when I was younger, I just was never sure

61
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,080
I was done. It's like you are done, but you just sit there for like 20 extra minutes because you

62
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:23,400
feel like they're supposed to be more. You know, the worst one is when you've done like the main

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,120
shit that you came in there to do, but there's a potential like another one down in the pipeline.

64
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,480
And you're not sure whether you should strain yourself to get it out while you're here or

65
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,840
wait until it needs to come out later. I'm going to tell you right now, my piece of advice to

66
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,560
anybody who has this problem, just get off the toilet. You can come back. That's true. That's

67
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:50,280
the right way to handle that situation for sure. It's very, very rare that that extra one is actually

68
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,360
going to be able to come out anytime soon. More likely once you get up and you walk around a little

69
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,720
bit, it'll shift around and you'll realize you don't have the shit actually. You don't need it.

70
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,280
You don't got to wait. This is another one of the many arguments that I constantly mock you behind

71
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:14,680
your back for. And it's the extended sequence of Digibro realizes and presents as new information

72
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,640
that which everyone has known for decades. And this is an ongoing series that I'm constantly

73
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,960
fascinated by. And I enjoy every interview. You can know it. It's not like you put words to it in

74
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,040
your mind. I mean, I suppose so. I'm literally like certain if this podcast had come out like

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,160
three years ago, it would have been like, whoa, dude, shred, like speedrun shred. Maybe.

76
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,680
You have to understand, Nate, that what's so appealing about the internet is that people who

77
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,680
have been completely left behind by society can gather and take notes about what's actually going

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,320
on in the world together. That's fair. I see the appeal there. That's like, I've never talked to

79
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,040
anybody about how they shit before. I was just taking too long on the toilet. And then one day

80
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,480
I read an article or something that's like, Hey, don't take too long in the toilet, you'll get

81
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,080
dysentery. And I'm like, Oh shit, I better start quickening up my poops. And then I start reading

82
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,400
studies that are like, Oh, Asperger's tied to taking too long to shit. And I'm like,

83
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,680
well, maybe this has something to do with it. You know,

84
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,560
you know, this is just an area that I'm very sensitive to because I feel that a lot of my

85
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,480
videos, I'm extremely concerned that I'm just saying things. Everyone's heard a million times

86
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,440
and are super boring. But I'm saying it anyway, which we all are. There's no new info. Nobody

87
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,960
is ever on YouTube who is going to be grudge having to hear something they've heard before.

88
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,720
It's like all YouTube is. I mean, you're right. You're absolutely right about that.

89
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,360
But maybe that's just my resentment to the, I mean, we all agree on this. Like,

90
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,800
I think about this a lot that the information that you come across on YouTube,

91
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,680
like these are not the experts. These are not, these are not people ahead of their field. These

92
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,720
are basic bitch observations about the world. And I suppose I feel a sensitivity and a bit of

93
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:09,800
shame at that fact. I think about that so often because I've gotten so far down like history

94
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,320
holes where like the popcorn historians that get like thousands upon millions of views on YouTube

95
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,040
are just like nothing to me to the point where I can't believe it was even made. Like someone like

96
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,840
had the idea to like not, not even just recite history, which isn't even history. It isn't even

97
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:35,480
interesting. And what's the word inherently, but they just had the goal to just, you know,

98
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,640
recite it word for word, but also to do the thing where, you know, I have to cut it down to 10

99
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,960
minutes. So it's just like skipping over lots of information, like stuff like that where it's,

100
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,360
it's so boiled down from an actual interesting thought. Like it actually, you know, you have,

101
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,240
you have like the deep level shit, you have like audio books and real,

102
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,640
horse storyography shit. And then you go up to the YouTube where it's just like so

103
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,440
polished down to like absolutely nothing that it is wasting your time.

104
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,600
You know, I feel like there's a, maybe it's some sort of inverse of the Dunning-Kruger effect,

105
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,720
but there's got to be a graph that charts like, like general interest in a subject matter that

106
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,520
peaks super early on with like the basic facts and like the further you go into like becoming

107
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,400
an expert, like people's interest or willingness to commit to learning more goes like exponentially

108
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,280
down as you get further and further out. I think that's just, I think that's just the Dunning-Kruger

109
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:31,320
effect. Well, I mean, that's a different effect, but I see your point. I have to ask, did you get

110
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,600
into history through videos like that? Yes, I did. I won't lie. Yeah, there you go.

111
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,160
See, there is use for that. I think that's the main purpose. Like I view YouTube as a

112
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,080
gateway drug to more interesting stuff. I completely agree. I don't want to

113
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,080
besmirch. I, you know, I don't want to like make it seem like I'm really angry at them,

114
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,360
even though I am constantly, I click on them and I think, oh, maybe this one will be good.

115
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,760
Ah, God damn it. It's always weird from the perspective of like being either, either a creator

116
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,960
or a fan because like the, there's always new people and it makes it confusing because like

117
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,880
for me, I always used to view like, okay, my like main channel is like the basic bitch stuff that's

118
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,760
like just meant to introduce you to the concepts and then you get sucked into like the deep lore

119
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,480
stuff that I do otherwise. But like there's always new people to be hit with the basic

120
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,040
bitch stuff. And so it's like, I have to keep repeating myself because those people are not

121
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,080
going back four years and watching, you know, my video explaining the concepts I'm talking about

122
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,160
now. So I still get questions. That's just what, that's just what most people cap, like guys like

123
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,240
Jeff, not to even, this isn't even an insult, but he clearly is appealing to that demographic

124
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,440
as his primary focus and you know, wise, wise. I get stuff like that even like on this show

125
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,600
where I forget the specifics and if it comes back to me while I'm talking, I'll mention it,

126
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,480
but there was a PCB episode where I was discussing like a topic that I had been

127
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,400
brewing and stewing on for a while. Oh, it was, you can't waste too much time chasing perfection

128
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,760
in art and it's very to have released something than not to have released something and just

129
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,600
put it out, just put it out, just put it out. And I said something like the tale, I said that

130
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,200
sort of like condensed aversion of the idea, the sort of like, you know, good art, you know,

131
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,720
technically impressive art isn't valued by said that on a PCP recently. And someone came in here

132
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,920
saying that like, um, like there are of course reasons to have technical art and like

133
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,720
a technically impressive art and like, yeah, duh, like I didn't think that I had to express it

134
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,080
because the, because this point had been discussed on RFCK and even on previous PCP episodes and

135
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,600
just two people in the circle. So I didn't even think that it was necessary to say it to people

136
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,320
in PCP, you know, the audience, but I guess it makes sense. Like maybe this is someone's first

137
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,680
episode, maybe these tuned in on episode 300 and fucking thousand and they want to get

138
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,280
on the lowdown. Or even they just forgot because they're dumb. Yeah, that's true.

139
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,240
That's true. Like I have people in my audience all the time who like,

140
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,640
who I'll be like, didn't you watch this video? And they're like, yeah, but I forgot.

141
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,400
And again, like, again, it's like, I don't really want to shit on them. It's just like,

142
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,200
like, what am I supposed to do? Like say the entire point from the beginning? I mean,

143
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,400
which makes sense in like a neutral context, but we can't just like stop the podcast right now to

144
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,240
explain the nuance of every single thing that we're saying. I think, I think there's a level of

145
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,360
which, like if, if it goes without saying for you, and it's not like completely ridiculous,

146
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,360
like if most people get it, then it's fine to just to, to say the thing, assuming that most people

147
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,080
get it, you know what it is, the initial context, but and just ignore the people who don't because

148
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,080
they'll eventually get it. Yeah, we're, we're talking about the difference between being a teacher

149
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,160
and being a scientist right now. Like a teacher is somebody who takes information that science has

150
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,360
discovered and repeats it over and over again every year to a new group of kids. A scientist is

151
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,760
always trying to find new information. They are expected to already know every piece of information

152
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,520
that currently exists as they pursue others, which is why those people, you know, are sequestered

153
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,000
into academia, where like you have to pet, like, well, you know, in an idealized way,

154
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,840
what academia is supposed to be is you pass all these trials to prove that you know everything

155
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:23,000
going on, and therefore you can think about what comes next. But you, if you, you know, stop off

156
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,600
to be a teacher, it's just repetition. And I think on YouTube, a lot of us are trying to do both at

157
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,800
the same time, like we're on a journey of self discovery, like the stuff we're talking about,

158
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,280
it's not necessarily that like we know everything, you know, we might do research projects and

159
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:44,760
stuff like that. But it's more about exploration of the self and the science of understanding the

160
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,040
environment around you. And then again, you have to go and teach that to your audience. But

161
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,120
it's like you're more excited about doing the science role, but you have to stop and do the

162
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,080
teaching role if you want to keep those people, if you want people to be able to keep up with you

163
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,480
basically. Yeah, okay, Mr. Philosopher, let's get back to shitting because I didn't get to say

164
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,120
what I wanted to say about shitting, like large shits out your a**hole.

165
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,240
I just wanted to say about the teaching thing. It's funny how like on YouTube,

166
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:24,200
like the biggest educational channels, the literal teachers, are usually only making videos about

167
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,200
stuff that is like spiritually, not spiritually, but like enlightening to them like new information,

168
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:37,080
people like Veritasium and Smutter every day and Vsauce, I guess. They're teaching people new

169
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,560
things that they have found and they make the videos in such a way that you don't really need to

170
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,840
understand all the science, but they do give you books if you want to read more and like get the

171
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:57,240
basic concepts out of the way so that you're on the same page and you know, they do it.

172
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,920
That's good. Yeah, that serves as a pretty good shitting. It's become so much more,

173
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,680
so much more than just the active shitting to me. It's become like an active part of my leisure

174
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,960
experience where I will put off shitting if I'm in the middle of writing so I can have the release

175
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,440
of taking a sh**. Like the shitting is my break time. It is literally how I experience like

176
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,160
a job well done. It is my reward. I do not go to the bathroom when I have to go to the bathroom.

177
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,120
I do it when it's convenient to trick my brain into like performing tasks that I want it to do

178
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,920
and like punishing it by holding in piss or sh** into the point where I'm able to take a break.

179
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:45,240
Who's f**king cat is that? Get the f**k out of here. Obliterate. No. Exodia. Obliterate. Send that

180
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:54,040
tanderlott pony back to the moon where she came from. I will spend like seriously like 30 yeah

181
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,440
like did you say like 30 minutes on the bathroom on the sh** as they call it and just yeah like

182
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,440
did you say just on my phone reading or writing or just doing anything just because that is the

183
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,520
time under which I am free to do as I please and I have not locked my like you know I haven't

184
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,160
turned off my computer manually from a frozen turkey and now I literally cannot turn back

185
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,240
on my computer again. I've taken a sh** from the respite of literally not being able to use my

186
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,680
computer at all. Munchy I'm proud that you're trying to address this problem now because my

187
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,560
cogey who used to share a room with me he just he did not care about how long his sh** took.

188
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,320
He felt like it was he was just really taking long sh**s and he would take his laptop in with him

189
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:47,400
and watch yeah no movies full films and he would do it in my bathroom because I had my own

190
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,440
bathroom and he was a roommate I do that too and I would be like you mother like every single day

191
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,840
I'd have to go downstairs and use someone else's bathroom because this mother f**ker is sitting

192
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,680
in my bathroom for two goddamn hours out of every f**king day watching whole films and he would do

193
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,040
it at work too and I think eventually I will do one better. I remember many a summer nights

194
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,960
while I was in middle school where I would in order to like dodge like my mom like a question

195
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,840
to me or whatever I would go into my bathroom and instead of like having like the lights on

196
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,160
in my main room so she would be able to see me I just went into my bathroom and I literally

197
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,000
stayed in the bathroom on the toilet for all night six hours plus I've done that most of my

198
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,160
god damn just avoid I mean that just shows a dysfunction I would say there's something wrong

199
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,560
where that is happening well I remember very specifically one time I watched the entirety of

200
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:48,040
marble hornets well in the bathroom and that was a great experience the ideal scenario to watch

201
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,800
marble hornets. Bathrooms are a comforting place and I used to be I used to feel very strongly

202
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,360
about the bathroom like because I spent so much time in there I always felt like it was a a place

203
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,120
I had a strong connection to I filmed a lot of music videos in the bathroom back in the old

204
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,640
Modal Soul Productions days but these days I just don't have the same effect I view it as

205
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,360
more utilitary it's just like hey that's why that's the place where you shit you don't want to spend

206
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,000
too much time in there you know. Yo I think one of the subjects we're talking around is kind of the

207
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,440
sanctity we feel in the bathroom in today's modern interconnected society where can you have true

208
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,120
privacy the bathroom. Well not if you bring your phone with you. Well okay I mean I mean you have

209
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,200
as much privacy as you want in the bathroom if you just leave it off or what I mean maybe they're

210
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,680
listening to you via apples or I don't know. They are. They are totally with you. They are.

211
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,680
What about the recent kerfuffle about bathrooms where did you hear about this one of my very

212
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:50,840
favorite streamers Dr Disrespect filming in several bathrooms at E3 and getting it which

213
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,760
is a crime in the state you live in and got banned from Twitch temporarily. Dr Disrespect

214
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:03,000
isn't actually blockbuster video game champion 1993 or 1994. You know actually Ben I think as a

215
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,480
matter of fact he actually is those two things I think those are one of the two things that are

216
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,320
actually true about his legacy. Okay well I think that's correct. I don't think that well okay I saw

217
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,320
a video. Maybe I'm wrong. Who was it? Was it a gaming historian? I don't know. I watched some video

218
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,800
that talked about because there were two blockbuster championships and we know who won them. Yeah I'm

219
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:32,120
pretty sure unless he like unless like he pulls off the sunglasses it was me all like one of the

220
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,160
guys who actually won one of these championships like beefed with him like on Twitter. That's funny.

221
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,240
Yeah he's like dude I I'm the blockbuster 1994 video game champion and this asshole is claiming

222
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,960
to be it. What the fuck man. You know we know his name and like you could look it up so that

223
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,520
that could very well be true that could definitely be true but but let's focus on his violation of

224
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,760
the sanctity of bathrooms and you know I I like the guy a lot I think he's real funny it was obviously

225
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,760
a joke but he committed a grave sin by by filming in bathrooms that is a place where I have my

226
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,920
pp on full display to all comers and I'm glad you're saying this honestly this liberates me a

227
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,120
little bit because yeah for for over a decade this is not a controversial position I don't think

228
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,880
dog I think everybody's on I think so too but like I okay so like 10 years ago I came up with

229
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:30,440
a bathroom rating system and every bathroom I go to I gave it a score out of 10 and I've always

230
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,360
wanted to do bathroom reviews but I'm like I can't really like how can I communicate this

231
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,000
bathroom to somebody without showing it visually and I just I was like I don't know if it's legal

232
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,200
slash I don't have the balls even if the room is empty to get out a camera and record in the

233
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,760
middle it's not illegal in every state you can't do it in California you might be able to in other

234
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,520
states you could just like make sure no one's in there I mean if so who would object as long as

235
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:04,040
it's legal yeah it just is it feels like to pull out a camera in a bathroom sure sure and who who

236
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:11,960
even wants these bathroom reviews honestly who gives um well tell you uh Kazi has a friend and I

237
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,400
want to disclose uh the Instagram in which it exists but she has a friend who owns a like

238
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,080
bathroom toilet review Instagram where she literally rates them on a scale from one to ten

239
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,520
and like what you're discussing in your brain is already real and people are doing it right now

240
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:35,560
it's an untapped market I guess my idea has was not that unique and other people probably came

241
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,040
to the same conclusion is this a popular account I'm just curious is this popular does she actually

242
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,800
write like a like text post or is it just like a picture and a score no no no no yeah yeah yeah no

243
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:52,440
there's there's well it's not a long-winded like like a video like essay transcript but it doesn't

244
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:59,880
have to be there's only so many properties that a bathroom can have indeed indeed uh but you never

245
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,240
know okay I want to go back I want to go back to Nate saying that like everyone's already thought of

246
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,160
like the the bathroom scenario and you know how to do strats I want to say that literally you

247
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:18,520
Nate on the pcp like 20 episodes is the reason I'm trying to cut down on shitting because you

248
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,520
because I said something about the fact that like I like I am on the bathroom for three minutes

249
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,600
and then you get ulcers or whatever you said something effective or hemorrhoids hemorrhoids

250
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,680
yeah yeah yeah you said that and I was like oh shit is that true it is true it is true and I was

251
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:38,200
my doctor told me you know what you know where I got that information is from an xkcd comic

252
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,600
that I mean it was just a joke but it was a a graph that was showing like cases of dysentery

253
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,720
over the years and it goes from like the 1800s where it's way high up and then it goes down down

254
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,680
down down down and then it suddenly starts going way back up and it says invention of the laptop

255
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,760
yeah yeah I was like oh can you get dysentery from and let's get real let's get real precise

256
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:07,640
about what's going on you're getting shit in your body the poop is rising in a in a fine mist

257
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,360
or getting smeared around because you're wiping improperly it's getting on your shit and then

258
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,200
entering your body through one of your orifices again and making you sick do you like eating poop

259
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,240
if not don't sit on the toilet too long after shitting get the hell out of there it's gross

260
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,320
don't do it I do it too but I fight it so hard I know I know I can't pry myself off sometimes

261
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,240
this is why I hate I hate smokers so much because when I was in like working in retail

262
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,320
because they always have this get out of jail free card of I gotta go have a smoke and I always hated

263
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,640
my employees who smoke because they could use this anytime I can only say I gotta go take a shit so

264
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,440
many times per day but these motherfuckers get double the breaks with their fucking smoke breaks

265
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,400
why do they get to kill themselves and get rewarded for it motherfuckers get out your candy

266
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,480
cigarettes my head gotta go gotta take a smoke break boy I will go ironically smoke my candy

267
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,280
cigarettes while while leering at everyone with my with my dreamworks face you know every 20 minutes

268
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,680
at work that'll go great as a bonus just a just a little tidbit just a little piece of information

269
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:19,320
for you that if you think taking a shit feels good that is gay yeah oh well I don't but I don't

270
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,880
think that's possible because I don't believe in the prostate okay well I don't I think anyone that

271
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,720
says they like lies lying yeah what's really you know I don't usually think it feels good I don't

272
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,920
usually think it feels good to shit just for this one day only I felt gay for some reason like

273
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:44,600
there's just oh my god it felt like I felt extremely gay just for something would you say

274
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:52,040
that you were gay for a day I think that might be accurate I think that might be wait yeah yeah

275
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,360
I think that's right on the money right there obviously we don't know all the details but

276
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:04,520
ladies this very day I wake up and I see a fucking a scheduled video I've never clicked reminder so

277
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,880
fucking fast on a on a fucking thing because I bet you guys years ago at radicon 3 I bet this

278
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,960
would never happen I said to you too I said this will not happen to our faith it's too ambitious

279
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,040
you will never do it and I don't know what it's gonna be but Jesus Christ what is that what's

280
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,720
what's about to happen I want to say to correct you real quick Nate because it's not a scheduled

281
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:36,440
video it's a live stream this is a live concert that you will be able to watch it we're gay for

282
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:44,280
one day only today exactly oh I didn't know I oh my god that's even better so this is this is the

283
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:50,600
one you know England concert exclusive you know maybe we should maybe we should literally make it

284
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,440
unlisted after it's gay for one day that's not a bad idea for one dude this is literally like that

285
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,040
one time only Beatles on top of that rooftop event that like only the literally Illuminati was invited

286
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,920
to do or whatever anyone who's listening to this podcast will have missed it so lol yeah ha ha

287
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,760
I there is there is a secret playlist on the pcb of unlisted videos maybe it's there you will

288
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,680
never know you will never tell we'll we'll never I mean it won't be unlisted they're just saying

289
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,880
you would have missed it live well I mean they were saying it might be unlisted which would be epic

290
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,560
meme you know you hear gay for a day and you think ha ha silly as we when we walked in we

291
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,000
walked into the Abbey Road recording studios right and then and then as we walked out we looked at

292
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,040
each other and just started saying gold solid gold gold solid gold over and over increasing the volume

293
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,760
over and over and over again because it was true it's so much more than any of us could have predicted

294
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:58,360
or imagined and it's actually real and go to the video somewhere if you're able to do so

295
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:05,560
three hours from right now in my life and that's fascinating yeah uh as as I was just

296
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,640
like an actual explanation gay for a day is a music project uh that me and munchie cooked up at

297
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,400
radcon three well not not me me and hippo didn't make this art the band sleep tight made oh yes

298
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,200
our band sleep tight consisting of us it's it's low buys for the modern age

299
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:29,960
sleep tight okay sleep tight um we came up with this idea at radcon three we came up

300
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,480
with lyrics gay for a day what would happen if you were gay for a day one day just for one day the

301
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:43,320
album um the other day like yesterday or two days ahead was finished shot to be gay would you take

302
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,840
it exactly literally yes we have recorded um an album and then we're going to do a live stream and

303
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,880
have that be like the live version of the album yeah and then maybe do like a remastered version

304
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:02,360
later where like it's actually like good no listen it's good i mean it's good it's good but it's very

305
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:09,480
like like sleet oh yeah i'm a little i'm almost a little shocked i mean we've been we've been supposed

306
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,360
to keep this under wraps since uh since radcon two we haven't been supposed to talk about one word to

307
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,280
anyone yeah yeah this has been a tightly kept secret a sleeply tightly kept secret yes a trade

308
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:28,440
secret a tightly slept secret um well it i wouldn't be so ready to talk about it if not for the fact

309
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,840
that like it is done and in the past and not only since that when you're hearing this it will be in

310
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,680
the past but also in the sense that we have already recorded a version so literally if i like die right

311
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,600
now if like both of us die right now the album will still exist so it is literally out

312
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,360
was this at all part of the plan when you went to england and whatnot uh i i'm not not really it was

313
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:58,840
just sort of like what better time than yeah exactly right now to yeah yeah absolutely fascinating

314
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,760
especially when we are able to enlist the talents of of your brothers who are musical genius genius

315
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:13,080
yeah the the musical genius and hgb guy who you may know yes the chas uh the chas made that one

316
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,360
road toad's video game that played in rfck one time yep of course of course and and uh a run

317
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:25,720
away from snakes yes famous uh bail jade video game and a hgb guy is like hgb guy is the best

318
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,680
savage comment responder in the entire world yes he is a hero he's a god damn hero he's communist

319
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:39,800
a frame he is uh he is neo gay lord nelson in rfck and he is a beloved creature and everyone loves him

320
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:45,320
i i love that's true like cryptid of the modern age oh and he has a really strange youtube channel

321
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,440
which uh if you like like weird shit that like is no it's like give and take sort of tear like uh

322
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,640
this would not like make it anywhere on youtube content but like much stranger and much cooler

323
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:04,280
seeing your brother what's what's the youtube is it called hgb guy uh i think so probably there's

324
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,280
kind of corona on there too if you're if you're from way back but right right seeing your brothers

325
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,320
together was incredible because you really are like the manifestation of both of them hippo you

326
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:20,600
were like like henry or hgb guy is like if you just were fucking hit with some sort of bizarre

327
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,360
like wizard spell and now you're completely off the rails in every way and and and the chas

328
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,320
is like if you were like restraining you got like a like a five to nine well-paying job and you

329
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:38,600
became a construction worker like normal person and the intersection of those two are you yeah

330
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,280
literally yeah they're they're very cool they are very cool and i like them so anyway sleep tight

331
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:50,600
gay for a day full album high quality in the past get fucked kill yourself damn oh i can't believe

332
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,600
i live to see the day you know you know going back to the shit you know the the shit conversation

333
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,320
really good but i just feel like the the shit needs something like if i had like an extra like

334
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,880
letter in there somewhere if you know like shit if there was some sort of like shirt conversation

335
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,840
we could be having right i totally forgot i like these i like these glances you're giving me

336
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,040
yeah i don't know what i'm supposed to add to that i wasn't sure if we were gonna use the gay for a

337
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,400
day to transition into you guys talking about you're more than one day of gay together but we

338
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,440
can do shirts for us yeah i know you want to talk about shirts and ben was was winging uh

339
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:33,480
justly that teespring earlier before we recorded so all right shirts are big news they're big news

340
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,680
in shirtland let me tell you right now there is seven hundred and fifty dollars sitting in my

341
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:46,200
PayPal right now mm-hmm on the basis of selling about fifteen shirts was there zero before or was

342
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,400
there seven hundred forty nine okay just check you say there's seven hundred dollars because you

343
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,520
sold fifteen shirts somewhere around there well this seems like that's like a thousand dollars

344
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:06,120
a shirt what are you talking about uh no i'm selling shirts for thirty dollars each okay okay

345
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,720
don't ask me to math that shit out i have however much well some of them were 40 because of

346
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:18,120
international shipping look okay the cost of producing one shirt like the full cost of just

347
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:24,680
the production of the shirt before shipping is about five dollars mm-hmm shipping in the us costs

348
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:31,640
five dollars how much was the device the device is a hundred and forty okay one time that's not bad

349
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,240
at all no that's that's let that's a lot less than i thought and however the result can just use an

350
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:44,600
iron but uh yeah the results are great they're uh perfect i mean i need to pre wash my shirts because

351
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,040
the first round i did i didn't and some of the graphics got a little scuzzy after being washed

352
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:57,080
but um yeah so i bought these transfer papers there i you can get a pack of like 16 transfer

353
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,840
papers they're like a dollar a piece basically um but if you buy in bulk you know the price goes down

354
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,760
marginally um one the the most expensive part of the process really is the ink i mean it's

355
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,400
pretty much like a dollar or two per shirt when you consider because printing these things will

356
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,240
shoot through your ink depending on the design i mean my design is really complicated it has

357
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:24,280
lots of colors in it and it's it's huge but like all told again the total cost of production

358
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:31,320
of one shirt is like five bucks i can sell them for thirty dollars um you know take away the five

359
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,000
dollars of shipping that's twenty dollars of profit per shirt as opposed to the two to five

360
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,600
that you will get on teespring and people are way more likely to buy them because i'm selling them

361
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:49,720
like i'm hand making them i'm writing my name on them in uh in paint so like a shirt paint

362
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,360
uh huh so i'm just saying uh this is the way to do shirts like well quick question quick question

363
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:02,520
fuck spread shirt this is the way to do shirts i hear you but what is the time investment per

364
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,600
shirt uh 20 seconds okay once you got your operation running okay i mean because you you

365
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:14,520
do have to print i mean if printing one paper can take a few minutes i mean you don't have to do

366
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,920
anything you just hit print yeah and you wait but if you print like a hundred that's just slightly

367
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,800
more work like like an extra click and then it takes a couple minutes for the heat press to heat up

368
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,240
but obviously you would just do them in bulk but you literally to to print this is how printing a

369
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:36,200
shirt works you take a piece of transfer paper print an image onto it you put that shirt on a

370
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:42,360
just on the base of the heat press put the design on top of it close the heat press for 20 seconds

371
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:48,680
open it and you're done like that is it i mean it's literally just an iron it's just a big flat

372
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:54,760
iron that's easier to use than like trying to you know smoothly because like if you use an iron

373
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,560
it's hard to get it even you know but i mean you can look up a tutorial it's not that difficult

374
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,440
people do it all the time with just an iron but like it's only 140 bucks for a shirt press that will

375
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,120
always give you the same result um yeah i don't know it's pretty fucking easy like the most time

376
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,880
consuming part is just going to the post office uh i mean i was inspired just because i lived with

377
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,240
tom and who of course was doing this for iam games and like seeing how easy it was for him to do and

378
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,760
i had always just assumed that shirt presses were expensive but i overheard him telling ben

379
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,320
that they were like 200 dollars or something like that which i didn't even pay that much to pay like

380
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,080
150 mines perfectly fine um yep yeah as soon as i heard that i was like oh fuck it's only a hundred

381
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,320
you've already recouped that why am i yeah i recouped it with several well i recouped that on

382
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:49,320
my fucking test run because i initially printed like eight um i just had like i had some papers and

383
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,440
i had just whatever ink was left in my cartridge and i did a bunch of test runs my printer was

384
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,040
fucking up so i had all these misprints but they all looked really aesthetic and cool so i sold

385
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,800
all the misprints to my patrons and uh they were gone instantly it was like i posted a picture of

386
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,840
like eight designs and within like 20 minutes i'd sold them all that already recouped the cost of

387
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:17,480
the t-shirt press so um yeah all right like the the only unfortunate part is like i can't really do

388
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,320
colors other than white although there are like there's different types of papers you can use to

389
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:28,040
do different colors i think um but i mean if you're doing something like endless war like t-shirts i

390
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:34,520
cannot imagine a better way and also part of my inspiration to even do this type of stuff was ben

391
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:40,760
when he did the vapors comic because when i saw that he shipped them in those cool black envelopes

392
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,880
with like the white writing on them i was like oh that's the coolest thing ever that like i i wish

393
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,640
i had bought that so i could have that presentation you know yeah a little yeah a little trade secret

394
00:36:51,640 --> 00:37:00,520
there um be cool and look stylish all the time no i know personality goes a long way yeah uh

395
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,600
vapors two kickstarter coming soon question mark

396
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,880
hey you know i did have one strong thought about this um uh this isn't to shit on may specifically

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,760
no you don't acknowledge it you leave it for the audience to have their own thoughts on

00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,200
life name right now jumping in and out of everywhere you have to jump out of the nether portals like

421
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,120
in binary code to to you know convey your internet presence yeah that's good that's good uh but uh

422
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:40,680
you know what we're good at it uh i love right dear jokes so please don't up my plan

423
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:41,880
max

424
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,240
real um but bin what what do you think i mean i mean apparently shirt prices are uh

425
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:58,600
cost nothing are nothing and are just more romantic and better okay um well wait at well i

426
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:04,280
i think depending on i thought it was a big problem it doesn't sound like it reduces the overhead

427
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,880
from teespring by that much wait what what do you mean teespring is the only overhead is only

428
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,400
like 10 bucks per shirt and that includes and that includes shipping wait how much do you make per

429
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:22,440
shirt uh depend uh about 10 bucks okay because i'm making 20 by selling them for 30 dollars

430
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,640
well we sell ours for 20 so there you go well i mean it's all about how many you're able to sell

431
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,200
and whatnot yeah i mean you know because the thing about teespring is that they have the better

432
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:39,800
turnover but they also have the shittiest shirts and like they i like i look maybe i'm crazy i love

438
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,120

442
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,880
shirt press though because the best part is not the money i make off of it it's not printing

443
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,240
shirts for fans it's not making my own designs and signing them it's that i can just make my own

444
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,840
shirts for myself of anything i want yeah i can just print any random bullshit out of shirt

445

449
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:13,240
to read the text and all the extra stuff but this i for the fourth of july i was like i need a special

450
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,680
shirt so i printed this unfortunately i printed it backwards however thanks to the magic of the

451
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:25,320
internet you're all seeing it the way it should oh good is that baracko trump hole it's yeah it's

452
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,720
trump trump bomb i literally just googled trump mama and got exactly what i wanted

453
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:39,960
oh you got the the comic my favorite comic of all time where george washington and ben franklin

454
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:47,080
smoke weed together and he says get money fuck bitches smoke trees um it's got you know a rainbow

455
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:55,480
murica with with uh with fucking right i'm gay i dubs on it uh the pansu party quote which i actually

456
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,560
misquoted i wrote the american flag the american flag is an autistic concept it was actually the

457
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,600
original quote is america is an autistic concept and the flag is to help normie's understand it

458
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:14,440
hmm more nuanced yeah way to way to contribute to the continual degradation of the discourse

459
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:23,000
yeah uh well forgive you and there's a beer and a well i'm basically sold for my own self so good

460
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,200
job digi yeah this is so i mean that was i can't imagine being able to just like print my own design

461
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,080
which is what i literally just want to do that's what i've always wanted to do yeah like i want to

462
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,040
have a whole wardrobe of like i want to have a shirt that just says i disagree on it every every

463
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,880
time every time i think of a shirt that i want to make that i'm like ah but i'd have to pay it

464
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:50,280
cost me like 10 bucks it cost me like 10 bucks to make it and order it for myself on teespring or

465
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:56,840
whatever i guess i could shrink that well i would always make that money right the profit would go

466
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:02,760
to myself so what i what i would just what i shrink that cost i could shrink that amount if i owned

467
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,040
a tea that honestly that actually would and the best part is that i just had all these materials

468
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,600
because like i'm already preparing to sell a bunch of shirts to fans and then i'm just like hey let me

469
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,440
just dip into my fucking supply here grab one of these larges grab one of these papers print one

470
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:25,400
for myself fucking wear it on america trump obama that's good uh you know i'm just a controversial

471
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,600
opinion but uh you look damn good in this picture did you look at that thick head of hair look at

472
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,200
that short i gotta tell you let me see look at the vibrant colors of his lips i gotta say very

473
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:42,120
appealing yeah yeah you do you do hold on i was gonna say why do you look like victor in this picture

474
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,440
why do you just look like you turned into you you're like half victor you guys you you just

475
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,640
went down it looks like someone trump bombed you with victor yeah i need to send you the full

476
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,920
story so this is going to have to go with the show notes as well so before that picture existed

477
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:04,360
mere seconds before i had you know i i want i had this shirt i wanted to tweet about it

478
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:10,120
so i took a selfie of myself in the shirt trying to emphasize the graphic so you would

479
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,960
you'd be able to read it so here's the picture that i tweeted initially

480
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:21,800
yeah okay which is this is like are you familiar with the hideo and kojima memes of uh

481
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,880
it's like that it's like that i don't see it where is it it's in gross disgusting audio links

482
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:34,200
that's the yeah um so this that was the first picture i posted then may look at his instagram

483
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:40,120
right here angles angles and filters yeah may was just like oh that looks like shit let me

484
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,000
take another picture where you look good so she just yeah just changed the angle slightly and because

485
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,720
i'm not holding the camera i had all of my body to pose and uh yeah that was just that's the difference

486
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,960
that a camera angle makes fascinating i don't even know okay but the first one shows the shirt

487
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,400
there's no filter at all so it's just uh it's just the camera angle and being a forward facing

488
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,840
camera versus a uh outer camera as you look you look you look you look almost as stylish as

489
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:13,880
nathan masry founder of garfield eats okay look at tiny mouth true look at just the change of position

490
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:20,040
makes digi looks so much slimmer like his jawline looks so much more defined his skin is like glowing

491
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,240
and looks like tanned and vibrant which indicates health like his lips are brighter like everything

492
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:32,840
about that this is this is a fascinating contrast is he single specifically look at the difference

493
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:38,200
in your beard it looks so much smoother and fuller in the second one it's a different way i'm

494
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,920
blown away by this the first one was taken from a low angle and the second one was yeah from a high

495
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,120
angle which i you know i always make sure in all of my videos that i'm looking up at the camera

496
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,640
because the only way i look good i don't have a very well-defined jaw so like you have to see me

497
00:46:53,640 --> 00:47:00,760
from above to get that definition but um the fact that i look also like 30 pounds lighter is particularly

498
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:09,880
hilarious it's incredible uh life is a crime and this is a lie uh everything is fake nothing is real

499
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,560
all observation is just uh what's the word non-objective based on our position in the

500
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,200
universe relativistic whatever and this is just uh the person the putting subjective that's the

501
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:26,120
word i was looking for buffalo new york lifelong pokemon fan neil ferraro threw away the chance to

511
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:33,480
instantly and yeah i'm down to like 157 so pretty good pretty good uh not as interesting what was

512
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,920
the origin of your stint there like why why were you questioning it it wasn't quit i just i just

513
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:45,640
fucking stopped doing it for a minute and then i got fat and i was like well fuck this yeah this is

514
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,240
uh this is not as interesting there's no narrative here but i have been counting my calories 100%

515
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:58,440
accurately well 99% probably for the last several days and uh have not lost the 25 pounds i hope to

516
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:05,240
yet but one step at a time and uh i'm i'm doing it last the time has come i'm cooking my own food

517
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,640
i'm dieting as well as i i broke 180 and uh a lot of my pants are not fitting right

518
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,320
they're enough yeah you sure you shrinkin you shrinkin no i need to i think he's going the

519
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:22,840
opposite direction he's saying oh i'm about to attempt shrinking because my pants are

520
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:30,360
fucking oh i see i see um well hey if you guys need any hot tips i'm all i'm always available i

521
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,840
i think there's no there's no better weight loss motivation than just keep your wardrobe fitting

522
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:42,600
like i used to always wear just like xls and double xls and shit and so like it never made a

523
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,880
difference but if you buy all large and like stuff that just fits and then you start getting fat you

524
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,080
immediately are like wow i can't wear any clothes now so i have i have a bunch of underwear and a

525
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:59,080
couple of pairs of shorts that are like ah i can't wear these anymore i'm too skinny but then i have

526
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:04,200
a couple that are so huge that i'm like these could i could never possibly have worn the i have a pair

527
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:11,320
of shirts that's like waistband size 42 and i'm like this was this was never this was never me

528
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,360
what was what was going on here i'm just finding a bunch of like oversized shit in my drawer and

529
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,640
i don't know why it's there i could never have worn it our parents just gave us some shit back in the

530
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,000
day i don't know if it fits under that category i don't know maybe yeah maybe boy it would have

531
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,960
had been kicking around for a long ass time if that's the case i i've been orbiting uh fitness

532
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,040
in one particular way and i've been thinking recently because there's going to be a gym

533
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,800
inside my dorm like just literally inside of there you go no excuses yeah yeah i've been

534
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:49,960
thinking myself oh yeah there's one thing i want to get fit in there's exactly one way and that's

535

rack in her brain she was telling me about how you guys are gonna have like access to a gym next

559
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,640
year and and uh she wanted to use she wanted to use the weight rack in our basement because

560
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,040
she doesn't have access to one right now so uh yeah we're we're lifting buddies now

561
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:25,160
can i be on that yeah absolutely oh yeah oh this is perfect yeah it'll be uh it'll be just like

562
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:31,080
when me and digi used to fucking squat together uh in the garage guys just just when you picture

563
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,400
someone squatting and spotting someone squatting i just i doubt too many people out there have the

564
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,760
visual imagine a man like just bent over knees been ass stuck out as far as it can and imagine a

565
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:47,080
man literally sandwiched dick to ass right behind him caressing him and making the most you know

566
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,560
ecstasy filled face as you go down and up it's worth that and i never actually like

567
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:58,120
properly spotted each other on squatting it was not like we just watched the other person do it and

568
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,560
we were just there in case they dropped it and we needed to call

569
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:10,120
911 there was one time i got stuck down and ben kind of sort of helped me mostly i just kind of

570
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:17,480
fell to the side and dropped the bar it's what i don't do that whole spotting shit um it's not

571
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,120
it's not my style i know i've talked about this before no you gotta no you gotta stand behind

572
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,680
you gotta stand behind on the bench you gotta hold your hands under the bar like oh it's all you

573
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,720
bro it's all you bro two just for sweet nothing three more three more it's all you i'm not touched

574
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,040
in the bar i'm not touching the bar this is all you this is all you bro one more come on come on

575
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:42,440
lock those not those elbows out i'm not touching it's all you bro that's what i'm in it for unironically

576
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:48,520
those things can be helpful uh yeah sure i yeah kind of having a lifting buddy is a good thing

577
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:54,120
which i've never ever in my entire life had although one time i have uh i was just like

578
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:59,000
all that's i was the man you would not have wanted ben as a lifting buddy because ben was in the middle

579
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,160
of texting uh his girlfriend in between every single set i mean sure and it's one of those things

580
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:11,320
where it's like a set only takes about you know 20 seconds but texting takes about a minute and a

581
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:17,080
half when you're ben yes i like to work out alone uh and i i'm i'm thrilled that that i've had the

582
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:22,120
ability to do so primarily but uh there have been some times where like i'm benching and i'm i'm doing

583
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:28,200
a little bit too much and that bar gets down to my chest and i'm like oh no i can't i'm this is it

584
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:35,880
it is 100 over for me i was a good run uh i will be dead momentarily uh but have you ever had to do

585
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,680
this ben you probably have like sometimes sometimes people will be on it and they'll come and help

586
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,240
you and it's a little embarrassing but i appreciate the gesture but more often than that you do the

587
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:50,680
little wiggle where you slowly work it down your torso like crushing every muscle as it goes and

588
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,240
you kind of you're able to sit up it's resting on like your little i don't know the the joint between

589
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:01,240
your your waist whatever and you yeah get out under it the dick yes the dick as it's colloquially

590
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:07,720
known and uh it's it's a very painful shameful experience but yeah i've done that it sucks it's

591
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,520
not it's not fun it's not fun but just so on the squad anything i was just gonna say that i once

592
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:17,000
squatted uh i'm probably the strongest man i've ever seen in my gym was a guy i went to high school

593
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,280
with and we were at our we are at the ymca that i worked at in my hometown and where he would work

594
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:29,720
he was squatting around 500 pounds or more uh he was he's a gigantic man and like he he was like

595
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:36,040
hey dude i'm about squat would you spot me i'm like a baby in high school what am i supposed to do

596
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:41,080
if you're squatting 500 pounds i got right up in there i mean because like he can do most of it

597
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,480
obviously it's just that if he needs it he wants a little bit of help which i can kind of provide

598
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:51,720
so i'm right up on him like dick to ass i'm feeling the strength of a man it's fueling me the musk

599
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,520
is filling my nostrils and i'm feeling true euphoria at this moment as he goes down and up

600
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:01,880
down it up us grinding against each other oh my god that's when i knew that the greek lifestyle

601
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:08,280
was the only lifestyle for me um and uh it was it was euphoric simmer down so i can say i have

602
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:17,000
squatted 500 pounds uh come at me gays i'm stronger than you yep so that's it that's it that was fun

603
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,920
one day i'll make uh i'll make uh one day my son will be there to spot me in the same way and

604
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:30,120
we'll be bonded as you know blood you you you won't hear any updates on on the munchie bar front

605
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:36,840
for for many of an episode of the pcp week because i'm gonna be fucking way too doing anything to

606
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:44,200
even attempt to even know how to begin but i i i will you know what munchie barra munchie barra

607
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:49,400
is the new storyline i'm gonna commit right here and you know what that storyline may it may

608
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,240
burn up and die and it may become a failure and that's the point of it do you know how unbelievably

609
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:01,160
powerful munchie barra would be like munchie's already like a force to be reckoned with like

610
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:07,160
a human wrecking ball on wheels yeah if he has muscles as well like he could probably punch

611
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,800
a building in half like i can't even imagine anything you wouldn't be able to do did did you

612
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,800
i remember i won the first like digi bros like after like you met me the second time at broding

613
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,200
con there was a digi bros reflecting upon the broding con and you're describing as like as like

614
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:26,280
an unbelievable tank slash a wrestler like some sort of like a bizarre yeah i've always thought you

615
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:31,560
needed to be a pro wrestler like if you were muscular you would easily be a pro wrestling

616
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:36,280
personality so you know there's another guy i think it might become real there's another guy

617
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,360
i just remembered about that you should also aspire to be munchie this is this is even more

618
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:46,440
famous than alexander and it's just it's the uh the husband from full metal alchemist who has a

619
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,600
big belly i was thinking of the same exact yeah that guy yeah that guy is your barra whenever i

620
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,640
think barra i think i think the blacksmith guy from full metal alchemist yeah yeah this is the

621
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:03,160
ideal this is the ideal right here can you imagine can you literally imagine you can't you can't you

622
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:10,440
you know i feel such envy i am limited by my genetics you know i've uh i'm of average height

623
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:16,360
basically i will never be the towering adonis to like a um what's his face uh fucking uh

624
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:22,200
armstrong no not armstrong uh who's the real life arm's horse nigger that's what i'm thinking of

625
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,000
just the biggest widest man in the planet but you munchie you have you have all the potential

626
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,760
in the world to be literally the biggest man on the planet and you could be you could be

627
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:39,480
one of the small weak guys from baki the grappler you could be one of like the tiny pathetic ones

628
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:45,240
on that show you know i was just looking at it like i was going uh i don't know whatever i was

629
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,000
looking at fitness stuff and i just saw like there's like a some fitness youtube guy who was

630
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,640
like a marine or something and there was just a video of him competing against like i think

631
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:59,000
literally like the winner of like world strongman competition just like this is a guy if you saw the

632
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,280
marine on the street you'd think holy shit that guy's huge compared to the other guy it was like

633
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:10,680
looking at a child versus an adult that man was so unbelievably jiggy we're talking like like

634
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:17,000
six nine or something and like probably 400 pounds just a monster and uh that could be you

635
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,520
that could be you and i hope to see it look out very soon munchie shasky's in town that that second

636
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:28,440
puberty is coming hard and when it hits it's funny it's funny when you watch you watch a basketball

637
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:34,120
and everyone playing seems normal because their only reference point is each other yeah and they're

638
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:38,760
all enormous and then you see them like next to regular people next to like the coach or whatever

639
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,600
and you see and they're like like regular people like come up to like their nipples and it's like

640
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:51,160
okay all right i see what we're dealing with here i accept my role to be genetically removed

641
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:56,520
from the gene pool you it's true you guys deserve to reproduce and i do not i get it you're king of

642
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:01,880
the menlets aren't you aren't you you're king of the man no i mean does the future does the future

643
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:08,520
really have a place for tall people like uh you know we we don't need to be physically strong to

644
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:15,320
survive anymore and the overpopulation is putting us into denser and denser human clusters do we not

645
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:20,840
need overpopulation is a myth overpopulation is a fucking i need a little bit of myth god damn it

646
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:27,560
god damn it i'm well listen when the bombs drop and it's us against us as nature always intended

647
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,720
we'll see who ends up on top and it won't be the guy when the bombs drop anybody who's tall enough

648
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:37,640
to see over a wall will be evaporated but like there'll be much like in barefoot again us small

649
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:45,080
people will just hide behind a chest high wall and we'll be fine in a minecraft hunger game scenario

650
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:50,840
what the with the pcp as the only players who would come out first in a in a minecraft hunger

651
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:56,520
game specifically well the the the different areas like you already know because we have the arena

652
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:02,840
so we know who survives that no that doesn't they're guns that no it's a man man e-man just

653
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:09,320
complete it has to be dominance physically well the the the thing you gotta account for in minecraft

654
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:15,000
you gotta account for for trickery and and stratagem and alliances which could absolutely form

655
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,360
let's say if like munchie might have a big advantage against like gibb for example but if

656
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,320
like everyone was team gibb and we said we will feast on munchie's corpse then obviously we have

657
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:30,360
you know the the edge there and we can uh so you know things like that i don't even know if we do

658
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:37,080
have the edge there i feel like i can imagine just swatting us away like flies like donkey kong

659
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:42,600
yeah it's like throwing us 20 feet i think munchie could see tomorrow night when we're all shipped

660
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:48,440
off to the fucking minecraft world to get out when battle royale happens pcp battle royale that

661
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:53,960
will be our next uh you know thing dude oh okay i'm sure today that's before but there's nothing

662
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,000
i love more than like physically beating someone up like i'm not joking right now we're like trying

663
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,840
to like make a joke that's why you need to be a pro wrestler god damn fighting people it like it

664
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,120
actually makes me feel so good like munchie unironically someone as hard as i can unironically

665
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:15,640
you me everyone else on the planet should do some type of contact sport like uh like people

666
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:20,600
really like brazilian jujitsu it's not as dangerous i mean it's really not that dangerous at like the

667
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,800
level that most people do it and the feeling of like there's something so lost in our modern society

668
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,840
of not physically engaging with each other which frankly i think is mad gay it's way less gay to

669
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:35,320
be all up on your bros and be comfortable like there's a thing of like ooh i don't want to touch

670
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,200
anybody ooh that's uh that's weird and gross i don't ever do it you should people should be more

671
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:45,880
comfortable with that in my humble opinion i think we're all singing all dancing crap of the world

672
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:51,000
exactly got a form fight club when i was a kid when i was in like like middle school and elementary

673
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,640
school i used to wrestle with my friends all the fucking time and i want to get way up on top of

674
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,960
them and i would be shirtless and i'd be so fucking fat that i would just like jump up and down on

675
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:05,080
their chest make them hyperventilate and i would be like oh i win the game and then i would just

676
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,960
like keep on being them even though they aren't even responding to me anymore it was so good the

677
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,040
adrenaline was pumping i was so fucking sweaty and i felt so good because all my friends were just

678
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,920
white twink and i was obliterating them i was reading the world of the of the right ways one

679
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:24,760
evil seed at a time it was already i was already splattered in blood but my fists just kept hammering

over them that's why it exists i felt them for the first time and frequently at night and i felt

696
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:01,560
so small and so powerless before the might of the planet moving underneath me it was a very uh

697
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:06,520
humbling experience but yeah i obviously that they're they're different you know ranges of how

698
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,880
powerful earthquakes are yeah but even like the small ones like it literally feels like just shake

699
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,920
your body up and down like your your like head that's what it like looks like to have an earthquake

700
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:23,400
happen yeah like the entire room and ground around you shakes and things like fall off your

701
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,760
shelves and like things can break you know there was another time like if if it's like a particularly

702
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,640
powerful one like in like like look up like i mean teleporting is famous for earthquakes like look

703
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:40,920
up like the san francisco and like la uh earthquakes those like obliterated entire fucking like cities

704
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:47,960
like countless city blocks obliterated you know when i was quick so just wipe things off them out

705
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:53,240
at my last apartment uh in sincenady um there was uh there was a big flood that i've talked about

706
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,760
that i got into the local news for yeah i know i've talked about that before it was pretty pretty

707
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,560
funny but like and the the car at the bottom of the hill got straight up completely covered in

708
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,800
water there might have been a little of the roof poking out but that car was destroyed and uh it

709
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:11,560
was fucked up and it just that was such a the the water the amount of water just going by on the

710
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,920
street luckily my car was parked at the top of the hill and it was totally fine but i thought to myself

711
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:21,560
my car will not survive if i attempt to escape this area therefore all i can do is stay okay now

712
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:27,480
that that's established the water is slowly rising more and more towards my apartment i will not be

713
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:33,160
able to escape and it's coming towards me more and more i live on the first floor of this building

714
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:38,600
the basement is filled with water right now there is no escape and i just thought well

715
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:44,520
i could die today um and there's nothing i can do but i will just sit here and hope it doesn't

716
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,080
happen and that's exactly what i did and it was fine it wasn't that big a deal but it was that and

717
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:55,480
like the earthquakes in japan were the two most in awe of the planet and in awe of nature experiences

718
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:00,840
i i have felt personally and it was sure was fucked up bro i want to live i don't want to die

719
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,840
i wanted to fight but there was literally nothing i could do like fighting the ocean or you know

720
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:12,360
whatever she was crazy she was crazy uh huh yep yep i don't know yep uh oh you know what i was

721
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:16,360
gonna say though the earthquake was a missed opportunity i wish i wish i'd felt it but i slept

722
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:21,320
through it uh you'll get a chance there'll be more chances um uh but but you know what i was gonna

723
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:28,040
say come out to the san yago conben just come on out dude sounds so hard here he was my theory

724
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:32,760
though here was my theory on the earthquakes my thought was that this was god's judgment against

725
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:40,200
anime expo taking place this was my theory because it is uh there's too many humans and it's too

726
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:46,280
shitty yeah i mean i think you might have ended by now but it's are you sad you missed it i'm

727
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:53,000
fainting right now oh i didn't i thought you i figured you knew no i i should i should know it's

742
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:29,160
i still haven't got a hotel situated yet though so i need to do that gotta gotta work i i i i i

743
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:35,080
i'm craving the con experience and thankfully even though i missed an expo i won't be able to go

744
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,960
to otacon like how i would have liked to do either one of those uh all of us besides did you

745
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:46,920
will be a brony con yep at the at the at the beginning of next month yo my crazy we uh i've

746
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:51,960
got tickets uh to brony con we have to get plane tickets and uh and a place we're gonna stay but

747
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,560
we were looking at probably do that today or something but we were looking at arabian bees

748
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:00,520
in the area and first of all let me tell you guys arabian bees are the way of the future hotels

749
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,760
can literally die and go away forever i don't care about them anymore they're shit they're a meme

750
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:11,160
they're a fad and they are obsolete you can just you can get like some dude's house he's just out

751
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:16,920
of town you get a whole fucking house which is full of cool things to touch and look at and

752
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:21,320
experience and a new family to pretend is your family which i very much look forward to doing

753
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:28,280
and uh it's it's literally cheaper than like most hotels and it's just better in every way too

754
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:32,760
it's incredible it's incredible now i hope we'll be able to find one that's like relatively close

755
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,560
and still relatively cheap but hotels are a fucking scam don't don't do them don't do them

756
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,880
abolish them that's what i'm for wait wait give them back to the people i wasn't paying attention

757
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,200
what did you say to do instead of i'm saying arabian bees are great hotels are shit because

758
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,680
we were looking into doing an arabian bee and i was like i don't know because i don't know if i

759
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:55,640
trust like that in in washington dc but if you're if you're giving them the strength of why in

760
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:02,200
washington uh i don't know it's just for otacon scary dc is a pretty rough place from what i hear

761
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:06,760
yeah oh i i had no conception of such a thing i think it's one of the crime capitals of the

762
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:12,040
country like not like the very center where like the the fucking you know all the rich

763
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:17,320
white politicians are is very nice but like outside that it's apparently pretty rough victor when he

764
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:23,400
went to otacon last time gave me the impression that it was uh that it was not so that it was

765
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:29,640
kind of a janky and scary place in places i mean the con is like literally right behind

766
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:35,640
the white house it's like fucking a block away yo go say hi to drump for me dude let him know uh

767
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:40,120
you know let him know he's got my official endorsement that the pcp officially endorses

768
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:46,600
drump 2020 baby all of us are on board for this right right uh wait who are we telling who are

769
01:12:46,600 --> 01:13:01,000
we're voting for drump fan thanks for signing off don't go away did you know every year every year

770
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,440
poor republicans vote for republican candidates we need to liberate them from their vote so they

771
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:15,880
don't make this mistake hey uh say is seeing as like every single topic that has been brought up

772
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:22,680
i have had absolutely nothing to say on anything sure and i feel stupid uh let's talk about like uh

773
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:30,200
munchie being at my house yes please what's going on sure uh i feel okay so so that there was one

774
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:34,760
big thing that happened while we were here was it the anifred redemption because i've heard a lot

775
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:40,120
of stories about this all right it was the anifred redemption i oh is that who that kid was in your

776
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:47,800
video yes okay so he was in fact like a 10 year old as i thought he is 13 okay um he is younger than

777
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,600
the teen cp god damn it might be more appropriate to say on the rfck about the bean up but i don't

778
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,600
care because we're just gonna talk about it now you know what the pcp needs more good topics or

779
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,120
i didn't talk about it an rfck thing and this is fitting this is fitting that we're talking about

780
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:07,240
here because this is there's pcb stuff here too it's the redemption of pcp fans in my mind

781
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:11,320
yeah it is the complete redemption of them as a concept because i was so racist towards them

782
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:16,040
and you know i still will be because i don't fully trust them i don't fully like trust people

783
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:20,760
who are just like into the pcp and not into rfck that's just like sort of like weird my brain

784
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,000
doesn't fully comprehend that's even possible of course of course but it made me really understand

785
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,080
that there can be good ones like there are like there's there's some of them yeah it was in the

786
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:35,240
in in in the mostly rotten patch of pcp fans there are a few good ones yeah it was it was a really

787
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:41,560
good con um literally everyone there was great and no one was annoying yeah there was not there was

788
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:46,840
not a single person who was like you know annoying but we couldn't bring ourselves to tell him you

789
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:51,480
know that sort of person who sometimes appears none of none of them were there with that guy and it

790
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:55,880
was just a delight the entire time to get some backstory because i feel like it's important

791
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:00,680
to understand like like the narrative arc of the con because it was you know of course a

792
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:06,120
rowdy fuckers cop clears con you know it was steep and lore and and lore things in rfck narrative

793
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:12,120
arc things happen within said con it was like an arg but in real life uh but but you know i

794
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:18,120
i guess so so wait so so you're saying it was just an arg yeah it was an arg it was a real game yeah

795
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:25,000
and and and so uh i i nest on the pcb is i mean oh maybe like one or two people will want to come

796
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,120
to this from the pcb and they'll be able to be you know indoctrinated into rfck i thought that

797
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,440
was the plan is that it would be like you know because there are a lot of our european rfck

798
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,040
players you know they're shouting yeah there's magic there's a lot of people i thought would be

799
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:44,600
coming uh none of them came besides magics and it was like ten hardcore pcb heads you're not gonna

800
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:50,760
believe this but there was at least one person who was just a knight head oh my god what was he

801
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:57,080
doing there the most oppressed minority we have to liberate them it's not fair wait when you say he

802
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:03,240
was just a knight head do you mean that he like didn't even watch the pcb well no he he described

803
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:08,920
himself as a knight yeah he introduced himself as a knight and he did expect the abuse okay

804
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:15,240
do you know his name i'm just curious who this person is his is cake okay okay this is internet

805
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:22,520
handle uh so so so we i post the link on the on the pcb channel people start with loading in with

806
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:31,480
was it they call him cake my favorite uh my favorite uh huge huge tits uh nsf w twitter artists

807
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:35,400
that's a god i don't know why you even just said that that's terrible anyway i don't know i just

808
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:42,040
wanted to plug my boy people started flooding in to the meetup channel and they all these anime

809
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:48,680
avatars they were saying memes and it was just oh god i can feel my life draining from my body

810
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:53,560
knowing that i was gonna have to interact with pcb fans and it was going to ruin my entire day

811
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:59,640
having to deal with like the meme or the antagonistic memers and the anime avatar of wielding mother

812
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:05,960
fuckers who uh watching pcb it's gonna be a nightmare i was dreading it and of course of

813
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:11,240
course any freddy it's called out for being the epitome of a pcb fan on this very show a couple

814
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:17,080
a couple episodes ago and you know i was dreading the entire experience but we get here we unload

815
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:23,000
and immediately you know there are people who are like oh yeah i'm a pcb head but you know i

816
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,440
had to very least i i checked out a little bit the wiki i checked out a little bit of you know i

817
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:32,280
joined the server and i read a little bit of orientation and i don't ask for much that display

818
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:38,520
of at least willingness that curiosity that that that that a gumption inside that entrepreneurial

819
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:43,800
spirit yeah literally yes they are able to recognize that you know you should at least try

820
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,360
to understand anything rfck that loosened me up a little bit and throughout the day as we

821
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:53,160
shared our pain our growing pains together all the joys and the ups and the downs that we experienced

822
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:57,640
throughout the day i became closer to these people and i consider i consider these misfits

823
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:03,000
these these uh these sicko fans these insane pcb heads who were sucking my dick the entire time i

824
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,240
consider them family you know what they were great they were great that's great beautiful beautiful

825
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:13,800
by the way i'm looking at this image gift posted of him in uh oh sorry the lord of ghosts and you

826
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,440
know i just know no this is very specific this is the cool lord of ghosts yeah sunglasses now

827
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:23,960
i just i want to mention ben wedges describing the picture let me finish describing the picture

828
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,920
yeah yeah on on the right is the cool lord of ghosts after the lord of ghosts got a fucked up

829
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:33,080
i'm in retreat the sewers we in the cool over ghosts he's just vacationing right yeah okay and

830
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:40,600
and next to next to him on the left is communist a frame who no no relation really yeah uh who has

831
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,640
who who went around all day wearing that and holding a boombox from the 80s that was playing

832
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:51,800
like radio static and then occasionally you can't inquire me by the way i just want to illustrate

833
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:57,080
that it was it was so hot that day and the and his hat was so tight that he had to leave the con

but left the internet i mean i just haven't seen him in a while so that was great and of course

865
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:07,960
of course uh my right hand man and brimstone programmer magix rambage there works in the game

866
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:13,960
magix by the way excruciatingly german by the way it's you can only see his face because he's

867
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:21,400
hidden by gibbon takes a nametag but he is like literally like craft work like if you

868
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:28,040
would condense craft work into like a human being that is him magix it was insane i couldn't believe

869
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:35,160
by the way magix got me magix uh messaged me about sly moids we talked about sly moids

870
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,480
because he i remember right from the very beginning magix was magix was all on

871
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:45,800
the sly moid update and sly and like maximizing his sly moid stats so he messaged me about it

872
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:51,480
yesterday and to talk about like updates and he got me into the new the devs or the new

873
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,520
i didn't realize i didn't realize that development had just like shifted to a new server i thought i

874
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,240
thought i was dead i told the steal a while ago but i can understand that it wouldn't have clicked

875
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:06,520
maybe i have well you well you told me that the new server was for like testing and i was like

876
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:11,960
well i don't yeah so i okay but whatever so i'm in there now let me give a quick verbal lashing

877
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:18,200
to farafrog bro what are you doing being like the kirito of the group get in there and get some skin

878
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:24,760
on skin contact my dude you should agree but on the other hand he looks like he looks like a little

879
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:31,000
baby yeah exactly no he wasn't he wasn't actually there this is a component i'll crop this in later

880
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,600
he voted you photoshopped him in yeah okay you know what now i see it now i see it who is who is that

881
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:41,640
kake made this and he photoshopped the people in who is left at this point the nade head making the

882
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:46,520
best content to come out of it that's what i like to see my who is who is that ghost who is that ghost

883
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:51,240
in the pillar that's got to be any friend of course yeah okay and at the bottom of course you

884
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:57,480
can see that antifred has been unblocked by the administrator oh so so to give more context on

885
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:04,520
antifred it in his journey so of course he gets called out mercilessly beaten and shackling crucified

886
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:11,560
on the pc and p in absolute like the passion on display there unrivaled and and so he sets out to

887
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:18,840
not become the of why i referred him as the epitome of our pc p fans okay the worst thing

888
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:27,320
that's so sad and and so i joined the surfer i don't trust him so i ban him i banish him immediately

889
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:33,560
yeah okay and and he says munchie how do i become a ratty how what can i do and i said you have to

890
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:40,680
prove to me that you're not a pcp head you have to recite to me one event from rfck history at

891
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:46,360
rfckcon just one that's all i asked for and and and then i'll know that you're not a pcp head

892
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:51,880
for you know what did he say the can the cancer is it isn't fully hit you and so and so he said okay

893
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:56,680
i'll do such we meet up in the beginning antifred comes over he says i have i have a speech prepared

894
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:02,760
and when i do it i need you to hold me up so everyone will hear and i said of course i wouldn't i

895
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:07,480
wouldn't plan anything other yeah so so it gets later in the day you know we're saving with the

896
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:13,960
perfect moment and and and we are outside the the british museum in front of like a crowd of people

897
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:18,840
there like like behind us this is like big public square and then i hold up antifred and you are

898
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:25,320
able to see the photos and videos of such antifred's redemption where he just reads aloud a a wiki

899
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:30,920
article that he had memorized about the food shortages the first line the first line of which

900
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:39,160
is after bin sain raises food prices to ludicrous levels a strike conducted socialism at work ladies

901
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:47,000
and gents speak speaking of which munchie i've had this idea this past week i i want to like wouldn't

902
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:56,520
it be great i know i want to make it communism i want to make communism in uh rfck like like i i don't

903
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:02,600
i was thinking about how i could do it but no no no no shut up i mean i was thinking about ways

904
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:07,400
that i could do it on on the killers only but i was like well would it be unbalanced i was just

905
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:12,520
thinking about like what if we like what if we had like uh i don't know some sort of like we just

906
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:17,240
changed how like killer slime calculation works so that like it was like the average of all killers

907
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:22,840
or something or like some fraction of the team of like the team slime would like became the functional

908
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:28,520
number or something or maybe some form of universal basic income where like every killer

909
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:34,360
about every every newly enlisted killer gets like gets like a stipend gets like a lot of his utopia

910
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:39,720
inside of surely i think it would be really funny okay and also i literally think it would work and

911
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,960
make the team better and be proof of coming to communism works this is this is a fascinating

912
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:49,560
point ben because i i just i think i have to say that like if you instituted a policy such as that

913
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:54,040
i think that you would find an organization that is obviously cut through capitalist immoral

914
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:59,560
agency such as slime corp just as we theorize what happened in real life if you were to institute

915
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:06,280
that this corporation would leave slime city if you're going to attempt to co-opt their their profits

916
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:13,080
and uh i these are these are my profits we're i can do what i want with my slime in the anarcho

917
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:17,880
capitalist nightmare that is new los angeles we're talking about things that aren't terrible

918
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:23,000
right now we can come back to terrible things later yeah okay agreed agreed well well i want

919
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:29,000
but i wanted to do that but then i was like that would be too good literally communism would be too

920
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,480
powerful and it would make the killers so powerful that they could not be defeated you know i would

921
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,480
be completely unbalanced i mean you're the leader of the killers do whatever you want uh that would

922
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:43,000
be interesting to see i guess what happens you know uh as an experiment if nothing else um

923
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,840
shit i shouldn't have said anything i should have just done it you can cut it out you can cut

924
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:52,600
this part out tell oblivion well now munchie knows oh yeah uh not now i'll be able to institute

925
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:58,280
communists and communism dammit you came in this this idea this idea that no one's ever tried

926
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:02,840
communism is so good i shouldn't have said anything because it's guaranteed to work when we

927
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:10,520
yeah dammit ben ben saint inventor of communism it's to protect his intellectual property

928
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:17,880
hey hey ben i i sent you i sent you like audio uh a content after the last episode recorded

929
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:23,800
did you ever get around to reading listen to that wait you did yeah and you said oh yeah i'll for

930
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:31,080
sure listen to this uh wait okay sounds like he didn't is the obvious answer let's make a whole

931
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:37,640
rfck thing wait what was it what was it it was it's like like like history through oh yeah yeah

932
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:45,160
no i did i listened to all you did yeah yeah did you like it did you like it yeah i did um the most

933
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:49,320
yeah i actually listened to a bunch of the ones like in between like i listened to the whole

934
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:54,040
series wait what what is this what did he what did he do so last last episode he was telling me about

935
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:59,480
this podcast called revolutions yeah he was like i think you'd have some uh interesting bits about

936
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:04,600
the the russian revolution here yeah i want to i really want to hear more of it i was disappointed

937
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:08,360
that like the series isn't done yet because i want to listen to the whole thing the most

938
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:15,800
interesting thing about it was the um the paris communes oh oh do you know do you know about

939
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:22,600
the story about that well like the story behind it kind i mean i i basically only know what they

940
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:28,840
said about it in this series and i feel like there's a lot more to it that they know i i i beg you

941
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:33,400
please let me talk to you about it later this is outside the scope of this episode right now okay

942
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:38,360
but it's very interesting and it would be and it'd be yeah anyway uh that was that was the most

943
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:42,920
interesting part and that was what got me i want to know more about this uh yeah i listen to listen

944
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:47,080
to everything i will tell you yeah yeah uh we'll talk about more later anyway uh and i hold up any

945
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:53,720
friend he recites his speech and immediately upon him doing so i lay him down i throw him down on the

946
01:29:53,720 --> 01:30:00,600
fucking ground i punt him and then i i unban him from the rice and so now annie fred he is roaming

947
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:05,560
around the streets of new lestadule city a proud rowdy eager for knowledge and curious about the

948
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:09,560
history and lore that has come behind him this is how you do it guys this is how you become

949
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:14,040
this is how you get on munchies good side this is how you become best friends with your god idol

950
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:20,440
munchie shatski is you just show any curiosity whatsoever and you're fucking all bones of your

951
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:28,120
body is you even just try to be a good person i will shower you and enjoy and lollipops by the way

952
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:34,520
even more interesting than that is a fairfrog is annie fred's friend who was whisked to this con

953
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:40,600
by annie fred and fairfrog has just become a foil to annie fred just because he's his friend

954
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:47,480
and so now a fairfrog is a huge killer with like like mega slimes only trying to destroy

955
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:53,160
annie fred's good time well good glad to hear how did that happen that was so on brand

956
01:30:53,160 --> 01:31:00,360
so on brand uh there was the twins as well oh yeah okay the two twins one is a rowdy one is a killer

957
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:05,400
yeah it's just like all this all this duality going on too much as you can see i'm pretty sure it's

958
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:11,880
callum and happy callum k64 unhappy yeah they are twins and i don't know if it's communicated in this

959
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:16,200
photo that you're able to see right now in in the show notes oh yeah but they like look exactly the

960
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:21,560
same i see in person they looked exactly the same and they sounded the same and they just were the

961
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:26,920
same person and and yet one's a killer and one's a rowdy just just touch you know just like like

962
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:32,280
one one leaf blew in a different direction for one of them in their crib and their life was irreparably

963
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:38,280
changed forever like just like this is butterfly effect in action people completely different

964
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:44,840
results from the same upbringing and same genetic code it's all it's all about that nurture when it

965
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:50,040
comes making a rowdy or a killer well it looks like this is a this is an outstanding success of an

966
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:55,960
event despite it being so many pcp heads yeah yeah but did you make any money oh did you make any of

967
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:01,480
that sticky icky cashish munchie no we didn't make any money because because we're friends now because

968
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:07,400
we're friends what was the point i asked you what was out of here oh oh by the way i also want to

969
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:13,160
reiterate that that this was uh you know on the fourth of july and we were walking around london

970
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:16,760
and and there was absolutely no reference to it as i assumed there would be you know i didn't

971
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:23,960
think there would be except for one alone cinema in the london china town and there was a cinema

972

01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:51,640
have been walking around london with a bag full of those throwing at the feet of every fucking

978

in a powdered wig with a bayonet just stabbing people i mean not even untrue not even untrue

983
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:26,360
listen this entire trip i've been i've been trying to restrain myself not even a very good job at

984
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:32,040
because it's just so grass but a graphine to say like oh things are different here yeah uh it's so

01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:36,360
much fun and i love it and it's great my favorite parts of the con when they'd be like oh you're

986
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:40,760
certainly such an american right now i'm like oh i'm different than people in certain ways of my

987
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:45,560
speech and it's cool it feels it feels good man it's it's interesting to see that's one of my

988
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:50,120
favorite things about when i went to japan it's just such a fucking i mean it's pretty similar

989
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:55,000
it's very business capitalistic i don't know fucking go buy two shops do cool things but

990
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:01,560
it's the culture man we're most of the attendees uh from england are they yes almost exclusively

991
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,720
yeah okay i only magics was from anywhere else in europe i'm pretty sure and where was he from

992
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:10,360
again we're germany you said right oh no lemontarp lemontarp's from i was gonna say i was gonna say

993
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:16,760
i thought i thought lemontart was there lemontarp's from from spain okay that's cool that's cool i mean

994
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,920
for them that's like a what like a 10-minute bike ride to get to england as i understand it yeah it's

995
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:26,840
um that's pretty cool yeah it's just a hop skip and a jump so fucking e you shrinking the dimensions

996
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:32,200
of the world i oppose that policy but fucking e you making it easier to go on vacation mother

997
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:38,920
fucking globalist fucking parentheses parentheses parentheses globalist you said it

998
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:45,080
fucking up the discourse it was it was a great time i mean there's just a thousand and more things

999
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:49,880
that we could say i mean it was an actual packed event filled day yeah no not even just that day

1000
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:54,920
like the the the other days that we've been spending just doing like time has frozen we've

1001
01:34:54,920 --> 01:35:01,160
been doing so fucking much lately it's it's it's felt incredible it's felt really good oh one thing

1002
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:07,480
i want to mention um is that we were doing just before we started recording uh recording something

1003
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:11,880
that i've wanted to do all the time and you brought up which is what we just we were working on our

1004
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:17,640
laptops doing writing things in the same room but not talking to one another and and i was introduced

1005
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:24,440
to this concept many years ago as a child watching autopimp videos autopimp as this person would read

1006
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,160
homestuck comics right and voice act for the characters and there was one famous homestuck

1007
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:34,600
comic about dave stealing terezi's panties and then all the homestuck guys wearing their panties

1008
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:41,240
feels good for them the point is is that the first panel solex and i think someone else is like like

1009
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:48,200
decoding on their computer on their laptop on a bed or on the side of the bed and then on top

1010
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,400
of the bed is john carcat playing super smash brothers and the idea that you can be with your

1011
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:59,480
friends but then also working while they're playing video games that just is like the

1012
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:05,880
best thing i can fucking imagine that's that's what my entire life right now is me doing something

1013
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:11,320
else while my friends are in the room doing a thing together and me i've never done that before

1014
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:18,040
not it's so it's my favorite thing it's my favorite thing in the entire world it's so good

1015
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:23,240
it's like perfect how was like humans were not meant for such a height man was not meant for such

1016
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:28,200
a height yeah men will tower at the site this is what my whole entire teen years looked like

1017
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:37,160
basically uh digi thank you for it anyway we were doing it and it was great i was able to

1018
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:41,160
just like work on work on in this work coding and hippo was able to i don't know do what the

1019
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:48,040
fucking yeah you know just i'm just writing thinking of of characters and and arcs and acts

1020
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:55,880
and beginnings middles and ends i i speaking of that is like a brief aside um i've i've learned

1021
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:01,080
that like the whole like a story has to have a beginning a middle and an end is like in it like

1022
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:07,560
you hear that and you're like duh but what does it mean and i've realized what it means uh just in

1023
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:15,000
like i put it in words that actually makes sense uh story has a pay a setup uh a suspense and a payoff

1024
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:21,240
if you get rid of any one of those things uh it's not satisfying like if you get rid of the payoff

1025
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:26,760
this the setup means nothing and the suspense is just sort of like well what happens um if you get

1026
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:31,880
rid of the setup uh you're not invested in the characters or something or yeah people are just

1027
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:36,280
doing stuff and you're just watching them do stuff and then they end doing the stuff uh if you get

1028
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:42,440
rid of the middle there's no suspense there's no uh will they won't they um so like if it starts off

1029
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:47,880
like a guy says i have to avenge my father and then he finds the guy who killed his father

1030
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:53,880
like one second later and kills him that would be like if you got rid of the middle uh so uh writing

1031
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:02,280
cool hell yeah i i i realized that if if if a piece of media is missing like something fundamental

1032
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:07,480
is usually one of those three things or is like lacking in one of those departments it's like

1033
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:13,560
yeah that's what beginning middle end means uh is to have the setup be paid off but also have

1034
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:18,360
suspense as to whether they will do it what uh what brought up this this thinking on this particular

1035
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:24,200
subject if anything uh cuz cuz i've been writing like crazy like writing like 18 different stories

1036
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:30,600
like different comics uh you know i'm just i'm just feeling very typey feeling very textual

1037
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:36,600
great sounds like you're shaking off your your doldrums a little bit well there's there's that

1038
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:45,960
i mean i i feel like i'm getting good at good at writing but the the thing that i've come into

1039
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:52,600
like this is like getting me a little bit is i'm not you i'm not really the right man for the job

1040
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:58,760
to write to to draw these comics because i can't draw that well and i would need to take time away

1041
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:06,040
from what i'm doing to get good and i it annoys me that that's the case like i'm writing all

1042
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:09,880
these stories and i'm coming up with these specific types of characters and then i try to draw them

1043
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:18,280
and they look like cartoon stupid stickman it's like ah i suppose i know the feel uh so i'm i'm

1044
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:23,800
looking for artists you know i've been thinking about this is the thought i had recently that like

1045
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:30,680
there's probably so many good ideas for stories that like let me put it this way more people

1046
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:36,280
need to like sell each other ideas and like just or like team up because like there's so many people

1047
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:40,600
who probably think like oh i have this amazing idea for a novel i'm gonna try to write it but

1048
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:46,920
it's like your writing voice doesn't really match the story and it's like oh if you just pass this

1049
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:52,680
to somebody who whose voice would match the story it would be good but because you feel like you

1050
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:58,920
have to write it because it was your idea then you know it's gonna come out like shit and like

1051
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:03,880
in different worlds this is commonplace like you know in the world of music ghost writing is

1052
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:09,640
commonplace you know people um there was just an album that came out of prince songs where

1053
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:13,160
it was a whole album of songs he had written for other people but it was like his original

1054
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:18,280
performances of them um like that he had sent to those people so they could do it and it's like

1055
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:24,760
you know all these major stars who he just wrote songs that didn't really fit his style like they

1056
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:29,240
wouldn't have sounded right on a prince album so he just gave them to people who it would sound

1057
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:34,200
right coming from and it's like they're all majorly successful because they match that person's

1058
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:40,440
style it's like you know i i've had a lot of ideas for stories myself that like i can't write

1059
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:46,520
because just my writing style is it just doesn't match the tone of the story but like it's it's

1060
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:52,280
got some kind of core idea that i want to be communicated that i wish it existed it doesn't

1061
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:57,880
have to be from me but at the same time i don't like trust anybody to be able to deliver on it if

1062
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:01,880
i don't like you know work with someone closely know that they're professional know that they

1063
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:07,400
can do it well and that takes time to investigate which can be a real uh wall in uh in do even if

1064
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:10,840
you're interested in doing that and even just finding people who want to write somebody else's

1065
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:15,880
thing who are actually competent writers you know like yes i've i've had people online like when i

1066
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:20,120
talked about an idea for a story who are like ooh can i try to write that and i say sure and

1067
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:26,360
then they do it and i'm like okay well you know i could have done better than this so like you

1068
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:30,680
know i'd want it to be somebody who was actually good but most people who are good want to write

1069
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:36,600
their own stories you know that's true you know i think a part of this comes from excessive pride

1070
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:41,400
of people feeling that there's no way that someone else could ever do the job that they want to do

1071
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:47,400
100 on their own and i heard a great quote that i'm sure is based on like real actual like i don't

1072
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:52,280
know ancient chinese wisdom or something from avatar i was saying this yesterday but like i was

1073
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:57,720
watching avatar clips of uncle iro the wisest mother fucker whoever lived uh great show 10 out of 10

1074
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:03,320
literally perfect and uh he said an amazing line that like i said i'm sure this has been passed

1075
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:09,240
around for generations and but i heard it from iro in avatar and it was azuko was going on about how

1076
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:14,360
like uh iro was saying like oh you're full of uh you're full of shame zuko you got to get over

1077
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:18,280
this well so that you can like you know shoot lightning or whatever and so it was like i don't

1078
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:25,400
feel any shame i'm as proud as ever and then iro said a genius fucking line that was pride is not

1079
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:32,360
the opposite of shame but is its source only by embracing true humility are you able to let go

1080
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:38,600
of your feelings of shame and this for me was a very profound thing to think about and i don't know

1081
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:43,800
i feel like when it comes to like my content creation as a whole i do think that i'm too proud

1082
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:48,440
on a lot of things and that uh i don't know i that that had a lot of value to me and i think is

1083
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:53,400
relevant to this overall question of like working with other people and allowing others to have any

1084
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:57,720
impact on your work if your goal is it depends on your on your goal is your goal is to be vain

1085
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:01,960
and just make your perfect project and take as long as it takes to be the one who did everything

1086
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:08,280
that's cool if instead your goal is to like produce as much great content in your lifetime as possible

1087
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:12,520
you should definitely incorporate the talents of other people and find ways to do it

1088
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:17,080
uh and not let your pride get the best of you so thanks uncle iro i obviously maybe this is

1089
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:22,600
obvious but i think i've in a way i've done more collaboration than most of us in this group because

1090
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:28,840
i've always had editors you know like i had davoo edit a lot of my videos and like davoo had offered

1091
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:34,680
to edit for other people sometimes and like i know you jesse hippo like all of you like the

1092
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:39,960
editing tossed around the idea well so for you guys the editing is so integral to the process of

1093
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:44,600
even creating in the first place like you have an image of what the finished thing you're supposed

1094
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:50,600
to look like in your mind already for my videos a lot of it is just i just write a thing and then

1095
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:55,880
i look at it i go okay what would i set to this and then a lot of it i have no fucking idea i'm

1096
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:01,000
like oh shit i did not think about how this would look on screen so if i pass it to somebody who's

1097
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:09,080
good at taking a paragraph and figuring out what to show then you know it's perfect so that's that

1098
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:13,960
is what ultimately i plan to do with we agua because i do not make those with a vision in mind

1099
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:19,080
i want to eventually have a editor i currently have uh you know may edits all the manga monday's

1100
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:23,880
videos for exactly that reason it's just like i i just sit in front of a camera and talk about it

1101
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:31,080
she listens to the video anything in like i've also gotten into a style of showing myself on

1102
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:36,680
camera so that i don't have to have images for every single second of the video you know yeah

1103
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:40,680
because it's unnecessary people don't need that much to pay attention they just want enough to

1104
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:46,360
to you know to shake it up so there's some pacing to be able to see the thing you're talking about

1105
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:54,120
people are perfectly happy to watch a video of someone's face talking to them because it's exciting

1106
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:58,840
especially no editing required if it's somebody who is you know interesting to watch or has a

1107
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:04,040
charismatic speaking voice or you have a good set good background you know but like i want the the

1108
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:08,040
images in there just so you have a sense of what i'm talking about so you can picture it you can

1109
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:12,680
know what it is um you know see some exciting stuff and of course again the pacing it helps

1110
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:18,120
with that like if there's an image every say 30 seconds or so then you never feel like you're

1111
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:23,880
just watching a guy talk but like when you try to pack a video with images every single second

1112
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:30,280
it's like some of those sentences just don't have an interesting visual for them you know yeah um

1113
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:36,200
so like then you get those retarded like super literal like and that's what opened the door

1114
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:43,560
image of door slowly zoom in on the yeah yeah i think those are funny sometimes but sometimes yeah

1115
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:47,800
i mean if you're like a jack is boy who like makes fun of that kind of stuff intentionally

1116
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:52,360
i can get way into it but that that's a lampooning that's uh you know so like the way that i've been

1117
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:59,000
doing the the manga monday's videos is like i will record my review you know and then just edit

1118
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:05,560
edit it down give it to her she then listens to it takes notes on like anything i say that

1119
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:10,840
should be visualized then she reads the manga behind because like you know obviously i have to

1120
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:16,440
read it before i do the video she doesn't read it till after watching the video so that she can

1121
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:22,360
just while reading put post-its in the book and uh and then just shoot you know all those parts so

1122
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:28,120
it's like that collaboration it literally cuts the time because if i were to do that like i don't

1123
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:34,120
know what i'm gonna say before i read the book so i can't make those kind of notes i can't sit

1124
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:38,760
there and put post-its in i guess if i was like saying ooh i'll probably mention this but like

1125
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:43,080
i really don't know what i'm gonna say so it's a lot easier for somebody to go in behind me and

1126
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:48,040
that way i don't have to reread the whole fucking manga you know if we both get the experience of

1127
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:53,640
hey we got to read a cool manga i get to work on a different project and not edit this one it's just

1128
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:58,040
all around yeah keep the pipeline going yeah makes sense that's why i like uh working with editors

1129
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:02,600
i mean that was always the appeal of working with divu was that like i you know i could just move

1130
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:08,840
on to the next project while he goes and edits that one i crave that i crave that uh reality yeah

1131
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:13,960
yeah though the way i've been doing uh today's anime is that i just screen record while i'm

1132
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:19,720
watching the shows so that i have all the footage ready and then i just you know sprinkle a little

1133
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:27,000
bit in in the edit but uh those are not like yeah i should do that oh you know what you know what

1134
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,000
wait on specifically that uh you know michelle had a little bit of feedback for you on that

1135
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,280
specifically and she said that she thought that putting the date was she has watched all of those

1136
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:41,080
i think but she said that it was a little bit off putting to have the dates and for some reason it

1137
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:46,280
feels like it cheapens the experience and she suggested leaving it as just the like the subject

1138
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:51,560
matter and leaving those offers specifically marketing purposes to make the video feel more

1139
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:55,880
whatever so there's your feedback i don't know take it or leave it timeless yeah timeless that's a

1140
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:00,200
good that's a good word for it i i mean i agree that it would make it feel more timeless i think

1141
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:08,360
that the reason i'm doing it is so that i i have this weird tendency that i am overly honest with

1142
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:13,560
my video titles no matter how quickly i try to make them like i want to communicate to you that

1143
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:18,120
hey this is just me reacting to the shows that happen to come out today you know yeah i know what

1144
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:22,760
you mean um and like it also kind of helps with you logically understanding why i'm talking about

1145
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:28,200
these shows in particular you know um yeah there's a there's a that question of like how

1146
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:33,960
quote-unquote honest do i want to be like ideally we should probably make every video we produce

1147
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:39,000
sound like the greatest video ever in the title as some people do and you know the problem is a

1148
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,480
lot of people do that and as far as i can tell they really it's not even that they don't feel

1149
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:48,440
shame it's that to them like this is obviously the right thing to do and like why would they

1150
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:54,920
even question that no it is because like i historically i feel like this this strange

1151
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:59,720
sense of like i want to stratify the content so that people know at a glance like if they're about

1152
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:06,120
to click on something that's you know high level or low level effort but most people can't actually

1153
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:12,120
tell the difference and the works against us right the reactions people like if you don't tell them

1154
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:17,560
this is low level content and you let them come to their own conclusions like first of all there

1155
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:21,960
are some people who are going to think something i did spend a lot of time on is low level content

1156
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:25,880
like there's there's going to be people who you know are going to rag on the thing even if i thought

1157
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:31,160
it was good but yeah and then vice versa there's people who just they don't come in with the

1158
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:37,560
presupposition that this is an under underdone video and so they end up enjoying it more so

1159
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:42,520
yeah i definitely agree that putting the dates on there probably does cheap in it i

1160
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:47,000
it would feel weird to me to not do it just because it puts them in order it's basically

1161
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:53,800
like saying like numbering the episodes but um yeah i don't know if they probably are unnecessary

1162
01:49:53,800 --> 01:50:00,680
so i mean i definitely debated removing like i put we agua at the end of we agua episodes

1163
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:05,560
and i don't know my whole thought process is is really all about stratifying that content as you

1164
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:11,880
said is like this is we agua it's not that good like don't get excited it's just a we agua episode

1165
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:17,800
there's going to be people who like don't care about gurund laghan and don't care about the best

1166
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:24,040
anime ever video and then you make a we agua about like say mob psycho and like that's their

1167
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:28,360
favorite anime and it doesn't matter that it wasn't as detailed a video that's their favorite video

1168
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:32,920
because it's about mob psycho or yeah because it made a point that they hadn't thought about

1169
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:40,280
and the other video didn't you know yep yep so it's a it's a real it's a complicated dance

1170
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:45,880
so i do think i would say it is in everyone's best interest to just title every video as though it

1171
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:51,080
were as though it were you know completely meant to stand on its own it's not being compared to

1172
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:57,480
anything else yeah yeah maybe this is that pride i don't know it's it's it's definitely that pride

1173
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:02,520
because i that's exactly how i feel like i feel this yeah but again and it has nothing to do with

1174
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:08,360
how i expect the audience to react it's entirely based on my feelings towards the product i will

1175
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:14,600
hamstring my own marketing just because i'm not proud of the video and it's uh it's foolish yeah

1176
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:20,600
yeah anyway fascinating voicemails i guess everybody else is asleep yeah yeah i'm ready

1177
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:26,600
i'm ready uh let's uh what i put that okay here we go how many how many voicemails we got i've got

1178
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:33,080
i've got nine voicemails oh i must say wait hold on wait one second sure i just want to say that on

1179
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:39,800
the subject of manga monday's anime reviews shimibakas akira coming out soon oh yeah oh my god

1180
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:44,920
hey did you guys hear they're making an akira anime that's gonna be more true to the manga yeah i saw

1181
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:51,400
i was fascinating yeah it we i had no idea that it took place in 2019 oh my it does ah

1182
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:59,160
what if akira what if akira was an anime imagine that what if i mean it's gonna be it's gonna be

1183
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:04,120
way quote unquote worse like moment to moment but it probably will have you know more information so

1184
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:09,960
so that's cool i don't say as somebody who has read the manga like yeah the movie is amazing as a

1185
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:16,040
technical showcase the manga is a much more interesting story so i believe i think if they

1186
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:21,720
uh i believe that completely only have watched the movie that movie so good though the movie only

1187
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:29,400
adapts the first two out of the six volumes of the manga what what yeah yeah i gotta read the first

1188
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:34,520
two volumes and then it just kind of skips to the like it incorporates the ending in a different way

1189
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:41,720
into the ending of volume two but the manga goes complete basically after the city gets destroyed

1190
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:46,360
is a whole post apocalyptic storyline that is like the bulk of the actual narrative

1191
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:54,760
damn yeah i gotta i gotta get in on that i'm a mango man i think you only takes a day to read

1192
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:59,480
plow through it yeah it's one of my favorites so so on the subject of the voicemails though

1193
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:05,000
let me just say that things i was feeling a bit of despair last episode you know all voicemails

1194
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:11,480
are shit hashtag uh voicemail lives don't matter but the good news is oh i distinctly better batch

1195
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:18,360
this week yeah yeah i i i forget if it was cake i don't want to misattribute to him and and to uh

1196
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:26,040
out him as an anti a trader and a head but someone at ars k con i believe it was cake the

1197
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:30,360
native head tree yeah yeah says something the effect of it's better when you pick the voicemails

1198
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:36,840
munchies oh that as a badge of honor some native it wasn't cake i'm using your words to to drive a

1199
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:42,840
knife run into your father's heart and you know what that's fine i'll i'll cry later uh let me

1200
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:49,240
just say and you know there was a message from nate's number one fan that okay it was it was

1201
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:54,840
interesting and it was good but the thing is like it's gonna sound weird but like it sounded great

1202
01:53:54,840 --> 01:54:00,520
and interesting there was clearly a lot of work into it but the actual audio quality was simply

1203
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:05,560
unintelligible and i couldn't like the microphone he was recording on was way too bad i could hear

1204
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:11,000
like music and like things happening in the background nate's number one fan try again

1205
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:16,600
and fix your audio because it sounded cool so like whatever that was i want to hear it as it was

1206
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:22,600
supposed to sound um and also requiem for a meme called back but i'm not going to play his because

1207
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:27,960
it was way too rambling and a bunch of personal details that like are fine uh he was like people

1208
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:32,520
do this where they'll like call in and try to like follow up when we respond to them they're always

1209
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:37,640
boring you're always boring when you do these like follow-ups on the details i'm sure they're

1210
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:41,560
really important to your personal narrative of whatever but don't even bother because it's

1211
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:47,240
boring and and a lot of people have been asking what makes a good fucking voicemail this is the

1212
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:52,600
answer entertainment value in whatever that may be so just be entertaining and you're

1213
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:59,720
miscellaneous you're about to play a voicemail that was the answer um maybe maybe okay but you

1214
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:04,280
know what let me just play the first one which is uh oh you know you're absolutely right about that

1215

1252
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:34,040
right underneath that let's just put a link to the voice grail or the voice jail what if we

1253
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:39,960

1254
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:45,080
slips of paper and like a grail i mean okay that's true but that requires effort a word

1255
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:51,960
doc we pay a guy to do that kind of effort um i guess uh you know what i will paste a png of a

1256
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:57,880
grail into the word document and a picture of a jail that'll be increasing its production

1257
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:04,840
value by ten thousand percent that's correct all right we'll do that for now um okay next one is

1258
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:08,600
okay okay this one's long we're not going to play the whole thing but it's uh this is an

1259
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:15,080
actually good topic nate is the name of the voice spell okay so go so this is an argument i've been

1260
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:21,720
having with my friends for uh the last few days and i felt like ben because i was explaining my

1261
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:28,840
point and they didn't get it and i would just get angrier and angrier uh my relative like ben

1262
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:34,920
i think it's fucking illogical to believe or to think that because somebody dresses up a certain

1263
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:41,480
way or looks sharp they will immediately and objectively do a better job than anybody else

1264
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:47,480
in the same position just because of how they look like i was telling my friends you know it's

1265
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:51,560
it's completely baseless like there is a societal expectation that certain jobs

1266
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:58,760
demand certain appearances and my point was never that there aren't any benefits to doing that

1267
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:03,880
or that it's detrimental in any way i think just think it's it's illogical and i don't i don't

1268
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:09,640
and your friends sound retarded so easy okay i'm gonna he goes on in that way for a while

1269
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:15,000
that's enough i kind of wanted to hear what he was trying to say is that his friends seem to think

1270
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:21,880
that if you are better dressed you will just do your job better than someone who is not better

1271
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:26,120
dressed and he was trying to really doesn't clarify any more beyond that yeah he was trying to argue

1272
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:32,600
with them that that is not necessarily the case that that's that there there may be advantages to

1273
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:37,480
dressing up but it doesn't mean that you will automatically be better than someone who is not

1274
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:43,400
dressed there are i mean in a job that involves like dealing with people there is probably a

1275
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:48,680
reasonable expectation that you should right but it's not there's no guarantee like there's no

1276
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:55,320
reason to think that somebody who isn't dressed up can't by way of some other methodology that they

1277
02:00:55,320 --> 02:01:01,080
have some other technique they know be better at it you know that it might be i mean i would

1278
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:07,480
i would make if you're a guy if you're a guy like trying to sell stuff and like um you're

1279
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:11,960
you're you're you're you know really sharply dressed but you're not charismatic the charismatic

1280
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:17,720
guy is going to win i mean even if even if even if he has a wrinkly shirt and he's like but he's

1281
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:22,760
if he's like the life of the street he's just like yelling and it's really selling you on these things

1282
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:29,000
saying ding ding if you're saying ding ding real loud i mean out outside the context of the job

1283
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:35,000
it doesn't matter how they dress if if i'm like hiring someone for a job i want to see them and i

1284
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,120
want to see them present themselves like in a way that is like yeah this is what i expect i have

1285
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:47,960
never seen a better salesman or marketing genius than the shirtless guy standing outside of otacon

1286
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:59,160
and brony con that guy is not dressed up at all in fact he is wearing less clothes than most people

1287
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:04,760
dude no he's dressed for the job he wants yeah i would have to agree he's dressed for he's dressed

1288
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:09,640
for success in his field have you ever heard there's a legendary moment in are you guys familiar

1289
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:17,080
with internet historians videos um there's a moment i believe it's um dash con uh the the tumblr

1290
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:21,160
meetup where uh there's there's a guy filming and there's just a moment where he goes up to a man

1291
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:27,320
dressed as the devil and he goes up and he says to him famously sir so what made you want a cosplay

1292
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:32,840
as the prime minister of israel and the the devil replies back well i always heard growing up that

1293
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:38,200
you got to dress for the job you want and that was one of the most legend like this was at dash

1294
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:45,000
con i was expecting a pure cringe i got legitimate comedy gold so shout out to that guy that guy

1295
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:51,000
that guy really nailed it also uh israel's not a legitimate state uh your death israel long live

1296
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:57,880
palestine uh you know you know how it is but anyway um next voicemail uh yes next voicemail

1297
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:04,120
next one is from dj jesse jess oh wait wait sorry i was just gonna say uh on the on the actual

1298
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:07,800
subject of that last one i was just gonna say that the the thing that they're your friends are

1299
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:12,920
kind of right about and i would say is there's a general feeling of when when someone like looks

1300
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:17,000
good socially like i don't know like a girl does their makeup they're like in good shape they're

1301
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:22,040
wearing nice clothes i think it's a signifier of general life i think he knows that i mean he was

1302
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:27,800
kind of saying like i was not disagreeing that it has advantages i'm just saying it shows general

1303
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:34,680
life competence but anybody who thinks in those kinds of absolutes is a moron like that is a

1304
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:40,520
normie way of thinking that is why regular people are so dumb is that they can only see things in

1305
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:45,320
that black and white terms if look you have to make assumptions sometime if you go and you see

1306
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:50,120
a bunch of people and you don't know anything about them but one is dressed nice one is dressed

1307
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:56,600
not nice that is a limited selection of information you have and it's reasonable to make a constantly

1308
02:03:56,600 --> 02:04:03,720
changing initial assumption yeah Nate hard agree okay but that's not what did he was saying no i mean

1309
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:09,560
okay it's not everything i agree it it was it was not about like the dressing correctly it's the

1310
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:17,160
fact that if somebody argues a point um and then people assume that that means you're like against

1311
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:21,400
the opposite of that point when you're not actually oh you know okay i guess i misheard or

1312
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:26,680
something like if if you're saying sometimes it's like this and and then the other people like wait

1313
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:31,480
you think it's always like that right right that's what is stupid oh okay i totally missed that i'm

1314
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:36,280
an idiot like like if like if nate says that israel is not a legitimate state that doesn't

1315
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:41,720
necessarily imply anything palestine is a legitimate state yeah yeah none of them we doesn't mean we

1316
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:49,560
shouldn't wipe both of them off the map fair fair um all right dj jesse jess with a voicemail uh

1332
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:22,280
straight going let me tell you sexuality is entirely irrelevant a good honest man a true pillar of

1333
02:06:22,280 --> 02:06:29,160
his community sucks dick and he likes it not because he's gay though he may be but for the

1334
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:35,240
sheer satisfaction it brings him to make the life of his fellow man more pleasurable goodbye

1335
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:39,160
uh can i just get a hard agree

1336
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:48,120
i saw like a post somewhere of like a it's like a model wearing a t-shirt and like

1337
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:53,400
if you know what i'm saying the back the back of the t-shirt it had like a big picture of an ak-47

1338
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:58,760
it was like it was like in protest of uh you know Colin Kaepernick kneeling for the

1339
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:04,200
national anthem or whatever and it's like the only time this patriot kneels is when he's

1340
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:06,200
sucking a hero comes

1341
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:18,360
damn that's multifaceted i didn't know which way that was going i i i'm like i'm not in i'm not

1342
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:23,000
entirely sure if it's ironic it's hard to tell i mean they could just be like a gay you know

1343
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,800
trump or whatever i think probably i think probably but i can't i'm not a hundred percent sure

1344
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:31,080
it's hard to know i don't know not a hundred percent sure like that feels like something

1345
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:36,120
like Milo would wear like he'd wear it relatively unironically but like for everybody else

1346

1348
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:53,080
your parents discovering facebook and now you can't use facebook anymore so you'll have to think

1349
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:58,280
of something you hard agree forever this is not a new thing i know i i know it's not a new thing

1350
02:07:58,280 --> 02:08:06,040

02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:16,440
anymore yeah yeah yeah so watch is like the next voicemail has someone playing the piano

1384
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:22,600
oh wait i just uh hey yeah anything else i gotta delete one real quick just just follow your heart

1385
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:29,160
just follow your heart uh potential uh i would say don't be dispirited if we don't play any individual

1386
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:33,640
one even if you thought it was good i just keep trying and like if it's good it will get played

1387
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:38,840
because there's not that many i play all the good ones basically and it just happens to be between

1388
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:43,560
like five and ten most times i've probably called into biggest problem in the universe slash the

1389
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:50,200
dick show like 11 or up to 15 times over the course of like three years before i finally got played

1390
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:56,040
on the show after i had already been a guest on the show several times it still took me another year

1391
02:11:56,040 --> 02:12:00,680
to get a voicemail that was funny enough to get played on the show and then i nailed the formula

1392
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:07,800
and got played twice so nice nice just gotta do one and done as i understand was uh in and out

1393
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:16,760
what a legend all right next one it's a it's an ironic gang weed guy an ironic gang weed guy

1394
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:24,920
let's see what he has to say okay go attention fellow gamers and gang weed members i've heard

1395
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:33,240
past voicemails about one itis quality woman and guy with generic problem number 137 examined

1396
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:40,680
life of gaming gentlemen have we learned nothing from best anime ever tangentopagar and longing

1397
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:47,400
fuck women and honestly just work on yourselves and let an actually good person come into your life

1398
02:12:48,040 --> 02:12:55,720
screw the yokos and wait for your nias gamers i have essentially had to give up on veronica

1399
02:12:55,720 --> 02:13:03,480
she has been with chat for over a year why even bother with her just because she has huge shits

1400
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:09,080
she probably has a shit personality and has been brainwashed by the government media and corporations

1401
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:14,200
yeah all that matters is being able to say the n word

1402
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:24,840
veronica sounds like a total neoliberal shit so not a fan i would agree i would agree with you on that

1403
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:35,880
yeah man just fucking just fucking wait just wait just hang out just chill out just let don't

1404
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:40,840
don't worry about it let life bring provide you opportunities as you are doing shit to

1405
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:44,760
make your life better and don't ignore them just seize the opportunities when they come to you

1406
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:49,000
that's what most people did throughout history it's not a bad strat and if you feel more desperate

1407
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:53,800
then that's fine devote some of your day to go meeting people you know start well you know the

1408
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:59,400
one thing you can do to make yourself the best you can be is go to go to church start going to

1409
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:05,960
synagogue oh yeah and you're bound to meet the ladies um in temple uh that's what works for me

1410
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:21,960
question reminds me of the number one most pro bully person i know the most pro veronica person

1411
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:28,120
in my life which is michelle uh where as she is absolutely pro bully uh saying various things

1412
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:34,360
like uh those nerds probably deserved it and uh their biggest problem was that they were boring

1413
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:40,520
and uninteresting as opposed to veronica and chad who had more going for them so no wonder those

1414
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:45,480
losers were jealous and you know wanted to be with them because they just don't have as much going

1415
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:53,640
on in their life and you know what hard agree yeah um i want to meet this chad i bet he's not

1416
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:59,560
always cracked up to be oh no he's more than you could ever possibly imagine okay all right whatever

1417
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:06,440
next next call let's go to uh adaptations are always bad okay go so i was recently talking about

1418
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:12,360
different adaptations with my friend like the idea of taking like sequential art such as like

1419
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:17,560
comic and mongas and making into like films and tv series and just from like talking to him

1420
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:23,480
and this is something that i know that i felt in the past he really stressed like this inherent

1421
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:31,640
value of having like a movie or a tv show based on the thing you like and it being good

1422
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:39,160
and it seems to like almost undervalue the actual work itself or the original manga

1423
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:45,560
or comic and i just think that's a really common attitude in like normie culture currently very

1424
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:50,360
much and i was just kind of curious if you guys have noticed this too dude it's yeah if there are

1425
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:55,880
actually any good adaptations of something or superior adaptations that you've experienced

1426
02:15:55,880 --> 02:16:00,520
let me say first of all it really can't think about damn this motherfucker just okay he's done

1427
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:05,480
there are definitely good adaptations that the reason people feel like that is that just more

1428
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:11,640
people watch movies the re comics so like more more people have watched like this i don't know the

1429
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:16,280
fucking avengers movies than ever read the comic i have to talk about the so to most people the

1430
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:20,120
comics just don't matter it's a weird and i'm gonna have been abusing this word today but

1431
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:25,560
stratification that people have in their mind of like how much value they put on each different

1432
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:31,400
type of media because like this is why all these fucking disney live actions have been getting made

1433
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:37,880
because normal people just straight up think that like something being live action just is better

1434
02:16:37,880 --> 02:16:43,240
than if it was animated like regardless of how well do they enjoy the animated version or not

1435
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:48,120
like normie people like when they hear oh this animated thing is gonna become live action they're

1436
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:53,000
like oh it's gonna be a real movie now like that's how they think of it it's like oh wow

1437
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:59,080
they're gonna make Aladdin a real movie and so they watch it and like really really really why

1438
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:04,280
those adaptations exist is so that disney can keep its stranglehold on the copyright well sure

1439
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:09,560
but it's this is why the people get excited for it like it's why they do so well because they do

1440
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:14,360
i oh this is what dude i'm so excited for black ariel dude i can't wait to pay disney more money

1441
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:19,960
to show me black area that is a that is a hard thing for me to swallow ariel being a ginger is

1442
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:25,800
like the most classic ginger ale such a classic architect that's fucking that's fucking stupid

1443
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:30,120
why but anyway why is that stupid because who because who fucking cares i mean her whole family

1444
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:35,720
is gonna change race now because i mean you know her dad so what guess what the movie's gonna suck

1445
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:39,800
and if you see it you're an idiot regardless of how her fucking hair color is the story from

1446
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:44,760
what isn't it from like grease or something i don't know it's french oh my god my historical

1447
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:49,960
accuracy and my fucking fantasy mermaid it doesn't matter don't look at me like like it's weird of

1448
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:54,600
me to feel like well that's a weird reinterpretation of the character it is weird it is weird so it

1449
02:17:54,600 --> 02:18:00,280
what if what if you're the weird would i be weird if repunzel was black like that's such a such a

1450
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:05,640
core feature of the character her long blonde hair why is it so crazy for me to be like ariel

1451
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:10,840
being like a redheaded white dude that's what i do expect that story just would not work if the

1452
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:15,400
hair were black i'm sorry it just it just wouldn't make any sense like i just it would just strain my

1453
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:19,560
suspension of disbelief too much are you being sarcastic are you being serious of course i'm

1454
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:24,520
fucking being sarcastic what the fuck is wrong with you look jesus i mean what is your objection to

1455
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:33,080
my feeling that this is weird is it not weird it is not weird no i don't well i just i i think it

1456
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:40,040
if anyway beside the fucking point uh the the movies are garbage and they only exist because

1457
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:44,840
people think that live action is just inherently better than animation in the same way that people

1458
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:50,440
think that animation is inherently better than non-moving comics people just straight up don't

1459
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:58,040
have a respect for those other mediums because they just see no value in it like they see it as like

1460
02:18:58,040 --> 02:19:04,360
oh yeah sure a manga can be good but an anime is automatically better unless it's like obviously

1461
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:08,600
bad you know unless there's something really wrong with it people will always be more excited

1462
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:15,640
but like in my experience most of the time if the i mean there's times where the original

1463
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:21,000
is not good and the adaptation fixes it like in the case of kaon the manga is just not good

1464
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:26,840
the anime is great because they took it and they reinterpret it as like what would be good in

1465
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:33,240
animation um the there's plenty of cases where like the original story was already like as good

1466
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:37,800
as its medium could get and then you translate it to something else but it's not as good as

1467
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:43,400
that medium could get so you end up with something where it's like okay it's theoretically adding

1468
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:49,080
all these extra facets to it should make it have more opportunities to be great but it also adds

1469
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:54,280
more opportunities to fail so if you know for instance um an anime that just came out the

1470
02:19:54,280 --> 02:20:00,280
season fire force i love the manga because the artwork is fantastic it's paced perfectly the

1471
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:05,880
images flow into each other well the choreography is perfect and like the anime has certain bells

1472
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:12,200
and whistles that are nice you know you got music voice acting color you have uh like certain action

1473
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:16,600
scenes that are really beautifully animated but the backgrounds look like shit and that's just a

1474
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:21,880
problem the manga never had and now we have that and it's like no matter how good all the other

1475
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:29,480
stuff is the manga was perfect the way it was and the anime is flawed as an anime so if you value

1476
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:34,040
all those extra things just inherently more if you think like oh i don't care if the manga was

1477
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:39,640
perfect it doesn't have color and i just value color above all else then sure you'll think the

1478
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:44,760
anime is better and i think most people think that way as with so many things it depends on what

1479
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:49,560
you value obviously and what about what about akira didn't you say before that akira the movie is

1480
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:55,640
like a better uh it doesn't even adapt the whole story though so i don't i don't i mean i wouldn't

1481
02:20:55,640 --> 02:21:01,320
say the akira i wouldn't say the movie is better necessarily in any way it's just a it's just a

1482
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:06,760
really amazing technical showcase of a film but like um the main problem with the movie is just

1483
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:12,520
that it doesn't have the complete story um okay i mean in the case of the akira movie as well

1484
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:18,600
literally the guy who drew the comic directed the film so like it's as close to being the same thing

1485
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:23,800
as it could be basically there are i'm sure i'm sure we could think if we try it of an example

1486
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:30,120
of like a work that was like not like you know an original work that was left that was you know

1487
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:34,680
not as successful and then it was adapted into a movie and the movie was a masterpiece and it's

1488
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:39,160
i mean i think kaon is like oh well how about the godfather there's a godfather book that was

1489
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:43,480
really good uh but they made it a movie and it's like you know some of the most beloved films ever

1490
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:49,560
made that's probably a good example yeah okay um so i mean i would say that like like people really

1491
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:53,960
like the book i've never read it but i have seen the movie and it is like some of the best movies

1492
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:59,160
ever made but does that make it better than the book i'm on record it's just different i'm on record

1493
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:04,840
i think that originality is worth a lot and i think that to us in a certain way the original

1494
02:22:04,840 --> 02:22:11,800
will always be superior to an adaptation in just in that aspect um yeah i think it's it's possible

1495
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:18,840
to improve you it's possible to make a superior adaptation uh but it's rare and probably people

1496
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:25,080
should not try well you know the godfather is an interesting example because in the godfather

1497
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:29,640
you can feel because i've watched it so many times i'm well aware that like a lot of information

1498
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:34,600
from the book like didn't quite translate you know a good example is i was always a little bit

1499
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:41,560
confused at the exact relationship of the godfather with um luke brazi who's like the biggest enforcer

1500
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:48,040
or whatever and luke brazi actually has like a a large storied history with uh vito corleone the

1501
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:54,040
godfather and like they barely get into that at all in the movie just enough so you know like what

1502
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:57,880
he is and what his role in the story is in the first movie but i think in the book and i know

1503
02:22:57,880 --> 02:23:03,640
in like the video game and other things they go way more into the backstory of that guy and like

1504
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:09,640
so basically information is lost in translation when you're making the godfather movie part one

1505
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:16,280
versus the book but in contrast uh kaon it seems the difference with kaon is that that was a four

1506
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:22,280
panel four coma manga originally mostly comedy not a ton of story what they did instead was they

1507
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:27,960
it seems to me they expanded the shit out of it exactly they added so much more to it and barely

1508
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:33,720
lost anything so it's like in a sense of that like you might be able to make as good a case

1509
02:23:33,720 --> 02:23:38,440
as you ever could that like nothing was lost and only things were added and you know there's going

1510
02:23:38,440 --> 02:23:42,760
to be people who value the original which is you know because the original was minimal um yeah like

1511
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:47,880
there's like a lot of it is functionally original right material i mean which is yep it'll always

1512
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:53,080
come down to again what you value i mean some people are gonna say they like game of thrones

1513
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:57,720
more as a book some people say they like it more as a series because it is you know what each one

1514
02:23:57,720 --> 02:24:04,200
has over the other is so different that you know you could easily make the case either way and both

1515
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:09,480
are good anyway that's enough of this fucking god damn i just i just want to like briefly touch on

1516
02:24:09,480 --> 02:24:13,720
like the whole black aerial thing because i've been pondering it in the background okay let's

1517
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:21,000
get into it well i feel like you know i like nate's problem i guess is like

1518
02:24:21,560 --> 02:24:26,200
black let's not use the word problem okay it's not a problem it's just like you you say it feels

1519
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:34,200
weird but like yes mermaids and like uh magical long hair doesn't exist like these are fantasy films

1520
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:39,720
so like you can make them the right hair color for like for like marketing you could make her be

1521
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:46,520
black and have red hair in in little mermaid i mean well okay i mean i would say that her being

1522
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:52,600
her having red hair is not like an essential aspect of the character nor is being blonde it's not

1523
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:59,400
but what but what but point taken yeah i mean uh and it's you know i mean i they may do it for

1524
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:03,880
marketing i haven't seen anything of this i mean can i just raise let me cut to the okay you finish

1525
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:11,240
you finish the thing is like the race i feel does not really mean anything in these fantasy

1526
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:17,640
tales because mermaids do not exist doesn't matter what i agree i agree if and the reason it feels

1527
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:22,520
weird is because you know her to be a white person from the time when you watch the original movie

1528
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:31,560
and i'm like the only time a race does matter is in a story about racial differences okay guys

1529
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:34,600
live action remake of the black panther but they're white

1530
02:25:36,040 --> 02:25:41,080
oh i mean yeah that's pretty strange pretty strange yeah uh i mean some people were joking

1531
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:46,280
well that would be that would be like i mean that okay i haven't seen black panthers take

1532
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:50,520
this with a grain of salt but i just feel like that would change the tone of the story a lot that

1533
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:55,480
would change the context of it yeah it would probably i mean there there is like there is like

1534
02:25:55,560 --> 02:26:01,160
actual like racial i mean you could you could have a theoretical country like that is Wakanda

1535
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:04,200
that's you know it doesn't happen to be black happens to be all white people like but in

1536
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:10,440
africa the story is the same in scotland i mean i suppose maybe you could have the exact same story

1537
02:26:10,440 --> 02:26:15,960
but the context the movie exists in would be that's true that would change well let me just

1538
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:20,120
clarify my point here it's just that this has been on my mind a lot like these reimagining

1539
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:24,680
and whatnot because i'm i'm making a weag with it we'll be out by now that's literally about tifa

1540
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:29,800
and how i just don't like how they're making minor tweaks to her bus size and her outfit and this

1541
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:36,760
annoys me as a fan like it's not that they're making like disney presents a new mermaid story

1542
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:42,760
what they're they're literally making little mermaid butt live action now my brain thinks oh i

1543
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:47,080
know what little mermaid looks like oh a black chick well that's not what the originally was there

1544
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:52,600
that feels a little you know that's a change so it like oh here's a question why wasn't bell

1545
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:57,640
funny at all because like yeah the the thing is a little mermaid it's just you know it's a john christian

1546
02:26:57,640 --> 02:27:03,400
anderson what's his name is that hans hans christian history so it's been adapted a thousand billion

1547
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:10,040
times aerials looked different in every different adaptation it's only in any way noteworthy that

1548
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:17,000
they made her black because of the fact that they are literally translating the exact movie assumably

1549
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,880
because that's what they've done for all the other that's my entire grievance which i mean the thing

1550
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:25,800
is that they all have had this issue as well like how the lion king translated to live action has

1551
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:31,640
the same problem that like using these realistic care animal characters that is some unique issues

1552
02:27:31,640 --> 02:27:36,680
but yeah it breaks the movie because you can't characterize them the same way like if you're

1553
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:43,400
doing the exact same movie but now they're they're realistic it's like well okay it was kind of

1554
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:48,040
integral to the original story like banjo kazooie nuts and bolts let me let me ask you this let me

1555
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:51,800
just ask you this okay they made a live action beauty and the beast already we've seen it here's

1556
02:27:51,800 --> 02:27:58,760
my question why isn't bel blonde in the beauty and the beast movie why isn't she blonde because the

1557
02:27:58,760 --> 02:28:03,960
original had her with brown hair here's my other question why didn't but why does bel wear a yellow

1558
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:09,480
dress in the famous dance with the bc why does she wear yellow dress because she did in the original

1559
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:15,400
so am i crazy to be like let's let's fill in the blank of why is an ariel you know it's just the

1560
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:22,680
same logic it's the same shit would you be would you think it was weird if bel was blonde i wouldn't

1561
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:26,920
i'd be like i would think oh bel used to be brunette that's a change i wonder why they did that it

1562
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:31,720
would be just as easy to make her well the thing is with this is like you don't need to wonder

1563
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:37,320
because it's it's you know good marketing like that's a cool thing to do now to be progressive and

1564
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:43,560
inclusive and represent uh you know minorities in in movies it's obviously a marketing thing

1565
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:49,080
i i just resist i resist this thought that like nates the weird guy for being like well that's

1566
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:54,120
not how that originally was am i taking crazy listen no it's not weird for you to make the

1567
02:28:54,120 --> 02:29:00,040
observation that a change was made but it's weird for you to think that it's not good or that it's

1568
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:05,400
like bad do you think it's bad it is bad because it wasn't what what did your film originally

1569
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:11,080
was and why would you think would you think it was bad if bel was blonde yes for the exact same

1570
02:29:11,080 --> 02:29:17,480
reason okay i wouldn't i think i just i think that if you took the original little mermaid

1571
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:23,640
movie you could make the exact same movie dude they were if they were black the movie would be

1572
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:28,520
exactly the same nothing would change it's not an essential part of the story so making that

1573
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:34,200
change i agree basically no i mean that's how i feel about making it live action at all

1574
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:39,160
yeah that also yeah there's that you you have to listen when my wiago comes i'm making all these

1575
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:44,920
exact same arguments about the tiny tweaks to tifa's design that everyone says nat you shouldn't care

1576
02:29:44,920 --> 02:29:50,040
about these things nat you're you're a dumb in-cell for giving a shit about a female character design

1577
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:55,720
blah blah blah it but but i do care i i liked it as it was why are we and not frankly i'm i'm fairly

1578
02:29:55,720 --> 02:30:00,120
attached to aria i fucking love part of your world i've watched a million times i was never

1579
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:05,480
gonna like or watch this but it just i mean you know that's it she could still sing part of your

1580
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:11,400
world she's black nae what what is nothing changes about that song you're filling that in but what

1581
02:30:11,400 --> 02:30:17,320
it there's a disconnect in my brain that i don't like and there was no reason to do it so why did

1582
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:24,280
they do it the thing that's a little weird okay well hippo hippo was right i i want to say more

1583
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:27,480
about this you can get i just want to say hippo was right before when he said it like it is for

1584
02:30:27,480 --> 02:30:32,920
marketing and it's and it is cynical in a way look maybe it's not even for marketing maybe she

1585
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:36,760
was literally the best one who showed up to the audition i mean but uh you know this is this is

1586
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:41,400
disney it's for marketing everything's from right look the point is right you could uh you can be

1587
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:46,840
like i don't like that she's black you know you can be wrong like that you can be like i do like

1588
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:51,160
that she's black this is great and you can be slightly less wrong but the point is that it

1589
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:55,080
having an appeal the fact that you differentiate between those two shows your true cards ban

1590
02:30:56,200 --> 02:31:01,640
you should feel exactly the same about both those observations no you're wrong um but the

1591
02:31:02,360 --> 02:31:07,480
like having any opinion on it at all is the point of the decision the fact that people will

1592
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:13,240
feel one of two ways is why they did it like you know disney does it disney makes every move that

1593
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:18,680
they make in order to make money this has stirred controversy i hate that it has stirred controversy

1594
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:23,560
but it has and because of that it will make more money this is getting people talking this is the

1595
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:28,920
plan they knew this would happen they did it on purpose and it's not good or bad that aerial is

1596
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:37,000
black but it is bad that disney is a fucking monopoly a capitalist nightmare that is controlling

1597
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:43,000
your brain and stealing your money movie who cares you care more than i care right here's here i care

1598
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:48,360
about i care about our capitalist oligarchs ruling our ruling our society that i do really how by

1599
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:53,720
making movies what's even the big deal they i mean they've they've shaped the discourse now right or

1600
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:58,120
no they're they're they're capitalizing on it right like i mean they'll continue to they'll continue

1601
02:31:58,120 --> 02:32:03,320
to profit off of our off of the fact that we feel so strongly about this by making decisions of this

1602
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:09,640
sort and here's an interesting thought about that and it's just and it just i feel infinitely less

1603
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:14,920
strong about this issue than i do about minor tweaks to tifa's design which i utterly despise

1604
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:20,440
so that's where i'm at okay okay i think um i would argue about that as well the i'm sure you

1605
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:24,680
would not the time if she her original model was like seven polygons they had to change the

1606
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:30,200
design oh my god then listen to my video okay fine i will cover these arguments in extensive

1607
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:37,560
detail okay all right all right i i i here's here's my my thought that perhaps you know this is no

1608
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:44,600
real basis but it's like interesting to think the the doing the marketing gets the money you know the

1609
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:52,200
appeasing crowds that you know like this sort of stuff and it's good to be representing people

1610
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:59,480
because it is unusual and it is like it is a progressive thing in a world where now it's

1611
02:32:59,480 --> 02:33:06,760
just normal like to remake something with any race character and it's no longer a you know

1612
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:11,960
a marketing gimmick that disney can do would they stop doing it because it's not as profitable

1613
02:33:11,960 --> 02:33:18,920
anymore yes i would yeah probably they would they would they would stop anything if it wasn't

1614
02:33:18,920 --> 02:33:24,200
profitable i mean like let's not significantly more profitable the the obvious choice if you're

1615
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:28,440
remaking the little mermaid is you get someone who generally looks like ariel that would be probably

1616
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:33,880
your first instinct you can you can do something else but then you know you've got whiny old

1617
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:38,520
fanboys like me who are just like well why the change this is my question why the change

1618
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:43,320
and you know marketing like you said that's clearly the answer yeah yeah but that would be the answer

1619
02:33:43,320 --> 02:33:47,800
no matter what that would be the answer no matter what race ariel was the answer would the answer

1620
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:52,920
why would be marketing um it would be because it would be because it makes the most money that's

1621
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:57,960
that's just the thing that really annoys me about like the representation when it's used for marketing

1622
02:33:57,960 --> 02:34:04,440
for money for profit as a no no but everything is used for that it's not i know i know that yeah

1623
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:09,960
but like in a world where people don't actually care and if the situation changes they'll just

1624
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:14,440
stop doing it and then it's it's back to how it was yes you know that's what i don't like

1625
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:19,320
you are on to something here right okay whether like whatever they decided to make area look like

1626
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:23,560
it would be equally cynical like the fact that she they made her black is not more cynical than if

1627
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:27,800
they decided to make either one would just be profit motivated and nothing else the problem

1628
02:34:28,280 --> 02:34:35,000
is that disney is able to make decisions like that and like like the fact that they have

1629
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:39,800
like the fact that they can make ariel black and we can all look at that and go oh this is great

1630
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:44,600
thank you disney thank you for representing minorities like you've like you're really helping

1631
02:34:44,600 --> 02:34:49,160
right like the fact that they have that power is fucked up if you really think about like the

1632
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:54,120
fact that it means that much to people that ariel is black i don't even think it's bad i think it

1633
02:34:54,120 --> 02:35:00,120
but i think it's bad that it matters so much i think that just means that disney just has our

1634
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:06,520
society by the balls and it's a nightmare with a neoliberalist capitalist nightmare uh and then

1635
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:12,280
we live in hell dude hard agree dude hard agree you have a much more pessimistic view of life than i

1636
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:18,120
do thank you okay let's get the hell out of here not to our next voicemail uh by cooking bad cooking

1637
02:35:18,120 --> 02:35:25,160
bad okay go i've called in before with a simple message hello fresh bad cooking good everyone

1638
02:35:25,160 --> 02:35:30,280
can do it it's literally easy yay but after seeing munchie make ramen i have to renounce

1639
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:38,200
my previous stance boom some people just shouldn't be allowed to cook at all no it's a sad world we

1640
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:43,560
live in and there's really no reason to make it any worse he saw your disgusting peanut but a ramen

1641
02:35:43,560 --> 02:35:50,360
and is rejecting it at a visceral physical level wasn't that a uh wasn't that a uh a uh a cluster

1642
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:57,080
punk kitchen recipe yeah i don't i don't know well i guess you found it offensive it was hell no fresh

1643
02:35:57,080 --> 02:36:02,280
yeah it was hell no fresh who was in the voice grail for his contributions to the show he was i

1644
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:08,200
think the very first person the voice grail uh well once we i mean you know fucking the real

1645
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:13,880
mass batman was was you know on the on the trail before that but my my audio kind of at the end

1646
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:19,720
did he give a reason why i was bad he did not clarify why he i think he expected to be obvious

1647
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:26,200
which i assume was that peanut butter ramen looks gross is my guess okay it's just it just sort of

1648
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:33,080
looks like a white sauce almost have you it was nice there there is food there is food that can be

1649
02:36:33,080 --> 02:36:38,440
tasty and delicious but look like absolute shit right yeah i don't i don't i don't know if you have

1650
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:43,800
this conception dude i don't know if you if you've ever heard of food that looks weird but tastes good

1651
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:49,240
i don't know sometimes you can have food that is just like a brown slop but it's like a robust

1652
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:55,880
umami sense sensory overload uh curry looks in there curry looks disgusting and yeah it's very

1653
02:36:56,840 --> 02:37:01,560
i mean it just looks like some brown sauce you know yeah it doesn't look like i mean it looks pretty

1654
02:37:01,560 --> 02:37:06,200
gross i'm just saying i'm just saying well fair i'm just saying ugly food can taste good well

1655
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:10,360
well that's that's what i'm saying too and i think that it's on brand for cluster punk kitchen

1656
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:14,680
i think you should strive to make your food as ugly as a kitchen i'm very i'm very

1657
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:20,040
that's where the that's where the ramen recipe right didn't cluster punk kitchen call in with

1658
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:25,720

Well, they've had fair warning now.

Yep.

02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:15,880
Everyone gets one, and you know what?

So good job.

1678
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:29,280
I'll tell you this, though.

1679
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:34,440
The audibility is a factor, Mr. Wavy Man, so you're on Thin Ice in the future.

1680
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:35,440
I can't guarantee.

1681
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:39,560
It's just barely comprehensible enough.

1682
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:40,560
Yeah.

1683
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:41,560
It's just riding that cut.

1684
02:39:41,560 --> 02:39:46,560
Well, half of it isn't, but you are able to clue in what he's saying based on the other

1685
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:47,560
half, you know?

1686
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:48,560
Yeah.

1687
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:49,560
That's true.

1688
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:52,560
It informs the other pieces, because language and shit.

1689
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:53,560
Yeah, okay.

1690
02:39:53,560 --> 02:39:54,560
There you go, everybody.

1691
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:55,560
That's the voicemails.

1692
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:56,560
Watch out.

1693
02:39:56,560 --> 02:39:59,560
If you see on the street, you're driving by a car dealership, and you see one of those

1694
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:02,920
wacky wavy inflatable tube man listening to this podcast.

1695
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:03,920
Watch the fuck out.

1696
02:40:03,920 --> 02:40:04,920
Duck into an alley.

1697
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:07,240
Don't let him make eye contact.

1698
02:40:07,240 --> 02:40:09,280
Or try to crash into him with your car.

1699
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:11,400
Take him out and save your fellow listeners.

1700
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:13,000
Do whatever it takes.

1701
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Highly recommended.

1702
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,000
I guess that's it.

1703
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Hell yeah.

1704
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:17,000
All right, we're done.

1705
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:18,000
We're done.

1706
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,000
That's it for today.

1707
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Hey, lads.

1708
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,000
You know what you should do?

1709
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,960
You should go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

1710
02:40:23,960 --> 02:40:25,640
Give us $1 and be in the Discord.

1711
02:40:25,640 --> 02:40:30,960
Give us $5 and get the bonus episodes, of which there's 27, including the most recent summer

1712
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:31,960
cast.

1713
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:36,520
Oh, it's summertime and the water is hot, and I am loving it.

1714
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:42,280
If there's any PCP member who you are not subscribed to every channel they have, you're

1715
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:43,840
not a true fan.

1716
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:47,520
You got to watch all the content from everybody, or else you're gay.

1717
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:48,520
Indeed.

1718
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:49,520
Yes.

1719
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:50,520
Yes.

1720
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:51,520
Watch.

1721
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:52,520
Check out that feed.

1722
02:40:52,520 --> 02:40:53,520
Someone was...

1723
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:54,520
I think they were talking shit about me.

1724
02:40:54,520 --> 02:40:57,840
Apparently, there's more than one place where there's a PCP content feed where all our shit

1725
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:02,120
gets pumped into besides just the patron discord, but the patron discord's the place to be anyway.

1726
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:03,120
And you get to give us money.

1727
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:04,120
What a privilege.

1728
02:41:04,120 --> 02:41:08,720
Follow me on Topastic and Lion Webtoon if you'd be so kind.

1729
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:10,720
Use every link that's in the description.

1730
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:11,720
Post it on all my shit there.

1731
02:41:11,720 --> 02:41:12,720
Yeah.

1732
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:14,440
Oh, by the way, update from the summer cast.

1733
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:20,320
I did go to a water park since then, developed a wonderful tan, and look like a bronze god.

1734
02:41:20,320 --> 02:41:21,320
Oh, god.

1735
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:22,320
Oh, god.

1736
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:23,320
Yeah.

1737
02:41:23,320 --> 02:41:24,320
Nate, okay.

1738
02:41:24,320 --> 02:41:30,320
My water park story is so vast and great and just so filled with terror and peril that

1739
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:33,240
like it will have to be an entire segment next episode.

1740
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:36,040
I'm so, I'm so remiss that I didn't talk about this time.

1741
02:41:36,040 --> 02:41:37,040
Okay.

1742
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:38,040
We'll talk about it next time.

1743
02:41:38,040 --> 02:41:39,040
Oh, god.

1744
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:43,240
Oh, you guys gave PTSD in such a terrible, visceral way.

1745
02:41:43,240 --> 02:41:44,240
I'm so...

1746
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:46,040
I will talk glowingly about my experience.

1747
02:41:46,040 --> 02:41:47,040
I can't wait.

1748
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:48,040
Yes.

1749
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:49,040
I can't wait.

1750
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:53,740
For those who aren't aware, the most recent bonus episode was about summer, and that

1751
02:41:53,740 --> 02:41:55,240
is what he's referring to.

1752
02:41:55,240 --> 02:41:56,240
Yes.

1753
02:41:56,240 --> 02:41:57,240
So many subjects in great water parks.

1754
02:41:57,240 --> 02:41:58,240
So many subjects in great water parks.

1755
02:41:58,240 --> 02:42:00,240
To the patrons so you can listen to it.

1756
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:07,040
And Nate, both went to water parks since the previous recording of the PCP, or did

1757
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:08,040
we?

1758
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:09,040
You'll have to find out.

1759
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:10,040
You'll have to find out next episode.

1760
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:11,040
Oh, my god.

1761
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:12,040
Okay.

1762
02:42:12,040 --> 02:42:13,040
I'm hyped.

1763
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:14,040
I'm excited.

See you next week.

1770
02:42:22,040 --> 02:42:24,040
Oh, so by the way, this episode went on so long so we can push back gay for a day premiere.

1771
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:25,040
And haha, that's really funny.

1772
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:26,040
Oh, yeah.

Bye.

1780
02:43:00,040 --> 02:43:05,040
What the hell is wrong with me?
