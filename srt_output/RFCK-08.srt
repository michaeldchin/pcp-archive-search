1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Alright Munchy, we're back. We're back for frog fractions. We found frog fractions.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,440
It's time to continue the story where we left off. Everything we said in the last

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,360
Radifuckers Cop Killers wasn't canon. This is canon though. This is frog fractions too,

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,160
I believe, I think. I'm led to believe. This is the only thing that will be in scriptures,

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,320
this and the last one. This will be the only thing worth celebrating.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,560
Just like an alt universe. An alt universe of Munchy and Bin. This is the real universe, canon

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:46,320
universe. Who just came online on my Skype, a little man named FngR. What a coincidence.

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,120
Let's invite him on the show, Munchy. Let's invite FngR on the show. After all, he's been

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,880
such a good friend to me. He's really reached out. He's reached out to me. Like so

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,120
often and just with such tenderness. He's just a good guy. He's just a good guy with a lot to

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,200
offer the world. He's just a little sweetheart. Roach is a sweetheart. He just knows how to get

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,160
into your skin in a good way and like pollute your bones with kindness. My bones are real polluted.

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,840
Real polluted. What is this game? Well, I mean, I guess it's like a roguelike.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:41,280
Man, there's so many messages. Okay. Okay. Cage. I mean, it looks like I found a towel.

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay, if I hit Q and W, I punch myself. Oh, it's not good. Oh, did I like knock myself out?

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,040
Did I like die from that? I think you'd like teleport it back. I think if you die, then you just die.

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,120
Oh, yeah. I mean, I still have the towel, so I guess I didn't die.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,800
This doesn't look very froggy or fraction-y. No, you're right. You're right. And yet,

19
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,320
and yet I know in my heart that this is frog fractions.

20
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
I can't take this.

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
By the way, my cursor and my keyboard are being real shitty in... Oh, gems.

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,520
They're being real shitty and unresponsive because we're... Oh, what?

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,360
I feel like I didn't explore this room thoroughly. Yeah, because we're using Skype,

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,200
because to share screen so you could see this fucking game, I need the cyan key. Okay.

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,240
We had to go back to Skype. We had to go fucking back in time. We had to go back

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,720
to the past like Samurai Jack. Yeah. Like the Samurai Jack. Yeah, yeah. We had to

27
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,600
hashtag MaxreviveSkype, which I mean... The worst part of the entire face of the fucking planet.

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,160
I don't know how they could have made it worse. Short of just not making calls at all,

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,840
I don't see how Skype could be any worse of a program.

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:15,280
Mm-hmm. It's so bloated and unoptimized, and then just the... It's so resource-intensive,

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
and for what? For a worse product or something that's then Discord.

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,240
Like Discord works? Why doesn't Skype work? Just make it work.

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,960
I don't understand. What is happening right now?

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,200
It's too dangerous to let you pass without a sword. Oh, but I can just

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,160
go past anyway. No, I think I'm going to listen to him. I'm going to try and get a sword.

36
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,000
There's gems up here. I want those. Harvest, though.

37
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,680
Welcome to the Texworld character creator. Oh, dude, what face should I be?

38
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,640
Oh, dude.

39
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
Blueberry Pie, Woodland Meadows. Lapis-Lazuli.

40
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,240
Lapis-Lazuli, apparently. Rose Quartz.

41
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,120
Rose Quartz. Holy shit. Moonlit Walk, Vanilla Snowfin.

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
Mass Effect 2 save.

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
Yeah, okay. I'm going to do that one.

44
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,880
This is my actual desktop. This is my actual desktop folder.

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,320
If you actually had...

46
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,720
It's the PCP folder.

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,200
Oh my god.

48
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,200
Here's all the files from Ben and Jackie's College Fund.

49
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,000
There's spoilers there. We can't look at that.

50
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
Wow. Do you have Mass Effect 2 on Steam?

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,120
No.

52
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,880
I do. Do you want me to play Mass Effect 2 for a little bit,

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
get a save file, and then give it to you and see what happens?

54
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Yes. Yes, I do.

55
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Can you fucking give me your Mass Effect 2 save file?

56
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,720
Yeah. I just find it inside of my computer and then give it to you. I'm fairly certain.

57
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,640
Oh, I've got... Maybe Pokemon Showdown will work.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,480
Teams.

59
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,160
Ninja Bugs team, which I never finished making.

60
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
All right. No, that's not going to do it.

61
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
Dude. Dude.

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,680
All right.

63
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,000
So, while you get your Mass Effect 2 file...

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
I actually nearly download Mass Effect 2, but it'll be fine.

65
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,160
Okay. Well, I'll just... I'll come back. I'll come back for that.

66
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,400
Yeah.

67
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,640
So, yeah, so a lot's happened between...

68
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,360
Since two Rowdy fuckers cop killers ago.

69
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,920
We were just making a nice little quaint frog fractions let's play for the masses on our channel.

70
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,720
We were just talking about what's real and dear to our hearts.

71
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,600
I don't know who could have faulted us for just sharing God's honest truth,

72
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,360
but it did. There was a stir. There was a kerfuffle. There was a cutie mark kerfuffle.

73
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,200
There was a single strife that I know about, a single strife.

74
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,080
A meat minuscule of a strife, if you will.

75
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,080
Meat minuscule.

76
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,200
Yeah, we got attacked. We got...

77
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
We got flat. We got trolled.

78
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,880
We got viciously attacked by some internet bullies and trolls.

79
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,120
Weakness, cage matches, okay.

80
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,040
All we wanted to do was just make content and, you know, just be ourselves.

81
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,680
But the powers that be wouldn't allow us.

82
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
That's too much for some people. That's too much for small minds.

83
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:31,840
Yeah.

84
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,640
We're the next Elon Mux, the Rowdy fuckers cop killers.

85
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,200
Oh, what the fuck is happening?

86
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,560
Seems like kind of cool, but also like what the fuck is even happening.

87
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,880
I mean, I'm pretty sure most of this is just bullshit that I can ignore and it doesn't matter.

88
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,960
Like, all these messages are stupid and I'm pretty sure I should just stop reading them.

89
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,640
I got some orange soapstone.

90
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,040
That's...

91
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,160
Oh my god.

92
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,400
Nice.

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,120
Soapstone.

94
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,800
Lie ahead.

95
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,880
It said Mass Effect 2 specifically, right?

96
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,640
Yeah, yeah, it was Mass Effect 2.

97
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,760
Because that's the only one I have.

98
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
It's a bowl full of wicker balls.

99
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,960
Oh, shit.

100
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
I can't carry any more gems.

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
What the fuck's even the point then?

102
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,760
Maybe I can buy stuff with them?

103
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,240
Maybe I have to spend some.

104
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
What's even the point of a system like that?

105
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
There's stuff like that in Zelda.

106
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,520
What's even the point?

107
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,880
Like, of limiting how much money you can carry?

108
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,360
Yeah.

109
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,560
Ah, just the fuck with you.

110
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,800
Just like to make you feel bad.

111
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,360
Okay, good.

112
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,760
Video game developers like to make the twisted cistern.

113
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,800
The Twister Caliborn.

114
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,840
I can't take this.

115
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,800
And I can't take this.

116
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
I can't carry any more gems.

117
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,240
What's the fucking point?

118
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,200
All right, I'm going home.

119
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,040
My home, I mean down.

120
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
Briefcase full of cash.

121
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,040
Okay, okay.

122
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,720
Let me...

123
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,440
All right.

124
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,760
All right.

125
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,720
There's a couple more.

126
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,640
There's a couple more side paths that I can check out while we're...

127
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,880
While we're looking for that save file.

128
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,200
This is what video games used to actually look like, right?

129
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,840
Like, this is what like real video games looked like.

130
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,400
Yeah.

131
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
I mean, this is what Dwarf Fortress looks like today.

132
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
Well, we have a Dwarf Fortress.

133
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,440
This is incredible.

134
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,800
Yeah.

135
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,840
Dwarf Fortress is...

136
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,520
Oh, it...

137
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,560
Federal insanity.

138
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,760
I used to play.

139
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,440
I used to play a bunch of Dwarf Fortress.

140
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,800
Dwarf Fortress is cool, dude.

141
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
It's really cool.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,440
But, you know, the thing I eventually decided about Dwarf Fortress

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
is that it's more fun to like talk about and think about

144
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,520
than it is to actually play.

145
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,440
A little bit.

146
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,920
A little bit.

147
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
I got to a point where I was like,

148
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
I've played Dwarf Fortress a bunch.

149
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,920
I've kind of mastered the systems, but not like the advanced systems.

150
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
And I just don't know how much...

151
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,360
Like, I feel like I get it.

152
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,680
And I've got like some good Dwarf Fortress stories.

153
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,840
I've had some real fun times, but like...

154
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,000
I get it, you know?

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,800
Like, I see you.

156
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,160
I see you the writing on the wall.

157
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,480
Yeah.

158
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,520
Yeah, you're right.

159
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,200
Oh, damn idiot.

160
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
God, I wonder if I can even make it.

161
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,560
I think you just have to like hold down air.

162
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,920
You have to go just as soon as the blue like disappears.

163
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:22,960
All right.

164
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,920
You have to go fast.

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

166
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,000
I actually think that maybe like my shitty Skype fucking with my keyboard

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,760
might like be messing up my ability to do this challenge.

168
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,840
Oh, God, I just want it.

169
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,160
It like freezes for a second for me.

170
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,800
This guy just cannot fucking keep up with this.

171
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,280
You know what?

172
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,560
Okay, I think I can get it.

173
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,760
I feel confident.

174
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,080
I can't hold it.

176
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,040
I have to mash.

177
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,960
How many things have you stolen before?

178
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,000
Have you stolen anything?

179
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
Yeah, I've stolen stuff.

180
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,800
Yeah, like what?

181
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
Um, I've like shoplifted stuff.

182
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
Oh, yeah, that's big time shit.

183
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,520
That's big time shit, bro.

184
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah, I'm a big I'm a big time like groceries launderer.

185
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,200
No, I've like I've like stolen groceries.

186
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
Like some like I stole some like the first time I think I ever stole anything.

187
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,600
I was in California and I was real poor and I and I like I just went to the grocery store

188
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,360
to buy some like rice because like that's what I was eating at the time.

189
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,040
And hang on, let me let the cat out.

190
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,640
Cat out of the bag, cat's already out of the bag, Nate.

191
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,280
I mean, Ben.

192
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,240
Okay, goodbye.

193
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
Fuck, monkey, lunchie.

194
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,200
And like I went to buy some shitty groceries and I saw some gushers and I just really wanted

195
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,760
the gushers.

196
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,120
Like I knew I didn't want to spend the like six dollars on a box of gushers,

197
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,800
but I was like, but I really want those gushers, but I don't want to pay for them.

198
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
So I just bought my I picked them up and I bought my other groceries and I went and I

199
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,840
checked them out at the fucking self-checkout line and I just didn't swipe the gushers and

200
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,320
I just put them in my grocery bag and I just walked out with these box of gushers.

201
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,080
And yeah, I've done it.

202
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,040
I've done that a bunch.

203
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,160
I've done that a bunch of times.

204
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,320
It's good.

205
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,600
That's like federalized.

206
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,680
Like like all my students are like small scale, like, you know, like, like, like, like

207
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,920
just like take a little bit of like, like, like, like, like one time I was at a guy's

208
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,080
house where I didn't really like in like fifth grade.

209
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,560
And I just stole his like little like, like, like a full of Minko, like fucking, uh,

210
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
you know, the, the, the pink where it's long next.

211
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,840
I still like little Minko.

212
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,160
Yeah.

213
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,320
I still, I stole a little bit of a like a statue, a statue just because I thought it was cool.

214
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
Um, did he ever notice?

215
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,600
No.

216
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,200
Um, no, I, I, I like, you know, actually this is, this is a good time to bring this up.

217
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,320
Um, I, because I don't know when else this would come up, but like there was a PCP.

218
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,320
I forget which one there was a PCP where like the, like me shoplifting came up and I like

219
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,160
said it and then I got like scared about it and was like, and like didn't know if like people

220
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
would be like, oh, he's a, he's a bad guy.

221
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,280
So I like went back and edited that and it was too bad because there was like a real good story.

222
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,560
I don't remember what the story was, but there was like a real good story that I had to cut

223
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,840
out because it was like interwoven with like the fact that I have shop lifted before in my life.

224
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah.

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
Which like, I don't, I don't really think it's a big deal.

226
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,400
Like on, on, on, in hindsight, I'm like, I don't really think anyone is going to care that much.

227
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,520
Yeah.

228
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,600
To me, like I wouldn't, like I wouldn't do it at like a mom and pop store.

229
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,400
I wouldn't do it at like a small local business, but at like a chain, like at like a Walmart or

230
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,440
a stop and shop, like fuck them. Who cares? They're not people. Corporations are not people

231
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,720
and they don't deserve, they don't deserve moral consideration of any kind.

232
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,840
So I don't feel, I feel like, and not only do I not feel like it's a bad thing to do,

233
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,080
I actively feel like it's a good thing to do.

234
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,320
Yeah.

235
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,680
It's great.

236
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,080
Yeah.

237
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,720
Okay.

238
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,440
If I go to a Walmart and I just put a cashier at gunpoint, then, you know, it's just a good

239
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,400
thing because they're part of the, they're a cog in the machine, dude.

240
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,600
You gotta break my auditioning.

241
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,760
Yeah, they're like, they're part of the problem.

242
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,160
Oh my gosh.

243
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
You're way too fucking slow, dude.

244
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,480
I really feel like, damn it, phone. I really feel like this should be working and just like,

245
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
my keyboard is not doing what I'm telling it to do.

246
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
This is like, I'm playing this game on hard mode right now.

247
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,080
Oh my god. Oh my fucking god.

248
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,560
Hey, can you go like, like go to like where you're about to jump into it and then like,

249
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,360
can you go up?

250
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,480
No, I can't because there's water.

251
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,280
Hmm.

252
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,520
It's like, it's like a zigzag path I have to take.

253
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,200
And maybe you can't see it on screen share.

254
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,960
Oh, oh, okay.

255
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,440
Yeah.

256
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,600
Yeah.

257
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:05,920
I see.

258
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,080
I see.

259
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
I see.

260
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,600
Oh yeah.

261
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,400
That's so fucked.

262
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,680
It's like, I'll go like, like I'll,

263
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,280
maybe I'll just hit the keys slower.

264
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,480
Oh my god.

265
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,280
Oh my god.

266
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,800
I am so upset.

267
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,800
It can't be, you know, maybe it is impossible.

268
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,520
Maybe it's just impossible and it's just here to fuck with me,

269
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,960
but that would make me so mad.

270
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,280
So it can't be like, it can't be true because it would make me mad if it were true.

271
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,480
I'm just gonna just go on the internet until lies.

272
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
Do you really think someone would do that?

273
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,680
This is what the hell looks like.

274
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,320
This is what we get for stealing.

275
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,280
This is our punishment.

276
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,800
Oh, did you fucking see that?

277
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,040
Yeah.

278
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,200
Okay.

279
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,920
I think I can do it.

280
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,640
I think I can do it.

281
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,160
Oh god.

282
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm going to kill myself.

283
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,800
I'm going to kill myself.

284
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm going to kill myself.

285
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,480
Myself, Mike.

286
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,720
Yeah.

287
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,440
I, I really do think that Skype is fucking up though.

288
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,880
Oh, yeah.

289
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,600
No, it's definitely Skype because I can see my, oh shit.

290
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,120
I can see my cursor flickering and it's very upsetting.

291
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,480
Like whatever, like whatever that fucking square root sign is up in the top left,

292
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,400
like I just want it more than life itself.

293
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,240
What if you can't even carry it?

294
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,200
I can carry it.

295
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,920
I got a towel.

296
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,480
Of course I can get a square root, a squirt for short.

297
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
Oh wait, I can, maybe I should just hold it.

298
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,520
Oh, I fucking did it.

299
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm a genius.

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,840
Good luck and try Fleur de Lis.

301
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,480
All right.

302
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,040
Fleur de Lis, that's a pony.

303
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,880
Is it?

304
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,000
That's a pony.

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,280
Be wary of butts, insulated boots ahead.

306
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,120
Oh, I got it.

307
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,560
I got it.

308
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,240
I did it.

309
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,000
I have done it.

310
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,720
Can you get through the other side?

311
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,280
No, your way is blocked by dire shrubs.

312
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,320
No, I think I just got to die.

313
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,240
Okay, there we go.

314
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,560
Let's try through here.

315
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,240
Blocked by water.

316
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,200
Is this a bank?

317
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,160
Yeah, it looks like a bank.

318
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,880
All right, I guess.

319
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,760
Until it gets it's gray and it makes you want to kill yourself.

320
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,360
It looks like it.

321
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,680
You know what?

322
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,800
I think those black blocks are supposed to be stained glass windows.

323
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,920
So I think maybe it's a church.

324
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,920
Oh, maybe.

325
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,200
The lion bunker.

326
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,000
Good luck.

327
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,080
Again, like it can't go anywhere.

328
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,600
It's blocked by shrubs and water.

329
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,520
All right, so that's a bust.

330
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,280
That's a bust.

331
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,240
It's a bust.

332
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,440
You have a sword yet?

333
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,760
Maybe what you think you just got up is a sword.

334
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,320
Yeah, maybe.

335
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,600
You need the red key to unlock this door.

336
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,280
Need no bless oblige and try pressed digitization.

337
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,160
Okay, so this is like some Dark Souls stuff.

338
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,520
So like need skates and imminent flaming tomb.

339
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
Again, blocked by shrubs, blocked by water.

340
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,880
Oh, I can push crates.

341
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,720
Oh, shit.

342
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,840
Oh, this might.

343
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
I wonder if maybe I could have progressed before.

344
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,720
Amazing trap.

345
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
Amazing trap ahead.

346
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,800
I can't believe the story you're telling me.

347
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,680
It's macabre.

348
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,160
I bet I can get that bracket.

349
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,040
You get that fucking bracket, bro.

350
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,160
I'm so fucking.

351
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
I'm having so much fucking fun with this game, munchie.

352
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, you might have fucked up.

353
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,040
I found a pair of auto correct skates.

354
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,240
Oh, shit.

355
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,440
Nice.

356
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,120
All right.

357
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,600
I did it.

358
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,280
You just auto.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,480
Oh, if space, I can doff skates.

360
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,440
You need you need the white key to take off the skates.

361
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,400
Oh, fuck.

362
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,760
Okay.

363
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,640
Well, whatever.

364
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,760
Like I'm fine with them on.

365
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,600
Oh, that's a monster.

366
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,720
Okay, I've got all the I've got all the gems I need.

367
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,640
Anyway, we're game.

368
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,160
I'm totally I'm just so fucking immersed inside this video game.

369
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,960
Me too, dude.

370
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,840
I like I'm like I'm loving this like not even as like a joke.

371
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,800
Gorilla Grove.

372
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,840
The Gorilla Grove.

373
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,040
Oh, the thing is like fucking going crazy at me.

374
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,280
What?

375
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
Oh, they like go after me.

376
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,200
Oh, no.

377
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,640
Now that I've got all the gems.

378
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,720
What the fuck?

379
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,920
Now that I've got all the gems.

380
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,240
Now that I've got all the gems I can carry,

381
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,680
the gems are like an impediment.

382
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,080
Okay.

383
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,480
You know what?

384
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,040
I can do this.

385
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,560
This is how they punish greed, Ben.

386
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,680
This is how they punish greed.

387
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,920
I mean, I guess I guess so.

388
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,520
The Megasort.

389
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,240
You see a message here.

390
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,720
I did it.

391
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,320
Master.

392
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,280
Oh, God, you're so fucked.

393
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,080
Master master using it and you can open this.

394
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,600
So I have to master the Megasort before I can obtain it.

395
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,160
Yeah, it's deep.

396
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,920
That's deep and it's important.

397
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,000
The two way slider doesn't move.

398
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,120
Oh, God.

399
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,920
At some points, I think in this like, yeah,

400
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,520
abstract art style is actually like benefiting it

401
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,440
because it's like, you know, you use your imagination.

402
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,400
That's kind of magical.

403
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,800
Other times I just think I just cannot fucking understand

404
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,600
what is happening.

405
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,600
I understand everything.

406
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,800
Oh, I found the red key.

407
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,120
Red.

408
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
My way is blocked by shroobs.

409
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,240
I've got all the gems that I can carry.

410
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,480
Okay.

411
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:00,640
Good.

412
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:00,800
Good.

413
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,280
Good.

414
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,560
I suspect two is done downloading.

415
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,920
Really?

416
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,240
Okay.

417
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,000
All right.

418
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,400
You know what?

419
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,200
I like, I wonder if I can.

420
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,160
Oh, I wonder if I can get in here.

421
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
They're giving me like CD keys right now.

422
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,560
The crates path is blocked.

423
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:18,880
Okay.

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,960
Look at my micron pen and write this down.

425
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,440
That's fancy, dude.

426
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,400
Yeah, that's fancy.

427
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,280
That's fancy stuff.

428
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,280
I paid, I paid, I paid good silver, silver shekels for my micron.

429
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,160
Centipede corner.

430
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,480
What the?

431
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
I just want to win, Munchie.

432
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
I just want to win the game.

433
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,760
You think we'll even see a frog?

434
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,560
Um, I mean, maybe we're, maybe we're looking at a frog right now.

435
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
I want to see a frog.

436
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
I want to see him spit his little heart out.

437
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,040
That's what dogs do.

438
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,560
I mean, uh, frogs.

439
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,600
That is what dogs do.

440
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,440
Harpy ahead.

441
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,680
Okay.

442
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,120
That's, that's, oh God.

443
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm so fucking annoyed by this purple.

444
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,200
I found a thing.

445
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,400
Okay.

446
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,280
Whatever.

447
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,680
Okay.

448
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,040
I think I got what I needed to get.

449
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,520
Although I kind of want to, I feel like those white blocks over there

450
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
are going to give me like an important message.

451
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,240
Master using it.

452
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,160
I got a master this, I got a master the Megasword.

453
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,360
How?

454
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,360
Shit.

455
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,040
This fucking key is so, why would they, why?

456
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,280
Why is this part of the steam release?

457
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,760
To have a built in like CD fucking ROM like code.

458
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,960
God, fucking physical media.

459
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,080
Yeah, what the fuck dude?

460
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,360
Why did it ever exist?

461
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,960
Why, why was there a time when we needed to have physical like anything?

462
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,240
Yeah.

463
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,280
It was bad.

464
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,080
Like it was bad.

465
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,200
It was a bad time.

466
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,360
And like history will frown upon it.

467
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,200
It was like even worse than slavery or killing gays.

468
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,480
I mean it was maybe a lot worse than either of those put together.

469
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
Play Master 2?

470
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,240
Yeah, of course.

471
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,840
Oh wait, I see, I see.

472
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,520
I got here before but I couldn't go anywhere because the crate

473
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,440
because the crate, I hate these monsters.

474
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,000
I hate them.

475
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,520
All right, now here's what you need to do, Ben.

476
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,160
What's that?

477
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,320
You need to open up, here I'm going to start, I'm going to do my screen share

478
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
and then you like put the window like off of the side

479
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,080
and then you have also my screen share up of Mass Effect 2

480
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,280
on the other side of the screen.

481
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,760
Okay, I'll try my best.

482
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,040
I think I just got to go over here.

483
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,520
Oh, you can also share your system sound.

484
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,960
Sewer blimp.

485
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
Wait, wait, hang on, do I need to do that right now?

486
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,000
No, well what do you mean?

487
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Like, okay, do you have the...

488
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,560
Oh, I'm on the blimp, dude.

489
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,200
What?

490
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,200
The world shifts as you touch Gliok's Mind Stone.

491
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,600
Sorry I was gone for a bit, I was making a sandwich.

492
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
I see you found the municipal sewers.

493
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,800
I wouldn't poke around in there too much, it's rather unsanitary.

494
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,760
How are these the sewers?

495
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm on a blimp.

496
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,480
Dude, wait, did you close the screen share?

497
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
Maybe we can only do one at a time.

498
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,040
Wait, no, I didn't close screen share.

499
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah, what the fuck?

500
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,240
Well, can you not see this?

501
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
No, I can't see you, no.

502
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,560
I can only see mine.

503
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,160
What is going on?

504
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,720
Here, I'll here, I'll in the screen share.

505
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,000
How, but how, but how could a man do that?

506
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,480
But how was a man to do?

507
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,200
Oh, wait, you know what?

508
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,960
Yeah, I can tell.

509
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,120
Oh, wait, did you not see the blimp?

510
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,240
No, I can't, I can't end it.

511
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,520
I can't end screen share.

512
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,760
Here, okay, let me try it.

513
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,520
Sorry, I'm fucking up.

514
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,120
Fuck.

515
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,800
Call share screens start.

516
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,600
Do that, is it better?

517
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,040
No, I can't see you.

518
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,520
How do I stop screen share?

519
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,520
Should we just end the call?

520
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,640
I, yeah, yeah, let's do that.

521
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,840
I'll call you right back.

522
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,320
Okay.

599
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,240
it's actually better this way cuz like the let if you don't know the question

600
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,960
then your answer will reveal like who you truly are you know no yeah I'm just

601
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:05,080
answering by it's widely exactly exactly think about it when Lego Star Wars not

602
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,440
like Star Wars but like like Lego Star that's Lego Star Wars that was like that

603
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,520
was very very Lego Star Wars this is like like like they fucking really like

604
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:21,360
um um Josh Josh scorcher as creator of as creator of Mass Effect we were

605
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,880
wondering what your biggest influence influences were and he'll say well um

606
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:30,720
well Munchie I was heavily influenced the story was heavily modeled after my

607
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,640
favorite video game Lego Star Wars to the Phantom Menace and and you know the

608
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,000
rest is history did you ever play Lego Star Wars no never never played a Lego

609
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,360
game like Lego Star Wars actually great because okay this is the most like

610
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,320
satisfying like sound ever is like like many kids are like basically like like

611
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,120
just like these like items can't throw at the level and you know if like if you

612
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:01,320
collect them all you get like 100% and the sound it makes is like this was

613
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,160
satisfying fucking thing you could ever hear in your entire life you know what

614
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,680
this actually looks kind of cool it's like space this this part this part I

615
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,880
like I like this part I'm like uh find a save point like you find a safe find a

616
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,920
save point dude wrong wait wait wait wait wait does this game have save

617
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,560
points wait you know what I'm gonna say I think you've already got a save file

618
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,960
because I'm pretty sure it auto saves whenever you make a decision really I

619
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,960
think so yeah let me just get the next load yeah yeah here here let me wait for

620
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,840
this cutscene and then I'll I'm gonna quit cuz I do not want this for any

621
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:47,680
month longer than I have to no don't be stupid fucking fag yeah like like look

622
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,480
at like look at the difference like like which of these men is straight like

623
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,080
just ask yourself like like looking at them like what do you guys got the

624
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,800
mischievous grin he's got the you know wild personality yeah clearly

625
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:10,520
sexual all the straight guy yeah yeah yeah am I like a girl is that what's

626
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:21,760
happening are you I mean yes but women can't space no they're they're hymens

627
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,760
just go haywire yeah when you enter when you leave Earth's atmosphere they're

628
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,960
uterus just cannot compute they just it just starts fucking up this is the

629
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:39,720
inside of women's uterus when like this is what this scene is about yeah this is

630
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,560
the end like if you pick a female character yeah

631
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:57,960
this is the end of the game I mean it's a space adventure no it's more like a

632
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:05,800
fucking real life like like this is like the red pill this is it like this is the

633
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:14,440
much the much Ballyhood red pill I think I think she's done for anyone play a

682
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,200
man we're this is completely different I found like a I use like a red key and

683
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,920
then I found like a door oh no I touched like a one of those things that were in

687
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,320
a camera to shoot real quick yeah yeah I'll figure this out

688
00:44:41,320 --> 00:45:06,520
kindling zero I guess I'll buy I guess wait I have to like sell the kindling like

689
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:15,440
I need less fuel so that I don't go go too high okay it's like oh man this is like a

690
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,600
parody of all of my favorite video games all like the bullshit addictive like the

691
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,520
bullshit this is this is like the kind of bullshit that like Magikarp jump is and

692
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,400
like I fucking love games like Magikarp jump where you just like accumulate shit

693
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,520
you just like hit imaginary milestones and accumulate meaningless crap but like

694
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,120
it's all like a self it's all like a self a self fulfilling oh go go down go go

695
00:45:41,120 --> 00:46:02,320
down how do we go down how do we go down I've sold I've sold everything no go

696
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:20,520
down no go down you fucker no no alright oh you oh you you buy it you buy it for

697
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:27,280
fuel okay so you add fuel to get your temperature up and then you spend the

698
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:40,040
temperature to buy the fuel which increases your temperature regularly so I wonder if

699
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:46,040
there's any way I wonder if there's any way to reduce your temperature because that's

700
00:46:46,040 --> 00:47:06,920
what I need oh I see you buying fuel weighs you down and you go down oh okay okay okay now

701
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,800
we're good I've got it figured out I've got the strategy oh my fucking god I love it I

702
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:28,440
love this game dupe dupe dupe leisurely I bet that Munchie is gonna I bet we're gonna go

703
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,840
through oh shit we're gonna go through all this rigmarole to get a mass effect to get

704
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,000
the mass effect to save and I bet it's not even like I bet it'll do something but not

705
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:50,540
like something that's actually good but that's fine that's fine actually oh there we go yeah yeah

706
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:58,880
okay I'm getting it I'm getting it God I'm so fucking smart just feels so good to be this

707
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:06,520
fucking good at video games do you know what I'm saying whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa okay okay

708
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:25,240
this red thing bad oh god god it looks the red thing reminds me of like the Sims when

709
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:37,800
something bad happens what um oh I think the red I think it might be a symbol I think it's an

710
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,880
ASCII symbol that maybe I was like I'm here to get I think I may have achieved what I was supposed

711
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,360
to achieve here but I just just really like this game I just really like this one I'm just gonna

712
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:59,680
fuck around with it until either Munchie gets back or I get like really bored which I mean stranger

713
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,920
things have happened but I have infinite patience I have infinite patience for video games that's why

714
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:12,400
I'm so fucking good at video games I'm just like I will just play I will just play the worst game

715
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:23,800
and not even care no no no no yes yes no no all right um how do I leave

716
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,200
do I have to do I have to like get to the end

717
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:57,200
the fact that there's no like quit to the main game thing makes me wonder maybe I have to get to

718
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:12,680
the end the crack in the ground looks suspicious that crack cocaine all over the ground looks suspicious

719
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:40,680
okay okay okay am I gonna make it I think I'm gonna make it okay

720
00:50:40,680 --> 00:51:03,160
okay yeah yeah I think we're good I think we're good maybe I'll just

721
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:24,460
oh my god no I don't think I don't think I could beat that I don't think there's an

722
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:46,900
end I'm gonna Google it oh god there's lightning outside I like it oh god fuck yeah oh how frog

723
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:52,940
fractions to want you import your mass effect to save to save file of the game oh let's find out

724
00:51:53,900 --> 00:52:02,420
there have been conflicting reports circulating about whether to save file actually does anything in

725
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:09,340
frog fractions to be on existing as a get of course it's just a gag whatever I just want to know how

726
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:17,020
to beat the toaster I just want to know how to beat the toaster all right all right

727
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:47,700

important even though they may not be like I don't know what's important I

856
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:08,820
don't know what this game values it obviously doesn't value Christian values

01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:23,520
vanilla snowlings was where she's such special snowflakes that we have to make

907
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,160

908
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:34,040

909
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,600
all right I don't I don't want to do this I don't want to play this fucking

910
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:50,680
toaster game it's all right okay um I think I think this is the way to advance

911
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:59,080
by beating this this mini game I may I may have fucked this up oh wait no no

912
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:05,960
no wait yes I fucked it up okay let's try it again yeah a big deal a big deal

913
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:12,040
we just we just gotta do it okay it's okay it's easy there we go

914
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:20,600
and some right on some on some matters of more importance

915
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:32,440
you don't you don't you don't understand yet I don't I don't understand you don't

916
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,360
understand yet but you will

917
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:44,920
oh god look at this shit here it's approaching so slowly and yeah I can

918
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:51,480
feel I can feel it on my bones like I can't I don't know if I can even explain

919
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:59,880
like why this is so bad but just it just oh no I'm fucked yeah idiot I don't know

920
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,360
why bad

921
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:09,400
because the way the way that you get height is you buy fuel and then you

922
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,560
gradually gain height but like initially buying the fuel costs you height

923
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:21,240
that's ridiculous yeah it's it's I'm if I can beat it I'm gonna feel really good

924
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:25,240
about myself and really excited and feel like I'm what is inside of the toaster

925
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:32,920
toast when you die some toast comes out okay I will feel like floppy thing going around is

926
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:41,000
that the frog no that's a wing oh that's a wing on the side of the toaster oh incredible

927
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:52,680
no no yeah yeah I was doing I was doing way better before I got through like five of them

928
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,320
oh damn dude yeah I know I know

929
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:07,960
I mean you'll see what happens if you sell uh if you sell you gain some height

930
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,440
and lose some acceleration

931
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,560
yeah oh god

932
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:22,120
like see I've already fucked up because I'm too high now and the only way to lose

933
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:29,800
height is to like buy like that yeah fuck okay now we're good for now

934
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:43,400
um do you have anything left anything left to do what like like like you have any fuel left

935
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,800
you're originally gonna run out right no you like gradually gain fuel

936
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:54,360
oh god please please please please please please

937
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:03,240
but you know what I've actually figured it out I've actually like figured out that the way to

938
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:08,840
like control your height oh my god what the fuck is that I think this is like what I need

939
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,880
from this minigame I think I need to like get this and take it back

940
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,880
okay you know I figured out the way the way to control your height is to like quickly buy and

941
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:23,480
then sell yeah okay so like it's like the stock market buying sell buying sell

942
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:29,720
I've got it okay you know what I've got a I've got a plan I've got the plan now um okay okay

943
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:40,120
no uh oh am I am I good or what am I fucking good or what you're god but you're god oh my god

944
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:45,160
that was the scariest fucking thing ever oh my god I almost I almost clipped the edge um good

945
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:52,920
oh god no I fucked up yeah I fucked up I should have bought molotov okay you know what I was real

946
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:59,800
close we did good we did good so we have that thing all right good like can you do anything with

947
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:05,240
it or is it just with you I think you just have to like get it and then win look at all these

948
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:08,280
fucking buildings in the background you can feel there's a brony each one of them

949
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:14,360
at like each window each window hides a brony yeah that's just like it's just looking out the

950
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:22,200
window and just like just like ready to like be ready to like censor us yeah ready to attack

951
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:29,240
control at a moment's notice um are we are we gonna are we gonna are we gonna touch on the

952
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:33,080
elephant in the room are we gonna dress the elephant in the room uh let's do that after we

953
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:38,360

01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:32,760
someone could be yeah even though like everyone around me was it yeah it's like like i just feel

992
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,080
like if you're from like spain or portugal then you like you you like you are like in a different

993
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:43,000

1005
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:17,560
me feel bad about myself how fast do you think someone can speed run this game wait how fast

1006
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:22,840
do you think you can speed run it probably really fast oh yeah yeah like i'll bet if you know exactly

1007
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:29,080
what you're doing you can do it and like like you like like if you know exactly where the keys are

1008
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:34,440
and exactly how to like solve the puzzle like if i had known if i had known that i had to like

1009
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:41,160
fail at one of those cracks in the ground then like i could have beaten that mini game in like

1010
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:49,640
a second and a half would have taken would have taken me uh damn it oh frustrating you should probably

1011
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:55,160
go to the top one first like there's there's water in the way there's water fuck yeah

1012

1139
01:41:55,640 --> 01:42:02,920
yeah okay yeah just restart then there was a duo is it working analyst who went by the name of

1140
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:08,200
cake standard and phantom horn they starred in their own series known as two best brothers

1141
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:13,400
bitch about ponies where they basically sat in front of their microphones and did commentaries on

1142
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:18,360
the newest episode of mlp not personally not what tbap was i really think much is completely

1143
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:25,000
mischaracterized it wasn't really presented in a way that was interesting more it wasn't really

1144
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,400
presented in a way that was interesting as he shows a clip of two live action pony figures

1145
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:37,880
rocking back and forth the sound of like the commentary yeah yeah like what's being shown here

1146
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:43,640
is clearly not of any interest yeah just about any of any kind yeah like some like someone like

1147
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:48,760
misanthropony couldn't fucking wrap his head around like this you know this took more work and has

1148
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:55,080
more creativity than the entirety of misanthropony's entire life i agree um misanthropony look at

1149
01:42:55,080 --> 01:43:00,520
misanthropony's oc like like just look at misanthropony's oc to understand like the

1150
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:07,160
utter depths like the utter depths of his of like the artistic what the fuck just like the

1151
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:11,960
utter depths of like artistic abandonment and like lack what's like the lack of creativity

1152
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:17,800
that he's that he like lives within yeah like there's nothing on display here that would make me

1153
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:23,080
like believe that a human made it i would think it's like an ai or something yeah like an ai or

1154
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:30,360
maybe a small animal like a bird or a dog yeah um yeah i hate him i did understand the appeal behind

1155
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:35,320
their content at the time they were bringing something unique to the analysis community that

1156
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:39,640
not a lot of people have thought of yeah it was a simple mini series wasn't interesting there was

1157
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:44,680
something about its simplicity that gained at its own fan base thus becoming a huge part of

1158
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:50,440
brony analysis huge part he he thinks he's so clever because he's saying like he's saying there was

1159
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:57,400
something about the simplicity of it like press like press him on that and like what does he actually

1160
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:04,680
mean like can you imagine him actually like meaning anything by that like like yeah this the simplicity

1161
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:09,400
of the matter has nothing to do with it and i don't know what he's trying to describe by simplicity

1162
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:18,680
what simplicity like we made jokes it was like yeah like it like was a review that's pretty simple

1163
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:24,760
like it's way it was way it's way less simple than like the bog standard like fucking pony review

1164
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:30,600
shit that was like you know common like what stood out about it was not its simplicity it was the way

1165
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:35,480
it was different from the rest yeah the way it was presented and like the like like the actual

1166
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:40,120
like timing and like editing and the things that made it different like like it wasn't it would

1167
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:45,400
have been simpler to just do a normal review like with the pony in the corner but you actually like

1168
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:51,560
put work into it and like made like jokes and like intros yeah yeah yeah so like really there's not

1169
01:44:51,560 --> 01:45:01,080
it's not the simplicity really is not the appeal no missanthropony uh but after season five their

1170
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:07,080
content was starting to dwindle until eventually it just stopped i'm not even exaggerating when i

1171
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:13,000
use these choice of words these two just disappeared from the face of the fandom without an explanation

1172
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:19,880
completely inaccurate completely not not correct at all yeah there was in fact a lot of videos

1173
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:25,960
explaining where they went and uh if you if you were self aware whatsoever then you would know

1174
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:32,200
exactly how well to the pcp i mean there wasn't there wasn't a video on t-bat but like i don't

1175
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:37,320
know why missanthropony is saying this because like he knows about the procrastinator so like

1176
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:46,920
he knew where we went so like he can't have been confused and and and in like like like there were

1177
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:53,000
obviously ways to get to know the pcp outside like like like even though there was nothing on t-bat

1178
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,520
for an unknown reason yeah there was like you know my my deviant art and like my twitter and stuff

1179
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:04,280
yeah and and like you know all those like like phantom plays where he's talking about the pcp

1180
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:10,040
and the vapors and shit oh yeah yeah yeah uh so there's no way he dropped off that was a pony game

1181
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:15,240
you were playing when you were discussing that there's you didn't drop out the face of the fandom

1182
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:22,760
you were easily trackable and it's like and and and the mere idea that he like dropped off the face

1183
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:28,200
of the fucking earth because you stopped making pony content like like because like because like

1184
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:34,040
because this channel stopped uploading videos that's equivalent to me just i just vanished

1185
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:40,200
without a fucking trace yeah there was like nobody could have found me no one completely

1186
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:46,040
indescribable eventually it was discovered that the two decided to split up although they

1187
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:50,920
what in contact with each other and they've been working on their own individual youtube

1188
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:56,760
channels no phantom like it's just a weird way to characterize it it's just a weird way to characterize

1189
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:04,760
what happens the the two split up the two split up but still keep in contact think about no if you

1190
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:12,200
didn't know the situation how would that seem like we're just like we're just each doing things yeah

1191
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:18,600
yeah we aren't yeah we like like imagine if you were got if you if you didn't know anything about

1192
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:23,480
the pcp or tbap and you watch this video you would think that they like you and you and me

1193
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:28,680
or keg sorry i had like a falling out but like and you like you're like you're like stop making

1194
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:36,600
videos together when in fact you just like you just don't do tbap is is the point you just don't do

1195
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:43,240
tbap yeah like all all of what he's saying is to say that we stop making tbap videos yeah like

1196
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:49,800
that's that's all he needed to say here yeah and then oh shit saint who was a member of the horseshoe

1197
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:55,000
crew eventually joined the procrastinator showing my consisting of the original horseshoe

1198
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,200
crew as well as a few new why does he say that i joined i'm personally subscribed to the procrastinator

1199
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:04,520
channel because i happen to be a fan of the content that is made by the people who are

1200
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:11,640
part of this team then came the moment where i saw this video in my subscription box and this video

1201
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:19,080
was literally so heinously awful that it almost made me want to unsubscribe from procrastinators

1202
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:26,120
how dressed it starts fencing saint as he prefers these days along with this guy named

1203
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:31,160
munchie i'm going to be talking about some some guy named munchie who like he's never heard of even

1204
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:36,040
though he like follows the talking about every single thing forgive me for leaving anything out

1205
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:42,920
but you have to understand this video is literally over four hours long and seriously who the fuck

1206
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:48,840
has time to listen to four hours of these two guys talking about whatever's on their screen share

1207
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,760
yeah yeah who would have time for that thing that like several thousand people

1208
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:59,560
watch we are in the bottom corner right there yeah yeah more than five hours the video named rowdy

1209
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:07,880
fuckers cop killers frog the way he says it i mean they do play the game for a good chunk of time

1210
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:15,640
but literally at least 75 percent of what we see in this video has nothing to do with them playing

1211
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:21,160
frog fractions so much he's hung up on this leading up to the parts that i actually want to talk about

1212
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:28,840
is just this irrelevant commentary with a painfully boring tone and no direction the two sound very

1213
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:35,720
bored and unenthusiastic about the stuff that they're doing which like look what's on look what's on

1214
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:43,480
look what was on screen yeah the big the big baby boy interest from the like how yeah like we're so

1215
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:49,800
bored like we're not having any fun we are we are not we like like we're so we're we're just doing

1216
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:54,920
the right for these couples for money we have no we have no fucking personal and sensitive to do

1217
01:49:54,920 --> 01:50:04,200
whatsoever we've yeah we've sold out cold hard cash we sound bored profitable thing to ever exist

1218
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:08,840
and we're only doing it just to sell out and you know make some green it's just amazing to hear

1219
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:16,760
misanthropony like like drag on in his weird monotone like they seem very bored in the video

1220
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:24,920
and it's very uninteresting to hear them talk for literally four hours like for him to say that in

1221
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:33,080
that voice yeah in that voice and the the entire like like like how we like change subjects no rhyme

1222
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:37,400
or reason is the point of the video is that it's not supposed to be a highly edited like like you

1223
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:42,440
know like frog fractions let's play it's the right figures copies which is notorious for being long

1224
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:48,360
and just for the entire show is dedicated to the chemistry of the host that is the point of it

1225
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:53,720
and the video completely smashes your expectations like frog fractions so it's thematically relevant

1226
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:59,880
yeah well i mean obviously all that's gonna be lost on this guy yeah but it's it's weird it's

1227
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:05,400
it's amazing to me like how like he comes back to this point multiple times that like the video

1228
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:12,200
is bad because it is called frog fractions but like not all of it is about frog fractions like

1229
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:18,600
like that makes it bad it like that proves us wrong when that is in fact the point and we wanted

1230
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:26,600
it to be that way yeah they showcase a very strong lack of enthusiasm and that's not a good thing if

1231
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:31,480
you generally want the people watching your video to take it seriously don't want to take it seriously

1232
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:38,280
it's a fucking comedy show is very very slow and there's a lot of parts that really should have

1233
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:44,920
been edited out like if the words frog fractions is going to be in the title of your video you think

1234
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:51,160
that the majority of its content would be relevant to the game they spend entire portions of the

1235
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:55,880
segments just googling themselves and looking up pictures of babies

1236
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:06,280
oh my god with no real rhyme or reason they literally feel like those annoying college students

1237
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:13,480
who spend their free time looking up repetitive material on their computers this is how fucking

1238
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:22,680
bizarre like what like they literally they literally seem like describes a totally innocuous thing

1239
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,600
like these people like they literally they literally come off as though they're like

1240
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:39,720
wearing pants and shirts like Jesus what the fuck are we doing we're we're we're college

1241
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:46,200
students who are looking up images online we're looking up repetitive materials on our computers

1242
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:53,880
like the fucking nerve the nerve and and i just want to say like he's going on now and he's

1243
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:59,560
going to continue to go on for a while like criticizing the video as though like the video

1244
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:04,520
being bad is like the point that he's like it's going to come out soon that like he's really he

1245
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:10,280
actually has like a moral objection but for now he's like playing it coy like he's playing it cool

1246
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:14,920
and pretending that he just thinks it's like a bad video and it's not entertaining yeah but like

1247
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:20,840
the truth will come out he's just looking for excuses to shit on it because yeah he just knows

1248
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:25,000
he doesn't like it for one specific thing that happens later yeah so he's just coming up with

1249
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:31,400
like weird like buzzwords fucking he's yeah he's he's he's trying to scrape up he's trying to scrape

1250
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:36,360
all the all the shit he could possibly fling at it he's he's like he's he's trying to he's just

1251
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:42,360
gathering up as much as much ammunition as he can just to take us down a peg yeah because we did

1252
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:48,040
release a video that he didn't like yeah yeah yeah and we should be punished and it was so bad he

1253
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:53,560
almost unsubscribed from our youtube channel oh my fucking god dude it broke him into a fucking

1254
01:53:53,560 --> 01:54:00,360
brink of destruction like can you imagine can you imagine being bad upset with someone that you

1255
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:11,560
would unsubscribe from their youtube channel oh okay continue video i have ever seen in my life

1256
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:17,000
and i've been through smut boys channel after a bunch of more rambling that goes nowhere one of

1257
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:23,000
which involving digi bros old time we finally get to them like totally relevant totally relevant

1258
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:30,440
and at this point the focus of the video has gone way off due to the way the video is presented

1259
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:35,880
up to this point it's very clear that they did not know what they wanted it to be about it's

1260
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:41,960
just aimlessly going from one subject to the next without any meaningful segue between any of them

1261
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:48,760
i mean imagine if i made a video named spongebob squarepants obstacle odyssey playthrough and i

1262
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:53,800
play the game for 20 minutes and then the next three hours of the video is just me going through

1263
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:59,640
youtube poops or random artwork on deviantart because i forgot to turn off the recorder

1264
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:07,160
dead so we finally get into no no it's not like that it it's not that we let it we were like like

1265
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:12,120
it's like he thinks we did this by accident yeah like like like we didn't mean to we like like like

1266
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:16,520
like we wanted to have a frog fractions let's play and just play the game but but but due to the

1267
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:21,880
same tip we just had we like due to our ineptitude minded that we just accidentally opened up this

1268
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:27,720
the rift cafe wiki and just started just going haywire we said we just had no saying it whatsoever

1269
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:33,160
and we were just completely the like the slaves of our of our aptitude minded destructive thoughts

1270
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:38,280
we didn't know any better yeah there's just nothing we could do we just accidentally typed

1271
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:46,680
in the rift cafe we just accidentally started going there and we were just the entire video

1272
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:51,000
which was just supposed to be this really like tight concise highly edited let's play because i

1273
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,360
know that's what he likes that's the only kind of let's play that he that he views is valuable

1274
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:58,760
so that yeah yeah yeah that's obviously what we were going for too we also have the exact same

1275
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:03,320
you know amount of taste that he has and in exact same way so that's obviously what we were going

1276
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:09,960
for but you but just some just some stroke of of sheer misfortune we we we accidentally opened

1277
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:16,280
up the fucking rift cafe and we just accidentally did all this yeah it's incredible that he can be

1278
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:24,440
like a fan of the pcp and not understand the idea of watching a video that is just two people

1279
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:30,520
in the pcp talking like where's the fucking disconnect here like what's not getting through

1280
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:36,760
i went through a comment chain like like like like last night i was getting like like notes for

1281
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:43,880
this video and i went through it like on the pony cast the the the uh video that the videos like

1282
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:50,520
the podcast that uh jesse and uh hit play yeah yeah uh f not f and g are miss anthra probably

1283
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:55,800
commented on a video that was it was like oh man this is a really good video i really enjoy this

1284
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:00,520
which in and of itself seems like okay he like like obviously he obviously just doesn't like us

1285
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:03,880
or he doesn't like what we said so that's fine it's not the problem he has no problem with the

1286
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:09,800
like the content itself he just wants to you know fuck with us but uh the thing is in that video

1287
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:16,120
jesse comments on this drama and like like doesn't call him by name but like calls miss anthra

1288
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:23,800
weird and he just doesn't pick up on it like he's obviously what it is oh my god yeah you know

1289
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:29,000
you know what here like here's what i okay like what what i know about miss anthra pony is that

1290
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:35,000
miss anthra pony used to be a dick to like tom digi and mage and i think he even says this later

1291
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,560
in the video like he used to be he used to like bully them or like call them out and like try and

1292
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:45,240
do hit videos on them because he he like thought they were quote a bad influence like this is his

1293
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:52,280
excuse and like i think what's probably but now he's like super apologetic and like feels super

1294
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:56,280
bad and he's like he's a good boy now you know like he doesn't do that anymore so i think that

1295
01:57:56,280 --> 01:58:01,880
probably he at one point he probably like hated jesse at one point and like said nasty things about

1296
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:07,640
jesse and then like someone smarter than him like told him to stop being retarded and then he felt

1297
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:12,840
like super bad and super guilty about it and now he like did a complete 180 on jesse and like now

1298
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:17,640
he thinks jesse is a great guy and a cool guy and like and like so he's not he's gonna like he's

1299
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:21,960
gonna be nice you know like he's not gonna he's not gonna like have any problems with him because

1300
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:26,840
he's been told not to that's my hypothesis yeah because because there's no way he could like

1301
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:30,920
like just like think about it for a little bit and just like come to a different conclusion

1302
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:37,160
like you just have that in his body he can't he can't think he cannot he does not have reason

1303
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:44,840
no i don't i i don't think he does he has no good reason you might you might say you might say

1304
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:54,680
awesome fucking shit into the brony fandom or the analysis community by using the rift wikia as a

1305
01:58:54,680 --> 01:59:00,520
source and if they really wanted to make a video ripping into the analysis community this is the

1306
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:06,280
worst way they could have done it i mean it's just them browsing through an incredibly outdated

1307
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:12,360
website and using it as a source to justify their criticisms towards these people i mean okay

1308
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:19,000
considering that past analysis has no information on his tab at all i think it's safe to assume that

1309
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:25,240
this website is long long dead and it certainly should not be used by people who want to make a

1310
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:34,280
point okay first of all no no again he thinks we're coming at this from like a journalistic

1311
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:40,040
standpoint no yeah like he mentions that we're using like the rift wikia as a source for our

1312
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:45,560
bemusement for the brony community when when the only thing we're doing is to like we're like like

1313
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:52,200
vaguely remind us of like our past like our past yeah yeah yeah like our source we're not like

1314
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:56,520
reading this and then making a judgment based on that we're just remembering what happened and you

1315
01:59:56,520 --> 02:00:01,160
know we forgot about a lot of these fucking geeks and freaks a long time ago so we're just using this

1316
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:05,320
to like remind oh yeah room lappers and yeah remember that osemer where they did that we didn't

1317
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:10,920
like yeah that's like we have like we have like we have per yeah we have personal experience with

1318
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:15,800
these people like this is not yeah yeah we're not like learning about this for the first time

1319
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:21,560
yeah yeah yeah um although there is like there is one or two people that i'd never heard of

1320
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:27,480
and like i said they were shit and like uh but like whatever like that's different the vast majority

1321
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:33,640
and and and also i think even if we were using this as a source which we aren't yeah uh that would

1322
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:39,640
still be valid because these are like what the people think about them like this yeah like somebody

1323
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:46,600
wrote this is about it them yeah yeah like sure it's outdated but like i'm sorry like find me a

1324
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:51,880
better source then yeah yeah yeah find me a fucking better source miss antherpony what would you

1325
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:58,760
recommend that i use to rip into the brony fandom yeah and and and the only people that we make fun

1326
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:04,840
of like just for it is because we don't like the website itself like the website itself is funny to

1327
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:10,360
us yeah so like it's like it's like when we find someone who we the majority of time we just make

1328
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:15,880
fun of them through the website as a source quote unquote we're just making fun of the website for

1329
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:25,880
being terrible yeah he doesn't get it like he really he really just doesn't he let me

1330
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:31,640
it's just it's just lost on him you know yeah like and i can't i can't believe that this guy

1331
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:36,840
watches the pcp and still doesn't like get what the point of ratty fuckers cop killers is like

1332
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:44,840
that like that doesn't make any sense to me it's just he just completely he will never not be confused

1333
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:48,760
and he just doesn't know he's confused he's confused on the inside and he just doesn't know it

1334
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:58,760
you're so right you're so right he's so confused he's confused about his confusion yeah he he he

1335
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:02,840
thinks he knows things when in reality he doesn't know things and he knows he doesn't know things but

1336
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:09,640
but who cares it doesn't matter like like like he i mean he's still gonna have an opinion like

1337
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:14,520
he's still gonna form an opinion despite knowing that he doesn't know anything yeah yeah yeah why

1338
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:22,760
not because why not what what what what could possibly go wrong good amount of time bitching

1339
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:28,440
about shipping and the analysts and some of the artists and all of that dumb jazz and at one

1340
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:34,920
point munchie asks ben saint how it's possible for anyone to still give a shit about mlp

1341
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:40,040
then oh how is it there's nothing i hate literally possible

1342
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:45,400
incriminating evidence still yeah yeah the proof is in the pudding shit about my little pony

1343
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:54,520
i don't know i don't fucking know may i remind you this is coming from a guy who spent 34 minutes

1344
02:02:54,520 --> 02:03:00,920
of his life discussing taco bell with digi bro as if it actually holds any weight and because of that

1345
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:08,440
we're supposed to take this seriously he says that he says that in a way he says that in a

1346
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:14,120
voice that is like he's really got you like he's really caught you in a contradiction here

1347
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:24,760
that that sentence doesn't make sense that does not that is not how you speak it's like

1348
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:38,520
munchie said munchie said that he doesn't understand why people like tuna fish but over here he spent

1349
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:47,480
34 minutes talking about how good salmon is and we're expected to take that seriously like i guess

1350
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:54,520
yeah like okay okay so so we ask this okay okay there's a clip okay what i say is how can anyone

1351
02:03:54,520 --> 02:04:00,040
still care about mlp a seven-year-old show with a little to no substance the what's so ever that

1352
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:05,480
we only watch like due to zeitgeist and perceived like lack of options on tv that's the only reason

1353
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:12,840
anyone watched that entire fucking show yeah it sucks it's bad it's horrible it sucks i hate mlp

1354
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:20,360
it's awful no one should watch it sure it's horrible so so so so i dare i dare to question why

1355
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:29,000
anyone watching lp uh a fucking it like a meme a literal meme a literal meme show i i dare to

1356
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,360
question what what what value it could have and then and then like he like shits on stealing your dad

1357
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:41,640
as if that literally means anything if that has any bearing whatsoever first listen to your dad is

1358
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:46,600
more like just it like you can call it a food review show when in fact it's just me and digi

1359
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:50,760
making jokes and like the food review is like a backdrop much like almost all of our content is

1360
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:56,360
about the chemistry of the hosts and not the actual subject matter itself that's the point of all of

1361
02:04:56,360 --> 02:05:00,600
our content maybe he said no maybe he didn't know that's the point and and you're welcome you're

1362
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:06,120
welcome for me explain to it i mean of course he doesn't know of course of course he doesn't

1363
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:13,160
understand that like listen to him look at him look at him and and and what does me making bad

1364
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:17,560
content and not you know send your dad's the best show ever made but like if it if it was just dog

1365
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:23,000
shit what she doesn't uh what would that do with mlp being bad yeah yeah what would that what would

1366
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:29,800
that have to do yeah it's like it's like it's like like let's see you do better it's like yeah like

1367
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:34,840
like the fact that you did anything that he doesn't think is good means that your opinion about anything

1368
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:41,240
at all is worthless and like should be should be discarded immediately it's not even that i like i

1369
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:45,720
reviewed like it's not that like i reviewed a show that he thought it was bad and he's like oh well

1370
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:52,600
your tastes are just bad it's not like that it's not like i am fucking like like i just don't i can't

1371
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:59,720
review shows correctly or something it's completely different like medium it's like how does my opinion

1372
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:06,280
on food invalidate my opinion on a cartoon you did you did something completely unrelated

1373
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:11,080
that he doesn't see the value in like therefore just like you're wrong about everything yeah

1374
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:17,400
i don't fucking understand i don't understand what his point is or what he's trying to like get

1375
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:22,200
across like he like he obviously think that's that's kind of like a weird but it's kind of like a weird

1376
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:26,440
ad hominem like like the fact that you would do that like the fact that you would do that means

1377
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:30,920
you're stupid and therefore we shouldn't take it seriously or something like like that's what he's

1378
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:35,880
trying to do which is like terrible like even if even if he succeeded at doing that like it would

1379
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:40,600
be shitty and embarrassing that he did but like he didn't even succeed because his point doesn't make

1380
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:49,560
any sense it's it's indescribable it is okay continue they do eventually come across digibro's

1381
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:55,400
page and they don't really say anything bad about him and i suppose that does make sense considering

1382
02:06:55,400 --> 02:07:00,760
that ben saint is friends with both friends but not not you though not really out of nowhere

1383
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:07,880
ramble on how much ben saint really hates burning doughnut just because he saw his i was a little

1384
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:13,480
hard on burning yeah he takes his artwork and proceeds to call him an idiot but what exactly

1385
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:19,560
does he mean he literally says nothing about the burning doughnut except for how he sets up his

1386
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:26,200
patreon he doesn't really say anything about the burning i literally self he just i literally

1387
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:31,640
say nothing about the burning doughnut except for like a thing that he did well yeah here let it go

1388
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:38,680
criticize it is what he does on the internet oh and speaking of okay okay okay so he's this this is

1389
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:45,000
like this is what he says all he does is make fun of his patreon he doesn't make any he doesn't make

1390
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:50,120
any points about the burning doughnut himself if he just criticizes the stuff he does online

1391
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:57,240
do you understand the problem with that sentence do you like like like like like the like the stuff

1392
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:03,720
you do online is not real like that's not what some that doesn't represent a person in any

1393
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:09,000
meaningful way he doesn't like that stuff like that stuff is is like like that stuff is like above

1394
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:18,280
criticism okay he doesn't criticize the burning doughnut he just criticizes what he does yeah

1395
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:26,200
what the fuck like like like i mean that's insane that's insane from the get go but like even

1396
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:31,560
overlooking how obviously retarded that idea is there's like you know i could be like well

1397
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:35,240
that's what you're doing to us right now you're criticizing what we did on the internet yeah

1398
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:37,400
you're criticizing a thing we put on the internet

1399
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:44,920
uh are we are we are like the neurons firing are you putting a picture are we painting a picture

1400
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:51,080
of your brain blast i he needs he needs a good brain blaster too he needs to have a brain in the

1401
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:59,320
first place which he obviously doesn't he needs something like okay i i want to harp on this

1402
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:07,240
because it's fucking insane yeah he just i just don't understand how it can be so

1403
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:14,840
blatantly contradictory like and he also have like a script this way this is scripted i'm sure

1404
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:21,800
i'm sure i'm positive yeah so how can you write okay you you think that you think that sentence

1405
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:27,320
you write that sentence you record that sentence you edit that sentence yeah you do all of those

1406
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:35,720
things and you don't catch how it's clearly a contradiction onto itself yeah and that it makes

1407
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:42,360
zero sense he's you are you're you are criticizing the burning donut for the things that he's doing

1408
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:49,160
online the things that he's doing online are making you make judgments based you are judging him

1409
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:53,960
you are judging him based on the things that he does yeah yeah yeah yeah judging him based on his

1410
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:59,080
words and his actions yeah and that's and that's and that's ridiculous like that's a ridiculous thing

1411
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:08,120
to do yeah that's insane it is insane insane it is completely insane that is unbearable

1412
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:17,160
um someone needs to stop him he needs to be fucking stopped right continue okay

1413
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:23,400
patreon get used to ben saint going back to this because he bitches about patreon

1414
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:29,560
like he spends a lot of time complaining about the amount of money that people are making on

1415
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:36,040
patreon despite that he has no reason to do so why would he even want to he's clearly making more

1416
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:41,560
money than at least half of these people so it shouldn't even be phasing him at all is it because

1417
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:46,360
he just doesn't like the idea that these people are getting money for expressing their talents

1418
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:52,040
because that's literally what it looks like while it's not the worst thing that i've seen so far

1419
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:59,560
it definitely makes him look pretentious on pretentious it makes me look pretentious specifically

1420
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:06,680
on a very heart-to-stomach level and from there they just spend a lot of time being complete

1421
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:15,080
hold on pause the video like pause making me making the video yeah yeah yeah

1422

1473
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:24,120
person to think that nearly five hours of two junkies aimlessly internet browsing on someone's

screen share is a good use of your time uh miss antherpony i'm literally the most straight

1529
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:10,520
We have to get Hippo to download Skype so we can be on.

1530
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:17,200
No, this is good, no this is good, this is what we want.

1531
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:18,200
This is commercial break.

1532
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:19,200
Do you have frog fractures?

1533
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:23,080
Just go to frog fractures and start playing more.

1534
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:25,080
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

1535
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:27,600
Pretty good.

1536
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:35,560
Pon Luffing Ulysses S. Grant used this political slogan in 1872, take a-

1537
02:24:35,560 --> 02:24:37,240
I think it's Grantham No Quarter.

1538
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:38,240
Pretty sure.

1539
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:45,400
Grantham No Quarter, oops, you blew that one, okay, he who cannot lie does not know what

1540
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:47,000
the truth is?

1541
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:53,580
Oh, Otto von Bismarck unified this collection of territories, the German Empire.

1542
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:55,580
Oh no no no no no no.

1543
02:24:55,580 --> 02:24:56,580
None of these are right.

1544
02:24:56,580 --> 02:24:58,860
You sure it's not the German Empire?

1545
02:24:58,860 --> 02:25:02,640
No, definitely, yeah, no, definitely not the German Empire.

1546
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:04,600
Definitely not Bismarck, definitely not Belgium.

1547
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:10,060
I'm fairly certain it's not rugby union, but you can try that it's not the rugby union. I

1548
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:15,660
I know for a fact that it's not any of the other ones. It's the German Empire's what they had after he did that

1549
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:21,960
Yeah, yeah, because because he unified them. He made them by unifying these collection of territories

1550
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:27,660
It's not like what is it called after he unified those territories like I think it is I think the difference is academic

1551
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:32,980
I'm pretty sure that like he unified a region that then became the German Empire. I'm going with German Empire. Oh

1552
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:39,420
Look at that. Oh, look at that. Look who knows a finger. I was I know I know my shit. They were just gay

1553

1557
02:25:56,900 --> 02:26:00,860

1558
02:26:02,980 --> 02:26:08,420

1563
02:26:32,460 --> 02:26:36,740
No, okay. Okay, you're you're on from fractions to because I didn't want to explain to you

1564
02:26:36,740 --> 02:26:40,180
And then we would have downtime and I have to explain to you on fact for our actions, too

1565
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:44,420
So here's what you do. I'm gonna give you the file right now for Minecraft. Oh

1566
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:49,260
Okay

1567
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:55,060
Very confused. No, it's fine. This is good though

1568
02:26:55,340 --> 02:27:01,660
This is so the pincers are unique among glasses and I

1569
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:06,900
All right. Meanwhile, this is we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna have downtime, right?

1570
02:27:08,580 --> 02:27:13,780
All right, so what you're gonna do is well while you're doing this you're gonna want to you are on Windows 7, right?

1571
02:27:14,380 --> 02:27:15,500
Yep

1572
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:20,540
No, no hippo hippo. I am. Yes. Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, sorry

1573
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:27,300
That was been first because I can't I can't tell go go to and like I go to like open up like the start menu and type in I

1574
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:30,340
P

1575
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:32,340
C O

1576
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:33,860
in

1577
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:35,700
F I

1578
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:37,700
G IP config

1579
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:44,780
The temperance fountain is a good. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You want to you're gonna want to see MD Edward

1580
02:27:44,780 --> 02:27:46,780
And then you're gonna do I

1581
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:50,980
In what's your type and see you type in cmd.exe

1582
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:53,660
Okay

1583
02:27:53,660 --> 02:27:54,780
All right

1584
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:56,780
I'm looking at

1585
02:27:56,780 --> 02:28:01,500
Okay, okay. Now now you're gonna want to look at for IPv4 address

1586
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:06,380
All right, I got that. Is this streaming by the way, you shouldn't be streaming this. I don't think

1587
02:28:08,380 --> 02:28:10,380
Okay, it's fine

1588
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:16,460
Then type in that address you see into your like your like browser. You're like internet browser. All right

1589
02:28:16,460 --> 02:28:18,460
well, I can't stream that but

1590
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:23,340
Yeah, I know I'll just I'll just turn it off. It'll be the be the this will be part of the frog fractions

1591
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:29,500
So we're being streamed right now, right? Like like like this part of frog fractions will be on the street, right? Yeah

1592
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:33,780
Yeah, okay, good. Nice. All right, so I type that into

1593
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:35,780
Hey, just a little preview

1594
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:40,580
I had to play mess that too so we could advance and fraud fractions too in this of YouTube video

1595
02:28:40,820 --> 02:28:44,100
This YouTube video will be the best YouTube video ever made

1596
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:51,940
So here I am like these questions are like the hardest they're so hard

1597
02:28:53,220 --> 02:28:56,820
Okay, okay. So so it's it's in there and when when you open that up

1598
02:28:58,500 --> 02:29:04,740
IPv4 address I type that into my browser. Yeah, and then like it didn't happen. It didn't work

1599
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:06,740
I don't know. Maybe a rarity. Yeah

1600
02:29:07,740 --> 02:29:12,660
Donald Denny became widely known for his I got there's so many different IPv4 addresses

1601
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:16,300
Okay, be I IPv4

1602
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:19,340
V4 a Scottish strong man. Okay

1603
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:25,180
So so you typed in oh, wait. No, this I'm just I come in the lowest one

1604
02:29:25,420 --> 02:29:30,980
They come as a boon and a blessing to you know what you might actually want to use might you want to use default gateway?

1605
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:34,620
I'm just trying something else

1606
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:38,180
That didn't work

1607
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:44,260
No, you know what you hear here go to the IP config thing like that like window and then try and type into your browser

1608
02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:51,940
What is an effective treatment for hysterectomy

1609
02:29:52,580 --> 02:29:57,460
Not not like the words default gateway as in like those numbers and then yeah, yeah for hysteria

1610
02:29:57,700 --> 02:30:00,380
You should get like a brink screen that says what's your password you?

1611
02:30:01,140 --> 02:30:03,140
Yes, yes, I did it

1612
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:07,340
What at least that's how it is for netgear. What do you have? What's your what's your router?

1613
02:30:08,660 --> 02:30:12,460
BT oh, I got I got a thing saying BT. Oh

1614
02:30:13,500 --> 02:30:16,620
Oh, it says that doesn't ask for a username or password. I

1615
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:21,980
Don't think so. Okay, so you're just in there like try and look around

1616
02:30:21,980 --> 02:30:27,660
It'll probably like it'd be an advanced advanced saying somewhere something like that find a place. It says port forwarding

1617
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:30,260
I

1618
02:30:30,860 --> 02:30:34,340
Might be in like a few for me for me in netgear. It's

1619
02:30:35,500 --> 02:30:40,940
Advanced then advanced setup then port forwarding slash port triggering. That's what it is for me

1620
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:43,500
But it might look probably different Pico

1621
02:30:43,580 --> 02:30:45,900
This is this is fucked. This is

1622
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:52,820
The fact that you're trying to explain that in a tutorial to the I just want to play Minecraft with my friends

1623
02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:55,380
You couldn't turn the server on. I mean, it's funny

1624
02:30:55,380 --> 02:31:00,660
I mean, I mean, I couldn't do that because like I like I actually like reset like my server

1625
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:04,580
Like I would have just done that but my like my like the world is fine

1626
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:09,140
But the actual like server itself doesn't have like the right like like settings in it

1627
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:12,460
Which I guess I could do right now and it actually be really easy. So I guess let's do that

1628
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:17,620
But wait stay here in case it doesn't work all right

1629
02:31:18,380 --> 02:31:22,500
You can also you can just stay here if you want to get Nate on here

1630
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:27,860
You could just stream minecraft and then the Minecraft stream will be in frog practice to that would be pretty funny

1631
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:30,220
Oh

1632
02:31:30,220 --> 02:31:34,820
Hey, by the way, what do you think about far corrections to just so you have that on like record?

1633
02:31:34,820 --> 02:31:38,460
So when Santa reporting can see this video and then he'll be like, oh my god, he likes it

1634
02:31:40,020 --> 02:31:45,860
What do I think about for impressions to I know no no for corrections one like the video like our video

1635
02:31:45,860 --> 02:31:52,500
I think I talked about it in my own stream and he's seen that because he followed my my my YouTube for that

1636
02:31:53,380 --> 02:31:55,380
So he knows, you know

1637
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:57,940
He knows whatever it was I said

1638
02:31:58,820 --> 02:32:00,820
Yeah

1639
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:02,820
Make sure I'll find

1640
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:08,500
All right, I hope you fucking god. Oh, yeah, I'm trying to do three

Why did I get mad at you and you were like that? I didn't do anything wrong. Yeah

1645
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:32,060

02:34:56,260 --> 02:34:58,260
What the fuck was she gonna do to you? Oh?

1674
02:34:59,020 --> 02:35:01,740
How could we how could we go after the I don't even have a

1675
02:35:02,060 --> 02:35:04,060
Rosie severe

1676
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:05,780
Cuz he's a kid

1677
02:35:05,780 --> 02:35:07,420
Like I'm not blaming him

1678
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:14,260
I'm not blaming him for being terrible and being useless and for him being worthless and for his content being shit

1679
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:19,540
I'm not blaming him for any of that then why the fuck are you wasting your time?

1680
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:21,420
criticizing him

1681
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:26,540
See the thing about wooden wooden sword is like I went to his channel later and I watched his videos and like well

1682
02:35:26,540 --> 02:35:29,580
I didn't think they were good. I thought they were perfectly like fine

1683
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:34,540
They were they were just like bog standard like you know goofy YouTube yeah, and I was like well

1684
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:37,500
I mean, yeah, like there's worse people

1685
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:43,740
There's it's still shit cuz it's pony shit cuz he's making pony reviews, you know, there's inherently bad

1686
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:51,380
Yeah, what he's doing isn't there like brute force like with yeah, yeah, yeah, it's an uphill battle

1687
02:35:52,180 --> 02:35:58,340
Now I understand there are a lot of people who like and dislike these analysts for different reasons

1688
02:35:58,340 --> 02:36:01,140
But the way that Ben saint is doing it

1689
02:36:01,140 --> 02:36:08,100
He really doesn't give us a lot to work with like the way that he just kind of slurs on his sentences

1690
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:13,220
As he talks about these people really makes it seem like he doesn't know much about them at all

1691
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:17,160
Which right from the bat doesn't make him very resourceful for this

1692
02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:23,380
criticizing a speech impediment which I don't even have yeah and like

1693
02:36:24,860 --> 02:36:26,860
like like I

1694
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:33,180
Just I just can't understand like we know these people it's especially you like I know of these people

1695
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:37,260
But you've taught these people like yeah, you know you know them

1696
02:36:37,820 --> 02:36:44,220
Yeah, you are like like where the fuck does missanthropony get off telling me that I don't know what I'm talking about like yeah

1697
02:36:44,220 --> 02:36:47,300
I have I have like personally interacted with these people before

1698
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:52,760
It's disgusting like it's really disgusting that he thought he had any fucking grounds to say any

1699
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:58,480
He's making money you're not anything what in fact he is the one who knows absolutely nothing about the video

1700
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:05,200
He's watching he just does not understand a single fucking thing about the appeal or the draw of it or even what the video is

1701
02:37:05,640 --> 02:37:11,240
He just does not understand. He's not understand. He really really

1702
02:37:12,560 --> 02:37:18,520
Is just like he's just literally retarded. Let's just let's just put it right out there like he's actually retarded and there's something wrong with him

1703
02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:22,520
He just he just is not smart. He just is not a smart man

1704
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:25,360
No, oh, and they also not perceptive

1705
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:32,240
Mr. Enter doesn't have a Pony OC despite that. He actually did have a pony. Oh heaven forbid on a video

1706
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:40,040
I really fucked up. It was also just on a thumbnail and yeah, I was just really starting to get bored

1707
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:47,160
Like I can't say that I'm getting upset with this video. It doesn't piss me off. It's just so boring

1708
02:37:47,160 --> 02:37:50,200
It's just I don't make an example. I don't make this video entertaining

1709
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:54,960
So they start talking about Vita and at some point they go to his channel

1710
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:02,520
Oh, he's got oh, he's got a little fucking video of him with the key frame key frame and puzzle

1711
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:09,760
Oh key frame fucking key frame. Oh great. This stick is gonna start talking about key frame. I wonder how this is gonna go

1712
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:13,240
Let's let's fucking talk about key. Why did he bother making that?

1713
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:15,240
Oh

1714
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:33,880
Way to show us how you're willing to look down on people then personally criticizing key frame and mocking her patreon

1715
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:39,540
I seriously cannot figure out how I like it any worse from there. Why? Why is that?

1716
02:38:40,300 --> 02:38:42,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah like

1717
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:44,060
like

1718
02:38:44,060 --> 02:38:52,260
Like just like just like with burning doughnut. He's like it's like I've incriminated myself by criticizing the wrong aspect of a person

1719
02:38:53,380 --> 02:38:58,300
And also not only that which we've already explained how that is making sense

1720
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:03,980
Like why why now? Why not any of the other like like he's just mentioned by name the brain

1721
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:07,240
Like he's been he mentioned like them in like like a list like oh, I look impossible

1722
02:39:07,240 --> 02:39:12,540
I don't fucking doctor will but he didn't go in like like this is like he goes in like oh my god

1723
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:18,000
He's talking about this about key frame. Like why is this any worse than you know the other people?

1724
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:21,740
You know why it's because it's because he had some personal thing

1725
02:39:21,740 --> 02:39:26,780
He had some like personal connection to key for it because someone told him because someone told him

1726
02:39:26,780 --> 02:39:29,720
It was a big deal and shouldn't be joked about you know

1727
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:37,160
It just goes to show that he just doesn't like he like he doesn't actually care about these like the things that we're saying

1728
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:44,240
He just cares that he like like he wasn't told they supposed to care when we make fun about Kim possible or about Dr. Wolf

1729
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:47,880
We're not he wasn't he wasn't like informed that's bad as well

1730
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:51,880
He only knows that it's bad. He's we're talking about key frame and that specific instance

1731
02:39:51,880 --> 02:39:54,920
I think that even worse. I think that probably like

1732
02:39:55,440 --> 02:40:02,400
Like Miss Anthropony gets mad and indignant when someone else does something that like he has done and been scolded for

1733
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:04,160
like

1734
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:10,440
He like he gets upset about about like his path like the fact that he was mean to lethal or a mage and stuff

1735
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:15,240
Like I think that maybe like maybe like he was mean to key frame and someone told him like dude

1736
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:19,360
That's not cool because this is serious and now he's like oh now

1737
02:40:19,360 --> 02:40:24,440
He knows like this is serious and if anyone else does it I'm gonna fucking step in and be like, you know

1738
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:29,520
Justice, you know, yeah, like that's that's my that's my headcanon at least

1739
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:34,920
Yeah, is that he's just like like he's been scolded for this before so he's like I made them

1740
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:37,720
I learned from my mistakes because later on in the video

1741
02:40:37,720 --> 02:40:41,960
He does go into bit like like I learned from my mistakes, but these guys didn't

1742
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:44,840
Yeah, fucker. I'm here

1743
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:48,360
She comes in she's there for like a week

1744
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:53,600
She makes like one video and then and then on with the waterworks on with the fucking

1745
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:59,720
Oh, no, suddenly. I'm really poor and I'm getting and my family is abusing me and and oh, no

1746
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:06,520
My life is ruined. Oh somebody help me and then they do and then the fucking doesn't people pledge to her patreon

1747
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:12,000
Get her like I don't know like a hundred bucks a month or something and probably they fucking give her money to like

1748
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:15,800
I don't know she's got a bunch of money and now she's been for a while

1749
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:21,880
For a while there fucking key frame was making more than on patreon than me and it fucking ate at me

1750
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:24,040
Thank God

1751
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:26,480
Yeah

1752
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:30,000
You know that's

1753
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:33,560
That that's a thing that's a thing that Josh Scorcher used to do like he would

1754
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:38,880
He would quote unquote not swear like he wouldn't call you an asshole

1755
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:43,960
He would call you an a apostrophe apostrophe hole like like it like it's any better

1756
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:48,120
Yeah, like he's not just like he's not just calling at you

1757
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:54,880
But like with like them the moral high ground of like oh, but I didn't actually say it. That's bizarre like yeah

1758
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:57,120
Like I was gonna call him the C word

1759
02:41:57,520 --> 02:42:03,760
Okay, so we know that you wanted to call him a cunt. How does that that has why didn't you just say it?

1760
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:08,280
Yeah, why like you don't have any reason to not say it. It's one like

1761
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:15,600
That would have just been better because it means you're not a fucking weird coward was weird such a weird coward

1762
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:22,320
Like he's misanthropony is such a coward. It's amazing. He's just like slimy and gross and untrustworthy and just completely

1763
02:42:22,840 --> 02:42:26,040
He just doesn't have any values or morals whatsoever

1764
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:31,680
Only those have been like only only those worlds which have been just imposed upon him

1765
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:38,720
And he doesn't understand whatsoever and are completely impersonal and he just he just follows like oh, I'm not supposed to swear for no reason

1766
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:45,200
Yeah, just yeah, he doesn't have any he doesn't have any like critical thinking or like higher level like like meta like meta

1767
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:50,480
Thinking skills like he doesn't have any like he doesn't have any like ethical like principles that he follows

1768
02:42:50,720 --> 02:42:56,720
He just has like rules that he's like learned rules that other people have told him. That's that's my takeaway

1769
02:42:57,400 --> 02:43:03,480
All right, he clearly knows that the keyframe movement was a thing and yet

1770
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:11,000
He's talking about it like it was just a complete scam despite all the evidence pointing out that it's not bro

1771
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:15,040
Yeah, I can understand your detachment from the brony fandom in recent years

1772
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:20,080
But you are really starting to trend on show me show me any evidence

1773
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:25,600
Like like he's claiming there's evidence, but he doesn't give any of it. Yeah in the comments in the comments

1774
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:31,360
I think he was like, oh, I wouldn't I don't want to give any evidence because I don't want to like divulge keyframes personal

1775
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:35,680
Shit and well, no, how am I supposed to see?

1776
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:38,720
Well, I guess I'll just take your word for it then

1777
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:41,680
No, faggot

1778
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:45,680
This is another person who like

1779
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:53,080
Like keyframe because she had like a sad tear jerky like oh, I feel so bad for myself fucking

1780
02:43:54,160 --> 02:44:00,440
Moment with dr. Wolf. I'm pretty sure this person got like I don't know some fucking money out of it too or something

1781
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:05,120
Play that again

1782
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:11,600
Like keyframe because she had like a sad tear jerky like oh, I feel so bad for myself fucking

1783
02:44:12,680 --> 02:44:18,640
Moment with dr. Wolf. I'm pretty sure this person got like I don't know some fucking money out of it too or something

1784
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:20,720
He's so mad

1785
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:29,140
Okay, it was bad enough for you to muck that situation once but twice you seriously had to go back to it twice

1786
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:31,920
Why wasn't he this mad the first time? Yeah?

1787
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:36,000
Like like like okay, it's like if it's so bad

1788
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Why did it take me doing it twice to really make a mess? Yeah, like I

1789
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:44,120
Just just another weird rule

1790
02:44:44,120 --> 02:44:50,600
I guess just like it sounds like something bad like or like so horribly bad just once and it's fine

1791
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:52,840
But if they but if they say it again

1792
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:57,360
Then then you know they really mean it and then you then it's okay to criticize

1793
02:44:58,120 --> 02:45:06,800
Yeah, no, I was going to do some kind of over-the-top yelling or some kind of really angry facial

1794
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:12,800
Oh, is it coming to show you how is it about to happen? I am with you right now, but there are no words

1795
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:16,200
There are no facial expressions that could possibly

1796
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:22,360
Capture how pissed off I am right now the only thing that could possibly and appropriately

1797
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:29,040
Represent how pissed off I am right now is this one clip from injustice gods among us

1798
02:45:53,360 --> 02:45:58,960
Forget the doctor video. I don't even know I don't even know what to say about that. I

1799
02:46:01,280 --> 02:46:03,280
Don't even know

1800
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:07,400
Ben it's just it's just a mate like like he's like how

1801
02:46:07,800 --> 02:46:13,480
How can I like how can I put like the biggest fucking exclamation point on like what I'm saying here?

1802
02:46:13,480 --> 02:46:17,480
Like how can I really can like the like the most the strongest

1803
02:46:17,720 --> 02:46:22,200
Convance of the the feeling that I have like what is what is the most heartfelt sincere

1804
02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:24,960
expression of this feeling

1805
02:46:25,720 --> 02:46:32,880
Okay, I want you to really really ponder. I want you to ponder and think and reflect. Yeah, okay

1806
02:46:33,240 --> 02:46:37,720
So he says that he could like make a big stink about it

1807
02:46:37,720 --> 02:46:42,520
Like, you know like like I guess he has some sufferers where he knows that it's like out place

1808
02:46:42,520 --> 02:46:43,960
We want to really emphasize it

1809
02:46:43,960 --> 02:46:49,280
But the only way he like it comes off is the only way he knows how to express himself is by just

1810
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:54,800
Using a clip from a video game like yeah, that's exactly those sort of terms

1811
02:46:55,560 --> 02:47:04,040
We're like like he wants to like what what video game moment made him feel this like he made him like think about

1812
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:10,080
How angry something is that one thing from justice gods among us like I that just feels so

1813
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:19,280
Low functioning, you know, yeah, it feels like he saw that scene and just was impressed by like the anger on display

1814
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:24,000
And like never forgot it. Yeah, I was like really really impressed by it and like

1815
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:31,040
Was and so when he thought like I'm angry. How can I explain? I remember the time Superman was really angry

1816
02:47:32,760 --> 02:47:34,760
Here here we go

1817
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:39,040
Just he can't express himself

1818
02:47:40,440 --> 02:47:47,600
Doesn't know how he doesn't know how to act or think or feel no, I mean this is like I

1819
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:51,400
Mean I we watched a couple of his other like reaction videos

1820
02:47:51,400 --> 02:47:57,440
Like we watched through the video or where he like reacts to like the the the MLP movie trailer and how he like

1821
02:47:57,800 --> 02:48:05,200
Started giggling like just like when Pinkie Pie appeared on screen like just Pinkie Pie showing up and being seen he just started like

1822
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:08,760
He just started giggling like a girl like a little girl

1823
02:48:08,800 --> 02:48:13,960
And it's like this is the kind of person that we're dealing with like he just

1824
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:21,560
He's very enthralled by media of all kinds and yeah, he that's how he chooses to communicate

1825
02:48:22,320 --> 02:48:25,700
Yeah, yeah, like like very low functioning very low

1826
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:33,080
Missing throw a pony could he would talk exclusively like mule and from Homestuck in just Tumblr gifts

1827
02:48:33,240 --> 02:48:38,280
That's how his ideal communication would work. I imagine yeah, like no words

1828
02:48:38,800 --> 02:48:43,360
Just move like like just moments from movies strung together to make a sentence

1829
02:48:48,120 --> 02:48:53,400
Yeah, I just hate him I just hate how he looks like oh, yeah, I just hate his OC

1830
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:56,800
Let's talk about how shitty his OC is for a second. Okay, it's just really bad

1831
02:48:57,160 --> 02:49:00,720
It's like it's really bad like it's just Pinkie, but like bad

1832
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:07,820
It's like I just I hate how it's but his OC is a rip-off, you know, I can't I can't fucking stand that

1833
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:15,340
Anyway, that's that's kind of a side of the point not not everyone can have like be like an artist and like make a good OC

1834
02:49:15,340 --> 02:49:20,500
I guess I get that. Yeah, well, even though I think the art of making an OC is disgusting

1835
02:49:20,900 --> 02:49:26,900
However, I understand that for some reason you may want to do it. Yeah. Yeah, there are reasons

1836
02:49:27,380 --> 02:49:33,140
This is one of the worst OCs I've ever seen this I actually think you know, I actually think

1837
02:49:34,140 --> 02:49:40,180
Miss Anthroponies OC is like really close to tune critics in terms of like my least favorite pony OCs

1838
02:49:40,180 --> 02:49:42,700
Like if they're both like in the extreme leagues

1839
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:47,100
Yeah, like like like like it's just the red

1840
02:49:47,100 --> 02:49:52,700
It's just the red because he knows it like red looks cool because it's like evil. It's like yeah

1841
02:49:52,700 --> 02:49:58,700
It's like it's like an evil color. So I'm gonna use a red because I'm like I'm like I'm like morally gray

1842
02:49:58,700 --> 02:50:01,740
I'm like, you know, I consider myself the least gay

1843
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:10,940
It's just like he took he took sad pinky pie and then just like tweaked it in ways that made it so much worse

1844
02:50:11,340 --> 02:50:14,420
And was like done. I'm satisfied with this

1845
02:50:15,700 --> 02:50:20,540
What is that key mark by the way? What is that? I don't I don't know

1846
02:50:20,540 --> 02:50:26,560
Like is it supposed to be like comedy and tragedy because like it's not he's this isn't comedy. This is only tragedy

1847
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:31,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know man. I don't know what it's supposed to be

1848
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:35,100
I guess it probably means something real retarded. And you just have to ask

1849
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:40,300
Like an angel of death. He's like a death merchant. He's gonna like you like like pop a cap in your ass

1850
02:50:40,660 --> 02:50:45,580
But like not ask like like a asterisk asterisk because he can't yeah, his mom is on the phone

1851
02:50:46,420 --> 02:50:48,220
Yeah

1852
02:50:48,220 --> 02:50:53,700
When I when I said that for did I say apostrophe when I meant? Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. Well, excuse me

1853
02:50:54,980 --> 02:50:58,640
Fuck me F F apostrophe CK me

1854
02:50:59,240 --> 02:51:00,400
Mm-hmm

1855
02:51:00,400 --> 02:51:03,800
God you want to keep going? Yeah. Yeah, so bad

1856
02:51:04,240 --> 02:51:07,400
The key frame movement happened two years ago

1857
02:51:07,400 --> 02:51:14,680
And that's not including the ten years prior where she was struggling to not get killed by her mother or worse

1858
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:22,720
The only reason she's still alive is because by some miracle her shitty father is a slightly

1859
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:29,400
Less shitty person if you still think that any of us were making this up while it was happening

1860
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:37,080
I still have that video that was uploaded on DeWelstonators channel saved onto a flash drive in my room

1861
02:51:37,320 --> 02:51:40,840
Before it was put as unlisted or private

1862
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:48,040
I can mail it to you whenever I can provide it that I have permission from key frame or wants to mail me a video

1863
02:51:48,800 --> 02:51:51,440
He wants to mail me a video as proof of

1864
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:58,560
Something like I'm just really unconvinced like yeah, maybe that like maybe there is a real

1865
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:05,000
Maybe there is a real problem here that like I don't know about but like he's really not convincing me like it's like

1866
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:07,840
He keeps alluding in fact out there

1867
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:15,440
It's just so plainly and like like just get just everyone was about key frame when in fact I okay first of all

1868
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:19,160
I don't know about key frame. I don't even know who key frame is so I don't know anything about that

1869
02:52:19,160 --> 02:52:26,800
But I'm assuming I'm assuming that it's not that easy to find out information of this because you aren't providing any evidence

1870
02:52:26,800 --> 02:52:28,800
What so ever you're just saying that you do have

1871
02:52:29,760 --> 02:52:33,400
Yeah, yeah, there's secret information that he alone has yeah

1872
02:52:33,960 --> 02:52:36,520
That explain how this isn't a scam

1873
02:52:37,160 --> 02:52:40,280
Yeah, like I never even said it was a scam

1874
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:44,600
I just said that like she just like people gave her a bunch of like pity money and like

1875
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:48,400
Now and now she's hot shit even though there's nothing special about her

1876
02:52:48,800 --> 02:52:52,960
Like that's all I was saying which is true, and I'm not gonna walk that back ever

1877
02:52:53,520 --> 02:52:55,720
and

1878
02:52:55,720 --> 02:53:01,800
Yeah, what does he want? He just just the way just the way that they allude like oh, it's so bad. Oh, it's so it's like

1879
02:53:02,440 --> 02:53:09,560
Is anything that bad like the way you talk about it? It's like it was the second fucking Holocaust, you know like like

1880
02:53:09,960 --> 02:53:13,600
Don't fucking don't fucking sit here and tell me oh, it's so bad

1881
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:16,600
I'm not gonna tell you how bad it was, but just trust me. It was that bad

1882
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:25,240
Yeah, just just leave trust me leave me alone, you know shut up. No, I don't trust I don't trust you like like he like

1883
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:27,880
Okay, first of all

1884
02:53:27,880 --> 02:53:35,440
There's no like like there's no like way to gauge that so like like he obviously just like like got caught up in the zeitgeist

1885
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:39,960
Like with watching my little pony. He was just like he just he probably just heard some things

1886
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:46,800
They're like yeah, like he frame has some bad parents and I got telephoned and then and then he just just believes things

1887
02:53:46,800 --> 02:53:51,920
I mean, you know, I don't I don't know. I don't know what I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah, I don't know

1888
02:53:51,920 --> 02:53:55,440
I don't know what the truth is, but I do know tell us

1889
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Yeah, and I and I am sure

1890
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:03,540
And I am sure that that Miss Anthropony believes things uncritically

1891
02:54:04,500 --> 02:54:10,460
So like I'm not even if he told me the story like I wouldn't believe it like I would need someone who's not stupid to tell me

1892
02:54:10,460 --> 02:54:12,460
Yeah, I

1893
02:54:12,500 --> 02:54:18,620
Want to know I mean, you know, I don't really want to make fun of someone but like for no reason

1894
02:54:18,620 --> 02:54:23,820
But it just seems it like he just will not he just won't tell us

1895
02:54:23,820 --> 02:54:28,060
He won't like here's like the like the you the fucking link to the YouTube is where it

1896
02:54:28,300 --> 02:54:33,380
Proves all this stuff is happening and like he like explains the story about like I don't even know what it

1897
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:39,460
I don't know what the keyframe situation is. I assume it's something like parental abuse. I don't know

1898
02:54:40,100 --> 02:54:42,100
happening and

1899
02:54:42,580 --> 02:54:47,220
And Miss Anthropony is not forthcoming with the details. So

1900
02:54:48,060 --> 02:54:50,660
It's not I think we've done our due diligence. Yeah

1901
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:59,740
I'm gonna fuck around here. Okay. I am just not this is a very very very very very

1902
02:55:00,100 --> 02:55:06,700
Very touchy topic to this day. I still have a hard time looking back to it and I'm

1903
02:55:07,060 --> 02:55:08,340
he

1904
02:55:08,340 --> 02:55:10,340
He is traumatized

1905
02:55:10,460 --> 02:55:12,460
by the keyframe situation

1906
02:55:13,060 --> 02:55:14,940
situation that

1907
02:55:14,940 --> 02:55:18,940
Probably didn't happen to him. No happened to keyframe

1908
02:55:19,460 --> 02:55:22,540
He's trying he's not talking about something that like happened

1909
02:55:22,540 --> 02:55:28,340
He's he's traumatized by someone else's problem and it's bad that we're triggering him

1910
02:55:29,100 --> 02:55:37,220
He has nightmares about it. Like like he is really held up on the fact that he knows he know he he

1911
02:55:37,700 --> 02:55:40,600
I don't get the I don't get the feel that he was like

1912
02:55:41,340 --> 02:55:47,620
Like I'm assuming do the fact that I've like seen some stuff like this where it's like there was like some like task force of like

1913
02:55:48,540 --> 02:55:55,700
Kickstart or something assuming is happening. I'm assuming that this is all assumption because again, I don't know and he won't tell us

1914
02:55:55,700 --> 02:56:02,380
I'm assuming that he just kind of like saw the kickstarter and like saw that things were going down that people were trying to help

1915
02:56:03,220 --> 02:56:08,660
I think he like talked to friends of hers or something. Yeah, that's I think he's friends with her boyfriend

1916
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:11,660
and

1917
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:16,060
So he's upset that he knows about something bad that happened

1918
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:20,700
Yeah, and that's the extent of his involvement with it. Yeah, he just he heard about it

1919
02:56:20,700 --> 02:56:25,540
Yeah, you heard about it sure that a lot of people have a hard time looking back to it, too

1920
02:56:25,900 --> 02:56:29,340
Because it was that bad the heart. Oh my god

1921
02:56:30,340 --> 02:56:32,940
Struggling to keep my mind together

1922
02:56:33,660 --> 02:56:37,020
listening to all of those horrifying stories and

1923
02:56:37,980 --> 02:56:44,340
His his trauma of hearing the horrifying stories. Yeah, I

1924
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:47,180
Don't I don't I mean it all right

1925
02:56:51,180 --> 02:56:56,060
Yeah, he's so empathetic that like he he felt it even more acutely than keyframe herself

1926
02:56:56,060 --> 02:57:00,580
Yeah, he was the real victim. So so that proves that it's so bad

1927
02:57:00,580 --> 02:57:06,160
But yeah, because he felt bad because he heard stories that proves that key

1928
02:57:07,260 --> 02:57:10,820
That's just how serious this is and how we shouldn't be fucking with it. Yeah

1929
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:17,660
Do you get off claiming that her situation was a stunt to gain popularity I didn't

1930
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:22,380
Using it as an excuse to bitch. I just think it was milked again

1931
02:57:22,500 --> 02:57:27,820
Now I will admit that I really wasn't that much of a better person when I started out

1932
02:57:27,820 --> 02:57:30,580
I was being really really horrible

1933
02:57:31,060 --> 02:57:37,100
Judging people despite that. I really didn't know anything about them because of some fleeting assumption

1934
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:39,500
That influence yeah, yeah

1935
02:57:39,740 --> 02:57:45,020
To this day, it really means a lot to me that after I was given another chance

1936
02:57:45,020 --> 02:57:51,380
I was able to train myself to know and he made such he made so much good out of that extra chance

1937
02:57:51,380 --> 02:57:58,180
She was given knowing like look what he's done was wrong for me to assume that lethal Aurora mage or golden fox

1938
02:57:58,180 --> 02:58:05,060
Or Tommy Oliver were a bad influence because I only looked at their content through a one

1939
02:58:05,060 --> 02:58:10,260
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't know what he's talking about again

1940
02:58:10,260 --> 02:58:16,380
I know that I know that he was a dick to lethal or a mage, but that's like the ex why do I keep calling her lethal?

1941
02:58:16,380 --> 02:58:22,140
I know that he was a dick to mage. I don't know the details. Okay, but I want to harp on here

1942
02:58:22,380 --> 02:58:28,620
It's like that he got mad at them for being a bad influence. Yeah a bad

1943
02:58:29,980 --> 02:58:31,980
Influence I cannot imagine

1944
02:58:32,980 --> 02:58:39,980
Anyone thinking that about mage like Tommy like I know people have they had their divisive opinion like some people didn't like Tommy

1945
02:58:40,500 --> 02:58:42,900
He was because for whatever but mage

1946
02:58:44,140 --> 02:58:51,060
Who okay, who would think that sure you're but you're taking that criticism at face value, but you're like thinking

1947
02:58:51,060 --> 02:58:55,780
Okay, yeah, how are they bad influence? Yeah a bad influence though

1948
02:58:56,140 --> 02:59:02,660
Oh, yeah, like is a problem like the fact that he is upset that someone may be a bad influence

1949
02:59:02,660 --> 02:59:05,500
Oh, my little pony brony analysis community

1950
02:59:08,220 --> 02:59:15,020
Like that that's even on the list of crimes that someone can be guilty of exactly. Yeah. Yeah possible

1951
02:59:15,700 --> 02:59:23,220
because they're making fucking YouTube videos about analysis of my little pony they

1952
02:59:23,460 --> 02:59:28,700
How who are they influencing who are they too bad influence?

1953
02:59:29,260 --> 02:59:37,140
Anyone how could they bad influence anyone? I wonder if he means there are bad influence within the community or like to people watching

1954
02:59:37,180 --> 02:59:43,420
You know like which like what specifically is the grievance here? I am I am honestly curious like what the fuck

1955
02:59:43,700 --> 02:59:49,100
Any of this could have possibly been about what does it mean? How could we?

1956
02:59:50,020 --> 02:59:52,020
like okay, okay

1957
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:57,660
How could like yeah, okay, Tom like mage obviously did nothing wrong and there's nothing

1958
02:59:58,860 --> 03:00:01,420
Even viable there to talk about Tom

1959
03:00:02,380 --> 03:00:10,460
What did he do that could even be construed as a bad influence like like he'd be broke honestly and them

1960
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:16,540
But a bad influence on leaving the fandom leaving the fandom on bad terms

1961
03:00:16,540 --> 03:00:21,820
And I but I think it was before that like I think I think it was before Tom left

1962
03:00:22,020 --> 03:00:24,280
And before that I think the only thing is like

1963
03:00:25,020 --> 03:00:28,420
criticizing the show and maybe being a little hard on like Brony culture

1964
03:00:29,260 --> 03:00:31,260
being like bad

1965
03:00:31,460 --> 03:00:40,500
Influence not being a bad person not being a bad person not being mean or like not any of those criticisms being a bad

1966
03:00:41,220 --> 03:00:46,460
Influence on people you are badly influencing someone. How?

1967
03:00:47,180 --> 03:00:55,180
What does that mean Tommy never had this video that was like guys you should do this guys this is this is how you should act

1968
03:00:57,340 --> 03:00:59,340
What does it mean

1969
03:01:01,460 --> 03:01:04,580
I knew I wish I knew I wish I could get a little window

1970
03:01:05,220 --> 03:01:10,500
Into the mind of like you know just like a fucking insect like this, you know

1971
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:16,420
Just a small little you know aside leaving the fandom

1972
03:01:17,060 --> 03:01:22,740
That doesn't exist. That is not a real thing that someone can do leaving fandom is a useless term

1973
03:01:23,300 --> 03:01:29,660
Yeah, I agree because you don't but it's real but it's real to him. It's real that like no one in

1974
03:01:30,340 --> 03:01:32,900
No one not a single person

1975
03:01:33,540 --> 03:01:37,900
Wakes up one day and says you know what I've had it

1976
03:01:37,900 --> 03:01:42,540
I'm not going to enjoy my little pony anymore. I'm just I'm you know

1977
03:01:42,540 --> 03:01:49,140
I just I just I just decided I will not partake in my little pony. I'm over. I'm going to leave the fandom

1978
03:01:49,140 --> 03:01:54,180
It's going to be over. I will I will not it's like people who leave the fandom quote-unquote

1979
03:01:54,500 --> 03:02:00,420
Just don't just kind of like I like oh well, you know, you know after a while I've kind of done all I can do

1980
03:02:00,420 --> 03:02:05,260
I don't I'm not really feeling anymore. I'll just make some other stuff. It's not like you're not like leaving it

1981
03:02:05,260 --> 03:02:07,260
You're not like leaving behind an interest

1982
03:02:07,260 --> 03:02:10,820
You are just deciding on like a moment to my moment basis

1983
03:02:10,820 --> 03:02:14,400
Maybe maybe I don't really like feel that strongly about this anymore. Maybe I don't have anything to say

1984
03:02:14,460 --> 03:02:18,100
That's all you're doing. You're not like making a point to leave the fandom

1985
03:02:18,100 --> 03:02:24,260
That's people the people like this like they see it as like a fucking lifestyle that has to be like actively maintained

1986
03:02:24,260 --> 03:02:26,220
And simply an interest

1987
03:02:26,220 --> 03:02:30,900
Yeah, yeah, like like it's like their personal little garden and it has to be like cultivated

1988
03:02:30,900 --> 03:02:36,780
You know and it has to be cold like like like malignant influences need to be cold from it because it's important

1989
03:02:36,860 --> 03:02:42,380
Because it's important and it needs to be kept pure like like the good like the good vibes have to be maintained

1990
03:02:42,380 --> 03:02:48,380
And like it has to be it has to make continue to be like like, you know, what it always has been to them

1991
03:02:49,100 --> 03:02:54,500
Bronies the burning community you ask beauty and my little point itself is inherently insidious

1992
03:02:55,500 --> 03:03:02,940
Yes purified bronies are definitely it needs to be purified from these people we need to save it from these people

1993
03:03:03,380 --> 03:03:10,420
Yeah, it needs it needs to be saved from like its most ardent members. Yeah, you are the bad influence

1994
03:03:10,420 --> 03:03:12,420
You are the bad influence

1995
03:03:14,060 --> 03:03:16,260
People may think that this is okay to do

1996
03:03:17,020 --> 03:03:23,540
Like Miss Anthropony and FNG are are like terrible and like the fact that people listen to them is like horrifying

1997
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:29,100
They are actually the bad influence. They are influence. They're influencing the youth

1998
03:03:29,100 --> 03:03:31,980
I think that it's okay to communicate such as like this

1999
03:03:32,140 --> 03:03:38,380
Yeah, like it's because of people it's because of people like Miss Anthropony and FNG are and like and dr. Wolf and Kim possible

2000
03:03:38,380 --> 03:03:44,220
I'd that like a fucking, you know a modestly talented youngster like wooden sword

2001
03:03:44,220 --> 03:03:50,460
Who can like can make a fucking YouTube video and have it not be terrible gets fucking on this track of like

2002
03:03:50,460 --> 03:03:53,140
Why don't I make fucking pony videos? I don't know man

2003
03:03:53,140 --> 03:03:59,340
I'm not saying like I'm not saying it's like he's like he's he's done for but like yeah, that's not good

2004
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:02,940
That's not a good thing to be doing. Yeah, I don't think so

2005
03:04:03,380 --> 03:04:08,580
It's definitely it's corrosive and the reason why the reason why I don't think it's good

2006
03:04:08,580 --> 03:04:14,780
Is because it means coming into contact with people like this and like having to fucking deal with people like this and risking fucking

2007
03:04:14,780 --> 03:04:16,780
Being influenced by people like this

2008
03:04:17,220 --> 03:04:18,900
If there were just

2009
03:04:18,900 --> 03:04:24,180
P-baps if there were just digipros if there were just fucking give-and-takes then it would be fine

2010
03:04:24,180 --> 03:04:29,100
But do the fact that these are the these are the people who are in the community

2011
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:33,220
But like the community now is like the community now is like Lily Pete

2012
03:04:33,380 --> 03:04:39,500
Which like fucking kill me fucking like put a bullet in my fucking head. Yeah that I even said that name

2013
03:04:40,180 --> 03:04:43,580
That I know who that is the saddest thing that's ever happened to me

2014
03:04:43,820 --> 03:04:49,380
These the kind of people who are you in social, but this is this is not an admirable situation

2015
03:04:49,380 --> 03:04:51,340
This is what's left like that's what's left

2016
03:04:51,340 --> 03:04:58,380
Like it's them and the people that think it's so important that they deserve money to keep doing what they're doing to like carry the fucking torch

2017
03:04:58,380 --> 03:05:00,380
and keep it alive

2018
03:05:01,100 --> 03:05:06,220
Disgusting absolutely fucking revolting it is like that is awful

2019
03:05:06,460 --> 03:05:11,300
Like it was bad enough like when like when we stopped doing it like it was getting bad, but like

2020
03:05:12,020 --> 03:05:18,820
The fact that it continued beyond that point and only continued to go in that direction is just really scary

2021
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:25,140
Yeah, it's like how long can they keep this up forever? Yeah forever like show runs

2022
03:05:25,140 --> 03:05:31,540
What like what's been left like like this like the cicada like like the cicada of the fan base has like

2023
03:05:31,620 --> 03:05:36,260
Crawled out of its hideous shell and it's left like it's dead husk lying there

2024
03:05:36,340 --> 03:05:41,700
And like the people that make up the husk will never leave it and it will continue to be important to them

2025
03:05:41,700 --> 03:05:43,700
Even though it's empty and even though it's dead

2026
03:05:44,180 --> 03:05:49,300
And they'll just be like we we just got we've just got to like keep going through the motions because this is what's important

2027
03:05:49,940 --> 03:05:52,580
And and okay, it's obvious that they have no

2028
03:05:53,220 --> 03:05:56,980
Grasp of quality none of them do because there's no like just the fact

2029
03:05:59,060 --> 03:06:05,300
Yeah, yeah, but like it doesn't matter what it is just like because this institution is important to them like anyone

2030
03:06:05,380 --> 03:06:11,540
Who contributes to it is like important and validating like they need that they need to be validated and anyone will do

2031
03:06:13,540 --> 03:06:17,700
It doesn't matter who it only matters that you are making a video

2032
03:06:17,780 --> 03:06:21,780
That's the only thing that matters and they will be associated with you. Yeah, they are

2033
03:06:23,060 --> 03:06:24,420
it's

2034
03:06:24,420 --> 03:06:25,940
it's

2035
03:06:25,940 --> 03:06:29,620
They're corrupting people that they're corrupt really corrupted insidious and scary

2036
03:06:30,340 --> 03:06:33,540
They could be talented, but they are they are forced into this

2037
03:06:33,940 --> 03:06:35,780
They like like once they come to contact with it

2038
03:06:36,020 --> 03:06:41,460
They are now like associated with this community and that community will reach out to it and it will be enticing

2039
03:06:41,780 --> 03:06:46,260
It will be very enticing you will have a lot of people if it seems important and just and good

2040
03:06:46,500 --> 03:06:51,540
So you get in here and you realize that everyone's complacent and none of them make any content whatsoever that could be

2041
03:06:52,020 --> 03:06:55,860
Even described as good on any level and they love it that way

2042
03:06:56,100 --> 03:07:00,100
That is what they are aspiring to they are inspired in my mediocrity

2043
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:06,420
Nothing they do will ever be good and that's just the way they like it. That's just the way the fans like it too

2044
03:07:07,300 --> 03:07:10,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they want they like that. They're comfortable with the status quo

2045
03:07:11,060 --> 03:07:16,100
Like something new would be would be scary something something new would be like well

2046
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:19,780
That's not what we're here for something new would be uninteresting

2047
03:07:20,100 --> 03:07:24,820
Like that that was that was new that had different parts to it and that was yeah interesting

2048
03:07:25,380 --> 03:07:29,780
Yeah, miss anthra pony miss anthra pony didn't find it to be presented in an interesting way

2049
03:07:31,220 --> 03:07:35,540
What's what's interesting about the thousands of clones of each other? What's interesting about that?

2050
03:07:36,580 --> 03:07:42,100
What's interesting about the exact same fucking video being presented by a myriad of the same

2051
03:07:42,180 --> 03:07:46,660
Score out of character archetypes over and over again in the exact same visual way

2052
03:07:47,460 --> 03:07:49,140
What's interesting about that?

2053
03:07:49,140 --> 03:07:54,260
I just worry I just worry about I worry about the wooden swords of the world who are like

2054
03:07:54,900 --> 03:08:01,300
Fucking caught up caught who like stumble upon this thing and receive like praise and validation for what they're doing

2055
03:08:02,020 --> 03:08:03,780
And like, you know

2056
03:08:03,780 --> 03:08:09,540
I'm worried. I'm worried about new people getting caught up in this and getting tricked getting fucking tricked

2057
03:08:09,940 --> 03:08:13,140
It really is like a weird cult like mentality. It's despicable

2058
03:08:14,020 --> 03:08:16,020
Is despicable

2059
03:08:16,100 --> 03:08:22,260
Should we continue continue but I will say that I have learned some things since then and one of those things

2060
03:08:22,500 --> 03:08:26,500
Is actually knowing when someone is being a piece of crap

2061
03:08:26,740 --> 03:08:30,340
Not just because they have an opinion that you don't want to hear

2062
03:08:30,580 --> 03:08:36,180
But because they're presenting themselves as an insufferable douchebag in other words

2063
03:08:36,340 --> 03:08:39,460
What I'm trying to say is you are a shit

2064
03:08:39,860 --> 03:08:43,700
Sucking a bitch Ben. You think you're so cool with your hole

2065
03:08:43,860 --> 03:08:49,380
You're a bitch because you don't watch our podcast of us talking about how you're a bitch because you don't want

2066
03:08:50,260 --> 03:08:51,780
When did I ever say that?

2067
03:08:51,780 --> 03:08:55,700
When did I ever say that like people that don't watch the rowdy fuckers cop killers of bitches?

2068
03:08:55,700 --> 03:08:58,340
I mean they are but when in the video did I say that?

2069
03:08:58,740 --> 03:09:00,740
What?

2070
03:09:01,540 --> 03:09:06,020
Question mark. What's he talking about? What's he talking about?

2071
03:09:06,980 --> 03:09:08,980
You

2072
03:09:09,220 --> 03:09:15,460
You're a bitch because you don't watch our podcast. I mean that's true. Yeah, it is true, but I didn't but

2073
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:20,180
Like it's like like is that my thing like is that my thing now?

2074
03:09:20,740 --> 03:09:26,740
That's not what the podcast. That's not what that video was about. It's just a fact. That's an objective fact

2075
03:09:27,140 --> 03:09:29,300
But like that's not what it was about. That's not

2076
03:09:29,940 --> 03:09:35,620
That's not even the reason you're upset like yeah, like are you you're suddenly mad because

2077
03:09:36,020 --> 03:09:39,780
You think that I think you're dumb because you didn't like the video?

2078
03:09:40,500 --> 03:09:44,020
Like is that why when did that become what this is about miss antherpony?

2079
03:09:44,580 --> 03:09:49,620
Why when and why this fucking picture you made this picture?

2080
03:09:50,260 --> 03:09:56,660
This is what you were talking. This is what you were talking about like he just needs he needs to communicate through like scenes from tv shows. Yeah

2081
03:09:57,860 --> 03:09:59,540
you

2082
03:09:59,540 --> 03:10:01,540
You thought this was

2083
03:10:01,540 --> 03:10:05,780
Okay, I don't know the scene from he thought that maybe it has some sort of like

2084
03:10:06,740 --> 03:10:08,340
I

2085
03:10:08,340 --> 03:10:10,340
I mean, I'm pretty sure

2086
03:10:11,620 --> 03:10:13,620
I mean bobby

2087
03:10:14,100 --> 03:10:17,540
I don't know. I'm not entirely sure what's going on in the scene either, but like

2088
03:10:18,260 --> 03:10:22,020
I don't think what's happening here is that like bobby is like

2089
03:10:23,060 --> 03:10:27,780
Righteously kicking hank in the nuts because hank was like legitimately in the wrong

2090
03:10:27,860 --> 03:10:31,300
Like I do not believe for a second that that is what is happening

2091
03:10:32,020 --> 03:10:40,740
So I fail to see I fail to see um what what you what the what point you're trying to make the framing the framing of this

2092
03:10:41,140 --> 03:10:43,140
that like you're like

2093
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:47,620
He's like an underdog. He's a small child soldier underdog

2094
03:10:47,860 --> 03:10:55,620
And you're like this big bad like fucking dad trying trying to like try trying to fucking impose his values onto this community

2095
03:10:57,620 --> 03:10:59,140
Uh

2096
03:10:59,140 --> 03:11:01,620
Which is like I'm a complete outsider. Yeah

2097
03:11:02,500 --> 03:11:04,020
Yeah, I don't know

2098
03:11:04,020 --> 03:11:05,700
I don't know like

2099
03:11:05,700 --> 03:11:08,900
Again, he's just like so mad that he needs to convey

2100
03:11:09,460 --> 03:11:14,740
His emotions not through his words, but through a picture from a tv show because like that's

2101
03:11:15,700 --> 03:11:19,780
That's the best way he knows how and this was the best he could come up with

2102
03:11:20,340 --> 03:11:21,940
worthless

2103
03:11:21,940 --> 03:11:23,940
Yeah, worthless

2104
03:11:23,940 --> 03:11:25,940
Zero values without value

2105
03:11:26,100 --> 03:11:32,580
Worthless no merit. No merit. You thought no one was gonna care enough to rush on to this bullshit

2106
03:11:32,900 --> 03:11:34,900
You're dead wrong ass face

2107
03:11:34,980 --> 03:11:40,420
Did you not think for a single microsecond that did did you continue? I did. Yeah, you know

2108
03:11:40,580 --> 03:11:43,700
Oh, yeah here here. I'll here. I'll be sure it's at 1608

2109
03:11:46,340 --> 03:11:48,900
For some reason it just like doesn't work sometimes

2110
03:11:50,740 --> 03:11:55,060
All right here like like just like change it a little bit like like go back like a second or two

2111
03:11:55,540 --> 03:11:57,540
and then like

2112
03:11:57,540 --> 03:12:03,060
All right. Yeah. Yeah, okay good. Someone was gonna care enough to respond to this bullshit. You're dead wrong

2113
03:12:03,460 --> 03:12:10,340
Thanks. Did you not think for a single microsecond that this could get you in trouble that this could make someone feel uncomfortable

2114
03:12:10,740 --> 03:12:16,820
Get me more importantly. Did you not think that this would look obscenely bad on your part?

2115
03:12:18,500 --> 03:12:22,420
Yeah, he thinks he thinks that this will a get me in trouble

2116
03:12:23,060 --> 03:12:23,940
false

2117
03:12:23,940 --> 03:12:24,820
B

2118
03:12:24,820 --> 03:12:26,500
Make someone uncomfortable

2119
03:12:26,500 --> 03:12:32,900
True him. Yeah, see look bad on my part. Well, wrong if you're retarded

2120
03:12:33,380 --> 03:12:37,940
Like yeah, I'm I'm risking alienating some like overly sensitive retards here

2121
03:12:38,820 --> 03:12:44,020
I'm risking alienating the very people who I'm making fun of for being awful and undesirable

2122
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:46,500
Yeah, I

2123
03:12:46,500 --> 03:12:52,020
I am alien like if I were to join the army. I am well look at something like if I were to like

2124
03:12:52,580 --> 03:12:57,620
Kill a Nazi. Yeah, I'm ricks alienating other. I would risk alienating Hitler

2125
03:12:59,140 --> 03:13:01,140
Yeah

2126
03:13:01,860 --> 03:13:03,060
problem

2127
03:13:03,060 --> 03:13:05,060
Yeah

2128
03:13:05,460 --> 03:13:09,380
If I alienate the very people who I want to dispose from reality

2129
03:13:10,340 --> 03:13:16,500
That I'm fine with that. I'm fine. I'm fine with alienating the very people who I dislike. Yeah. Yeah, um

2130
03:13:17,380 --> 03:13:24,020
I you're you've well said munchie and I like I wish I wish that I wish misanthropony could see things with such clarity

2131
03:13:24,900 --> 03:13:28,420
I wish I risk I I wish I wish

2132
03:13:28,980 --> 03:13:30,980
that misanthropony

2133
03:13:31,300 --> 03:13:32,900
Was real

2134
03:13:32,900 --> 03:13:34,900
I wish that he was a real person

2135
03:13:35,220 --> 03:13:40,580
But I know my heart of hearts that he's just like a computer ai designed to be the worst possible human

2136
03:13:41,060 --> 03:13:42,580
I

2137
03:13:42,580 --> 03:13:48,180
I wish that he I wish that he had a beating heart. I wish that he had a brain a dick or a soul

2138
03:13:49,060 --> 03:13:51,060
Any one of those things would be fine

2139
03:13:51,300 --> 03:13:53,300
But he has none

2140
03:13:54,820 --> 03:14:00,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, like we like because if you had any of those things we could revenge ourselves upon them

2141
03:14:00,900 --> 03:14:05,380
But we can't like there's nothing like there's nothing there's nothing to be struck back against

2142
03:14:06,900 --> 03:14:08,900
It's just it's just

2143
03:14:09,700 --> 03:14:15,540
We can't do anything. He's just too. He's just too powerful and my powerful. I mean

2144
03:14:16,500 --> 03:14:18,500
He like like what are we gonna do?

2145
03:14:18,660 --> 03:14:24,500
His mind is just armored. He's his mind is just armored too impenetrable. Yeah, like we can't it's like

2146
03:14:25,540 --> 03:14:32,100
Like if we can't say anything to like make him think like he's not cognizant. He's not cognizant

2147
03:14:32,420 --> 03:14:35,700
He's not lucid. There's no getting through to him. Yeah

2148
03:14:36,340 --> 03:14:37,780
there's no

2149
03:14:37,780 --> 03:14:39,780
Getting in there continue

2150
03:14:40,740 --> 03:14:44,580
Are you really this desperate to spike the analysis community?

2151
03:14:44,740 --> 03:14:52,340
That you would openly spit in the face of such a delicate event that has actually had an impact on people's lives

2152
03:14:52,740 --> 03:14:56,260
Yes, no regret. Yes, definitely with no reluctance

2153
03:14:56,580 --> 03:15:04,980
This entire video has just been you rambling on and on like a bitchy high schooler about how the brony fandom is below you

2154
03:15:05,220 --> 03:15:07,220
Which would be annoying enough on its own

2155
03:15:07,460 --> 03:15:11,700
But what you say here is thoroughly disgusting in the worst way possible

2156
03:15:11,940 --> 03:15:14,500
People say that tommy oliver is a backstabber

2157
03:15:14,740 --> 03:15:20,580
But you directly take the dagger shove it through the stomach and disembowel with it

2158
03:15:20,820 --> 03:15:24,740
At least he had the decency to raise awareness on a struck from the front

2159
03:15:24,900 --> 03:15:32,740
Honorably the way that you speak of it so absent mindedly shows me that you knew nothing about this situation

2160
03:15:33,060 --> 03:15:36,020
Thus you have no fucking right to comment on it

2161
03:15:36,340 --> 03:15:39,460
I have no and and what makes you feel like you

2162
03:15:40,100 --> 03:15:42,100
Know about the context of this video

2163
03:15:42,820 --> 03:15:48,820
What makes what makes it seem like you are in like you know anything about what's going on in this video

2164
03:15:49,220 --> 03:15:51,220
Or what's happening in the pcp?

2165
03:15:51,380 --> 03:15:55,300
You obviously sound like you don't know a single fucking thing you're talking about

2166
03:15:55,540 --> 03:15:57,540
So maybe it's likewise

2167
03:15:57,540 --> 03:15:59,380
Maybe maybe we don't want to think about each other

2168
03:15:59,620 --> 03:16:03,620
And there's no reason for you to get so mad because we obviously are just misunderstanding

2169
03:16:03,860 --> 03:16:08,100
Or but but that's obviously like too like high level. That's too like high strat

2170
03:16:08,340 --> 03:16:12,500
You can't just understand that like like okay if we don't want to think about that

2171
03:16:13,060 --> 03:16:16,900
You probably don't think about us too. So like what's the what's even the problem here?

2172
03:16:16,900 --> 03:16:19,940
Like like like we just don't know anything about it. So what's the problem?

2173
03:16:20,180 --> 03:16:25,300
I think he's mad like he's mad that I like he's mad at me because I didn't know anything

2174
03:16:25,700 --> 03:16:26,660
Exactly

2175
03:16:26,660 --> 03:16:31,300
And if you don't know anything then we obviously don't fucking know anything. So you might as well just brush us off

2176
03:16:31,940 --> 03:16:35,780
Yeah, man, and then he doesn't even try to fuck and he doesn't even try to educate us

2177
03:16:36,100 --> 03:16:40,340
Yeah, just try he just chides us for not knowing anything and then provides us with no information

2178
03:16:40,660 --> 03:16:41,700
Exactly

2179
03:16:41,700 --> 03:16:48,420
Fucker or earthly clue as to how any of your fans let alone subscribers to the procrastinator channel

2180
03:16:48,580 --> 03:16:53,060
Could actually get a kick out of this piece of shit video not okay. Okay. Okay

2181
03:16:53,700 --> 03:16:57,780
Most of our subscribers are not from the pony days. This is not a pony channel

2182
03:16:58,740 --> 03:17:00,740
Yeah, I sincerely doubt

2183
03:17:01,460 --> 03:17:06,180
Okay, okay. Look at the view the view count compared to the fucking subscriber count not like a small portion

2184
03:17:06,660 --> 03:17:10,340
It's like it's like it's like half or it's like a I can't even read it

2185
03:17:10,340 --> 03:17:13,860
But like yeah, it's like a quarter a half and like there's more. I think it's like doubled since then

2186
03:17:14,100 --> 03:17:16,100
Oh, yeah, okay. Well still still

2187
03:17:16,900 --> 03:17:20,660
Uh, it's like that and then this was paused around in the in the pony community

2188
03:17:20,660 --> 03:17:25,140
So I guess it's not a really good example, but yeah, what I mean. These are not pony guys

2189
03:17:25,700 --> 03:17:31,300
I'm I'm certain that the majority of our subscribers don't know who any of these fucking people are

2190
03:17:31,860 --> 03:17:37,540
They have no way to tell if we're being like justified or not and this is purely for us

2191
03:17:38,020 --> 03:17:40,020
We were not doing this for like the fans

2192
03:17:40,580 --> 03:17:44,740
No, like that's the point of the rowdy fuckers cop killers really it's not for anyone

2193
03:17:45,460 --> 03:17:47,460
It's for no one. Yeah

2194
03:17:48,420 --> 03:17:49,700
Ah

2195
03:17:49,700 --> 03:17:51,060
Just giving it views

2196
03:17:51,060 --> 03:17:57,220
But giving it likes the fact that mage is still willing to put up with you is a true act of saint

2197
03:17:57,300 --> 03:18:00,580
Here he goes white mighty white knighting mage because of something

2198
03:18:00,740 --> 03:18:04,420
Anyone else putting up with your insufferable ass except

2199
03:18:04,980 --> 03:18:06,980
It's like it's like he could say

2200
03:18:07,860 --> 03:18:10,020
Like ben I can't believe

2201
03:18:11,060 --> 03:18:13,380
Like like I think a reasonable thing would be to like

2202
03:18:13,700 --> 03:18:18,580
Suspect mage of being bad because she associates with with bad me and you

2203
03:18:19,140 --> 03:18:23,300
Yeah, but no, he's he's like impressed with how good mage must be

2204
03:18:23,940 --> 03:18:27,380
To be able to put up with with bad me and bad you how is that good?

2205
03:18:27,460 --> 03:18:32,580
How is how is associating and like clearly being friends with bad people? How is that good?

2206
03:18:32,980 --> 03:18:33,860
He's just got it

2207
03:18:33,860 --> 03:18:38,820
He's just previously decided that mage is good because he feels bad about something and it's like oh no

2208
03:18:39,060 --> 03:18:42,260
I thought mage was bad, but actually she was good. I made a mistake. So okay

2209
03:18:42,260 --> 03:18:46,900
I'm gonna fix it. The mage is good. Mage is good. Let's this is this is our operating position from here

2210
03:18:47,300 --> 03:18:49,300
That is literally he just oh wait. No no stop

2211
03:18:49,940 --> 03:18:55,140
Stop, okay. Yeah before you do that. I have one point and then I and then and then hold on uh like like

2212
03:18:56,020 --> 03:18:59,060
Like he is just arbitrary like like he just decides things

2213
03:18:59,060 --> 03:19:02,740
He does not think about things and then decide afterward what to do

2214
03:19:03,220 --> 03:19:06,020
He decides and then like reviews

2215
03:19:06,500 --> 03:19:08,740
Yeah, he did he decides and then he and then he like

2216
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:11,700
He has he has his conclusion

2217
03:19:11,940 --> 03:19:20,100
And then he has his thought he then then he puts thought into into justifying it. Yeah, and yeah, it that's that's horrible

2218
03:19:20,100 --> 03:19:26,580
That he just one of the many things that shows that he just is not lucid. He's not he's not really it's really low functioning

2219
03:19:26,900 --> 03:19:28,900
And no wait, uh, just a side note

2220
03:19:29,380 --> 03:19:34,100
I want you I want everyone at home to turn up the speakers all the fucking way so you can hear this next line

2221
03:19:34,260 --> 03:19:38,500
Because I know what's coming and it's my favorite line in the entire video. So please play. I'm gonna be quiet

2222
03:19:39,060 --> 03:19:44,180
Enjoy your ignorant patreon supporters who are blissfully and mindlessly

2223
03:19:44,340 --> 03:19:49,380
Throwing enough money at you for you to buy yourself an oculus rift in two months time

2224
03:19:49,780 --> 03:19:53,620
Yeah, it doesn't feel so good when someone does it to you does it I could have

2225
03:19:54,580 --> 03:19:55,620
Okay

2226
03:19:55,620 --> 03:19:56,900
Yeah, you know

2227
03:19:56,900 --> 03:19:57,860
Yeah

2228
03:19:57,860 --> 03:19:59,860
my yeah, it's

2229
03:20:00,340 --> 03:20:02,020
Oculus rift

2230
03:20:02,020 --> 03:20:07,780
It's at this point in the video where I start to feel bad because we're obviously punching down

2231
03:20:08,500 --> 03:20:10,500
You're

2232
03:20:10,500 --> 03:20:14,340
We are obviously dealing with someone who's just like not

2233
03:20:15,460 --> 03:20:21,060
Who just can't like this is this would be the equivalent of like an MMA fighter going up against a fetus

2234
03:20:23,300 --> 03:20:28,820
Intellectually yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's no no not a stillborn baby who's already dead

2235
03:20:29,460 --> 03:20:31,460
Like

2236
03:20:33,060 --> 03:20:39,940
Yeah, like like can you imagine like trying to have like a lot like a live one-on-one conversation with this person

2237
03:20:40,100 --> 03:20:44,900
Yeah, like can you even imagine like the stonewalling you would get as he just like

2238
03:20:45,220 --> 03:20:48,500
Fails to fucking take in the information you're presenting him with

2239
03:20:48,980 --> 03:20:55,380
And just like backpedals and like invents facts to try and like cover his own his own like tracks like

2240
03:20:56,340 --> 03:21:02,180
Just the anyway, anyway, that's all to say like what the fuck is he talking about like with this oculus run

2241
03:21:02,740 --> 03:21:07,620
Okay, okay, okay. He like slightly explains the comments that

2242
03:21:08,340 --> 03:21:09,460
like

2243
03:21:09,460 --> 03:21:12,740
Like someone's like, you know three hundred and thirty dollars isn't a lot of money, dude

2244
03:21:12,740 --> 03:21:19,940
He's like all I'm saying is that he can buy an oculus an oculus lift rift in two months. Nothing. It could live on it

2245
03:21:20,820 --> 03:21:22,820
so he's like

2246
03:21:23,060 --> 03:21:24,340
Wow

2247
03:21:24,420 --> 03:21:26,420
Does that wow have to do

2248
03:21:26,900 --> 03:21:33,700
With fucking anything like he's trying to be he's trying to say like look at all this money

2249
03:21:33,940 --> 03:21:38,020
Like this guy's like look at all this money that this guy is like, you know

2250
03:21:38,340 --> 03:21:42,580
Can you believe that such an asshole would get this much and it's like

2251
03:21:43,220 --> 03:21:48,100
Three hundred and thirty dollars enough to buy an oculus rift in two pay jacks

2252
03:21:48,580 --> 03:21:50,580
Not in one in two

2253
03:21:51,140 --> 03:21:55,140
Will pay for an oculus rift. Yeah, if I didn't eat or live anywhere. Yeah

2254
03:21:56,420 --> 03:22:00,660
Completely saving he could buy an oculus rift in two months

2255
03:22:01,220 --> 03:22:08,180
Oh my fucking god. He can buy a video game console in fucking two months of work

2256
03:22:09,060 --> 03:22:13,860
Oh my god, this guy's living the lap of luxury. I know right like

2257
03:22:14,900 --> 03:22:16,900
Silver spoon in his mouth

2258
03:22:16,900 --> 03:22:18,340
Let's let's

2259
03:22:18,340 --> 03:22:22,180
Let's and that's not even to touch on the fact that he previously said

2260
03:22:22,500 --> 03:22:29,380
He previously said that it is like completely unthinkable and unfair and like unjust to like criticize someone else for their patreon

2261
03:22:29,700 --> 03:22:33,700
And now here he is. It's not too good when you do it. It's like, you know, it's a feel too good

2262
03:22:34,340 --> 03:22:36,340
You're doing what you don't like

2263
03:22:36,500 --> 03:22:42,180
You're doing the thing that you said it was so bad that I did and then and then he's uh, uh, I bit my tongue

2264
03:22:42,420 --> 03:22:48,660
Oh god, and then he's acting like oh, he's really turned the tables. It's like well, I guess but like

2265
03:22:50,260 --> 03:22:52,260
You are just making it worse for you

2266
03:22:52,660 --> 03:22:57,700
You you said this was wrong to do and then you're like, I've really I've really

2267
03:22:58,260 --> 03:23:00,420
I've I've shown you by doing it

2268
03:23:00,900 --> 03:23:04,260
Like like we obviously have no problem with doing that to people

2269
03:23:04,580 --> 03:23:10,820
So you know, but you said you did. Yeah, like like like he's he's the only one who's not benefiting from this

2270
03:23:10,900 --> 03:23:15,300
He's the only one who's at a disadvantage here. He's the only one who's feeling bad about it

2271
03:23:15,780 --> 03:23:17,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2272
03:23:17,140 --> 03:23:24,020
We are not affected you you're just doing this to yourself the problem is entirely the problem is entirely on his end. Yeah

2273
03:23:25,220 --> 03:23:26,740
Oh

2274
03:23:26,740 --> 03:23:33,620
Oculus Rift I just can't I can't go I just can't stop of all things to measure your wealth with why oculus rift

2275
03:23:34,180 --> 03:23:38,340
in it and then in the comment in the comments there was like people being like

2276
03:23:39,300 --> 03:23:44,420
So I think someone was like I really he's gonna buy an oculus rift with that money. What a piece of shit

2277
03:23:45,780 --> 03:23:46,980
Guys

2278
03:23:46,980 --> 03:23:48,420
wait

2279
03:23:48,420 --> 03:23:50,420
No, you don't you don't understand

2280
03:23:51,220 --> 03:23:52,500
We like

2281
03:23:52,500 --> 03:23:58,260
Have you ever even said the words oculus rift publicly? I don't I honestly don't think I ever have

2282
03:23:59,140 --> 03:24:04,260
So like where that came from. Maybe he was just thinking about the oculus rift that day, you know

2283
03:24:04,260 --> 03:24:10,740
Maybe maybe just had like like an oculus rift ad and he was like, oh, I love video games

2284
03:24:10,820 --> 03:24:16,260
And I love media so much. Yeah, he's gonna have so much money. He can spend it on media

2285
03:24:17,060 --> 03:24:23,780
Yeah, yeah, because like what else would I spend on like what else would a person spend their money on then video games? Yeah

2286
03:24:24,500 --> 03:24:27,620
I don't even know if this rift is pure video, but it's just fucking

2287
03:24:28,260 --> 03:24:32,820
It's so it's not like he could buy a fucking house in a year's time

2288
03:24:33,540 --> 03:24:37,540
He could he could spend so much money on grocery. He could he could get so many valuable things

2289
03:24:38,020 --> 03:24:40,020
an oculus rift of all

2290
03:24:40,500 --> 03:24:42,100
Yeah, it's

2291
03:24:42,100 --> 03:24:46,260
This is like this is the thing this is the thing that he measures wealth in, you know

2292
03:24:46,900 --> 03:24:49,620
Like this is a glimpse into what's important to him. Yeah

2293
03:24:50,420 --> 03:24:52,420
not of like

2294
03:24:53,300 --> 03:24:57,860
Rent removed. Yeah, not like rent or something. Yeah, or like

2295
03:24:58,500 --> 03:25:00,500
I don't yeah, or like a house or like a car

2296
03:25:01,380 --> 03:25:03,380
An oculus rift

2297
03:25:03,380 --> 03:25:05,380
That's it matters

2298
03:25:05,540 --> 03:25:10,660
And uh, this is all to say a check the description for the Kickstarter to get been an oculus rift. Yeah

2299
03:25:11,620 --> 03:25:13,620
um

2300
03:25:13,620 --> 03:25:18,420
Fuck dude when when we get pcp headquarters, we should fucking get an oculus rift

2301
03:25:18,500 --> 03:25:21,780
Yeah, and like fucking live stream and fucking live stream vr

2302
03:25:22,340 --> 03:25:24,580
We should get miss antherpony on that stream

2303
03:25:24,580 --> 03:25:30,820
He's invited miss antherpony is invited to pcp headquarters. He's invited

2304
03:25:30,820 --> 03:25:34,740
We wouldn't have thought of this if it weren't for you. Thank god. You said something

2305
03:25:36,820 --> 03:25:38,820
Oh, I hate him

2306
03:25:38,820 --> 03:25:44,020
So it's just it doesn't it it does not compute. It doesn't compute

2307
03:25:44,580 --> 03:25:46,580
No, he's made a critical error

2308
03:25:47,380 --> 03:25:51,700
He's made a he's made some kind of logical error that like just can't be rectified

2309
03:25:51,700 --> 03:25:54,980
Oh, should I continue?

2310
03:25:58,340 --> 03:26:00,340
What yeah

2311
03:26:01,140 --> 03:26:02,500
My i'm

2312
03:26:02,500 --> 03:26:09,300
I hate him imagine jesse wood and gibbon takes snoring through your content given how boring and repetitive it is

2313
03:26:09,540 --> 03:26:14,900
Considering that they themselves have made much more interesting content jesse and hippo are my friends

2314
03:26:15,860 --> 03:26:20,260
I would sooner watch one of racer fists aimless republican superior

2315
03:26:20,980 --> 03:26:25,300
What okay, okay. Well, that was pretty good right that's right there about razor fist

2316
03:26:25,700 --> 03:26:26,660
but uh

2317
03:26:26,660 --> 03:26:32,100
Like first of all we are like, I don't know if he understands like the pcp isn't like

2318
03:26:32,820 --> 03:26:36,180
This is this funny because you were just talking about how it's too business oriented like last episode

2319
03:26:36,260 --> 03:26:39,620
But like yes, but it's not supposed to be that way. Yeah, it's it's not like

2320
03:26:40,260 --> 03:26:44,820
It's not like we like we like clock in from nine to five and we like we like hash this out

2321
03:26:44,900 --> 03:26:49,940
And like like we're not in like a huge like studio where like we like barely pass by one another

2322
03:26:50,260 --> 03:26:55,300
We are aware of each other and we like know what we all do. We're all subscribed one another

2323
03:26:55,540 --> 03:26:58,020
We're all we all like our friends

2324
03:26:59,620 --> 03:27:05,700
Like so so the idea that like so the idea that like mage would be like saintly like putting up with my like

2325
03:27:06,100 --> 03:27:08,100
like my like wicked deeds

2326
03:27:08,100 --> 03:27:13,460
And then like and then hippo and jesse are like scoffing at me just aren't aware of what we're doing

2327
03:27:13,780 --> 03:27:15,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah that they wouldn't know

2328
03:27:16,500 --> 03:27:21,140
Like no they know and they love it because we're geniuses

2329
03:27:22,340 --> 03:27:24,340
And it's incredible

2330
03:27:25,780 --> 03:27:27,700
Like

2331
03:27:27,700 --> 03:27:32,020
Your heroes you you're fucking heroes give and take and and and jesse

2332
03:27:32,660 --> 03:27:36,900
Yeah, they they they enjoy it. They like they're on our like they're on our side of this

2333
03:27:37,380 --> 03:27:39,860
They're on our side of this dispute guy

2334
03:27:40,580 --> 03:27:44,020
I don't know about jesse, but I know for a fact a gibbon is hippo is

2335
03:27:44,980 --> 03:27:49,940
I'm pretty sure jesse. I don't know. I don't remember if he said anything about it. I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure he was on it

2336
03:27:50,180 --> 03:27:52,180
Either way, that's one out of two

2337
03:27:52,500 --> 03:27:54,500
yeah

2338
03:27:55,140 --> 03:27:58,980
Uh, great. All right, let's let's keep going. Let's let's let's let's kill this

2339
03:28:03,140 --> 03:28:08,660
Oh, did we did it go for you? No, it didn't it didn't go for me. Okay. Yeah, go go go ahead

2340
03:28:10,820 --> 03:28:13,860
Uh rambles before I even is going for you

2341
03:28:14,020 --> 03:28:17,380
To revisit one of your t-bab videos again right now

2342
03:28:17,460 --> 03:28:22,580
You are one of the worst things that has ever happened to the brony phantom. Yeah, look how terrible that is

2343
03:28:23,060 --> 03:28:26,100
Look how cool phantom work is that we're sent to aim to ketan rogers

2344
03:28:26,420 --> 03:28:32,660
Literally the best thing that has ever happened to the analysis community is that you left it

2345
03:28:32,820 --> 03:28:38,420
You are a piss-gargling scumbag who deserves to lose all the popularity. He currently has

2346
03:28:39,140 --> 03:28:43,860
All the popularity all of the patreon pledges that are being given to this micro

2347
03:28:44,020 --> 03:28:51,540
Penis ass wipe and give it to me so that she actually has something to eat outside of whatever's left over from his mcdonald's happy meal

2348
03:28:51,780 --> 03:28:56,020
And by the way, what the way, you know, did she bro? I don't know what he's

2349
03:28:58,820 --> 03:29:00,340
What

2350
03:29:00,340 --> 03:29:08,100
I think he's saying that I eat mcdonald's and eating mcdonald's is bad and I eat happy meals because

2351
03:29:08,740 --> 03:29:10,500
saying like

2352
03:29:10,500 --> 03:29:11,620
Mage

2353
03:29:11,620 --> 03:29:15,700
Okay, the three like the three ideas there are that

2354
03:29:16,180 --> 03:29:20,740
Maid doesn't have a lot of money ergo is eating table scraps, of course

2355
03:29:20,980 --> 03:29:25,700
A lot of money on patreon ergo is eating table scraps. Yeah

2356
03:29:26,340 --> 03:29:27,700
uh

2357
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:29,700
and she like

2358
03:29:29,860 --> 03:29:31,780
like he says

2359
03:29:31,780 --> 03:29:33,460
something like

2360
03:29:33,460 --> 03:29:39,140
Play it again like roll back. I need like digest so that she'll have something to eat besides the leftovers from his

2361
03:29:39,460 --> 03:29:41,140
mcdonald's happy meal also

2362
03:29:41,140 --> 03:29:45,060
I just want to say that like if he thinks that if he's showing this picture of phantom horn

2363
03:29:45,060 --> 03:29:48,180
And he doesn't think that it's great like like he's he's just so fucking

2364
03:29:48,580 --> 03:29:51,620
He's just so fucking out of touch because this is like the greatest thing that ever

2365
03:29:51,700 --> 03:29:55,940
This is this is the best thing that ever happened to the mlp fandom and like the fact that he

2366
03:29:56,500 --> 03:29:58,820
Like the fact that he thinks that telling me that like

2367
03:29:59,780 --> 03:30:03,380
It's good that I left like the fact that he thinks that would like hurt my feelings. Yeah

2368
03:30:04,020 --> 03:30:08,500
Like this is again, we're just we're just getting a glimpse into it. It's just like watching it's like walking

2369
03:30:09,380 --> 03:30:12,900
It's like walking up to like a renaissance pain and say like oh my fucking god

2370
03:30:12,980 --> 03:30:18,900
This is the worst thing to ever happen to medieval times. I'm so sorry that like I'm so sorry that like we got like machines

2371
03:30:18,980 --> 03:30:21,380
And like advance to the modern era. What the fuck

2372
03:30:22,500 --> 03:30:24,020
What the fuck dude?

2373
03:30:24,020 --> 03:30:25,860
Lee has you know what we should do

2374
03:30:26,020 --> 03:30:31,220
We should take all of the patreon pledges that are being given to this micro penis ass wipe

2375
03:30:31,380 --> 03:30:37,780
And give it to mage so that she actually has something to eat outside of whatever's leftover from his mcdonald's happy meal

2376
03:30:38,020 --> 03:30:45,140
And by the way by the way, you know digi bro that great friend of yours that you were hesitant to say anything bad about

2377
03:30:45,220 --> 03:30:47,220
While you were criticizing everybody

2378
03:30:47,780 --> 03:30:55,300
Yeah, he's a pretentious sick muncher who stumped his thumb up people's asses over how they produced their anime content

2379
03:30:55,540 --> 03:30:59,860
I honestly don't get like I don't know like I don't know about that video instead

2380
03:31:00,180 --> 03:31:05,380
He practically makes the same content and he's not a complete conch and oh my god

2381
03:31:06,180 --> 03:31:08,180
Oh my god

2382
03:31:09,540 --> 03:31:13,780
Just the woeful just the woeful ignorance like

2383
03:31:14,420 --> 03:31:16,580
Telling me this like it's a great revelation

2384
03:31:17,140 --> 03:31:20,820
Like oh like he's spilling the beans that oh digi's an asshole

2385
03:31:21,220 --> 03:31:26,660
And we should watch jeff like he doesn't know like shouldn't he know that like we kick jeff out

2386
03:31:27,940 --> 03:31:33,780
Okay, well first of all first of all on record. I think I said this last time too. I'm I'm I'm pro jeff and I think jeff is cool

2387
03:31:34,500 --> 03:31:37,060
I don't care. I don't care one bit about jeff is

2388
03:31:38,180 --> 03:31:42,260
Does he not know that jeff was on the pcp?

2389
03:31:43,460 --> 03:31:45,460
He might he might know that

2390
03:31:46,420 --> 03:31:48,420
He doesn't seem like he knows like

2391
03:31:50,100 --> 03:31:56,660
That doesn't like like like oh, why isn't jeff on here's way better than did you know like we should all watch this guy

2392
03:31:57,380 --> 03:32:00,660
Because I think he I think he's thinking that like he's problem

2393
03:32:00,740 --> 03:32:04,900
He might be drawing the equivalents. They're like because jeff was on the pcp

2394
03:32:05,700 --> 03:32:07,700
All right fair fair, I suppose

2395
03:32:08,020 --> 03:32:10,820
Uh, but first okay. Yeah, but to go back

2396
03:32:11,780 --> 03:32:13,780
I'll concede maybe maybe he knows

2397
03:32:14,340 --> 03:32:19,780
Something about the pcp. Maybe maybe he knows one fact about the pcp. I'll give him that. Yeah. Yeah

2398
03:32:20,420 --> 03:32:24,180
First of all again, we're all friends of one another. We all know what we do

2399
03:32:25,060 --> 03:32:31,620
Ben you lived in the same house as did you when he yeah at this time. Yeah, yeah, yeah

2400
03:32:32,420 --> 03:32:35,460
But of course he wouldn't know that yeah, I lived in his house

2401
03:32:35,940 --> 03:32:39,700
You lived in you were roommates

2402
03:32:40,260 --> 03:32:46,420
You lived at his house. You lived in the same house when he made that video

2403
03:32:46,980 --> 03:32:48,980
Yeah, yeah true

2404
03:32:48,980 --> 03:32:53,380
It's not like a loose confederation. It's not like a loot like we all know what we're doing

2405
03:32:53,380 --> 03:32:59,380
We are like like like look at this crate. Yeah, I bet you didn't know did you bro made this video

2406
03:32:59,700 --> 03:33:03,460
Well, well, well, well, you know what let me I'm not entirely sure whether he's

2407
03:33:04,020 --> 03:33:11,140
Trying to do like an expose and like expose digi as an asshole or if he's just trying to like hurt me by insulting my friend

2408
03:33:11,460 --> 03:33:12,660
You know

2409
03:33:12,660 --> 03:33:14,660
Oh

2410
03:33:14,820 --> 03:33:21,780
Maybe but like he might just be being like and about your friend digi. He sucks this guy's better, you know

2411
03:33:23,140 --> 03:33:26,500
If so completely irrelevant and also just weird and mean

2412
03:33:27,140 --> 03:33:30,180
Yeah, yeah, I mean he's just being mean like he's just being like

2413
03:33:30,820 --> 03:33:36,260
Like know what like nowhere in our video. Did I say I don't okay? I don't think I was like

2414
03:33:36,820 --> 03:33:41,380
Listen everyone who's pledging to tune critic y2k keyframe

2415
03:33:41,940 --> 03:33:45,140
Whoever the fuck else I don't think I I never said like

2416
03:33:45,620 --> 03:33:51,060
You all need to stop pledging to them and pledge to like me or pledge to hip or pledge to someone else

2417
03:33:51,380 --> 03:33:54,900
I didn't do that. I was just like man. I can't I don't think so

2418
03:33:55,140 --> 03:34:00,900
I don't think so because I think I was more like I just can't believe that people see value in this and are pledging and it

2419
03:34:00,900 --> 03:34:02,100
Upsets me

2420
03:34:02,100 --> 03:34:06,820
This and then for him to come and be like you all need to stop pledging to ben

2421
03:34:07,620 --> 03:34:09,620
Like I'm not worried

2422
03:34:09,700 --> 03:34:15,780
Like obviously I didn't think that it was going to happen, but it just strikes me as really malicious and

2423
03:34:16,580 --> 03:34:18,580
Just like a really nasty thing

2424
03:34:18,740 --> 03:34:20,660
To even want to do, you know

2425
03:34:20,660 --> 03:34:21,540
Yeah

2426
03:34:21,540 --> 03:34:25,540
Just like a really nasty thing to say and I really just really

2427
03:34:26,180 --> 03:34:33,140
Makes me kind of wonder why he thinks that why he thinks he's got any kind of moral high ground to come to like look down from

2428
03:34:33,540 --> 03:34:35,540
Hashtag save misanthropony not been

2429
03:34:36,020 --> 03:34:38,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly

2430
03:34:38,580 --> 03:34:42,180
He needs it. He needs to be saved from himself

2431
03:34:43,940 --> 03:34:45,140
It's off

2432
03:34:45,140 --> 03:34:51,380
I'm gonna continue. Oh, oh, wait, wait. I was tried to do it. Uh, by the way, uh, he says, uh, your friend did you bro?

2433
03:34:51,460 --> 03:34:58,420
He was so hesitant to talk bad about uh, we just like didgy. Yeah, like have anything bad to say about him. He's yeah

2434
03:34:59,540 --> 03:35:02,820
It's it's weird like it's weird that that's not where his mind went

2435
03:35:03,140 --> 03:35:05,300
Yeah, like how he could not piece that together

2436
03:35:06,260 --> 03:35:08,260
Like yeah, like it's yeah

2437
03:35:08,500 --> 03:35:17,060
In the comment section of this video because no reply that you make will ever justify the unbearable level of ignorance that you displayed

2438
03:35:17,300 --> 03:35:22,100
And fuck you shit, man. Whoever the fuck you are for accompanying this madness

2439
03:35:28,180 --> 03:35:30,180
Why doesn't he know who you are

2440
03:35:31,060 --> 03:35:36,980
What he just showed a video of mine earlier. He showed to your dad. You know who I am

2441
03:35:38,580 --> 03:35:39,860
like

2442
03:35:39,860 --> 03:35:42,580
I don't I don't get it. I don't get like what

2443
03:35:43,620 --> 03:35:46,340
He's talking about like why doesn't he know who you are like he well

2444
03:35:46,340 --> 03:35:50,740
He knows the pcp like he's familiar with what's going on there. How can he not know?

2445
03:35:52,500 --> 03:35:54,500
like like

2446
03:35:54,580 --> 03:35:56,580
I he's just

2447
03:35:56,900 --> 03:35:59,620
I have no idea what information he has and what doesn't

2448
03:36:00,180 --> 03:36:04,500
You see like it's a rant like it's random some information. He just has to block out some

2449
03:36:05,220 --> 03:36:07,860
Yeah, have the full picture, but how are we supposed to know?

2450
03:36:09,700 --> 03:36:16,340
I don't get it. I don't I don't know and like me like fuck you too much if you're accompanying this madness

2451
03:36:16,740 --> 03:36:20,420
Not fuck you too for saying the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like

2452
03:36:21,700 --> 03:36:27,540
It was like this was a group effort. This was a group like it's not like it's not like I committed a crime and you like

2453
03:36:27,700 --> 03:36:32,100
Covered for me. It's like we were both in it doing the exact same thing. Yeah

2454
03:36:33,700 --> 03:36:34,980
I don't know

2455
03:36:34,980 --> 03:36:36,820
I don't know man

2456
03:36:36,820 --> 03:36:41,620
Like like why like like like why is he maybe he just doesn't know me so it doesn't matter

2457
03:36:41,700 --> 03:36:47,540
But like that's still like a it feels like it feels like the crime isn't that you just did these things

2458
03:36:47,540 --> 03:36:53,380
But that you were in the community and did these things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was gonna say it's like it's personal for me

2459
03:36:54,020 --> 03:36:56,020
like for me it's personal

2460
03:36:56,340 --> 03:36:58,340
Uh

2461
03:37:00,500 --> 03:37:02,900
Yeah, yeah, like like when it's me it's a betrayal

2462
03:37:04,340 --> 03:37:07,060
But but when it's me it's just me doing bad things

2463
03:37:07,380 --> 03:37:12,660
Which you know, if you're so much just doing bad things, I don't who cares. He's just doing horrible things. I find your poor

2464
03:37:13,300 --> 03:37:18,420
Yeah, yeah, but if he didn't use if I didn't use to think he was an ally then it's no big deal

2465
03:37:20,260 --> 03:37:22,020
Jesus Christ

2466
03:37:22,020 --> 03:37:28,340
Know that a lot of people who were featured in your video have seen it already and they've been pretty merciful towards you

2467
03:37:28,660 --> 03:37:32,660
But not me. So I've got one thing to say to you pal

2468
03:37:32,980 --> 03:37:40,020
Own up to your stupidity and take responsibility for it because people are generally not gonna want to put up with your

2469
03:37:40,020 --> 03:37:46,260
Shit, you're lucky that I decided to format the audio for this video before golden fox sent anything to me

2470
03:37:46,580 --> 03:37:52,900
I'm pretty sure he has some very special choice words for you after what you just said about his girlfriend

2471
03:37:53,540 --> 03:37:58,340
Um fun fact. No, he doesn't uh, he never said a thing to me. So there we go

2472
03:37:58,580 --> 03:38:01,060
And hold on hold on. I just want to analyze it soon as for a second

2473
03:38:01,460 --> 03:38:07,380
So he formatted his audio before like you're lucky. I did that before golden fox sent anything to me

2474
03:38:07,860 --> 03:38:12,820
So I'm sure that must mean that that he was like chatting with golden fox and was like, oh man

2475
03:38:12,820 --> 03:38:14,820
You should send something my name was like, oh, I don't know

2476
03:38:15,380 --> 03:38:21,060
But I I want to just imagine I want I want this headcanon to be real. I want this to be what I actually had

2477
03:38:21,140 --> 03:38:25,300
I wanted I wanted golden fox to come at me. Like I thought that sounded great

2478
03:38:25,780 --> 03:38:27,860
Well, okay. Okay. I want this to be what happened

2479
03:38:28,500 --> 03:38:32,180
He missanthropony knows about golden fox

2480
03:38:33,220 --> 03:38:35,780
And he knows that he is dating keyframe

2481
03:38:36,580 --> 03:38:40,100
So he watches this video and he like makes a video

2482
03:38:40,580 --> 03:38:43,540
He like makes a video and then he's just thinking

2483
03:38:44,100 --> 03:38:45,060
man

2484
03:38:45,060 --> 03:38:50,980
What if golden fox sent me some audio that would be crazy like he like like like do you understand what i'm saying here?

2485
03:38:50,980 --> 03:38:52,340
Like he doesn't know

2486
03:38:52,340 --> 03:38:56,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like like this is not a thing that was ever like actually going to go down

2487
03:38:56,980 --> 03:39:01,860
Yeah, this is just like what he wanted because he says it's odd to me that he says he's pretty sure

2488
03:39:02,100 --> 03:39:07,700
The golden fox has some choice where like that vague wording makes me wonder like what he's actually talking about

2489
03:39:07,940 --> 03:39:12,180
Yeah, so I want to just conclude like I want this to be I'm sure this isn't the case

2490
03:39:12,260 --> 03:39:18,340
This seems unlikely, but I want to be the case that he just does not know golden fox and golden fox doesn't even know about this

2491
03:39:18,900 --> 03:39:20,900
Know about fucking frog fractions

2492
03:39:21,220 --> 03:39:23,540
He just knows that they are like related

2493
03:39:24,660 --> 03:39:28,020
I don't I'm not sure. I kind of think that maybe

2494
03:39:28,980 --> 03:39:34,340
He did but like I don't know. I never thought about it. Yeah, maybe maybe he doesn't maybe maybe golden fox

2495
03:39:34,420 --> 03:39:40,180
Just like listen, I don't care and and and uh and miss anthro is just like choice words

2496
03:39:41,140 --> 03:39:43,220
Yeah, exactly fucking jesus christ

2497
03:39:43,460 --> 03:39:47,300
I mean golden fox like I said, I would have I would have loved it if golden fox had been like

2498
03:39:47,380 --> 03:39:54,100
Hey, I heard you talking shit about my girlfriend like I would have loved to defend my position to him or keyframe herself

2499
03:39:54,340 --> 03:39:56,340
But nobody ever said anything

2500
03:39:57,380 --> 03:40:03,700
Fuck you and have a nice day and if I see you anywhere near brony conigan, I'm slamming my foot up your dick

2501
03:40:04,100 --> 03:40:06,100
Oh

2502
03:40:06,900 --> 03:40:09,860
Jesus christ, what a nice guy. Yeah, what a nice dude

2503
03:40:10,660 --> 03:40:15,220
Really really vindictive when we obviously had the tone that we didn't actually care in that video

2504
03:40:15,300 --> 03:40:17,860
Like like none of this is really negatively impacting us

2505
03:40:18,580 --> 03:40:22,660
Like like to to him. This is personal like like like like to him

2506
03:40:22,900 --> 03:40:26,820
The right there just talking to his frog fractions was the end of the world, but to us it was Tuesday

2507
03:40:27,300 --> 03:40:30,340
Exactly exactly. I don't know. It's just it bugs me

2508
03:40:30,420 --> 03:40:33,860
It bugs me that he can like think this is okay that like I

2509
03:40:34,660 --> 03:40:40,820
Say mean things about someone and his and what he believes to be an appropriate response to that is like to fucking kick

2510
03:40:40,820 --> 03:40:44,740
Someone in the dick, which is an action that can cause like serious injury, you know

2511
03:40:45,540 --> 03:40:50,500
Like he's like he thinks it's fine. Like he thinks it's fine to threaten violence against someone

2512
03:40:51,060 --> 03:40:53,060
Like he thinks that's appropriate

2513
03:40:53,380 --> 03:40:55,700
And like what do you even say to a person like that?

2514
03:40:56,660 --> 03:41:00,980
I'm not I'm not trying to be all bleed and heart like oh he threatened me but like for fuck's sake

2515
03:41:02,980 --> 03:41:06,580
I just it's just completely unwarranted and disgusting like

2516
03:41:08,020 --> 03:41:09,060
like

2517
03:41:09,060 --> 03:41:16,340
He is doing everything that we that he considered bad in that video, but worse 10 times worse and more personal

2518
03:41:16,900 --> 03:41:23,220
Yeah, we didn't spend I mean, I mean, I mean sure I'm sure we spend like large segments talking about one person

2519
03:41:23,540 --> 03:41:26,900
But none of it was this in-depth and like personally like

2520
03:41:27,460 --> 03:41:32,500
Like we never had like fucking like like like like material. We never had like oh here. I'm gonna edit this

2521
03:41:32,580 --> 03:41:34,980
I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking script this it was all off the cuff

2522
03:41:35,540 --> 03:41:39,940
Normal just friends like shit talking in like completely closed off

2523
03:41:40,580 --> 03:41:47,540
Yeah, none of it was this highly edited our video was not a hit video unlike this one, which is explicitly was yeah

2524
03:41:50,020 --> 03:41:52,020
Speaking of hit videos, um

2525
03:41:52,500 --> 03:41:53,860
Shall we go on to the next one?

2526
03:41:53,860 --> 03:41:56,420
Should we go on to the next man? That one took a long time to get through

2527
03:41:56,580 --> 03:42:01,940
I don't know if I don't I don't know if I've got the energy to like spend to pick this next one apart to that extent

2528
03:42:02,580 --> 03:42:05,300
Well, I certainly do so you can just pick it back off me

2529
03:42:05,380 --> 03:42:09,140
It's because this next one is like really like that one was mean to you

2530
03:42:09,220 --> 03:42:11,380
This one's like mean to us both this one

2531
03:42:12,020 --> 03:42:14,740
Yeah, this one's real this one's real shitty and like

2532
03:42:15,620 --> 03:42:17,780
Even less coherent. We have to understand

2533
03:42:18,580 --> 03:42:23,220
Here here like this one. I honestly can't even understand like what his point is. Yeah, uh, okay

2534
03:42:23,460 --> 03:42:27,940
I watched this one before obviously and I just want to I just want to let you go

2535
03:42:27,940 --> 03:42:31,940
Oh, by the way, we should mention that that video you just watched was by Miss Anthropony

2536
03:42:32,260 --> 03:42:36,740
It was called something like uh, you know taking down been saying uh all credits, you know

2537
03:42:37,060 --> 03:42:40,980
That was his video go ahead and watch that if you want to not claim your ownership there

2538
03:42:41,060 --> 03:42:45,300
It's you know a little disclaimer. Anyway, this is by fngr for no good reason

2539
03:42:45,620 --> 03:42:47,540
How not to bring 35 of tumblr insane?

2540
03:42:48,100 --> 03:42:50,100
Okay, I watched this before

2541
03:42:50,500 --> 03:42:55,860
I don't understand it whatsoever. I do not know what this video is

2542
03:42:56,260 --> 03:43:00,020
Miss Anthropony's video was about the video like at the very least you can you can

2543
03:43:00,500 --> 03:43:06,020
You know what the point of that video was like like reading between reading between the lines

2544
03:43:06,020 --> 03:43:12,500
You can understand what it is that Miss Anthropony feels about the video and like what it is that's bothering him

2545
03:43:12,820 --> 03:43:15,540
That video was a response to right-fingers copulars fog for actions

2546
03:43:16,020 --> 03:43:20,500
That was describing what happened in the video that made him upset. Sure. None of his points make sense

2547
03:43:20,500 --> 03:43:26,660
But you can understand what the video is. Yeah, I do not understand what this for no good reasons video is

2548
03:43:28,420 --> 03:43:35,540
His like there's no like none of his none of his things that he says like point to any like central idea

2549
03:43:35,860 --> 03:43:40,660
Or like reason which I guess that's his name. Haha his name. Yeah. Yeah good

2550
03:43:41,220 --> 03:43:42,340
um

2551
03:43:42,340 --> 03:43:44,020
Like this one is like

2552
03:43:44,020 --> 03:43:47,780
Basically the like this entire not the whole video is about us

2553
03:43:48,100 --> 03:43:53,940
But the part that is is like just calling us shit and like not even trying to back that up

2554
03:43:54,340 --> 03:43:56,340
Yeah, go ahead and start it

2555
03:43:57,220 --> 03:44:01,300
Are we first or we later? I don't I don't think

2556
03:44:04,580 --> 03:44:08,980
This is a last minute pre word before I get to being needlessly bitchy

2557
03:44:09,220 --> 03:44:14,100
I'm not I think I skip with me. Sorry. Sorry. I don't want to I skip the important

2558
03:44:15,220 --> 03:44:19,540
Yeah, yeah, we just gotta find out I think it only goes I think the first like eight minutes or so are about us

2559
03:44:19,860 --> 03:44:24,500
Yeah, it's just probably first us and then later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know some weeks ago

2560
03:44:25,060 --> 03:44:28,740
I oh, I should say that before this video came out fngr

2561
03:44:29,540 --> 03:44:30,980
Tweeted at me

2562
03:44:30,980 --> 03:44:35,540
And he was just like I don't remember what he said, but he was asking me like are we cool?

2563
03:44:36,500 --> 03:44:37,700
And I was like

2564
03:44:37,700 --> 03:44:40,660
What what do you mean? Like what wouldn't we be cool about? I think

2565
03:44:41,380 --> 03:44:45,940
I don't even know if I mentioned him in the frog fractions video, but I think I did

2566
03:44:46,820 --> 03:44:48,100
Yeah, yeah, maybe you did

2567
03:44:48,100 --> 03:44:51,140
But he was asking me like are we cool and I was like are we cool about what?

2568
03:44:51,540 --> 03:44:54,900
And he was real cagey and he kept asking like are we cool are we cool?

2569
03:44:54,900 --> 03:44:58,500
I'm just checking and finally I was like what are you fucking talking about

2570
03:44:59,060 --> 03:45:04,180
And he or I forget how I phrase it, but I got mad. I was like what I said like what are you talking about you cagey?

2571
03:45:04,180 --> 03:45:06,340
Fuck. Yeah, he was like never mind

2572
03:45:07,140 --> 03:45:12,180
And like dropped it and then a couple days later this video comes out. Oh, okay, and let me read the text on screen

2573
03:45:12,500 --> 03:45:14,500
Uh, boy, I can't wait to get this puke

2574
03:45:14,900 --> 03:45:19,780
Uh, this puke class. This is what a fail abortion looks like that wasn't capitalized

2575
03:45:20,100 --> 03:45:24,340
I'm actually such a garbage human being if he was the crap and the divus diaper

2576
03:45:24,820 --> 03:45:28,020
Uh, the dude's girlfriend's diaper. Uh, he dumped her

2577
03:45:28,740 --> 03:45:30,980
Okay, pretty good pretty good so far

2578
03:45:31,540 --> 03:45:35,940
I'm enjoying this content pretty yeah, yeah pretty good content so far pretty good

2579
03:45:36,500 --> 03:45:41,460
Uh, we're really getting the lulls here, bro. We're really getting the lulls here. I'm gonna laugh out loud when I see this

2580
03:45:41,460 --> 03:45:46,900
This is just setting the tone for what to expect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this is this amount of intelligence we're dealing with here

2581
03:45:47,780 --> 03:45:51,460
Uh, hang tight. We'll get there Ben. I need you to focus reach down deep

2582
03:45:51,620 --> 03:45:56,420
Percent like there's a big bag of pain chips waiting. Look at how he spells theirs

2583
03:45:56,980 --> 03:46:02,660
Wait, wait, it didn't work for me for some reason. Yeah. Yeah, here. That one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there we go. There we go. There we go

2584
03:46:02,820 --> 03:46:04,100
Yeah, yeah

2585
03:46:04,100 --> 03:46:09,060
Look, just look at how he spells theirs. Like I don't understand of what joke he's trying to make here

2586
03:46:09,060 --> 03:46:11,860
Just the spelling is it's funny problem naturally

2587
03:46:12,260 --> 03:46:15,860
There's the horse news situation, but that looks like a big one

2588
03:46:16,180 --> 03:46:20,580
This is a last minute pre word before I get to being needlessly bitchy

2589
03:46:20,820 --> 03:46:25,060
I'm not interested in the moral high ground. This is not me being the better man

2590
03:46:25,540 --> 03:46:30,580
I've glanced at and skimmed Miss Anthropony's video on this topic and left it up for attention

2591
03:46:30,660 --> 03:46:36,020
So he can get his sweet 20 minutes. I could work really hard to pander why I'm right and ben's wrong

2592
03:46:36,340 --> 03:46:41,300
I'm just gonna be salty right and wrong about what we called chelise's bluff last night

2593
03:46:41,460 --> 03:46:46,900
That being tuesday to have a talk with tune critic and chelise in true horse news fashion

2594
03:46:47,140 --> 03:46:52,020
Dick tucked despite having a skype account. He said that he didn't have the means to log on to it anymore

2595
03:46:52,180 --> 03:46:57,460
Journalism folks like even if you forgot the password it would take him what 60 seconds one minute

2596
03:46:57,620 --> 03:47:02,420
Should I skip a little bit? Let's see. I think so. Yeah, it's all just bullshit. The horse news is still stuck on the

2597
03:47:02,820 --> 03:47:04,820
Where he had tried to oh, yeah

2598
03:47:06,260 --> 03:47:10,980
Oh, here we go. Here we go. Goldfish. I nasty youtube thing. Dear ben saint

2599
03:47:11,140 --> 03:47:14,100
I know you're too lazy or too stupid to walk kind of looks like a 20 year old

2600
03:47:14,260 --> 03:47:19,540
I'm actually older than that. That's right. I bent over backwards monday to try and make peace with you

2601
03:47:19,780 --> 03:47:23,140
Ben had done a four-hour hit video on the brawny fandom

2602
03:47:23,380 --> 03:47:30,660
Where he had tried to bend over backwards to impress his fellow pcp member munchie the mongoloid knuckle dragon of the group

2603
03:47:30,740 --> 03:47:32,740
Dear munchie

2604
03:47:33,300 --> 03:47:39,140
First of all, yeah, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't I mean

2605
03:47:40,500 --> 03:47:43,300
There's so there's just so like everything he says is nonsense

2606
03:47:43,300 --> 03:47:47,220
I mean like if he was trying to make pee like he didn't try to make peace

2607
03:47:47,620 --> 03:47:51,940
He asked me if there was anything wrong and I said I didn't know what would be wrong

2608
03:47:52,020 --> 03:47:57,300
And like I don't know what and then he kept pressing me until I got annoyed and basically told him to go away

2609
03:47:57,940 --> 03:48:01,060
Yeah, and then he left and was mad at me. That's bad

2610
03:48:01,460 --> 03:48:06,820
But the way he describes the video like okay, first of all, it's obviously he calls it a hit video

2611
03:48:07,300 --> 03:48:12,740
Yeah, that didn't even he didn't even watch missanthropone's 20 minute response to it. Yeah, he just skimmed

2612
03:48:13,460 --> 03:48:16,900
Okay, so right off the bat. He just doesn't know what he's talking about. He just does not understand. Yeah

2613
03:48:17,380 --> 03:48:20,660
So he so so I guess this is again punching down

2614
03:48:20,740 --> 03:48:24,260
Like we like we shouldn't even be doing this because he obviously just does not understand anything

2615
03:48:25,860 --> 03:48:28,900
I mean, I said it about missanthropone. I said about fngr

2616
03:48:28,900 --> 03:48:32,820
I really believe it in both cases like I really think they're retarded and there's something wrong with them because they

2617
03:48:32,820 --> 03:48:38,660
Just don't act or speak or behave or like convey thoughts in the way that like a functioning human being does

2618
03:48:38,820 --> 03:48:41,700
Yeah, and and like we wouldn't I like if it was just like

2619
03:48:42,260 --> 03:48:46,900
I don't really understand what's going on. They were being mean to key for like again, like I wouldn't care

2620
03:48:47,220 --> 03:48:49,220
But this guy gets like mean

2621
03:48:49,380 --> 03:48:52,900
He gets fngr gets mean and never says why he never says why?

2622
03:48:53,620 --> 03:49:01,060
Uh, but but yeah, okay, but the way he described it as you made the frog fractions video to bend over backwards to appease me

2623
03:49:01,620 --> 03:49:03,940
The mongrel, where does he get that idea?

2624
03:49:04,580 --> 03:49:07,620
Like where does that come from? What does that mean?

2625
03:49:09,380 --> 03:49:10,740
What

2626
03:49:10,740 --> 03:49:11,700
What?

2627
03:49:11,700 --> 03:49:17,140
It's like what does it not enter these people's heads that maybe we're just friends and we want to hang out and be friends

2628
03:49:17,220 --> 03:49:19,620
And talk shit about people that suck. Yeah

2629
03:49:20,100 --> 03:49:25,460
Like could that could that is that not a reasonable explanation for why this is a video?

2630
03:49:26,100 --> 03:49:27,540
How like

2631
03:49:27,540 --> 03:49:31,780
That's not like a marketable that you can't even say that was for money. That's not a marketable video

2632
03:49:32,420 --> 03:49:36,100
No, that's not like what people want to see that's that wouldn't get us money

2633
03:49:36,580 --> 03:49:38,660
And how would that appease me to do that?

2634
03:49:39,300 --> 03:49:40,260
how

2635
03:49:40,260 --> 03:49:46,580
You like like I don't even know most of those like I don't of them and I had stuff to say but it's not like like like

2636
03:49:48,420 --> 03:49:53,700
I don't have the I don't have the beef here. I just kind of ride the beef. I read the coattails the beef basically

2637
03:49:54,020 --> 03:49:57,860
Like I want like I want to theorize like where this idea comes from

2638
03:49:57,860 --> 03:50:03,380
But I've just got nothing like I've got no idea why he thinks that like I'm trying to impress you

2639
03:50:04,100 --> 03:50:06,020
with any of this

2640
03:50:06,740 --> 03:50:08,740
I don't understand. I don't understand

2641
03:50:09,140 --> 03:50:10,260
Continue

2642
03:50:10,260 --> 03:50:16,500
I'm gonna take care of you right now. This is my friend Vita. I could spare 100 munchies to a single Vita

2643
03:50:16,580 --> 03:50:21,220
For those of you guys who don't know once upon a time ago Vita used to be boys with digi bro

2644
03:50:21,380 --> 03:50:26,740
And digi bro cut Vita out because and Vita got all bitchy and huffy about it because and the ensuing

2645
03:50:27,060 --> 03:50:31,860
Shitstorm has reached levels of fuckery that the bernie fandom might not have known

2646
03:50:32,100 --> 03:50:33,620
Well, if not for this channel

2647
03:50:33,620 --> 03:50:37,460
Munchies case on like digis where digi just cut Vita off and Vita

2648
03:50:37,460 --> 03:50:42,260
Wondered up taking it very poorly about as bad as say lily peat took being cut off from joss scorcher

2649
03:50:42,420 --> 03:50:43,300
Munchie

2650
03:50:43,300 --> 03:50:47,620
Did the same thing and Vita asked for me to go find out to which munchie told me

2651
03:50:47,940 --> 03:50:50,820
Sometimes some niggas just don't get along anymore and that's fine

2652
03:50:51,140 --> 03:50:54,660
And Vita's response was and nothing of value was lost

2653
03:50:55,220 --> 03:50:58,820
Vita didn't mindlessly harass munchie. He let shit go

2654
03:50:59,060 --> 03:51:02,820
In fact, I was really proud that Vita had the most mature rare moment

2655
03:51:02,900 --> 03:51:07,380
I've ever seen him have in one of these situations. Later on Vita snuck his way here here

2656
03:51:07,620 --> 03:51:14,660
Let me pause this so I can explain what's going on. Uh Vita made accounts on steam over and over trying to add me

2657
03:51:14,740 --> 03:51:18,740
That is a fact that is what he did and I'm pretty sure the timeline of this

2658
03:51:19,380 --> 03:51:22,420
After effing you're asked me he didn't do it anymore, which was fine

2659
03:51:22,660 --> 03:51:28,100
The facts still remains after I blocked him and I'm fairly certain that I that I said I blocked you or even if I didn't

2660
03:51:28,100 --> 03:51:34,100
He could take the hint making a ton of accounts to message me and me ignoring every single one

2661
03:51:34,180 --> 03:51:36,180
Probably doesn't seem like I want to talk does it?

2662
03:51:37,940 --> 03:51:39,940
You know like he's

2663
03:51:41,620 --> 03:51:48,740
I which like fngr just he just goes off on this thing and like there's no context given as to like why there's be

2664
03:51:48,820 --> 03:51:52,180
like he says that like Vita used to be boys with digi and then

2665
03:51:53,300 --> 03:51:55,300
something about you and

2666
03:51:55,940 --> 03:51:59,460
Something see like this isn't even like drama

2667
03:51:59,620 --> 03:52:03,700
This is just like a weird sort of like Vita wanted to be friends still

2668
03:52:03,780 --> 03:52:06,900
Or maybe he just it just seemed like you want maybe he didn't want to be friends

2669
03:52:06,980 --> 03:52:12,100
Maybe he just wanted to talk for some reason. I didn't want to talk so I didn't accept his friend's request. That's it

2670
03:52:12,260 --> 03:52:17,860
That's the entirety of what transpired, you know the entire the entire section was just uh mean vita didn't talk anymore

2671
03:52:18,340 --> 03:52:24,100
That's it the the the thing that i'm getting here like I've thought about this before and I like the closest thing

2672
03:52:24,260 --> 03:52:25,940
I can get to like

2673
03:52:25,940 --> 03:52:32,180
An underlying reason for why fngr is so upset is I really think that was like vita that was upset

2674
03:52:32,260 --> 03:52:37,780
Like I really think he's upset on behalf of vita because of probably because we shit talked him and we like went and tried

2675
03:52:37,860 --> 03:52:40,660
And I I deleted his page even though I knew it would come back

2676
03:52:40,980 --> 03:52:45,780
Yeah, um, so like I think I think that he's indignant because we were mean to vita

2677
03:52:46,100 --> 03:52:50,980
And I think that probably what this video is is just like a sort of diarrhea stream

2678
03:52:51,460 --> 03:52:57,780
That like came squirting out as the like as the aftermath of like some really angry like back and

2679
03:52:57,860 --> 03:53:03,220
Forthing between like the people that like fngr hangs out with like, you know corpulent brony and vita

2680
03:53:03,780 --> 03:53:04,820
and

2681
03:53:04,820 --> 03:53:10,820
Shelley d and like whoever the fuck else like I think this is like they kind of took this idea that like oh ben and munchy

2682
03:53:10,820 --> 03:53:15,540
Were mean to vita echo chambered it around being like oh well, they're bad. They're the ones who are bad

2683
03:53:15,540 --> 03:53:20,980
They're shitty and I hate them and then like this video is what's like squirted out like of the black box

2684
03:53:21,060 --> 03:53:23,780
Like we don't see we don't get to see what went into it. Yeah

2685
03:53:24,340 --> 03:53:26,900
Yeah, yeah, we don't we don't really know what happened there

2686
03:53:27,220 --> 03:53:32,100
We just know that this is like the feeling that this indescribable in like

2687
03:53:32,740 --> 03:53:35,620
Unfathomable video is what was is what was created

2688
03:53:35,860 --> 03:53:39,780
We don't like it's just we can't describe what it is because it makes no sense

2689
03:53:40,340 --> 03:53:45,540
It's really like it really feels like it's all based on like some some like cultural some like

2690
03:53:46,340 --> 03:53:50,660
Like clicky shit that is like deeply understood by like five people. Yeah

2691
03:53:51,220 --> 03:53:57,380
But we have like no context for but then like a thousand people watch it anyway because it's like vaguely related to the brony fandom

2692
03:53:57,380 --> 03:53:59,700
And that means it's worth watching for some reason

2693
03:54:00,660 --> 03:54:02,660
I just I don't understand

2694
03:54:02,820 --> 03:54:07,620
Now by the way, and none of this is a point about the video. This is just like weird backstory between me and vita

2695
03:54:07,940 --> 03:54:12,180
Continue. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah where he was getting along with people in there

2696
03:54:12,260 --> 03:54:16,340
We'll more the fans and say the pcp members, but that was never gonna happen

2697
03:54:16,500 --> 03:54:22,260
I fully understand that vita didn't belong there. We kind of popped in the call and munchi showed up and went

2698
03:54:22,420 --> 03:54:27,540
What are you doing here vita? Nobody likes you kill yourself. Oh, hi fng. Are you're cool?

2699
03:54:27,860 --> 03:54:32,420
Let me respond munchi. No, I don't also when you first of all

2700
03:54:32,580 --> 03:54:37,460
I don't think I like my entire okay. I know I might have said

2701
03:54:38,660 --> 03:54:41,540
Me, you know fng. You're cool. My entire

2702
03:54:42,020 --> 03:54:47,060
Knowledge of fngr was that he was like this weird like shady sketchy guy that I didn't like

2703
03:54:47,300 --> 03:54:50,580
But I knew I knew that people thought were cool. So I was like, okay

2704
03:54:50,740 --> 03:54:55,620
I guess I'll just like I I never wanted to be friends with fng. I just thought like, okay

2705
03:54:55,780 --> 03:54:59,380
I won't start shit like I'll start shit with vita because I hate him. Yeah

2706
03:54:59,940 --> 03:55:06,500
And uh, that's my entire like I I never was like trying to like like boot lick fngr

2707
03:55:06,900 --> 03:55:13,140
Because I I didn't like him, but I I didn't think it was okay to not like him. So I didn't want to start any shit. Yeah

2708
03:55:15,620 --> 03:55:18,260
By the way, I still like don't even know like what's being like

2709
03:55:18,900 --> 03:55:22,740
I guess they came into a call at some point. Like I don't know what the call was

2710
03:55:22,740 --> 03:55:26,660
I don't know like when this was happening or I will explain the entirety of what

2711
03:55:27,380 --> 03:55:31,780
Of what this person tried to explain. I will explain to you in like human terms

2712
03:55:32,340 --> 03:55:38,020
Yeah, one day in the pcp fan chat vita came in and uh, he was acting kind of weird

2713
03:55:38,420 --> 03:55:41,620
And then I was like, oh man, it's vita. What a fucking weird asshole

2714
03:55:41,700 --> 03:55:44,020
And then I called him a weird asshole and told him kill himself

2715
03:55:44,420 --> 03:55:48,580
And then I told sorry, but how he fucked digi's chair and he got all embarrassed

2716
03:55:48,900 --> 03:55:53,540
And and uh, people made fun of him a lot because he was being weird and creepy and an asshole

2717
03:55:54,020 --> 03:55:58,340
Uh, he wasn't he wasn't even being like that like, you know, he wasn't even being that weird

2718
03:55:58,340 --> 03:56:03,940
It was just vita and I hate vita. So I wanted to make fun of that was like a that's understandable to me

2719
03:56:04,020 --> 03:56:07,300
Yeah, I just don't like vita. So I wanted to give him a bad time

2720
03:56:07,540 --> 03:56:11,940
Like I've heard I've heard enough about vita that I don't think he deserves the benefit of the doubt

2721
03:56:12,260 --> 03:56:13,060
Yeah

2722
03:56:13,060 --> 03:56:17,060
And so that happened and then fngr was there too and they they gone to a call by them

2723
03:56:17,220 --> 03:56:20,820
Like in a voice call by themselves like it like they joined the voice channels

2724
03:56:20,820 --> 03:56:24,260
What I'm saying not like a call off on their own they got into the voice channel

2725
03:56:24,420 --> 03:56:28,740
I was going to but I was out of the house and uh, so I just I just told him to kill himself and the

2726
03:56:28,820 --> 03:56:34,100
I think he's gay and then jesse came in and then uh, me and jesse talked about how uh, stupid and uh,

2727
03:56:34,180 --> 03:56:39,460
Faggy uh, vita is and vita got really pissed off and like mad and like uh, like like angry, uh

2728
03:56:40,020 --> 03:56:43,220
Like like angry and started crying like pissing his pants and then he like left

2729
03:56:43,460 --> 03:56:47,860
Or no, he didn't left we banned him and then he tried to make all the counts to come back and spam the pcp chat

2730
03:56:48,100 --> 03:56:53,220
Because quote he said this to one of the mods quote. There's nothing more dangerous than man with nothing left to lose

2731
03:56:55,940 --> 03:56:59,460
But oh my god all of his attempts to come back to the pcb fan chat

2732
03:56:59,460 --> 03:57:02,260
We're in vain because we immediately realized and banned him

2733
03:57:02,580 --> 03:57:04,980
We just immediately banned him. He didn't even have time to spam

2734
03:57:05,460 --> 03:57:12,100
Like like he came back like six or seven times and i'm fairly certain and uh, we just banned him like immediately and he didn't

2735
03:57:12,260 --> 03:57:16,420
He didn't have any of the epic trolling lulls that he wanted to he was completely and utterly defeated

2736
03:57:16,740 --> 03:57:18,740
And nothing he did ever mattered

2737
03:57:18,980 --> 03:57:24,420
So he was just pissing his pants publicly and we always made fun of him for being retarded and it was great

2738
03:57:24,500 --> 03:57:25,860
It was a great time

2739
03:57:25,860 --> 03:57:29,700
Uh, sounds pretty good. Um, should I continue? Yeah, go ahead

2740
03:57:30,020 --> 03:57:35,380
You were in the pfc munchie. You acted like a cringy autistic kick who literally screeched into his mic

2741
03:57:35,700 --> 03:57:42,180
You went full retard and everyone bent over backwards to be cool with you after vita came back

2742
03:57:42,420 --> 03:57:45,380
To say hi and he acted like you were a big deal

2743
03:57:45,700 --> 03:57:50,660
You're a star fucker munchie. I want ben to know if you could ever step over him for something bigger

2744
03:57:51,060 --> 03:57:55,060
You wouldn't a heartbeat so you could be an even bigger toadie munchie

2745
03:57:55,140 --> 03:57:59,380
You're a sniveling groveling two-faced puke once upon a time ago

2746
03:57:59,460 --> 03:58:04,580
You blew your nose and showed it to digi and that's not bubble somehow resembled fan art and you

2747
03:58:05,220 --> 03:58:09,860
Indeered yourself to someone talented. That's why you are where you are. Shit. That was me

2748
03:58:10,340 --> 03:58:13,460
You're been seeing someone else I just I just

2749
03:58:15,060 --> 03:58:18,980
Munchie I I know I know that you'll betray me if I ever give you a chance

2750
03:58:19,140 --> 03:58:24,660
But but you're like that's that's that's just what I would expect like like I wouldn't ever I wouldn't expect anything less of you

2751
03:58:24,900 --> 03:58:29,460
So like I keep you around to keep me on my toes so I don't slip up and get sloppy

2752
03:58:30,180 --> 03:58:34,660
Okay, okay, so so a lot of things a lot of things here first of all go back like well, no not go back

2753
03:58:34,740 --> 03:58:38,980
I'm gonna go back in my brain to the beginning of that clip where he describes a story

2754
03:58:39,060 --> 03:58:45,860
I told on five fractions one where I once went through the pony fuck cast which uh, I don't really remember my interaction with them a lot

2755
03:58:46,180 --> 03:58:51,860
I I do I like I described a story where uh meeting a couple friends went into that chat room

2756
03:58:52,100 --> 03:58:57,780
And described the history of the Byzantine empire to uh them and it was very funny. I thought it was very funny

2757
03:58:58,260 --> 03:59:03,620
uh, that did happen and uh, I'm sure like I was pretty

2758
03:59:04,100 --> 03:59:08,260
Like I I I kind of a dodgy memory. Uh, I'm by the memory of the goldfish

2759
03:59:08,580 --> 03:59:12,500
And I don't truly remember how often I was associated with the pony fuck cast but I know

2760
03:59:12,900 --> 03:59:16,020
Vita added me to cause a lot. I know that for a fact

2761
03:59:16,340 --> 03:59:18,900
So I had a lot answer twice to yeah. Yes

2762
03:59:19,460 --> 03:59:23,380
So I'm sure I had a lot of interaction with them and I'm sure one time I did scream

2763
03:59:23,380 --> 03:59:27,140
I'm sure what I'm a screaming kind of guy. I'm sure I did scream for a while

2764
03:59:27,380 --> 03:59:28,580
I don't doubt that that happened

2765
03:59:28,580 --> 03:59:32,500
But I also don't doubt that my fucking weird Byzantine empire story happened

2766
03:59:32,740 --> 03:59:39,220
So that's not really a gotcha. That's not like there were just two times probably he's saying all these things like they're gotchas like he

2767
03:59:39,380 --> 03:59:43,460
It's like everything he says it's like he thinks he's like really he's really like

2768
03:59:43,940 --> 03:59:49,540
Putting some shit out there and then it's all just like but it's all just like a big star fucker great

2769
03:59:49,620 --> 03:59:56,100
Like he was on to say that like I I'm only friends with digi because I'm I gave him fanner one time and that is completely accurate

2770
03:59:56,580 --> 03:59:59,380
Yeah, that is not I'm not like how like how

2771
03:59:59,940 --> 04:00:06,100
Yeah, like that like I don't know. How do you fucking meet people? How do you fucking meet people fngr? You fuck?

2772
04:00:06,660 --> 04:00:11,780
Yeah, and so like like like we like again, this wasn't to appease me

2773
04:00:11,860 --> 04:00:15,140
We just did that because we are friends and we like to have fun

2774
04:00:16,260 --> 04:00:18,980
It's like he's reading all these like sinister

2775
04:00:19,780 --> 04:00:26,340
Intentions he's reading he's reading all these like weird like Machiavellian power plays into the whole thing that are just not

2776
04:00:27,300 --> 04:00:29,300
I'm a star fucker like like

2777
04:00:30,100 --> 04:00:37,780
If I was a star fucker, I could do a little bit better than been saying don't you think? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you could you could um

2778
04:00:38,900 --> 04:00:43,140
Oh, no, I'm sad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you could go after jeff. Oh man

2779
04:00:43,940 --> 04:00:46,740
Um, that'd be really easy mean jeff got into a good

2780
04:00:47,460 --> 04:00:53,780
On a good fire red calm. We could easily I could easily use jeff for subs that would be incredibly easy

2781
04:00:54,500 --> 04:00:58,900
I you know, I could do for subs. I could not make the Japanese Juggalo ARG

2782
04:00:59,860 --> 04:01:04,260
I could I do not do that. I could make anime videos instead of making the Japanese Juggalo ARG

2783
04:01:04,580 --> 04:01:10,180
But I don't because I'm a weird fucking emotionally stunted freak and I just want to do cool things. Yeah, like

2784
04:01:12,900 --> 04:01:14,900
We're like we're not we're not

2785
04:01:15,300 --> 04:01:19,060
We're all here. We're all here because this is where we belong, you know

2786
04:01:19,700 --> 04:01:25,220
Not because not because we're not here on some like false pretense. Yeah, it's like there's there's

2787
04:01:26,180 --> 04:01:28,180
If we were if we if like if the pcp

2788
04:01:28,980 --> 04:01:31,140
Were a thing that we're just like

2789
04:01:31,940 --> 04:01:36,580
A business. Yeah, if like if we were here to do business and we were here to like promote an agenda

2790
04:01:36,660 --> 04:01:38,820
Like there would be better ways to do that like that's

2791
04:01:39,780 --> 04:01:47,380
You know fngr. He just doesn't fucking get it and why would he you know? Yeah, he just doesn't he just doesn't understand a single fucking thing

2792
04:01:47,460 --> 04:01:54,260
Yeah, continue. No Ben phantom horn. You ever see the movie twins the one where Arnold Schwarzenegger and I love this

2793
04:01:54,580 --> 04:01:55,380
Twin brothers

2794
04:01:55,380 --> 04:01:56,900
There's a line in there

2795
04:01:56,900 --> 04:02:02,660
When they're talking to old Arnold and saying that all the greatness went into him and all this shit that went into his brother

2796
04:02:02,980 --> 04:02:08,420
Afterwards now. This is best guy ever clearly. You know who this is. I'm gonna do this nice and slow

2797
04:02:08,740 --> 04:02:15,060
This is the Arnold in this situation, Ben. You're the shit that got left over the pig lips and assholes

2798
04:02:15,540 --> 04:02:18,500
You're why does he big old batter of hot dog goo?

2799
04:02:19,060 --> 04:02:20,100
Yeah

2800
04:02:20,100 --> 04:02:20,900
Yeah

2801
04:02:20,900 --> 04:02:26,340
The brony gets more views than your nez lock series and that's with you having that's that's not that's not true anymore

2802
04:02:26,340 --> 04:02:28,340
By the way, I've passed him

2803
04:02:29,540 --> 04:02:33,780
I don't know. Well, why is he why is he so why is he so sweet on Nate?

2804
04:02:34,020 --> 04:02:38,660
Yeah, yeah, do like what did like what did Nate do to be what did Nate do for him to be like?

2805
04:02:38,740 --> 04:02:40,260
Wow, this guy's really bad

2806
04:02:40,340 --> 04:02:45,300
But his brother is like the cool guy like this like this like that that guy's cool with me

2807
04:02:45,620 --> 04:02:48,020
And this guy's that's not a one-off thing. He mentioned that again

2808
04:02:48,420 --> 04:02:54,980
How like how like like ben is like this groveling disgusting sack of shit, but like Nate's so cool

2809
04:02:55,540 --> 04:03:03,060
Yeah, what yeah, he shows I believe the kin hearts lecture. Is is that what got you on Nate that video?

2810
04:03:03,860 --> 04:03:05,860
that of all videos

2811
04:03:06,420 --> 04:03:08,180
I mean

2812
04:03:08,260 --> 04:03:10,260
I don't know he's like

2813
04:03:11,060 --> 04:03:14,660
I don't think like I'm sure that Nate doesn't interact with fngr

2814
04:03:14,900 --> 04:03:19,460
I'm sure that Nate thinks that fngr is is retarded just like I do like

2815
04:03:20,580 --> 04:03:24,900
There's no doubt in my mind that like we're completely on the same page about fngr

2816
04:03:25,300 --> 04:03:26,900
And yet here he is

2817
04:03:26,900 --> 04:03:29,220
Being like then why can't you be cool?

2818
04:03:29,780 --> 04:03:35,540
Why can't you be nice and good and and a cool guy like this other guy that thinks I suck ass?

2819
04:03:35,940 --> 04:03:40,580
Yeah, I don't understand and also since we're past the mungy part that had no

2820
04:03:41,700 --> 04:03:43,700
There was no point there

2821
04:03:43,700 --> 04:03:45,700
The point was simply that I was like oh

2822
04:03:46,500 --> 04:03:49,060
It was simply that I was a mongoloid. That was the point

2823
04:03:49,540 --> 04:03:53,780
I mean the point here is simply that I am inferior to Nate. Yeah

2824
04:03:54,340 --> 04:03:55,860
Like there's no

2825
04:03:55,860 --> 04:04:02,020
There's no relation to the ratty fucking cop killers. There's no there's no reason given. Yeah, it's just

2826
04:04:02,820 --> 04:04:09,460
It's just stated as facts. Yeah, and and and and because because I was mean to vita justly

2827
04:04:09,860 --> 04:04:14,500
Therefore, I'm a therefore. I'm a mongoloid and a star fucker. Yeah. Yeah, and and

2828
04:04:15,300 --> 04:04:16,580
Again

2829
04:04:16,580 --> 04:04:18,420
Why make this video?

2830
04:04:18,420 --> 04:04:23,700
You're not making any points of that the friday fuckers fired frack frack frack frack is a bad video

2831
04:04:24,100 --> 04:04:30,660
You're just making a video that we are bad people for like he called rowdy. He called rowdy fuckers cop killers a hit video

2832
04:04:30,660 --> 04:04:36,660
But like a hit video is exactly what this is. This is nothing but that and we and it wasn't a hit video

2833
04:04:36,660 --> 04:04:42,020
It was just us shitting around. Yeah, like it wasn't even mostly about that. Yeah

2834
04:04:42,900 --> 04:04:44,900
Um, all right. Okay continue

2835
04:04:44,900 --> 04:04:49,780
One thousand subs than me. I'm told that you're pissed that tune critic is making more money than yourself

2836
04:04:49,940 --> 04:04:52,980
Well, Ben, he's not even before he makes his streaming money

2837
04:04:53,380 --> 04:04:56,900
You seem to poke fun at the burning donut who unlike yourself

2838
04:04:57,140 --> 04:05:01,620
Went to be homeless then got a job and pulled himself up by his bootstrap

2839
04:05:01,860 --> 04:05:03,940
A man who holds you innate in a high regard

2840
04:05:04,180 --> 04:05:10,020
But then you turned around and act like a cunt to the man in front of your little mongoloid friend here with 700 subs

2841
04:05:10,420 --> 04:05:15,700
I tried to have a word. I'm really upset. You asked off to me 700 subs. So let me give you a reality

2842
04:05:16,740 --> 04:05:19,700
First first of all, how is your sub count relevant? Second of all?

2843
04:05:20,580 --> 04:05:23,860
I'm second. I mean, you know, I'm sorry if burning donut thinks I'm cool

2844
04:05:24,260 --> 04:05:29,620
Whatever the I don't I don't like his art and his fucking patreon was an embarrassment. So what what the fucking up?

2845
04:05:29,620 --> 04:05:30,820
What am I supposed to say?

2846
04:05:30,820 --> 04:05:37,380
Uh, and and and wearing a homing became don't a dirty and homely fucking burning donut became homeless

2847
04:05:37,860 --> 04:05:43,460
I'm pulled by his bootstraps. Oh, Ben. How's your living situation? How's that going out? How's that working out for you?

2848
04:05:43,860 --> 04:05:50,260
How's the majority of your of your fucking life? How's that? How's that? How's your leftover eating situation? How's that?

2849
04:05:50,900 --> 04:05:52,900
Um, it's it's on the upswing

2850
04:05:54,660 --> 04:05:56,660
I mean, uh

2851
04:05:57,140 --> 04:06:02,340
Well, I never I never was homeless, you know, I'll give him that much. It never was never was fully homeless

2852
04:06:02,660 --> 04:06:06,980
Uh, so, you know, lucky me. Don't see what that has to do with my fucking

2853
04:06:07,780 --> 04:06:13,220
criticisms of the way burning donut chooses to run his fucking art pr campaign

2854
04:06:13,540 --> 04:06:18,580
Don't really see the relevant there. Sorry. He was homeless wouldn't have wished that on him doesn't really make

2855
04:06:19,460 --> 04:06:21,300
Yeah

2856
04:06:21,300 --> 04:06:25,300
Hate him. What else did he say? They're like there was more going on there. Uh, uh, uh

2857
04:06:26,100 --> 04:06:27,940
Hot dog goo

2858
04:06:27,940 --> 04:06:33,700
It was just more like weirdly specific insults that no one cares about and aren't effective whatsoever

2859
04:06:33,940 --> 04:06:40,820
Him saying like him saying like I have more subs, but for no good reason gets more views

2860
04:06:40,900 --> 04:06:42,900
Which is like it's not even true. I looked

2861
04:06:43,540 --> 04:06:50,500
So something about like some kind of point about how my audience isn't as engaged as his which like sorry. Are you the police?

2862
04:06:50,980 --> 04:06:52,340
Yeah, um

2863
04:06:52,340 --> 04:06:54,340
Munchy you have 700 subs

2864
04:06:54,820 --> 04:06:57,460
You suck. Yes, which I don't even like I don't

2865
04:06:58,260 --> 04:07:01,540
Make youtube videos as a profession. That's not what I'm about

2866
04:07:01,940 --> 04:07:04,100
This will come up again. This will come up again

2867
04:07:04,180 --> 04:07:09,700
But fngr is like is fixated on sub counts and view counts as a measure of a person's worth

2868
04:07:09,940 --> 04:07:14,260
Yeah, like yeah, he throws that out there a bunch as opposed to patreon money

2869
04:07:14,260 --> 04:07:20,100
Which is more because it shows how much people like your stuff. Yeah, I mean, it's not like exactly

2870
04:07:20,820 --> 04:07:26,820
Yeah, it's yeah, yeah, but like it's definitely more of one than like a sub count. I mean look at sigh for example

2871
04:07:26,820 --> 04:07:28,020
Yeah, exactly

2872
04:07:28,020 --> 04:07:33,140
Look inside your big revelation of leaving pony was to become a pokey tuber

2873
04:07:33,700 --> 04:07:37,220
Fresh and original benny, you know because brony is dying benny

2874
04:07:37,460 --> 04:07:43,620
You lift mlp to get about half the views that tbb ap used to make not just that but

2875
04:07:44,340 --> 04:07:45,220
I mean

2876
04:07:45,220 --> 04:07:48,340
Does it even need saying that he just doesn't know what he's talking about?

2877
04:07:48,500 --> 04:07:54,340
Yeah, like he just obviously just does not understand like he thinks that people can only exist on youtube

2878
04:07:54,420 --> 04:07:56,580
And there's nothing else one could possibly do

2879
04:07:57,300 --> 04:08:05,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah like like the thing the things off the things off youtube are not even like entering into this dialogue for him

2880
04:08:05,220 --> 04:08:11,220
Like they're not relevant. They just don't even exist in his mind. Yeah. Does he even know

2881
04:08:12,340 --> 04:08:14,740
That you have made a comic before does he know that?

2882
04:08:15,540 --> 04:08:17,620
Who knows? Who knows?

2883
04:08:18,660 --> 04:08:24,980
Like there are creative aspirations outside of youtube. I'm sorry if that's a news flash to you

2884
04:08:25,620 --> 04:08:29,780
But there are there are things you can do outside of making youtube videos

2885
04:08:30,820 --> 04:08:32,580
well

2886
04:08:32,580 --> 04:08:34,180
God

2887
04:08:34,180 --> 04:08:41,780
It's really frustrating. It's really frustrating because he just it's like it's like trying to like explain don't touch a stove to a child

2888
04:08:42,420 --> 04:08:46,100
Yeah, they don't understand but why though. Yeah, well

2889
04:08:47,060 --> 04:08:50,500
It'll you'll try it and you'll see and then he tries it, but he still doesn't get it

2890
04:08:53,060 --> 04:08:57,700
And the way he calls you bunny benny is the most disgusting. Benny is creepy. It's creepy

2891
04:08:57,860 --> 04:09:01,140
It's super creepy gross and like he's trying to be like

2892
04:09:01,700 --> 04:09:05,220
He's trying to be like demeaning about it and it's like just makes me

2893
04:09:05,940 --> 04:09:08,980
Sweat just make it just makes me feel feel dirty

2894
04:09:10,260 --> 04:09:16,260
Like he's it's so it's so gross. He's like such a gross disgusting person. He's

2895
04:09:17,060 --> 04:09:24,500
Really like offensively just unpleasant. Ben. This is proto mario. He has 500k subs entertaining guy

2896
04:09:24,820 --> 04:09:29,540
Poketuber his average views today are 10k. That's two percent benny

2897
04:09:29,780 --> 04:09:32,500
Which is okay for milk, but not so much for youtube

2898
04:09:32,820 --> 04:09:41,140
That's your big breakaway benny going from mlp to pokemon with your staggering dead dry boring thumbnails those numbers

2899
04:09:42,180 --> 04:09:44,340
What's what's he what's what's wrong with my thumbnails?

2900
04:09:45,060 --> 04:09:52,900
What yeah, they're clear and concise and convey what the video is like look at fucking look at this guy's thumbnails

2901
04:09:53,620 --> 04:09:58,900
His these views are his thumbnails are a fucking nightmare. They are in yeah, they can't even read them

2902
04:09:59,220 --> 04:10:00,260
You can't read them

2903
04:10:00,260 --> 04:10:05,780
They just have like a bunch of photographs and like drawing like it's too small to even read like it doesn't even read

2904
04:10:06,020 --> 04:10:08,340
My fucking thumbnails are designed to read well

2905
04:10:09,300 --> 04:10:16,900
This guy doesn't know and and and not only fucking that but the shit he said before that where it was like it was like

2906
04:10:17,860 --> 04:10:23,060
Can we just replay it can you just go back like a little bit so I can just fucking see that again the proto mario bit

2907
04:10:23,140 --> 04:10:26,420
Yeah, yeah the other proto. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just like just like

2908
04:10:27,220 --> 04:10:31,060
The fact that he again again. He just does not understand views

2909
04:10:32,420 --> 04:10:36,820
He just doesn't understand that that's not what you do tvb ap used to make

2910
04:10:37,220 --> 04:10:42,980
Not just that but see this ben. This is proto mario. He has 500k subs entertaining guy

2911
04:10:43,300 --> 04:10:48,020
Poketuber his average views today are 10k. That's two percent benny

2912
04:10:48,260 --> 04:10:54,980
Which is okay for milk, but not so much for youtube. That's your big breakaway benny. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay first of all

2913
04:10:55,860 --> 04:10:59,940
He makes it seem like leading t-bep and going to pokemon

2914
04:11:00,420 --> 04:11:02,740
Well, okay first of all, that's not even what happened

2915
04:11:02,980 --> 04:11:08,340
But even if that word to have been what happened like like that's what that's what that's what happened in his mind

2916
04:11:08,580 --> 04:11:10,580
Yeah, that's not

2917
04:11:10,660 --> 04:11:14,020
That's just not what it is on any level on any level

2918
04:11:17,700 --> 04:11:19,700
Hey, you there

2919
04:11:21,460 --> 04:11:25,380
You thought that that was a good business decision because as previously stated that's not what you

2920
04:11:26,020 --> 04:11:28,260
And even if it was strictly for money

2921
04:11:28,820 --> 04:11:33,620
It wasn't it wasn't for money. You didn't do that for money. It's just because you wanted to do it

2922
04:11:34,020 --> 04:11:37,220
It wasn't it would have been smarter to say with pony. Yeah

2923
04:11:37,940 --> 04:11:39,540
No one doubts that

2924
04:11:39,540 --> 04:11:41,300
Yeah, um

2925
04:11:41,300 --> 04:11:42,740
and I mean it's just

2926
04:11:42,740 --> 04:11:47,300
I don't I don't even I really don't even know what to say about it. Like it's just so missed. I mean

2927
04:11:48,100 --> 04:11:49,380
I mean, I don't

2928
04:11:49,380 --> 04:11:51,380
I don't know what

2929
04:11:52,340 --> 04:11:54,020
Like yeah, like

2930
04:11:54,020 --> 04:11:55,380
but like

2931
04:11:55,380 --> 04:11:58,100
Here's the thing like he's he's he's saying all this like, you know

2932
04:11:58,100 --> 04:12:02,660
Oh, like I've clearly fucked up like I've clearly fucked up so much and like

2933
04:12:03,380 --> 04:12:05,460
And like oh, I made such a terrible decision

2934
04:12:05,460 --> 04:12:12,180
But like it worked out for me and like I fucking make more on patreon now than I ever have and like my fucking

2935
04:12:12,820 --> 04:12:16,100
Shit has like like shit has gotten better for me and like

2936
04:12:16,660 --> 04:12:22,580
I consider everything I've done to like like I see it as like like I've really succeeded at what I set out to do

2937
04:12:22,820 --> 04:12:25,540
Like I've really made good progress towards what I wanted to do

2938
04:12:25,860 --> 04:12:29,860
And like the fact that he just like frames it all as the exact opposite of that

2939
04:12:30,260 --> 04:12:33,060
Just just what am I even supposed to say to that?

2940
04:12:33,540 --> 04:12:38,340
Just like no, I I just wrong wrong and act like incorrect

2941
04:12:38,980 --> 04:12:41,300
Wrong like wrong by any metric. Yeah

2942
04:12:41,940 --> 04:12:45,380
And like just told just there's there's not even like a basis

2943
04:12:45,460 --> 04:12:52,420
There's not even a basis for me to critique that on because it doesn't even get like the basic assumptions of reality, right? Yeah

2944
04:12:53,460 --> 04:12:55,460
Holy shit

2945
04:12:55,780 --> 04:12:57,780
Should I continue? Yeah

2946
04:12:57,940 --> 04:13:01,940
Going from MLP to pokemon with your staggering dead drive

2947
04:13:02,020 --> 04:13:07,620
Go ahead and start those numbers did not work here here like move back. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Um

2948
04:13:09,700 --> 04:13:11,700
Here

2949
04:13:11,860 --> 04:13:13,860
Are you on the thumbnail?

2950
04:13:13,860 --> 04:13:16,660
Hold on one fucking second here

2951
04:13:19,140 --> 04:13:25,620
Yeah, here I'll reset I'll refresh the pages weird that this keeps happening. Yeah, I guess it wasn't designed to be paused that often

2952
04:13:28,740 --> 04:13:33,780
Funny like I think it's explicitly designed to be paused like I thought that was like the point of this

2953
04:13:34,260 --> 04:13:39,620
Yeah, but you're like like move the cursor a little bit like like like like move it back and forth a little bit

2954
04:13:42,100 --> 04:13:46,980
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he was strictly coming from you hanging on to everyone else's coattails

2955
04:13:47,220 --> 04:13:49,220
So the next time

2956
04:13:50,580 --> 04:13:57,220
That's your big breakaway, bennie going from MLP to pokemon with your staggering dead drive boring

2957
04:13:57,300 --> 04:14:02,660
Thumbnails those numbers strictly coming from you hanging on to everyone else's coattails

2958
04:14:02,900 --> 04:14:05,300
So the next time you look at my videos and go boring

2959
04:14:05,300 --> 04:14:11,620
I challenge you to show me your retention to your shitty videos and I bet mine beat the fuck out of yours

2960
04:14:11,940 --> 04:14:16,820
By the way, bennie, they don't asking off was the original reason why I turned off the PCP podcast

2961
04:14:16,980 --> 04:14:22,340
Nate was working really hard trying to put the show over and then you were there acting like a faggot in the background

2962
04:14:22,580 --> 04:14:25,940
See this toilet paper roll. This is your fucking legacy, benn

2963
04:14:26,180 --> 04:14:31,140
It's not that I'm not grateful for you giving me a chance when you did bennie, but I ain't nobody's punching bag

2964
04:14:31,620 --> 04:14:38,100
Thank you. Fuck you. Bye. Dear lily pete another. I never said anything bad about fngr

2965
04:14:38,580 --> 04:14:42,580
Yeah, that rowdy fuckers cop killers. I have no idea what he's talking about

2966
04:14:43,540 --> 04:14:45,540
Yeah, and again just to reiterate

2967
04:14:46,580 --> 04:14:51,620
We he's not addressing the video. He just does not say what's wrong with the video

2968
04:14:52,340 --> 04:14:58,740
No, wouldn't that make more sense to describe what he has a problem with instead of like he he he's like

2969
04:14:59,220 --> 04:15:02,580
He's like describing that we are bad without describing why we're bad

2970
04:15:03,220 --> 04:15:04,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2971
04:15:04,660 --> 04:15:07,140
Um, or like what we did to make him think this

2972
04:15:09,620 --> 04:15:11,620
He he described like

2973
04:15:11,940 --> 04:15:15,380
The only thing that's like slightly like that is how he described that I was like mean to vita

2974
04:15:15,380 --> 04:15:17,940
That's the only that's like the only like reason you could give for like no

2975
04:15:17,940 --> 04:15:22,820
No, no, no, yeah, yeah, but that wasn't that wasn't even in the video, but at least it was something

2976
04:15:23,540 --> 04:15:30,020
At least it was something me. It's just he just like it comes off like he's just dragging me up to try and like prove

2977
04:15:30,180 --> 04:15:34,420
That I have failed at something and like that's the point in and of itself

2978
04:15:35,300 --> 04:15:40,980
When it's not like I don't know what the point is why now if he's always felt this then why now

2979
04:15:41,780 --> 04:15:43,780
I mean the only thing I can think of

2980
04:15:43,860 --> 04:15:45,460
Is that he's mad

2981
04:15:45,460 --> 04:15:48,580
At me about the fact that I like told him to fuck off on twitter

2982
04:15:49,060 --> 04:15:53,380
But like then what was he asking me about on twitter in the first place, you know

2983
04:15:56,020 --> 04:16:01,620
Again indescribable he I do not understand this video. It makes no sense

2984
04:16:03,220 --> 04:16:04,100
and

2985
04:16:04,100 --> 04:16:09,620
Fucking fucking uh talking about talking about how I've like how I'm like writing people's coattails

2986
04:16:09,620 --> 04:16:13,380
Like it's not like my fucking nuzlocke's got like crazy promoted or anything

2987
04:16:13,620 --> 04:16:19,780
Yeah, like like Nate would retweet them once in a while like when I treat it because he was a big fucking fan of them and love them

2988
04:16:20,500 --> 04:16:25,700
Uh, I don't know man. Like what I don't even know what I don't even know how to answer some of these things

2989
04:16:25,940 --> 04:16:31,540
Because there are these it's like asking like like it's asking you to explain something that you didn't do

2990
04:16:32,260 --> 04:16:37,300
Yeah, like so what am I supposed to say? I just wrong. That was that was not a correct question

2991
04:16:37,460 --> 04:16:41,460
Like your accusation is simply untrue and I have no other response. Yeah

2992
04:16:42,660 --> 04:16:45,780
Um, I like you're just misinformed sir

2993
04:16:46,420 --> 04:16:49,060
I this might be the end of the video about us, but I'm pretty sure that was more

2994
04:16:49,380 --> 04:16:55,380
I thought that was more about how I'm like not like I like I like I am just like writing the coattails of digi

2995
04:16:55,940 --> 04:16:57,540
I know I think

2996
04:16:57,540 --> 04:16:59,780
I think I think we got to that part

2997
04:17:00,580 --> 04:17:02,100
First skipping ahead to like the very end

2998
04:17:02,740 --> 04:17:04,740
I am I'm skipping around

2999
04:17:05,060 --> 04:17:07,060
Skipping through a bunch of lily Pete stuff

3000
04:17:07,620 --> 04:17:10,500
wanting to puke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right

3001
04:17:11,620 --> 04:17:16,260
Weird I could have sworn there was more but uh, yeah, I guess I was just something

3002
04:17:16,740 --> 04:17:21,540
There's some cartoon thing at the end. Like I don't know what yeah, there's some like weird like animation

3003
04:17:21,540 --> 04:17:25,940
I guess but it like doesn't yeah, I'm pretty sure it's not relevant to us at all. Yeah

3004
04:17:26,260 --> 04:17:27,300
Yeah

3005
04:17:27,300 --> 04:17:29,300
Well, that was

3006
04:17:30,100 --> 04:17:35,940
That was yeah, that was that was fngrs. That was fngrs big takedown of us where he like

3007
04:17:36,500 --> 04:17:39,860
Really fucking put us through the ringer and like put us in our place

3008
04:17:40,340 --> 04:17:47,620
He threw us some fucking nostalgia critic tier like like insults that we've all heard a thousand fucking times by now

3009
04:17:47,780 --> 04:17:50,420
And then I have no weight or gravitas whatsoever

3010
04:17:50,660 --> 04:17:57,380
He threw those at us with no context as to why just for the sake of it, I guess just for the mere sake of it

3011
04:17:59,300 --> 04:18:04,420
I'll never understand like I don't like I'm sure that if I asked him I'm sure that if I asked him like

3012
04:18:05,380 --> 04:18:06,980
Tony

3013
04:18:06,980 --> 04:18:12,660
Why were you so mad? What did I do? Like I'm sure that I wouldn't get an answer. Yeah

3014
04:18:13,460 --> 04:18:14,580
Yeah

3015
04:18:14,580 --> 04:18:18,180
Because what because what what did we do? What could it possibly be?

3016
04:18:18,420 --> 04:18:22,980
I I can't even I can't even imagine what he could be mad about because I don't understand him

3017
04:18:23,380 --> 04:18:28,980
I mean for you it seems like he's mad at you because vita has some kind of beef with you

3018
04:18:29,140 --> 04:18:31,700
So like but for me, it's saying weird

3019
04:18:32,900 --> 04:18:34,900
Dispusting human

3020
04:18:35,460 --> 04:18:37,460
Jesus

3021
04:18:37,460 --> 04:18:38,900
um

3022
04:18:38,980 --> 04:18:40,820
The I mean the last thing

3023
04:18:40,820 --> 04:18:46,100
The last thing is like there was this other thing that this this some other twitter guy did some guy with like 100 subs

3024
04:18:46,420 --> 04:18:48,420
He did like a response to misanthropony

3025
04:18:49,220 --> 04:18:51,220
I don't know if you wanted to watch that but he was actually

3026
04:18:51,700 --> 04:18:56,660
I actually liked his I thought he like he's kind of like a weird nerd or whatever

3027
04:18:56,660 --> 04:19:00,020
He's kind of goofy and like stupid but like I thought he made some good

3028
04:19:00,500 --> 04:19:06,660
Shit and I appreciate like even if he's just even just the token effort even just the token even just the fact that someone

3029
04:19:06,900 --> 04:19:11,380
That someone else was willing to be like this video makes no sense and is retarded

3030
04:19:12,020 --> 04:19:14,020
And uh, you know, it's just nice

3031
04:19:14,260 --> 04:19:19,860
It's nice to hear it from an outsider. It's merely just trying to bring reason to do a space or reason

3032
04:19:19,940 --> 04:19:23,940
Yeah, yeah, I appreciate I appreciate like this wasn't even like a fan of mine

3033
04:19:23,940 --> 04:19:28,020
This was just a guy who saw that video didn't know anything about me

3034
04:19:28,660 --> 04:19:34,580
And then was like but wait, here's why this is wrong. Yeah, that's incredible. Yeah, I want to see this

3035
04:19:34,900 --> 04:19:40,660
Yeah, did you have you seen this before? No, I haven't. Oh, it's so this is youtuber named misanthropony

3036
04:19:41,380 --> 04:19:46,420
He does all sorts of pony related content and from what I've seen it's

3037
04:19:49,460 --> 04:19:52,260
I mean his content is okay, I guess

3038
04:19:53,700 --> 04:19:59,220
But at the same time I would be lying if I said it left any kind of impact on me

3039
04:20:00,180 --> 04:20:05,700
But anyway, recently he did a response this group of people they call themselves the procrastinators or something

3040
04:20:06,580 --> 04:20:11,620
Basically, they were skeptical of a situation keyframe found herself in a few years back

3041
04:20:12,660 --> 04:20:14,660
Now I'm gonna get something out of the way

3042
04:20:15,220 --> 04:20:18,820
I have expressed this taste in keyframes content

3043
04:20:19,860 --> 04:20:23,700
Particularly the one review I saw her do with golden fox

3044
04:20:23,940 --> 04:20:29,620
However, I am willing to let that slide in the face of more serious issues

3045
04:20:30,500 --> 04:20:34,580
Basically a few years ago keyframe had to go fund me. I believe

3046
04:20:35,380 --> 04:20:37,540
Started because she was in an abusive household

3047
04:20:38,980 --> 04:20:40,980
Ben saint from

3048
04:20:42,020 --> 04:20:43,540
Procrastinators

3049
04:20:43,540 --> 04:20:50,020
Said in a recent video that he denied this and felt it was an attempt for keyframe to get fame via dr. Wolff

3050
04:20:50,580 --> 04:20:55,860
Wolf now I never denied that's not quite what I said, but whatever

3051
04:20:56,980 --> 04:20:58,980
however

3052
04:20:58,980 --> 04:21:04,020
The best argument against something is a bad one for it misanthropony

3053
04:21:04,900 --> 04:21:10,180
At least that's what I would say if misanthropony actually offered up an argument

3054
04:21:11,220 --> 04:21:19,220
By a timely point is about 12 minutes into a 20 minute video. So already the majority of the video is done

3055
04:21:20,340 --> 04:21:21,620
However

3056
04:21:21,620 --> 04:21:26,180
misanthropony doesn't really even debunk ben saint's idea

3057
04:21:27,460 --> 04:21:29,460
Instead he just sort of

3058
04:21:30,420 --> 04:21:35,380
Complains that he had the idea to begin with instead of debunking. Yeah

3059
04:21:35,940 --> 04:21:39,620
He then talks about how hard it is for him to think back about it

3060
04:21:39,860 --> 04:21:44,820
Not ignore the fact that someone was actually abused. It was hard for him to think about fact here

3061
04:21:45,540 --> 04:21:47,540
I am going to create a very scientific

3062
04:21:48,260 --> 04:21:54,260
Yeah, I like it on this whiteboard based off f from jozine. Um, you see this is this is a circle

3063
04:21:55,700 --> 04:21:58,900
This is how important it was that she was being abused or whatever

3064
04:21:59,300 --> 04:22:05,380
This is how important it was that it made the santhropony uncomfortable. It all was this. Yeah, I fucking like this guy

3065
04:22:05,860 --> 04:22:07,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah

3066
04:22:07,380 --> 04:22:11,700
Seriously, he said he had a hard time thinking about it. Really

3067
04:22:12,660 --> 04:22:14,660
Really

3068
04:22:15,300 --> 04:22:22,020
That is actually what he said go to the video. It's in the description if you don't believe me. That is literally what he said

3069
04:22:23,540 --> 04:22:28,900
Yeah, now I will give misanthropony the benefit of the doubt and assume that was just bad wording

3070
04:22:30,100 --> 04:22:32,100
but

3071
04:22:32,340 --> 04:22:38,500
That doesn't escape the fact that it was still at best bad wording at best

3072
04:22:38,820 --> 04:22:40,820
Yeah

3073
04:22:40,820 --> 04:22:45,300
He mentions doesn't excuse it frame. No, no doesn't prove anything

3074
04:22:46,100 --> 04:22:49,060
Anecdotes aren't real evidence misanthropony

3075
04:22:49,940 --> 04:22:55,300
For that matter. He claims he has all this evidence and you want to know how much of it he shows in the video

3076
04:22:56,820 --> 04:22:58,820
Zero

3077
04:22:59,940 --> 04:23:01,860
Not a bit

3078
04:23:02,020 --> 04:23:04,580
He just assumes that I should know you have evidence

3079
04:23:05,540 --> 04:23:07,540
and actually having evidence

3080
04:23:08,580 --> 04:23:11,940
Are two very very different things

3081
04:23:13,380 --> 04:23:19,300
And considering how there were people who were around that didn't see the proof such as shelly d for instance

3082
04:23:20,020 --> 04:23:25,860
Should at least bring up the fact that you need to show proof at the very very least

3083
04:23:26,900 --> 04:23:28,900
He then goes on to spout

3084
04:23:30,500 --> 04:23:32,500
Fake humbleness

3085
04:23:33,140 --> 04:23:34,660
Guys

3086
04:23:34,660 --> 04:23:37,860
He's talking about bad guy. Yeah, oh

3087
04:23:41,220 --> 04:23:43,460
The status quo is always right and I've accept that

3088
04:23:44,340 --> 04:23:45,940
people

3089
04:23:45,940 --> 04:23:47,940
Who have told me that they're right

3090
04:23:48,260 --> 04:23:50,020
are right

3091
04:23:50,020 --> 04:23:54,580
You know, this guy's fucking red pills fuck. You have a reasonable trusted humanity

3092
04:23:55,140 --> 04:24:00,980
And video like a little shit with misanthropony threatening physical violence

3093
04:24:01,940 --> 04:24:03,940
Upon ben saint. Yeah

3094
04:24:04,740 --> 04:24:07,460
Right, it's to kick ben saint in the balls

3095
04:24:08,500 --> 04:24:10,500
That's what it comes down to

3096
04:24:10,820 --> 04:24:13,060
Uh misanthropony. I don't think you understand this

3097
04:24:14,340 --> 04:24:16,340
But assault is illegal

3098
04:24:16,340 --> 04:24:18,980
Okay, we got everyone got that down

3099
04:24:20,740 --> 04:24:24,500
And even I at my most hyperbolic don't condone assault

3100
04:24:25,700 --> 04:24:27,700
Because it's illegal

3101
04:24:27,780 --> 04:24:33,860
And should be illegal before anyone brings up my position on drug war assault should remain illegal. Okay

3102
04:24:35,700 --> 04:24:40,980
For that matter, this isn't even a time where I'd be willing to say yes, their words

3103
04:24:41,540 --> 04:24:47,540
Count for violence. This isn't like ben saint was saying I'm going to commit violence against you

3104
04:24:48,900 --> 04:24:50,900
No, you know what he just said

3105
04:24:52,020 --> 04:24:56,740
I'm kind of skeptical about this one situation involving keyframe

3106
04:24:57,620 --> 04:24:59,620
That's it

3107
04:25:00,180 --> 04:25:06,980
And it's just it's just good that it's good that like someone who doesn't know the situation can like come away with the correct impression

3108
04:25:07,060 --> 04:25:11,540
Like in spite of in spite of misanthropony trying to like confuse it as best you can

3109
04:25:12,980 --> 04:25:14,580
Yeah

3110
04:25:14,580 --> 04:25:16,580
That's what this is

3111
04:25:17,220 --> 04:25:21,860
For that matter you guys remember what I said about emotional manipulation

3112
04:25:23,060 --> 04:25:25,060
Because people like misanthropony

3113
04:25:25,620 --> 04:25:28,180
Are that ideology taken to an extreme?

3114
04:25:30,020 --> 04:25:32,020
You are wrong

3115
04:25:32,020 --> 04:25:38,180
Because I feel like you are wrong and people are telling me that you are wrong. Therefore you are wrong

3116
04:25:39,140 --> 04:25:41,140
And when I ask him

3117
04:25:41,460 --> 04:25:43,220
When anyone asked him

3118
04:25:43,220 --> 04:25:45,220
Why is he wrong?

3119
04:25:45,220 --> 04:25:47,700
misanthropony does not have an answer

3120
04:25:48,740 --> 04:25:53,300
He just wants to drum up sympathy and he wants to make it so

3121
04:25:53,620 --> 04:25:56,900
Oh, you'll feel horrible if you think you're wrong

3122
04:25:57,620 --> 04:25:59,620
You'll feel horrible if you think I'm wrong

3123
04:26:00,420 --> 04:26:06,180
When if his arguments were solid, he'd just have to say here's the proof as to why you're wrong

3124
04:26:06,740 --> 04:26:09,940
Now shut up. He didn't do that. He didn't show any proof

3125
04:26:10,500 --> 04:26:13,380
He just sort of said this was a delicate issue

3126
04:26:16,420 --> 04:26:20,820
And then they will preside any fucking reason this shouldn't have convinced anyone

3127
04:26:21,140 --> 04:26:23,140
I'd love I'd love to see something

3128
04:26:23,860 --> 04:26:28,820
Like I'd love to have come away from that with like a real idea of like exactly what happened

3129
04:26:29,220 --> 04:26:31,940
So I could have responded to it in a reasonable way

3130
04:26:33,780 --> 04:26:40,820
All right, and everyone go subscribe to that guy. Yeah, go subscribe to f from jozine linked. He's a pretty cool guy

3131
04:26:41,300 --> 04:26:43,300
Yeah, yeah, I like him

3132
04:26:44,260 --> 04:26:49,940
Maybe he should be I wonder I think I think he does I don't think he's just like a pony guy

3133
04:26:50,100 --> 04:26:53,060
I'm pretty sure he just like talks about whatever

3134
04:26:53,540 --> 04:26:58,900
The only advice you could possibly give was I'm not on the realm to give advice because it's not like I'm like teaching him anything

3135
04:26:58,900 --> 04:27:03,060
But I would just say you don't need to always be on camera and that's pretty much it

3136
04:27:03,780 --> 04:27:05,780
Yeah more more concise, I guess

3137
04:27:06,420 --> 04:27:10,020
But uh, I don't know. I think I think I think he's got I think yeah

3138
04:27:10,500 --> 04:27:14,740
Um, I mean, I know I'm biased because he's like agreeing with me and like defending me

3139
04:27:14,900 --> 04:27:19,300
But like I thought yeah, but I thought he made his points pretty I thought he made his points pretty reasonably

3140
04:27:19,860 --> 04:27:24,260
Yeah, we're the people who are like thinking cognitively

3141
04:27:25,300 --> 04:27:32,180
Cognizant we heard the old who are cognizant at all. It's good. It's good when some cognition can can occur and like be evident

3142
04:27:33,140 --> 04:27:40,020
Uh, that's not always the case. No as we've seen as we've seen today here on frog fractions, too

3143
04:27:41,860 --> 04:27:48,100
Feels so good. Now, why don't we finish frog fractions, too? And you know that guys this has been too

3144
04:27:48,340 --> 04:27:53,940
This has been t-bap. This has been this has been t-bap. Um, two best brothers frog fractions, too

3145
04:27:54,420 --> 04:27:57,940
Yeah, right if I could stop killers. I hope you enjoyed

3146
04:27:58,420 --> 04:28:05,380
Uh, this and we'll see you next week. I forget. I forget what you said. I'll see you next time with frog fra- with rowdy fuckers cop killers

3147
04:28:06,740 --> 04:28:11,460
Seven frog fractions episode two frog fractions two part two

3148
04:28:12,020 --> 04:28:18,820
Exactly. All right. Yes. Bye. Bye. Later. Later gator. Yeah later investigator

3149
04:28:19,380 --> 04:28:25,300
I hope you enjoyed. Oh, fuck you vita and also fngr and miss fngr. Fuck you miss anthroponi

3150
04:28:25,380 --> 04:28:28,260
Oh, oh, wait, you forgot to mention, uh, your your friend dying

3151
04:28:29,380 --> 04:28:37,300
Oh, yeah before yeah, yeah, um, I finally blocked fngr because my friend died and I tweeted about it that I was like sad and like

3152
04:28:38,020 --> 04:28:40,020
You know, it's sad that someone died

3155
04:28:47,780 --> 04:28:52,580

3156
04:28:52,900 --> 04:28:54,900
