00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,280
the best guy ever, and let's see what we've got going on here. Rubstands together greedily.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:27,960
We've got Ben Saint. Fresh off his philandering and other podcast territory. And we've got

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,960
Tom Oliver.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,920
There's some reason today I feel more financially solvent. I can't imagine why. Maybe you guys

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,840
have to figure that out, yeah.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,880
Doesn't solvent mean to have fluidity of one's way?

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,600
What do you mean?

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,080
I thought financially solvent meant you were just more financially stable. You had more

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,200
income, or your finances were in order.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Apparently, I just googled it. Financial solvency means that an individual can pay all bills

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
on time with cash to spare.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,200
You mean because there's only three of us?

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Exactly.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Oh, of course.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
That's very true.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,440
And I gotta let everybody know. We're up to a great start, because even if your stray

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,160
layabout, lazy-ass PCP member rolls on in, they've already incurred a hefty penalty on

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,360
their income. And that goes straight into our bank account, baby. So I could not be happier

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
about it.

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,080
I'm making hefty fees. So, not actually. But so you guys know, and I have to announce

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:39,120
this, I legendarily found the podcast and was on the Pizza Party podcast. I've been

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,160
there. I've seen it with my own two eyes.

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
I'm stressed.

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,640
Frankly, I think you're talking mad shit. I still don't, but I've never seen it with

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
my own eyes.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
Go check out Rebel Taxi in the latest episode of the Pizza Party podcast.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
That makes sense when you think about it. If the podcast takes place in a taxi, it's

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,560
constantly moving, how would we ever be able to find that?

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Me and the boy, Cheesy Manfredo.

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Fair.

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Fucking around.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,440
Well, frankly speaking, I mean, with the dimensional merge so well underway, is it surprising that

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,880
a fictional podcast would suddenly become all too real?

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,960
Like I said in this very chat, the night that Ben announced it, this is the most convincing

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,840
evidence for the dimensional merge I have seen so far.

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Indeed.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,920
I don't know. There's lots, I mean, there's lots of great evidence.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Well, I must tell you this, Chris.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He's not a custorian like you, so from my peasant eyes.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There's no shortage of evidence.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was going to ask, I don't know, I thought I'd wait until now. I'm very curious as to

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,360
know how it is, not only that you discover the podcast, but we're then also on it, because

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,440
that, I mean, surely that's more than just a simple operation.

46
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,120
Well, I think Cheesy got on it, and I think maybe they told him like he could invite someone

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
else.

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
The lowly Cheesy Manfredo.

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,520
I don't really know exactly what the discussion was like.

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,320
I just know that he came to you and was like, hey, Ben, I got a spot on the Pizza Party

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,440
podcast and you can be on too if you want, and I was like.

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
So it was his initiative.

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Yeah.

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
I see.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
I see.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Yeah.

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
I was just along for the ride.

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,240
Do you have any idea what Cheesy's credentials or in what way he got on?

59
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I just don't.

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
I didn't think he was much of a...

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,080
Well, I know that he bought like an ad on a previous episode, like he paid for a plug

62
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,120
for Bongo and Luna, and I'm not sure if maybe he just levied.

63
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,040
I think he, I don't know where, how it moved to.

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Okay.

65
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,360
Funny story, it seemed like they thought that I was going to be like promoting my Kickstarter,

66
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,640
which like they delayed for two weeks.

67
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,040
So I was supposed to go on two weeks earlier, but for like two weeks, they were like, no,

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,240
we're not doing it.

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,240
So by the time we finally did it, the Kickstarter was ending that day.

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,720
So then I got into the call and I'm like, hey guys, what's going on?

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
And they were like, oh, don't you have a Kickstarter?

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,240
And I'm like, yeah, but it's ending today.

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,160
And they were like, what the fuck?

74
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,840
How are you going to promote it if it's ending today?

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm like, I don't fucking know.

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Were they angry?

77
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,800
Why are you asking me that stupid question?

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I see.

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Okay.

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Yeah.

81
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,200
By the way, I know they run, they're into a tight ship over there like we do.

82
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Perhaps not.

83
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Perhaps not.

84
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
They were fine.

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
They were fine.

86
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,800
They seemed like, they seemed maybe not annoyed, but like confused and like, I don't know.

87
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,480
I don't know what I was supposed to say to that question.

88
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,120
They are in a totally different dimension than they usually are.

89
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,760
That must be jarring for anyone.

90
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,520
It seems like there's a pattern here or there's an expectation of behavior.

91
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,840
It sounds like their podcast is simply a vehicle for people or among other things, I'm sure,

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,880
to pay for ad space and like to find that you aren't there for that explicit purpose

93
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,000
is like a shock is an awe inspiring fact.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,240
And I'm just thinking, why aren't we capitalizing on this obviously vibrant market to make vast

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,920
sums of cash advertising products we have no interest in or quality control over?

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,080
It sounds like the way forward for me, right?

97
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,280
This episode is brought to you by Squarespace.

98
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,640
Nate, have you heard that Squarespace is an online learning community and you can get

99
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,720
a month free from our affiliate link or something?

100
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
I don't know.

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
That's Skillshare, Ben.

102
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
You fucked up our sponsorship.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Shit!

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
I can't wait for that.

105
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
For that wonderful...

106
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
It's okay.

107
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
We got Purple Mattress lined up.

108
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
We got ExpressVPN.

109
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
It's all okay.

110
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
What's Purple Mattress?

111
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,080
There's going to be a glorious day where our patrons are paying us vast sums of cash

112
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,760
to advertise to them from other people who are also paying us for those advertisements.

113
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Look, we already fucked this up.

114
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
I want to get them coming and going.

115
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,200
This is why our voicemail bot is failing us because right now we have a free avenue

116
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
for advertising.

117
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,680
We need to fucking clamp that down and put a price tag on it immediately.

118
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
You know, unironically true.

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,560
You know, speaking of advertising, this is actually an interesting thing.

120
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
I'm in...

121
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,920
Actually, I've been a little bit bad.

122
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,600
I've been a little bit unprofessional getting back to this guy.

123
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
But I was talking.

124
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
I don't know if I'm...

125
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,280
I probably just shouldn't say what company it is.

126
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,720
But I was talking with a company.

127
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,680
I just got a message on my email, best guy ever mailed or whatever, and it was a company

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,160
a little bit different from your normal shitty, like, hey, work with us, hey, advertise our

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,520
terrible thing.

130
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,200
This one is something I've used before, and I'm, at least in theory, kind of a fan of

131
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:21,000
the concept of, and their proposal was like, hey, do you want to not advertise, make a

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,080
video about this thing?

133
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,680
And I know Gibbs done that before about like his own.

134
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,600
Are they going to pay you for it?

135
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,160
I mean, that would be the idea.

136
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,280
Yeah, they'd give you actual money.

137
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,600
And I was thinking to myself, you know, Weagawa is a soulless shill product churned out to

138
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
make a product.

139
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,320
Churned out every week without fail.

140
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
That's right.

141
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,480
It's eaten up your entire creative uvra and has taken over your life.

142
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,520
Well, but Ben, I've made space finally.

143
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,560
I made a smash video about sands.

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
That was nice.

145
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
That's pretty good.

146
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I've made space.

147
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,200
So what you're saying is we're going to get a fleshlight video very soon.

148
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,520
That's what I've gotten from it.

149
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,000
Here is the thing about it.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,560
So I'm negotiating with these guys a little bit, and the important sticking point was

151
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,960
they were like, they wanted to be like 80% of like, I'll say like gameplay or like featuring

152
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:21,400
this thing prominently and it's not a fleshlight video, but I mean, it's in the ballpark kind

153
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,320
of it's like an adult thing, which I don't care about.

154
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,000
And obviously on YouTube, you can't make like actually pornographic videos.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
So you have to like censor shit or whatever.

156
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,680
But I'm like, we are what isn't exactly that format.

157
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,520
Is it a porn game or something?

158
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Can you tell us?

159
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
It's in that sphere.

160
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Yeah, it's in that sphere.

161
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Okay.

162
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,600
Like imagine it was me doing like a review of Sengoku Rants, which it's not, but it'd

163
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,000
be something kind of like that.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,240
So I'm just, I don't know, I'm trying to think if it works out, but if it does work out,

165
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,320
it seems like I could make a good amount of money doing this.

166
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,600
So I'm very interested in finding a way to make this work.

167
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
But I don't know.

168
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I've never done it before.

169
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
I'm a little nervous about credibility.

170
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
You just got to jump in, dude.

171
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
You just got to jump in, dude.

172
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
You just got to jump in.

173
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
You just got to jump in.

174
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Your credibility is down the shit.

175
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I mean, it's We Agua.

176
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Your weekly show is not in here.

177
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
It's We Agua, so.

178
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
It's fine.

179
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Yeah.

180
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Half the audience won't even notice it happened.

181
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
They'll be like, I knew We Agua came out.

182
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
No.

183
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
That's absolutely true.

184
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
That's absolutely true.

185
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,840
Or you could just make a whole new show, like a show specifically for shilling things.

186
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,760
So the expectations are set from the beginning.

187
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,320
Well, We Agua was designed to be the shill show from the start then.

188
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,040
Then you're on brand.

189
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,680
You're on brand already.

190
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
It's true.

191
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,600
Well, speaking of shilling, I want to say one thing.

192
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:36,400
The Kickstarter for this weekend is the last weekend that I'll be accepting late PayPal

193
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,880
payments for Kickstarter donations for people who miss the Kickstarter.

194
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,640
I know there were some people who were messaging me during the campaign, like, I don't have

195
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
a credit card.

196
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,680
The website doesn't work or something.

197
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Can I use PayPal?

198
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,560
And I was like, yes, hold on until after the campaign's over.

199
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,280
Now is the time.

200
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,400
So if you missed out on it and you're like, oh, maybe I should have wanted to support

201
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,280
my favorite online creators, then you have like two days.

202
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,160
You have until Sunday after you hear this.

203
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,360
And then I'm saying, like, fuck it, no more.

204
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,280
I'm glad the slimeoid has gotten over his fucking addiction and is now supporting you

205
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
financially.

206
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
You know, I forgot.

207
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Me?

208
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
The swimeoid.

209
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
The swimeoid.

210
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Oh, yeah.

211
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Uwupiti.

212
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Uwupiti, yes.

213
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Uwupiti.

214
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,520
A charity case.

215
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,400
I want Uwupiti to hang out with tiny baby Ben St. and pall around and have a playday.

216
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,040
Well, I mean, I'm not sure if, I mean, the timeline has diverged.

217
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,280
There's a timeline where it died.

218
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
There's a timeline.

219
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,720
There's at least one timeline where it lives.

220
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,400
So at least two, I believe.

221
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
It's very confusing.

222
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,520
Well, I don't know, maybe the two, maybe the Izumi scenario and the red man scenario

223
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
happened.

224
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,800
Maybe, maybe Izumi fished him out and then, or fished it out and then something else

225
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,440
knocked it back in and then while Izumi was fighting against N7, that's when red man

226
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
put it in the jar.

227
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
I don't know.

228
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Right.

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
It's hard to say.

230
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
It's hard to say.

231
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
We're just scholars of these.

232
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,720
We're just, yeah, we're just prophets.

233
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
We don't write this shit.

234
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
We just report it.

235
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,360
Had that happened last episode?

236
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,160
I forgot if we discussed the incredible amount of, of like, you guys all making different

237
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
shit about it.

238
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I don't think it did.

239
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
That was like early this week, right?

240
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Yeah.

241
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
I think, yes, yes.

242
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm pretty sure I did that Tuesday, Tuesday or one day or something like that after reporting.

243
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,680
This has been my favorite thing about this whole saga so far.

244
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,080
I mean, you know, Chris did the whole genocide, excellent work, Chris, but now you guys all

245
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,240
making your different shit, like, and what I said, I mean, give me this comic, Ben was

246
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,400
doing his thing, really cool.

247
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,080
But then when I saw Tom making his like animated Izumi crossover, I want to know how long that

248
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
took Tom.

249
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,920
I want to know what was the inspiration because I was fascinated.

250
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
I must take it a hull.

251
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,480
Should we explain like what this is?

252
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
We probably should.

253
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Yes, yes.

254
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
We should leave the groundwork.

255
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,320
So the final stretch goals for the Vapors 2 Kickstarter.

256
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
And don't worry, everyone.

257
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
We won't bore you with endless war talk.

258
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,400
It fills you with rage and piss and vinegar.

259
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,080
Audience, I literally hate you.

260
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,000
There was a, the final Kickstarter stretch goals.

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,960
I didn't really have anything else to do, so I made up a thing where like, oh, if we

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
hit this stretch goal, we'll make it a meme, that's the way, we'll send this Swymoy to

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
college.

264
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We'll get him in education to increase his waver value and, and then they hit the goal

265
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and I was like, well, shit.

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,120
I was like, well, he's looking to enter the workforce, but it's too much for a slime

267
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
like him.

268
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,800
He develops a terrible sludge dust addiction and now he needs to go to rehabs.

269
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,200
We got to send the Swymoy to rehab and we didn't make it.

270
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
He didn't make it.

271
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,200
So it was, it was over for poor little Uwupati and it decided that it had, it had hit walk

272
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,240
bottom and it had nowhere to go.

273
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,360
So it was about to dissolve itself in the slime way or in the, the, the, the, the, the,

274
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,160
the, the, the, the, the, the slime corp vats.

275
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,120
But how much did you make all told at the end of this?

276
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Oh, 12,000.

277
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,080
So $12,000 exactly as much as I would get in one year under a Yang presidency.

278
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:25,080
So no more, no less exactly.

279
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Literally it's like, it's like 50, well it's actually like, um, $12,000 and 50 cents, but

280
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
you can't see the 50 cents.

281
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Yeah.

282
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,480
That's like, you know, you get your Yang money and then you happen to find a quarter a couple

283
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
times a year.

284
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Yeah.

285
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Yeah.

286
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,280
So, uh, we don't need Yang anymore guys.

287
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
We've solved the problem.

288
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,880
We just need a Kickstarter once a year.

289
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Yeah.

290
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Just vote Kickstarter for president.

291
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,080
Um, that's how he's going to get with the millennials.

292
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,080
He's got to get down with them like, no, this is, this is just a Kickstarter.

293
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
So yearly Kickstarter for your life.

294
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
We do it.

295
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
No more taxes.

296
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,440
We will, we'll end taxation.

297
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,280
We will just crowdfund like roads and like every end like hospitals and stuff.

298
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Make it voluntary.

299
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Yeah.

300
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,080
Um, uh, and, and, um, wait, what was I explaining?

301
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,280
So you were explaining how we disfigured to rehab her.

302
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Yes.

303
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,080
He was going to dissolve and it was going to dissolve itself, but then hippo comes in

304
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,480
with a comic showing some mysterious red handed figure, saving it from and putting it in a

305
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,640
bottle.

306
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:31,280
And then Tom comes in with another, uh, a 3D, uh, model video, uh, showing a zoomie

307
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,760
comes in and fucking gives an inspiring anime speech and convinces it to want to live after

308
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
all.

309
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,200
Uh, oh, this was all after Chris.

310
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,800
Chris had responded saying like, don't guilt me, don't guilt me, Ben, Saint, don't, I,

311
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,320
I have foreseen all possible timelines and the timeline where the sly moid was survived

312
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,400
was terrible.

313
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,840
It would have been disastrous for everyone.

314
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,200
So hippo comes in and of course does it.

315
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,520
So the sly moid survives, but then the final panel is like, would have been terrible for

316
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
everyone.

317
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,480
Like the timeline is doomed.

318
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,880
We've doomed the timeline.

319
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
What do we do?

320
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,400
Um, this is all developing.

321
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm like, I'm like, I was just making some more of this, this shit right before we started

322
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,520
recording and, um, I made some, I'm just like, I made some shit.

323
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
I put it out.

324
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,560
I'm just going to see how Chris reacts and then I'm just going to respond to that.

325
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Right.

326
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,320
I have a couple, I have a couple of different ideas for like, for like how to resolve it.

327
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Right.

328
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,520
Cause I need to convince her that this is happening.

329
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:39,760
I need to convince her that she needs to fear the events that may transpire.

330
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,720
So it's all highly reactive.

331
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,920
So Tom, just tell me how much did that take?

332
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
What kind of effort was involved in that animation?

333
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Okay.

334
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,760
So I woke up at like 9am and I saw the tweet of the sly moid dying.

335
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
I was like, this cannot stand it.

336
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,600
I was like, I'll just do a little four panel comic doing something cute.

337
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,440
Were you in the middle of making it?

338
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,000
And then you saw hippos response and you were like, darn.

339
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I did.

340
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I did.

341
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,320
I did message hippo like 15 hours into working at it.

342
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,040
And I was like, you fucking bitch.

343
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,840
Cause like it started as a comic.

344
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm like, no, comics on enough.

345
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I got to go all out.

346
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
So I just said, I'm just going to throw this whole day away.

347
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,680
So for 20 hours straight, toiled over a hot blender and just made it all.

348
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Damn.

349
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,520
It was an idea that went too far.

350
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Uh, yeah.

351
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
How are you feeling?

352
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,160
It was super cool seeing that pop up on my feed though.

353
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Yeah.

354
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
It came together pretty well.

355
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,280
Anything against the kill the kill soundtrack just automatically is good.

356
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,080
So I couldn't use.

357
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,480
You know, I suspect, I suspect this is my current fan fiction.

358
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,240
I think that, uh, our little whoopity will somehow travel back in time and like found

359
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,680
slime corp or some sort of, you know, like Bioshock infinite level, terrible plot.

360
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,480
Well, it wasn't that bad, but you know, there's clearly they have an important role to play.

361
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
No doubt.

362
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,800
No doubt.

363
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,360
My favorite thing about, okay, okay, whoopity is like, you can, okay, you can see it's brain.

364
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,640
Like you can see it's brain, right?

365
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,920
And my head cannon is that it is like literally just like a P is just like fluid.

366
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,120
It is just basically a sack of fluid with the thinnest of membranes surrounding the

367
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,240
fluid and just like the brain just kind of floating loose inside, just like you have

368
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,480
them lying on his side.

369
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,280
The brain is still oriented upright.

370
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Yeah.

371
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Clearly.

372
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,320
Cause the brain is fried from all the sludge dust.

373
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
So it's in there.

374
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,760
Just kind of like shaking around with the lightning bolts going like, yeah, the brain's not connected.

375
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,320
Like someone asked why it had a spine and I was like, cause what else would the brain

376
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
connect to?

377
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,120
But like the spine doesn't connect to anything.

378
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,200
It's just floating around in there.

379
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,880
I don't know if it's eyes are actually eyes or just like buttons that someone's stuck

380
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
on.

381
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Whoopity is a mystery for sure.

382
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm like actually upset.

383
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
I wasn't able to model.

384
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,560
The original idea was to model the brain and have like a particle system make the bubbles

385
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
and everything animate.

386
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,720
But I would have taken so fucking long, I mean, I don't blame you for just like make

387
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
it green.

388
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Like you get it.

389
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,840
You should make Tom, I'm just going to throw this out there.

390
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,720
You should make some sort of like secret area in Izumi where you can break the wall and

391
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,760
you can find Uwupity in there with the model you've already made and you can just kill

392
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,240
them for some quick cash.

393
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Secret boss Uwupity.

394
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,800
Oh, he gets a whole intro.

395
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
He gets a full boss bar.

396
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,280
But then there's one of those ones that takes one slash to kill and you got the big victory

397
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
fan.

398
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Oh, like, like Zote.

399
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Exactly.

400
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Yes.

401
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Exactly.

402
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,800
And then you can get another dream sequence like with Zote where he gets full power slime

403
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,480
oid mode and he's a big Chad.

404
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
These are all you.

405
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,120
You're welcome to all these ideas, everyone.

406
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I encourage you.

407
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm seeing from modest view.

408
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,640
I'm seeing maybe like a tiny little Uwupity, like sitting in the little cockpit of like

409
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,000
a giant mech or something.

410
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, that's good.

411
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,280
Maybe that had built itself with its extensive education.

412
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,880
Oh, you know, that actually like that's seen from the last Jedi where fucking the robot

413
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,880
like what's what's the name fucking not R.C.B.

414
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,200
He's in the fucking Walker and it like it pulls off the Walker and just B.B.

415
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,480
Eight moving around the ATSC just to have a mech with a Uwupity.

416
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Yeah.

417
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Yep.

418
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Yep.

419
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Yep.

420
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Yep.

421
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Yep.

422
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Yep.

423
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Yep.

424
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Yep.

425
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
Yep.

426
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Yep.

427
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Yep.

428
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Yep.

429
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Yep.

430
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Yep.

431
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Yep.

432
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Yep.

433
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Yep.

434
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
Yep.

435
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Yep.

436
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Yep.

437
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Yep.

438
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,040
And I've met good he should they should it.

439
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,880
Oh, so much a draw comic of him like in Lecture Halls with a Temmie because they both went

440
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
to the same super fast school.

441
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,080
Obviously, one day education, 10 minute education, some.

442
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,980
I mean, especially in New Los Angeles City, like going to class is not really the point.

443
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,280
Just the point is just can you pay them enough.

444
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
And of course, that's how you get your diploma.

445
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
That's what it is.

446
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
That's what it means.

447
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,580
You had to be smart to get that money in the first place, right?

448
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,680
So like clearly you deserve the diploma.

449
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,840
Like I forget what since we live in a meritocracy and all that wasn't it

450
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,800
There's like something where it's like you want to get the ultimate. Oh, actually here's one example dragon ball Z

451
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,680
Is like you have to climb that tower. Sorry the beginning of dragon ball

452
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,080
You have to climb this tower to get the mystical water, but turns out the mystical water does nothing

453
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,520
It's the strength that took to climb. Yes, it was the strength that took to make a whole bunch of moneys in the first place

454
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
It's like you have learned

455
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,320
Of hard if you haven't learned about the shams of capitalism by the time you've saved up all that money

456
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,560
The lessons are lost on you anyway indeed indeed very true

457
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,240
All right, there you go, and you everyone put your time codes now to skip to the end of the endless war

458
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Fuck you audience

459
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
God bless them

460
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Disappointed in you every single episode

461
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,280
Uh, well, here's here's a small point. I messaged this in the chat the other day

462
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,320
I thought it was interesting, but people jumped down my throat about it a little bit

463
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,160
But that wasn't the point it was that I've noticed that a couple people have made

464
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,480
Smash videos not just in a similar style to me, but like

465
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,880
Ripping off the branding including the font and there's a couple of things going on here

466
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,080
I have no problem with people copying my style and doing the things in this way

467
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,100
When I start to have just a little bit of concern is when I see many many comments about well

468
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,360
Looks like BGE really shit this one out and just and that that's like the worst-case scenario

469
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,280
but many people just expressing some degree of confusion that

470
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,600
Clearly they thought this was a video by specifically these are all like banjo ones

471
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
there's like three ones that people have made and

472
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,440
I just it's I wish I have no problem with people doing this

473
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,120
I just kind of wish they would brand. There's a little bit differently

474
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,840
So it didn't just look like it was one of mine. I mean, but it's just like there's been on it

475
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,480
I feel like I mean, I feel yeah, I feel like that's probably not effective

476
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,920
marketing on their part

477
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,880
You don't think so. I think they're at the goal of making these videos is not to build their own brand

478
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
It's to get clicks off of yours

479
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,560
I mean a lot of them are clearly like up-and-comers. They're just trying to like do something fun

480
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,760
I don't have a problem with that. I don't think it's malicious

481
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,960
But I think the goal is to emulate your style as closely as possible because they know it works

482
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,160
Well, I mean, maybe if they're just starting out they like your videos

483
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:31,560
Maybe I mean, I guess probably the ideal what you would hope would happen is maybe they start out basically just making carbon copy

484
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,960
Best guy ever style videos and then they find their own style in that space

485
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I mean, and of course, I mean did very true and did you of course said this to me

486
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,160
He's like wow Nate. You really think you copyrighted putting

487
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,360
Another person's like character on the thumbnail and putting the smash logo behind it. Well, no

488
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,880
I don't think I invented that or anything

489
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,720
But the font choice being the exact same font and it being a music like this kind of gives it away that it is in fact

490
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,840
There's a lot of specific choices that would all brought together again makes the influence clear

491
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,040
Yeah, yeah, and yeah, you like you might not own any of those things, but like

492
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,400
Yeah, it looks like a best guy ever video and I'm not an idiot. I'm not trying to say I copyrighted or I

493
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,360
Copy-acclaimed these people. It's it's just I mean take for example the fact that my first one the Ridley one was a complete

494
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,800
It wasn't a copy but like in the description. I say

495
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,760
inspired by

496
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Demolition D and his

497
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,960
His berserk like getting off the boat video one of the greatest videos of all time. It's it's incredible

498
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
Deserves all its success demos the legend etc. etc

499
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,360
But and and you know some of the guys start their videos by saying like inspired by best guy ever like here

500
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,880
We go so like okay couldn't have a problem couldn't couldn't have less of a problem with that

501
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,800
but other people don't even mention me anywhere in the video and

502
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,920
are just

503
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,000
There but you know that I can't even get that mad at that because some people when they make their videos

504
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,240
They don't feel the need to like credit anything at all and I'm the complete opposite

505
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,080
I credit like every single link of everything I use and like all my videos

506
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,720
I don't need to but I just find it easy and I'm happy to do so some people

507
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,320
Just don't feel that need and maybe they still think like well

508
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,280
It's obvious. I'm you know doing a homage to this guy. So I don't it's hard to get in people's heads

509
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,720
And know exactly what they're thinking it is when I bring this up

510
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,880
It sounds like I'm like an angry complaining loser. Who's like these people are ripping me off

511
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,080
Well, I assure you viewers it is only an illusion

512
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:41,800
But but my my actual point here is to encourage these guys because you know what some other people came to me and said like hey Nate

513
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,320
I really like your videos like do you mind if I make a video in this style?

514
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,640
Some people actually reached out to me to ask me that and you know what I said to him

515
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:56,960
I said like fuck off. I said absolutely not pay me money motherfucker or whatever for 50% of your ad revenue

516
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,640
Actually, it's literally 0% ad revenue. Oh, by the way, give Gibbs said this was really funny

517
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,800
One guy puts a bunch of like things the beginning of his videos that are like. Oh, no

518
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,800
I got demonetized guys who could have expected that to happen. So I'm not making any money. So give my patreon

519
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,200
It's like yeah, what do you think this project is?

520
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,360
There of course is demonetized. We're stealing other people's music and making a montage. Okay, but whatever

521
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,160
I also plug my patreon

522
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:28,400
But some people reached out to me and they said like Nate can I do this my answer was I I didn't invent the concept of musical

523
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,360
Montages, I didn't invent the concept of like smash reveal videos or hype things or anything

524
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,960
But just put your own style on it would be the thing to do you can totally rip off the formula

525
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,160
I can't stop you. I have no right to stop you

526
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:47,480
I'd encourage you just to put your own creative spin on it as I like to think I have done with my videos

527
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,160
This is a humble request not a demand because I have no right to demand anything as you know

528
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:59,760
This is the internet. We all steal from each other and take ideas and whatnot. That's my that's my message to those to those fine folks out

529
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,880
There, but I mean if those guys hear this, I just I'm not mad. I don't care

530
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm not upset about it

531
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,720
But just just consider these and as you grow and as a creator put your own spin on things

532
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,040
Don't don't make it so that like people have made collections of these

533
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,200
Like playlists of like the smash revealed videos or whatever and it's like all my videos

534
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,080
Then like a bunch of these banjo ones that are not mine and like one or two that are unrelated

535
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,680
But you can tell the unrelated ones are not made by me in it like instantly from the thumbnail and the title and stuff

536
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,880
Like I feel like that's where we should all be you know as a society

537
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Yeah, there you go. All right, that's my point. Well point. It's like it's like it's like the same goes

538
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,040
You know imitation is a sincerest form of theft

539
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,920
I don't know

540
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,840
I feel like some people are gonna be mad at me or call me a whiny bitch about this as as some of the people in our chat

541
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,400
Seem to be but Nate aren't you just like happy that people are copying you and you know flattering you? Yes. Yes. I am

542
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:05,160
It's very nice. It's very nice, but I mean I guess to be a little selfish when I see that one of these videos has like

543
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,880
85,000 views and I'm just like damn

544
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,160
I have no problem with this guy making the video. It was pretty good and all that but like

545
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
I feel like at least some of these people

546
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,280
Were we're clicking on this because they thought it was my video and now you know, they've consumed this

547
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,560
Entire point

548
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,580
Yeah, I mean, that's why they did it. I think I think we've passed the point where

549
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
If you continue to complain

550
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,320
You start to sound the litch a little alright, okay

551
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,840
And you know as digi and other people said it's like a lot of people in those comments are like this will hold me over until

552
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,040
Best guy ever makes his video like so, okay, I get it

553
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:54,280
Not you know, I don't I'm not trying to be that that that annoying about I just thought it was something of interest to bring up

554
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,120
Because there's a fine line here of of I don't know

555
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,040
I don't want to say like acceptable versus unacceptable behavior

556
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,600
But like ideal versus, you know another person when that when people reached out to me and asked me

557
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,040
I had to kind of meditate be like what what would I want someone to do if they like were trying to copy?

558
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,480
I don't know just honestly like a thumbnail that doesn't look like it's totally copying my style and

559
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,400
Like it's funny because the the text of the description or of the of the title of the thing

560
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,120
I just put into like fancy text generator comm and was like which one of these like kind of looks cool

561
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,880
And I just picked one randomly. There's no meaning to it, but then other people like why are they using it?

562
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,160
I mean because I'm using obviously. That's the only reason you'd pick that font. So, you know

563
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,600
Just just funny to think about lads. I hope you've enjoyed this

564
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,400
Good well, there you go, that's what I have to say about that. Okay. All right, um

565
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,400
What else we got?

566
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,840
What else what else is going on Tom? What's what's new in your life?

567
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,520
Not much

568
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Surgery on Wednesday

569
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:09,960
excited and by excited by the time people hear this it'll be over you'll be you'll be I'll either be cured or crippled

570
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,560
I guess we'll find out find out okay. Yeah, I don't I don't you know

571
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,800
This is perhaps a sensitive topic don't want to push you to talk about too much about if you're worried or uncomfortable like

572
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:25,720
Will you know if things have like improved or not improved like very soon after we'll take a while to like, you know

573
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,440
From what I understand it should you want to tell us like what they're doing to you

574
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,480
They are doing surgery on my spine because I have a herniated disc is maybe unable to walk since January pretty much

575
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah, as some of you have seen firsthand

576
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,400
So they're going to knock me out open up my spine and pull out bits of my spinal cord

577
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,560
They're currently interrupting the nerves in my back that are fucking things up. Very nice. Yeah, it's a good time

578
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,400
Very nice. Yeah, so I guess the idea is that you pull out these pieces of bone

579
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
And I won't have the pain anymore

580
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,800
But if something goes bad, they could sever the nerves in my spine and paralyze me. So oh my god

581
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,800
I thought it was your sciatic nerve like in your legs

582
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,320
It is that's where the pain is coming from but it's because there's there's the disc in my spine has slipped and it is hitting the nerve

583
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,480
That affects the sciatic nerve because it like runs down your spine into your leg

584
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,560
I don't know. It's some weird biology. Why don't you just go to a chiropractor because they're all about like

585
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,520
Controlling the flow of energy up and down your spine. Well, it sounds like they are designed for this problem

586
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
I don't know why you're using this quote-unquote

587
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
standard medicine this

588
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,200
Mainstream solution. Well, Ben as someone who's been suffering with this for a year. I've gone to the chiropractor multiple times

589
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,840
I've gone to physical therapy. I've gone to I've tried everything. I've tried

590
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
My guy will hook you up

591
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Yeah, I don't know about any of that

592
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,920
Seems a little it's a little too mainstream for me

593
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,520
I guess I'm more of an indie guy. I got it. I got it. I've had some seances with witches

594
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:14,280
Yes, good. Good. No no luck so far. Have you perhaps prayed to the great Satan for for benefit

595
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:22,320
I'm trying to Satan every day just about everything. All right. We're okay. I don't want to be overly negative here

596
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,000
But just this at all utterly terrify you because I feel like it would me constantly. Yes, okay

597
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,080
Yeah, all the time. Well, very paneled like this like the problem. I've heard about people having herniated discs before

598
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,280
I feel like this has got to be a somewhat common procedure. Yeah

599
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,760
I mean the talk from from the surgeons like yeah, this is like probably the best surgery

600
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,600
I do with the highest rate of success the problem is like this is already like a huge phobia of mine already

601
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,120
so like surgery in general as

602
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,400
Just just like anything to do with my spine or brain or like cuz that's like

603
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:04,200
Yeah, yeah alive right brain shit fucks me right up dude. I saw a post on Twitter someone trying to get get a voyage

604
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
That brain shit as much as

605
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,280
Tell me about that there's a metaphor in a whoop-a-dee's design somewhere

606
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,320
I'm sure like there was there was a post on Twitter someone trying to get thing help for their medical bills

607
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,480
And I guess yeah something had happened to their neck

608
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,660
The the bones in their neck had shifted and their brain was falling out of their skull as a result

609
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,920
Yeah, it was fucking my god, yeah, yeah, I'm googling brain surgery images right now

610
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Ah

611
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Yeah

612
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
That this is why I'm

613
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,960
Transhumanism hashtag H plus get us out of these flesh prisons now. Well, I mean

614
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,240
I mean this reminds me of a couple of things in in ghost in the shell land of cyber brain

615
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,960
Ah, what not they do have to I believe fully remove the brain

616
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,880
And then they put it into like a casing that can be like moved around easily between skulls

617
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So, I mean there is brain surgery going on there for sure, but yeah

618
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, that's just not as scary

619
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,200
No, I mean it would be scary because like then you also have to like wonder like well

620
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,040
I still be the same thing like it's still my brain

621
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:25,560
Yeah, like is there something that's lost your transition. Yeah, but but once you the benefits the benefits are yeah

622
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,560
That's true. The benefits way too big to I'm like you're basically like, you know a god at that point a god

623
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,320
I mean just look at look at Tom for example

624
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,040
I mean he could literally put a cyber brain in a new body in a situation like this and then what I think the thing

625
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:46,400
That really fucks me up is that I wouldn't even be so weirded out by being like an organic biological being if we could synthesize organs

626
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:53,400
Easily because like the problem is like we don't have we don't we can't just like bring ourselves to the hospital and be like

627
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,720
Yeah, my heart's broken. I need a new one. It's like all right pay me like a couple hundred bucks

628
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,840
We'll you know, we just grow you a new heart

629
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,880
I guess we fantasize a little bit that we're farther along in this developmental process of medicine and whatnot

630
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,120
But we're actually very primitive in the things that we can do watch watch the original Star Trek and then like yes

631
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:20,040
Like even back then like the ideas that they were having for medicine are still far beyond anything we can ever do like their ideas of

632
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,720
Technology have been obliterated by modern devices, but the medical field is still

633
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,520
Laughably behind the concepts from the 60s. So you know, it's just ridiculous

634
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:37,560
Like I'm going I really they're gonna carve pieces of bone out of my back by cutting through the flesh

635
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,960
It's like what the fuck this is some medieval shit

636
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Did I mention the last piece of the episode the the situation of like Ron Weasley discussing his views on human doctors or muggle doctors?

637
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,800
Did I did I bore everyone with this last time? I don't want to repeat myself

638
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,880
I don't remember it's very quickly. It's just that Ron Weasley this privileged wizard fuck with literally magic blood

639
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,000
When when Harry went with him to like the wizard hospital and like book two or whatever

640
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,400
They were like

641
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:11,440
Harry's who grew up, you know with muggle people was like all these wizard doctors Ron and Ron was like no Harry

642
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,480
What those muggle natas that cut people up? No, they're healers

643
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,920
So it's like he's literally shaming muggles because of the best stuff

644
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,720
They've got science real shit. Your god isn't real Ron. Fuck you

645
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,640
You know because we don't have magic the wizards keep their their advanced medical

646
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,360
Technologies and leave us all the suffered and die of cancer really says a lot

647
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,360
I mean Harry Potter has

648
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:41,160
Like weird ramifications of this like secrecy of their entire society when you really make it like a real thing

649
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,880
Well, it's because the book started off as like kind of like cutesy children things exactly

650
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,380
They got older and then when you start dealing with more complex topics

651
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm not actualizing things and more you're like wait a minute

652
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,620
We made it too real things get teenagers everyone's starting to get a little horny and you know from there things just go straight down

653
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,040
Well god damn I hope it goes well and I want to know as soon as possible things go

654
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,520
Well, and if anything I mean good or bad if you need our help Tom

655
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,600
We'll we'll here I am to virtue signal that we can perhaps be of assistance in some way

656
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:21,080
I mean just if terrible things happen and lots of money is required boom

657
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,280
We got an audience we got we'll we'll make a Kickstarter or we'll make it go fun me whatever man

658
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,120
I'm sure people will be willing to help I'm hoping mass health will cover the majority of whatever this fallout is and force comes to worse

659
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,560
Maybe I can sue the hospital for millions and damages for malpractice

660
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
You can make this work for you

661
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Let's just say you need an extra thousand dollars

662
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,920
I don't see any reason why if you like you're I don't know you're paying the bills you got your your

663
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,720
Your your not tax your fucking benefits or whatever from the the health care or whatever

664
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,920
But if you need an extra like five grand, that's a thing for Kickstarter

665
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,120
That's a thing for just the kindness of man to help out with yeah, this is not your fault

666
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:05,800
This is literally the role of the fucking dice. What a great system we got going on in America right now

667
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah

668
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
They could use a little bit of work

669
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,480
capitalism has some problems it could use a violent revolution

670
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,080
Hate the corporations and hate the government the most are also the ones who are anti-gun we're never gonna see a violent revolt

671
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,320
It's such a shame

672
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,520
well

673
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,320
Perhaps perhaps that's why

674
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
I

675
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,800
What if I can charge for entrance to like my antifa weapons training program

676
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,800
So I can make a pretty penny off of arming though

677
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,880
That'll work for a while until they seize the means of armament from you that you know, you're not wrong

678
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,160
Well, there you go, there you go, there's the update there

679
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
We joke about all this but

680
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:05,400
Shout out to nexus mania in Chile right now where things are fucking really fucked up. Oh my god

681
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,720
Well, dude that like yes, it was fucked for him

682
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,760
I don't know exactly what's going on in Chile. There's there was like some protests

683
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,120
I guess the government shut it down into a there's a curfew now

684
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,880
There's military on the street that's armed fucking with people

685
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,240
I haven't looked into it too much because that shit fucks and creeps me out, but uh, yep

686
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,840
Feel the same way please don't die

687
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
I'm thinking about you thoughts and prayers

688
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,240
Thoughts and prayers bro thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers

689
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,240
You know, we did it we got a voice

690
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,240
I won't well we'll play it later, but there was a voicemail irrelevant to the situation that perhaps will be a salvation

691
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,160
For nexus in this situation. I don't know unless they they've closed almost certainly. I don't know. I don't know

692
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,440
But oh boy, yeah, yeah with like that and many other unhappy things happening in the world

693
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,200
I'm like, ooh

694
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,000
Like if I worked really hard, maybe I could help but I got like a lot of dishes to do today

695
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,360
I got like a lot of chores to handle so

696
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,360
You know just got to keep it 100 keep it focused on number one over here. So good luck everybody out there

697
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,880
You know unironically there's a there's probably some kind of equation to be found

698
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,800
Of it's appropriate to spend a certain amount of time worrying about the rest of the world

699
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,560
And a certain amount of time worrying about the shit you got to deal with in your life

700
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,400
I don't know what that ratio is well

701
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
There is not 100

702
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,960
There's a school of thought that says you take care of yourself first because once you're in a good position

703
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,520
You're you're more effective at taking care of the world. I think they call that objectivism at least it's part of the ethos of

704
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,040
objectivism

705
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,800
Maybe I haven't read Anne Rand. Those books are big. Those books are good. I think

706
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,360
I mean Rand is literally a fucking psycho. Hey, hey, no, no, thy enemy Ben. No, thy enemy, right?

707
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,800
And I found them enjoyable terrible terrible mindset from a terrible woman. Oh

708
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,880
She lived communism Ben. She's allowed to be mad at it and to you know

709
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:13,280
Okay, you know all those books were just a temper tantrum about being well mad about communism

710
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,680
Some of our greatest art has been the product of temper tantrums. I give you sonnachu volume one

711
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,560
Rage against the yeah rage against the garbage. All right. That's fair. That's fair

712
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,920
Can't argue with Christian, but the Anne Rand of our time. I guess

713
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:38,000
Man I got the I got a fucking mm-hmm. I just got a fucking keep I just got to keep Chris

714
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,480
Interested I just got to keep it. I gotta keep it funny

715
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,240
Of course the Chris just keeps like coming up as long as Chris is still coming up with no

716
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,240
No, no, no, this happened in this universe. No, no, no, no, the slime is doing this and this is what's going as like as long

717
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
As that's going on

718
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,000
I gotta say as a bystander it's interesting watching the diplomatic relations continue to break down week over week

719
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,880
It is it is interesting. Um, they're not it's it's not over until I'm fucking blocked and even then

720
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,640
Even then I have options. Now. I suppose I'm curious Ben at this point of the equation

721
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,800
Are you at all, you know getting into the the thoughts of like am I perhaps taking this a little bit too far?

722
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,640
Am I no, no, no, okay. Okay. No, I ain't no bitch

723
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,040
I have a question related to that. How are those scripts going for the vaporettes?

724
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
Uh, well, I got two of them out

725
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
All right, how many are them?

726
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Six oh

727
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,680
I think I might rewrite one or two

728
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
I think maybe that means none are done

729
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,000
No, no, no, no, no the ones that I got out to the artists are set in stone. Oh, okay

730
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,800
I'm happy with those. I must say other ones who I'm like, am I really happy with these just like could I improve these?

731
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Am I

732
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,800
Don't don't beat yourself up about them too much try to get them to a workable state

733
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,160
Then maybe consider just giving them to the artists and let them

734
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,880
Possibly make some small changes to the script because you know, they have a creative voice that perhaps could bloom. I guess that's true

735
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,880
Yeah, I don't know. I'm sad that my dream of a chris chan vaporette from two weeks ago is all but dead now

736
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,120
Unless there's a big

737
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,320
I did say that a couple episodes ago. I was like, oh man, vapor's three

738
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,760
Oh, you know, she never would have fucking done it, you know

739
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,960
It's I mean to respect chris to deliver on a deadline, you know for a certain amount of money and not just demand extra money for no reason

740
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,720
Never fucking do it. You would never do it

741
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,080
I mean, she she made you that that page that you paid for, you know, that was it's true deliverable

742
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:49,040
It's true. It's that did happen. Um, but I think I'm in the minority of people who actually got what they paid for

743
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,520
Really? Hmm. I I mean, everyone says she doesn't deliver on her kickstarter on her like, uh, uh

744
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,880
Paypal or you know patreon obligations and stuff and doesn't you know

745
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,240
Screws people out of commissions and stuff. I don't know. I don't know fair enough

746
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,800
My one experience was through you getting it successfully. So that that made me think like, oh, wow

747
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,680
Yeah, and that was fine. So I get maybe you know

748
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:23,840
Thumbs up one of those ones five stars. Give her a good yelp review. Now. That's what you call customer service

749
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,400
Uh, let me see what else is going on the saga of sesho exercise and thinning uh continues

750
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,920
I'll have everyone know I accidentally gave him two dinners the other day. It was a it was a mistake

751
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
All progress is lost

752
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
What have you done?

753
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,360
I need to really kill him. It was an early dinner situation

754
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,200
I forgot and michelle was like did you feed sesho yet? And I was like, uh, I don't think so

755
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,320
But alas I had so you get a system going

756
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,720
We will you know, we should make like a whiteboard and like check it off when we fed sesho and maybe exercise him every day

757
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,160
You know, some people are saying some people have to voicemail. I didn't play because it was fine

758
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,200
But it wasn't wasn't up to par of like you should go running with sesho. Now you should go running with sesho

759
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,720
I could like try that. I suppose but sesho is a very

760
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,160
He like sesho doesn't play fetch some people are saying play fetch with sesho sesho does not fetch

761
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,960
He could perhaps be convinced to perhaps one way chase. He's he's a broken boy. He's a broken mind

762
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,040
This is what happens when you make your dog

763
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,360
Rotund as you have it was from day one sesho was like this

764
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,520
You know sesho's a very demure soul a very demure soul like his namesake lord sesho maru himself

765
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:46,880
Doesn't speak much very quiet. We'll occasionally do some mild grumbling and uh, doesn't doesn't fetch doesn't run much

766
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:53,440
Except sometimes we'll just run around the house. No reason to find out that his younger brother has the tetsaiga and that would give him all the motivation he needs

767
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,080
That's to raise his yokai power level to overcome him and uh and seize the means as as it were that'll be good

768
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,240
Okay, well, you know, we have been thinking about you know, I'll give you guys a teaser

769
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,880
Perhaps I shouldn't spoil this because one day I feel like it'll be a long time before this comes of fruition

770
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,960
But me and michelle this is michelle's idea

771
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,160
We've long thought about eventually perhaps soon getting another dog for sesho to play with and to hang out with because we both

772
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,360
Just love dogs. What a fucking nightmare. I'm stressed out just thinking about it

773
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,960
I feel like having one dog is like 90 of the work getting a second dog is only like 10 extra, you know

774
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,160
So we're already yeah, that seems like some slippery slope logic

775
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,320
Well, it's not a child. So their lives don't matter. So I'm not that worried about yeah

776
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,920
Yeah, if you change your mind you can always take them out back behind the barn

777
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,440
Yeah, that's all right. So so here is the um

778
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,520
The the name we we are thinking about it's not inuyasha as people may think that that would be too boring

779
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,800
And this is michelle's idea. It's we're thinking of kagome

780
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,240
It's we're thinking of calling him odi for short which stands for

781
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,680
Left arm of the forbidden one exodia is would be the full name of

782
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
Showers

783
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,800
Left arm of the forbidden one a.k.a.

784
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:14,240
Left arm of the forbidden one exodia a.k.a. odi for short. All right, isn't that right? That's pretty good. That's pretty fucking funny

785
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,440
It is that was all michelle. She's a she's a funny lass

786
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,520
Patreon her for more epic memes on her patreon, which she does not have but one of these days

787
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,240
Um, we all right. Well, you know, let us know when you actually go through with it. I guess we'll do

788
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:35,520
I wonder if people will remember and uh, keep uh, give us your hot suggestions in the description down below

789
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,280
Vote in my straw poll for what to name my second dog that I don't have

790
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,720
The current fictional dog that may cross the dimensional merge

791
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,800
He may just cross over that dimensional merge right now

792
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,120
Send us fan art of odi so that he can then become real through the dimensional merge

793
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,680
It could be in your backyard right now for all we know

794
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,440
There is

795
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,680
There's so much this dimension the dimensional merge. There's so much possibility space

796
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,040
So much there's so much possibility space about where yeah, we're we're gonna take things

797
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,720
Um, I'm I'm I'm constantly walking on the razor's edge

798
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,560
I figured out your end game of all this by the way this morning. I had the brain blast

799
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,680
It's like, oh, I see the whole point of this entire endeavor

800
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,760
Is that when the inevitable chris chan part two lecture has it has to by default have a sub lecture of endless war

801
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,320
You've injected there it is man. There it is

802
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,800
And then it'll reach already it's already there

803
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,960
It's already there because already on the quickie of the slime the slime related

804
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,120
Arizona slime card updates for the Twilight Sparkle secret shipfic folder

805
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,200
Are already listed as sonichu special number six, so it already has its own side chapter devoted to it

806
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,240
So there's nothing I can do. I literally must

807
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,840
Devote a section of the lecture to it. It's canon. I mean, it's a hundred percent canon

808
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,600
How could you give the lecture a nod address? Yeah, no, I would be sure I would be

809
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:04,240
You negligent in your in your christorianly duties. No doubt. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I would be remiss not to not to have a section

810
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,600
so

811
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,600
You know, I've already won

812
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,800
well

813
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,920
I feel like that right there is the not so good news. We just heard about on the web and perhaps

814
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,120
We should move on to to the voicemails

815
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,960
We've got we've got like 12. We've been going for like 45. Did I mention did I mention that I have a quickie article?

816
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,600
Yeah, we said it was the article of the now last time it was it is no longer the article of the now, but it's still there and

817
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,760
It's the article of the

818
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:39,440
But it's all it's got it's got the template. Oh, it's some other guy who has been like making

819
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,240
Kickstarter campaigns or gofundme campaigns to like raise money for

820
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,400
And like they've all failed. I don't know. I don't know what his deal is and I don't really care

821
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,760
Okay, fair enough

822
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,840
But I my article has that little mark. It has a little star has that template at the top

823
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,240
It's like this article was once article of the now I can never they can never take that away from me

824
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,360
They can never take away the touch the poop that'll be on

825
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,400
I did I sure did it's stink the stink is on me boys

826
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,480
Uh, I mean if you guys are down, I mean I pretty much burned through I'm think we're a little bit light on

827
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,680
individuals with human capital to expend today

828
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,480
That's true. Uh, well, I mean

829
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,400
The Kickstarter got into a little sunday for that. Um, uh, I went to uh, I did go to um

830
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:34,000
The massachusetts independent comics expo yesterday. Oh, yeah, okay with kazzie and uh, munchie

831
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,440
And uh, I hate it. It's all why really it's bad. I don't like it

832
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,440
It's just it bothers me that all you do there is buy stuff

833
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,080
It's only a place for I mean there are panels. None of them seem like actual comics

834
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:54,480
They've made or like bullshit corporate merch or something. Well, yeah, I mean they are independent creators and I mean that's cool and all

835
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,400
But like you just go that you you buy their comic books. You buy their

836
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,680
You know prints they made I don't want any of that stuff. I don't want this mythical networking

837
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,760
Be a part of the experience in some way where I would be interested in that

838
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,000
But like I don't know how you're supposed to do that

839
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,200
Like I met like I met abby howard, right and like last year

840
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
Last year abby howard was there

841
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,440
And and I didn't say anything to her but this year she was just walking by me and I was like, oh abby howard

842
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,240
Hey, I know you I know you from that stuff search. Yeah

843
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,320
We had a you know, we talked she was like, oh, yeah my table's downstairs

844
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,200
And you know, I was like, oh cool. Great to meet you. She walked away and I was like, what was the point of that?

845
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,800
Like what have I what has anyone gained like this sucks like this whole endeavor is useless

846
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,840
I wish I I wish I never left you know, I wish I never left my house. What a fucking

847
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:50,800
What a fucking nightmare the problem and I never and I never felt and I never felt more alone than I did

848
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,120
In public at mice out at this thing

849
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,600
Is that where the tweet came from where you said you felt alienated or is that a different

850
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:05,200
Although that's it certainly didn't help now that was after ben's abduction by aliens and he was feeling real alienated

851
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:11,120
I never felt more alone than I was at mice and like here I am at this event that like this event seems like it's

852
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,600
Literally made for someone like me and I'm here and there is like zero

853
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,800
I feel zero purpose in being here. I feel zero camaraderie with anyone else here

854
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,400
You know, they this is a nightmare

855
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,240
They say that human beings feel their loneliness when like in cities surrounded by people who know, you know, who they know

856
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,920
None of as opposed to

857
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,120
Or smaller little communities when they can know a couple people that makes sense

858
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,880
You get the sense of tranquility when you're actually by yourself indeed indeed

859
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,760
Anyway, so

860
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,320
I didn't like it is the short version of that story

861
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,760
I mean, I guess my thing is if you weren't going there to either a

862
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,280
Have a table yourself because then you actually have a purpose or b

863
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,040
You wanted to go get a bunch of fucking independent comics from a bunch of creators. Like yeah, it does seem pointless to go

864
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,720
What yeah, why go just to waste money or waste money, you know

865
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,040
Because like the that the boston comics round table had a table and i've been

866
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,600
I've gone to a couple meetings lately. I don't know if i'm gonna go anymore. It sucks. It's fucking pointless

867
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,880
I mean if you're gaining nothing fair enough, I suppose. I'm gaining nothing

868
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,000
Uh, they're they're I went I I've been saying like maybe I want to like sit at their table and like, you know

869
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,320
You can sell your shit like I could have brought some of my comics and sold

870
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,080
But like they had all bunch of shit on the table

871
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,440
Like like mine would have just been like one book among like 20

872
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,640
So like i'm sure I wouldn't have sold very many copies of anything. I don't think it would have made me any money

873
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,080
I don't think it would have increased my ability to network with other

874
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,120
Creators because I just would have been sitting behind a table

875
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,600
um

876
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,080
That's kind of like the reason I've never wanted to vent at conventions or anything like that because it just feels like

877
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,840
Oh, I'm just sitting behind a table while all this other cool stuff is going on everyone's walking around

878
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,760
I could hang out with my friends, but no i'm behind here at a table and I can't move for the entire weekend

879
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,840
Just seems interesting. I don't know they say they say they talk about operated for you

880
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,040
You know they talk about networking, but I don't know

881
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,320
I mean

882
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:13,200
Then you had the galaxy brain move of like starting a kickstarter online and accessing an international audience and made $12,000

883
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,280
I'd gout anyone like the better plan between the two. I mean

884
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,080
Yeah, space is just old school

885
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,280
I mean it took me like it took me like six years of fucking audience building and whatever

886
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,440
But you know other than that little hiccup it's like it's like what could be simpler

887
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,120
Well, I mean, I don't know six years of grinding in the real world would get you far less results. I feel

888
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,280
You could make more than $12,000 just working a job

889
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,480
Well, I mean, I mean, I mean making comics. I mean making

890
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,360
Oh

891
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,560
In that case

892
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:49,520
Real life possibly yet. That's fair. That's that's possibly fair. I mean, I would definitely encourage people

893
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,760
If they're making a they're trying to be successful at some, you know

894
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
artistic endeavor of any stripe

895
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:02,320
To acknowledge the financial reality of how they need to survive and work a job in addition to doing that thing

896
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,440
Which is what I did and maybe yet again all too soon

897
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,080
If I'm not making enough money and stuff

898
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,960
It just seems like a practical way to live but uh, you know, whatever I can respect those who just jump

899
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,680
Both feet in let me sink or swim. Let me talk about let me talk about

900
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,960
Assholes on twitter who don't like my tweets, right?

901
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,040
And it's your girlfriend and digi's girlfriend. Michelle and may okay. They're bullying gang

902
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:34,320
Just just gang up on me and bully me on twitter. There's such shit lords

903
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,920
Love to be mean to you. I don't know just so you know

904
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,720
I worry sometimes that people think that I'm like sending michelle out as like a no, no, no

905
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,080
I never do that. No, I don't I didn't think that this time

906
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,760
In the past I've wondered like isn't it in on this but this time like I know this is just I mean what she does

907
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:58,080
Is she will say Nate? I'm telling ben what a fucking retard he is right now and I go. Okay, michelle. That sounds nice

908
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,480
Yeah, you know things of this. Yeah

909
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:07,760
It's terrible. It's terrible. She's she's not she's it is funny who but she has she has cowered tactics

910
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:13,040
Cowardly debate tactics. She only she only did police is my tone. She won't debate me

911
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,640
She won't let me own her ass with facts and logic

912
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:22,720
I don't just say oh you sound like uh, you sound like an old you sound like such a boomer the way you phrase that

913
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,040
Ha ha who would phrase the thought that way idiot. I can't argue with that

914
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:34,160
prerogative is definitely to be a be a trickster and a jokester and to laugh at vulnerable individuals

915
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,920
And then I say, you know, I like fdr. I like fdr

916
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:46,400
Economic policies and may is like is japanese ben. She is japanese her people are locked away in those concentration camps

917
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I mean michelle, isn't he? I mean, yeah, there was that

918
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,960
May was on my ass about she locked away the concentration camp who cares bro get over it, right?

919
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,360
How long ago was that? Yes, literally who okay? Well, I wasn't even talking about that

920
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,800
I like his economic policies. Obviously. I don't like the internment camps, right?

921
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,360
But I'm just saying fdr fucking tax the rich to shit and I think that's awesome

922
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,200
And uh, you know pretty pretty cool stuff

923
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,040
Doesn't invalid doesn't invalidate that other things he did were bad

924
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,640
I don't think may I don't like may's take on the whole thing. She's trying to tell me that I'm wrong and I don't think that I am wrong

925
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,520
And the point is that I hate women. That's it

926
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,640
Understood understood. Yeah, you know

927
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,400
And the and the jews and the japanese I guess of course considering our different

928
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,880
I don't know like our different political beliefs to whatever degree

929
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,520
Uh, I feel like a lot of people would probably think that I'd just be like with these people

930
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:48,400
But like I swear to god guys when I hear these things when I hear like michelle for example, this is just sucking my own dick right now

931
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,680
It's like when I hear michelle like laughing at ben. I really do say

932
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,240
Like well, I mean it's pretty clear ben's talking about the economic policy and like it's pretty you know

933
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,880
I'm not talking about the other shit

934
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,200
Yeah, I like that he he put a he put a 100. Well, he proposed a 100 percent

935
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:14,080
Good gracious a 100 percent like wealth, uh, like wealth like tax bracket above $25,000

936
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,960
Which was about 400 to 500

937
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,320
You know

938
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,880
Well, it was about $500 in in the period time of the period a great quote

939
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,760
I heard recently recently sam harris was getting some pushback for like having different

940
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,560
um, I mean people are getting mad at him for having like different opinions on um, like like islamic terror versus like white

941
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,200
Nationals terror and whatever it's a complex. It was a great podcast

942
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,040
I thought was very interesting on his um the making sense podcast people should go listen to it

943
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,160
I think it's very interesting

944
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,280
But like one of the things he said was just like one of the quotes was just like

945
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,400
If someone likes he said like for example

946
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,440
What about the japanese the japanese have a policy of japan is for the japanese

947
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,280
We don't want you know to to intermingle with others and he's like and what about that?

948
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,760
He's like i'm happy to take this point from hitler himself and to debate

949
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:09,440
The the the merits of this argument because it doesn't matter who they're from and I couldn't agree more that that's the smartest way to operate

950
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,080
Um, so basically natus saying go hitler

951
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,800
He made some good points the autobahn guys

952
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,960
He's really killing it with that autobahn to this day fan fantastic

953
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,440
So there and you know so f dr did some like I don't know I think george washington had some good things

954
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,240
You know columbus day was recently a lot of people have very negative things about columbus

955
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,760
But surely we can say it was a different time that doesn't excuse it

956
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,920
But can't we just celebrate the good things? I discovered in america for europe pretty nice. Okay, like i'm like, you know

957
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:42,960
I just think uh, you know, we could we could not do the internment camp thing

958
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,360
We could not turn away

959
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:52,560
We could not turn away people fleeing the holocaust, but we could still do the new deal

960
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,840
We could do the new we could do a new new deal, which I think

961
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:03,920
We're probably pretty good about now. It helped with the last big depression. We're in another one. Hmm. Hmm. What's to be done?

962
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,160
you know I I

963
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:12,240
Hashtag I stand with women unlike ben, uh, but but uh, I do think

964
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,000
I I do hate it when people when you're I mean you're trying to make a point about something and people do a lot of what about

965
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,160
Ism and you know these

966
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,440
I don't know. I'm just saying what are you saying?

967
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,720
I'm saying that it's a pet peeve of mine when like well, okay on twitter is a format that's

968
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,880
Nobody's gonna take it seriously

969
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,600
It's a terrible place to have substantive debates and whatnot because it's not face-to-face as far as we anonymized

970
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,040
So I get why a lot of people come out and goof and gaffe and but whatever you take a positive stance on anything

971
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,880
Like just now I made some vaguely positive Christopher Columbus points. Like it was pretty cool. He discovered America

972
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:52,640
Of course, you can say that like his discovery of America resulted in many many bad things

973
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,160
And affirmative stance is open criticism. There's a video

974
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,160
Yeah, okay. Everyone's everyone's on the the Christopher Columbus hate train. Yes

975
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,520
There's a video I've seen being like, you know

976
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:11,440
Christopher Columbus didn't really like personally do a lot of the bad stuff that we say like, oh

977
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:17,120
Wait, I don't know. I mean like knowing better. You're talking about because he's yeah, I think so

978
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,440
I think it's knowing better that guy made a point

979
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:26,240
I because I happen to see this fairly recently, you know with all this being discussed that like a lot of people accuse him of genocide

980
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,240
But yeah, I mean the fact that uh, when you dig into why that is

981
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:37,360
A lot of it ties back into the fact that like disease wiped out 90 percent of the Native American population

982
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:43,920
But they literally didn't even know what disease was like at the time and they could not have intended the genocide

983
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:50,080
Even if they wanted to they couldn't have because of you know, so like I mean, I'm sure there's many other specific things

984
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:56,400
You know that um that in defense of columbus video in defense of columbus an exaggerated evil is pretty good

985
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,120
I think it was the first knowing better video I ever saw and it's it's a good one like

986
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:06,560
He did he did do some pretty shitty stuff, but like absolutely not maybe not as much as everyone

987
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:11,440
Kind of just says he did I don't know there's there's nuance to all of history, you know

988
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:19,600
Yeah, I feel like a lot of this falls into my mo of like for example when people get too excited about one piece chapters

989
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:26,000
I am here to regulate and say you are too excited about these chapters and when people are too critical

990
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
of historical figures who could

991
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,000
A lot of this is like I'm in the 20th century the 21st century

992
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:37,520
Of course, we know x y z things are bad. You're too critical of these historical figures

993
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,880
Well, uh, you know relax on that reaction my my issue with the whole thing of like everyone stay in your lane

994
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,720
Calm down the issue I feel with people judging historical figures

995
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:52,400
So harshly is that like we're all doing things that in a hundred years will be morally reprehensible. We just don't know

996
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,480
I'm not

997
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,360
I'm on the right side of history

998
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,320
Oh, we just don't know like like society culture is going to change and like the standards are going to evolve

999
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,040
And we're all going to do things that are like backwards and stupid at that point

1000
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,760
It's not like we've reached the end point of moral progression

1001
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,960
So the cast stone backwards is to also inculcate all of us as being terrible people as well

1002
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,040
And for all time it's very simple

1003
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,440
It's it's very easy and I like it's very easy to say that yes to some degree

1004
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,400
Christopher columbus engaged in the slave trade to some degree that seems to be true

1005
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:32,080
He's just a little bit of a slaver, but you know what it was exactly the thing

1006
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:38,560
Okay, then does that mean everything he did because of that is forever bad and forever tainted

1007
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:45,760
No, but nobody nobody says everything was bad unless you're one of my idiot twitter enemies

1008
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,160
Says like no, didn't you know f dr was actually a fascist?

1009
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,720
I just want people to be consistent as long as you agree. Yes f dr did bad things, but let's focus on the good

1010
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,360
You know his economic policy winning world war two or whatever it was he did all good stuff

1011
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,360
Same with columbus same with washington ending the great depression

1012
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,160
Pretty good. Pretty good stuff winning world war two

1013
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,200
But you know on the other hand I feel like I'm being a bit of a nanny and people like michelle would be out here

1014
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,640
Bunking me on the noggin and saying nate. I'm just trying to mean bro. I'm just trying to mean

1015
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,200
Michelle doesn't think

1016
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:30,400
Michelle I'm speaking directly to you. Oh, you don't think that jokes mean anything

1017
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:35,520
But they do and they're funny because they mean something they have real victims

1018
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,840
They have real victims and you're talking to michelle thinks that if you're making a joke

1019
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,680
Nothing you say has to mean anything, but if that were true, you wouldn't laugh

1020
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,200
You wouldn't laugh would you think about it? Damn

1021
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,200
Damn damn debunked for all time. I'd say

1022
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,480
Say hello to the tolerant laugh once again ladies

1023
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,520
They're back and they're better than ever

1024
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,480
Do we want to go to voicemails? I think we should go to voicemails. How many fucking voicemails do we have?

1025
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,880
So, okay, there's there's 11 slash 12 because one's a two-parter

1026
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,880
We you know, we might not need to play that two-parter

1027
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,320
You I'll let you decide when we get there because it may or may not warrant it

1028
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,840
But all right, you get it started. Let's let's roll first up started in here tails of a virgin

1029
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,640
Oh, of course, everyone speak pipe link down below leave us a voicemail. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you very much

1030
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,120
Okay tails of a virgin. Let's go on the count of three. All right. You guys you guys ready? Yeah

1031
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,480
Okay the count of three one two three

1032
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,600
I don't think I've ever been terribly interested in sex or dating. I'm a little bit too autistic

1033
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,080
for all that. So I'm still a virgin

1034
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,000
but

1035
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
But I once got very very close to popping that cherry

1036
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,720
A friend of my mom was injured in an accident involving some fuckface

1037
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,240
So she was helping develop on her gas line or some shit

1038
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:02,880
So she was out of commission for a while and I went there. I lived there for about a month helping her

1039
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:08,000
Taking care of her her dogs like where this is guy, you know, just no being there

1040
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:15,280
And after the first three weeks, I think on the third weekend of me being there

1041
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,000
her sister ends up coming down and

1042
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,400
I mean at this point, I I know everyone pretty well

1043
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm decent friends with everyone and she tells me her sister now the lady who got injured her sister

1044
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:34,320
Told me hey, I used to be a porn star. So we started to talk about that. I'm like that's that's actually really interesting like

1045
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,640
How does that work?

1046
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,880
And she you know kind of understanding that I'm an autistic little boy who's fucking homeschool all of his life was like, hey

1047
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,680
want to fuck

1048
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,600
and I said

1049
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,760
no

1050
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,880
The reason

1051
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,720
She's 50 fucking six or some shit. Yeah gross

1052
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,000
Yeah, okay

1053
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,120
That's a while ago. That's a porn star from the 70s or so. Yeah

1054
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,760
a little bit little later, you know, I mean

1055
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,760
I

1056
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,400
Cool story bro, but unironically cool story

1057
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,640
Kind of a cool story that I enjoyed hearing

1058
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,840
Imagine that good for you

1059
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,240
Uh, how unfortunate maybe one day you'll find a porn star who's not

1060
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,560
50 something when you are

1061
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:26,560
When I feel like a lot of people perhaps a lot of virgins out there listening to this or maybe not

1062
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,640
Would be like whoa, bro for girls said I want to fuck. You know, I do it instantly

1063
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,120
I mean unironically if you're a virgin and a girl just comes up and says let's fuck

1064
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:41,120
You don't know what you're doing and it's like embarrassing and like I would I absolutely would have done the same thing

1065
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:47,360
I've been too scared to do anything. Yeah, I don't I just don't blame you. I don't know about any all any all that

1066
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,600
I don't know about any all that

1067
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:56,240
But I do love these stories from virgins that are like bro. I was so close to losing by virgini

1068
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,000
Now granted this one's a little bit more real than a lot of those unless you're making it up

1069
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,920
I mean, I can't prove he isn't but a lot of dude this girl. She was giving me the look

1070
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,560
I totally could have smashed bro. Yeah, totally could have smashed

1071
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,440
I just chose not to because I love god and I love jesus and I didn't want to come between the two of us

1072
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,120
That's uh, that's the story I can get into

1073
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:22,560
Fuck yeah, dude now that's that's what gets me excited. It's thinking about being married to god. Let's go to the next one

1074
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,400
Speaking of god, uh, next one is from oh voicemail god is real once and for all

1075
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:37,360
Let me just uh, okay. I'm ready. Yeah, you got it. Okay on the count of three. Here we go one two three voicemail god here guys

1076
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,640
Apparently I need to prove my existence

1077
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:46,960
So I'm here to take credit for the five voicemails that were mine that were played on episode 180

1078
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,560
number one

1079
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,040
Sound like the morning somewhere

1080
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,680
Pick a number guy

1081
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,200
PCP shadow puppet master guy professional nate trigger

1082
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,840
And some of my other characters

1083
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,640
Such as pcp professional bit ruiners pcp promise guy

1084
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,160
Uh retarded ben head yang ganger guy

1085
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,840
And yeah, I mean I I'm real god is real. I'm a natehead. I don't remember any of this

1086
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,560
So I think I'm above everyone so that makes me god

1087
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:25,520
He's a natehead and a benhead the universe motherfuckers impossible. You that almost proves his divinity because you can't be a benhead and a natehead

1088
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,520
Well, he's like the alpha and the omega like you'd have to that's totally contradictory

1089
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:35,200
Everything everything I believe is everything you hate and vice versa

1090
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:41,680
That that's definitely true. So I don't quite understand. Um, I'll just have to take his word

1091
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,360
He was on five voicemails. Okay, apparently again, I'm kind of just taking his works

1092
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:50,000
I'm not going to go fucking unless unless the people who left those other voicemails call in and challenge his class

1093
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,480
Yeah, uh, uh voicemail antichrist. Please call in and prove that he's lying and he's exaggerating. Um, you know

1094
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:01,280
Do do something about that. Is he on the shortlist for uh, voice voice grail

1095
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,000
I feel like this guy is going to voice purgatory. Uh, you know to voice hell

1096
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,240
Uh, well, maybe not hell, but he's totally neutral if he hasn't gotten into voice

1097
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,640
Grail on purpose here

1098
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,120
I mean if he's the voicemail god, he's already there, right? Like we don't he's a voice heaven, I guess, right?

1099
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:21,840
He doesn't need our help. Oh god the voice cosmology is so convoluted expanding

1100
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:27,440
I know we need a voice manual of the planes sort of pcp voice lecture. I gotta lay it all out

1101
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,960
All right, next one is from marlowe. Are you guys you got it? I'm ready. I gotta get ready

1102
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,680
Okay, all right count of three one two three

1103
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:40,640
So I found podcasts this week that also happened to be called the procrastinators podcast

1104
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,240
A clear case of copyright infringement as they also use the word podcast in their title

1105
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,840
So about them they only have one episode published so far

1106
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:54,560
It's posted five months ago. It's only five minutes. Oh, and worst of all

1107
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,400
episode title is referencing and avoiding plagiarism

1108
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,960
Here's a sample

1109
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,560
Another episode of the procrastinators podcast

1110
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,760
Today I'll be going solo because big jay is away. So you're stuck with me for this episode

1111
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,720
Then keeps talking for a while

1112
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,480
uh-huh

1113
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,920
Trust me

1114
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,040
Now when you're looking for information for your assignments, it can be hard to find exactly what you're looking for

1115
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:26,000
Using the advanced search tool in the deacon library allows you to pinpoint exactly what you want

1116
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,240
Also, if you're looking for a book to borrow you can see if it's in stock at the deacon lock

1117
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:36,880
See you get the point. Well, I'm saying is you guys need to jump on this guy fast before he starts siphoning your patreon box

1118
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,440
Tenderly yours

1119
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,440
marlowe

1120
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,800
Thank you marlowe or maybe we should let him continue to work in

1121
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,840
In obscurity because then people who become his fans will find our patreon and pledge thinking we're him

1122
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,800
I say we can let him do our work for us

1123
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:01,760
Yeah, we so he's made one episode five months ago with his co-host not present for that particular episode

1124
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,600
But I think there's a flourishing community

1125
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,080
So we'll only I will demand if he makes further episodes

1126
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:13,120
You have to link our patreon in your description and not have you know your own patreon if we can arrange that I think

1127
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,520
I think we can let him stand he can be um

1128
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,840
What's the word the the tendrils of the pcp can continue to expand and encompass all

1129
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,440
Similar podcasts deal. That's fine. I have to pee

1130
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,120
Um, can you play the next one while I take a piss?

1131
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,880
But the next one's called tails gets trolled though. I think you want to hear it. Okay. Okay. We'll do the next one

1132
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:41,040
And then he can go piss. Okay. Uh the count of three tails gets trolled one two three. Hey ben. I know uh talks with

1133
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,360
having

1134
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,360
laserbot on the show

1135
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,520
Fell through and that didn't work out

1136
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,680
but

1137
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:54,000
I've listened to the tails gets trolled lecture maybe a hundred times and

1138
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,480
uh

1139
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,920
Every time tom says uh ben like one punch upgrade this or whatever

1140
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,240
Uh, I like really want that to happen

1141
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,360
So all I'm saying is

1142
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:16,720
Do you have interest in doing that? No, and also I would be willing to back it if you did

1143
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,160
End up doing that especially if there was no I got question

1144
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,320
I got some sort of a slime comic to make

1145
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,320
I'm really sorry. Let's play just much much more filled than it was during

1146
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:32,080
I'm really sorry that that's something you're really interested in and I'm just absolutely not gonna do it

1147
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:37,760
But I'm not gonna waste my fucking life redrawing tails gets trolled when you've already done tails get trolled

1148
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,320
If you want to remaster tails gets trolled

1149
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:45,360
Like you just got to go learn source filmmaker download all the models because they're all copyrighted characters that have source

1150
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,360
Filmmaker models anyway, just do it yourself

1151
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,000
Yeah, that's true. Be the change you want to see it doesn't require artistic vision at this point, you know

1152
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,360
But you see I mean this guy at least he's saying I'm willing to financially back

1153
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,240
I respect I respect that

1154
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,720
But I'm definitely not I'm just I'm just not interested in making that a thing

1155
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,920
If this guy can gather thousands and thousands of people

1156
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,880
I mean you can surely you can find some artists who's interested in this although

1157
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,960
I don't know if laserbot would like legally allow it if that's like allowed. I mean

1158
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:19,680
You would think he would have some combat one online creator at a time. He's currently combating christian

1159
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,320
I gotta wait for sport you would think you would think well

1160
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:29,520
I mean I am probably gonna combat ululia at some point because ululia fucking left me in the lurch on the audiobook thing

1161
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:35,040
And I'm ready to unfortunate whenever the whenever this whole thing with chris is over. I think I'm gonna say fuck that guy

1162
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:40,160
I'm gonna take that into my own hands. The elemental masters will face the wrath of slime city

1163
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,120
Pretty

1164
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,440
All right, go pee go thank god

1165
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,560
Get out of here. All right. Well, we'll play the next and all he's gone. Let's do a literally the law

1166
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,080
Okay, let's see what that's about one two three

1167
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,520
Hello, pcp

1168
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:03,520
This officer Jenkins from the mall and as of right now you are all under arrest for the defamation of humanity via

1169
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:10,240
The existence of this podcast itself anything you say pass this point can and will be used against you in court

1170
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:16,000
Oh, and don't try to be smart getting the paperwork filed out for criminals in a state and abroad took us a while

1171
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,400
So by the time you receive this voicemail, we should literally be dunking a donut in your living room

1172
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,720
Come out with your hands up and your hands down

1173
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,320
We've made special accommodations for each of you. So there's no point in resisting

1174
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,400
We traps for the digi bro

1175
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,480
Tiger nets for the mage a fake sign pointed toward the bernie poles for the bend a fake sign pointed towards starfleet for the

1176
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,880
Nate a trailer ones for the munchie a wheelchair for the tom and a pair of handcuffs

1177
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,520
With i'm just being cool written on them for the jesse

1178
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,360
Now, I don't know why anyone would be dumb enough to put on those cuffs voluntarily

1179
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,560
But that's what the google doc says. So I gotta believe it like the torah

1180
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,800
There's another name at the bottom of the page

1181
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,480
Davoo

1182
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:58,320
Davo. Yeah, it looks like a time. It happens. Anyways, that's all I had to say. See you fuck is in prison

1183
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:04,160
Well, well, that's it. We're going to jail. There's no escape. You want to guess that's all

1184
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,920
Samurai's for me

1185
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,600
We're going to this guy

1186
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:14,480
The the the pc police are they've entered our homes and they are in fact here arresting us at this very moment and

1187
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,280
Yeah, what can you do about that? Well?

1188
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:23,040
Shelter and three square meals a day is more than I can claim to now. So, you know, perhaps this is an upgrade

1189
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,600
Jokes on you. Yeah, we we've been begging for this. We've been hoping for this all along

1190
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:33,920
Uh, all right. Well, there you go. Let's move on to the next one. Yeah, we've got weak willed wagey is calling in

1191
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:40,560
Let's hear uh with this this hero of the common man has to say all right on the count of three ready one

1192
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,920
Two three

1193
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,600
So I recently become a wage cook and here are the three things that I've learned so far

1194
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,040
Number one, you will have no more free time ever

1195
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,400
Number two, you will never wear jeans again

1196
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,480
You will have a closet full of jeans and other fun fucking t-shirts and clothes

1197
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,520
That you will never wear again because you'll only wear them on the weekends

1198
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,600
But you're going to be too tired to do anything on the weekends

1199
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,400
So fucking all your clothes are trash

1200
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,640
uh and number three

1201
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,920
um

1202
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,920
The shotgun's gonna look pretty tasty

1203
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:16,000
So that's what I've learned being a wage cook so far. Um, how ben and tom how have you guys?

1204
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:21,680
Survived how have you guys managed to not starve to death? I want to learn your ways. Um

1205
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,200
Well, I got uh, I got one word for you

1206
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,080
patreon.com

1207
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,400
St

1208
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:39,840
Yeah, that's literally what's kept me alive. Well, I mean that and youtube ad revenue and twitch donations and you know, whatever

1209
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,880
You just got to make yourself a brand

1210
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,840
And abuse other people's kindness

1211
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,400
Yeah, oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean that's that's a big that's what it's all about

1212
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,760
You can't expect to do like the the dream

1213
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,280
It's like when you if you look at a guy doing the olympics and you're like, I want to do the olympics

1214
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,520
I'm gonna do it today. Well, that's unrealistic

1215
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,360
You've got to get a plan going and if you want to be a you know a leech on society

1216
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:08,400
You know internet artist freak show you have to set the stage it takes years to cultivate that

1217
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:15,840
That you know ability so you gotta take years to completely destroy any sense of ethics or morality you have exactly

1218
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:22,320
Well, you see we're all born with a god-given sense of morality and it takes years to dismantle that brick by brick by brick

1219
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,120
So you gotta get to work on that immediately

1220
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:31,360
And uh, the it will pay off in the long term. You have to lose everything to gain everything or some

1221
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes something like that. All right next one lecture me dads

1222
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:40,960
Okay, let's see what this individual has to say on the count of three one two three

1223
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,120
So i'm a huge pcp head and recently on episode 180

1224
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:51,680
You guys are talking about how you were wondering if anybody discovered the pcp because of ben's christian lecture

1225
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,400
And i am definitely one of those people

1226
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:59,120
I think a lot of people came into the pcp because of that like really excellent lecture

1227
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,600
Your guys's lectures are the fucking bomb

1228
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,120
They get

1229
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,800
Way more views than anything else this little club has ever fucking created

1230
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:12,000
It's true. Well in a completely different league like we're talking like digi bro levels of fucking views

1231
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:18,880
Just for these fucking lectures if you guys were smart you would have rad con five or six or whatever fucking rad con rat now

1232
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,240
You would have that be the fucking rad con

1233
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:27,920
Conference the rad con seminar where you just do fucking lecture after lecture

1234
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,080
I want three lectures from each of you on my desk that's fucking next week

1235
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,880
Because that shit would get you guys millions of views

1236
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:40,720
Whatever your lecture would be about that would attract viewers related to that topic who would then be introduced to the pcp

1237
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:47,600
It's it's just fucking algorithmic. It's fucking beautiful. It's long form content. It's the good shit. It's algorithmic

1238
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,800
Fucking make the big break. You guys deserve it fucking do lectures. God damn it

1239
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:59,760
Yeah, that aptly stated. Yeah, I mean we've we've kind of talked about that before about how like the lectures are like

1240
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:04,640
Proven content that does work with the way youtube is the problem. I mean

1241
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,560
I think the the reason we don't do more of them is just because

1242
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:14,880
Like part of the the whole appeal is you have the the audience, you know, everybody else listening and we're not all

1243
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,960
In the same place. Yeah, that's the total there's a there's a lot of prep involved in doing these

1244
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:27,280
Yeah, there's only I do I do wish we had more ready access to do them like

1245
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:34,080
Imagine if we could like it's it's easy to do we just need like the camera man is actually very important in those

1246
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:39,280
So yeah, the camera man and the mic the mic setup setup is like actually crucial

1247
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:46,160
Yeah, I mean we've talked about like one of the things we would do with pcphq would we have a studio that set up to do

1248
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:51,120
You know lectures on a more regular basis and we just hey we're going to the studio and recording one

1249
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,160
And uh, it would be easy peasy. Yeah, but the dream of pcphq is dead, so

1250
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,680
Unless you give us more money double your patron now. No

1251
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,440
No, it's well, maybe it's dead for you ben, but not for me

1252
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,600
Okay, if i don't know if pcp is like two of us live in the same place, then okay

1253
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,440
I don't I mean, I don't even think that I can just this is the new thing

1254
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,800
pcphq doesn't have to be a place of residence if we're rich enough

1255
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:24,240
We can just fly everybody out on the weekly. Oh, I see I see technically speaking. I suppose that's true, but uh, I mean

1256
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:30,960
If we made more money that would change the whole equation a morphous concept that can take whatever form is most convenient for us

1257
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:35,360
I basically I agree. Well, and you put it like that. I'm a little more sympathetic

1258
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:41,360
Okay, okay. Let's go to our next one here. Uh center point x nexus ship thick. Okay. This is the one

1259
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:48,240
Nexus, so let's let's hear what this one is. Okay three. Oh, sorry. One two three nexus

1260
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:53,520
Come on, dude. Chili's on fire your people are rioting and the government is corrupt

1261
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:58,800
Okay, like look if you actually want to get fucking out of chili and and come to america, dude

1262
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,480
I I will actually unironically marry you to get you here, man

1263
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:09,680
Come on come on. No sex required. No gayness. Just just straightforward, uh corrupt marriage. Let's go

1264
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:14,800
Yeah, you got to do you got to pull a ross and holly and just have a sham marriage

1265
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:21,440
Like how like ross did to get a fucking american green card or whatever. I swear to god. That's true. I I'm convinced

1266
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,160
That's what happened. Yes. That's just it's just my pet theory, but I am convinced

1267
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,400
That is fascinating. I mean just the timeline all line up for that stuff

1268
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:36,960
Well, the reason I think that is because holly talked about jared being like the first person to like stir feelings in her

1269
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,480
That like made her think like maybe i'm not asexual like I thought

1270
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,160
Implying that she was asexual while she was with ross

1271
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:51,040
So, well, you know, we do know asexual people who are in relationships despite that and I wonder if

1272
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:56,640
You know, I wonder if yeah, but it'd be really a sexual person obviously, but whatever. I mean, obviously doesn't exist

1273
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,880
We all know that but so, you know, well, okay

1274
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,600
So if you're not fucking then the question is why and it's just like well ross is an australian

1275
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:10,240
But I'm I think he obviously wanted to move to america because he did and a marriage with holly sure would be convenient for that

1276
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:19,120
And you know their breakup sure was drama free, you know, so I think probably they just fucking did it for the green card like why not

1277
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,360
You know, I mean they probably liked each other fine, you know

1278
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,840
Um, I just think that there's I mean this this discovery of feelings or whatever

1279
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,560
I mean that that's all cool and all that. Oh my god imagine not to be mean but like imagine pro jared

1280
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,200
I know awakens your sexuality

1281
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:42,160
Jesus christ. Well, it's because the guy wasn't because it happened. It's because it happened through it wasn't holly and jared

1282
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,160
It was deith and strict snate

1283
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,960
That's why I have to give the deith and strict's lecture

1284
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:52,880
Her oc is not asexual you see and that's why it was able to happen and you know

1285
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:59,600
Damn fast. There's so much so many layers to this story. I swear. That is interesting. That is interesting. Okay. Well, anyway, it is and I

1286
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,240
Was just thinking about this yesterday

1287
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,320
Well, that's actually a pretty funny story. Maybe I should tell it

1288
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:11,200
Uh, yeah, it's details like that that make I don't know like all these stories like the lectures and whatever

1289
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:18,160
Makes them interesting like digi's background. No lore about the dick stuff and my kingdom hearts. I don't know whatever anyway

1290
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,600
All right next time. Let's go pc purgatory application

1291
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:26,000
Uh, all right, let's see what's up with that on the count of three one two three

1292
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:32,640
Oh, fuck. I'm sorry. I just forgot to start mine. I was I was totally spaced out

1293
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,200
Oh, but you know what I forgot to say, okay

1294
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,280
Everybody gets one and I was gonna say by the way nexus getting contact with center point in some way

1295
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,520
He says he'll do it. Let's get you out of chile, buddy. Let's uh, it sounds pretty rough over there

1296
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,400
Let's call his bluff. Okay. I'm ready and by the way, I don't understand

1297
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,160
You know what? Okay, never mind the whole marriage for just weird purposes thing

1298
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:55,680
Like what what is the actual like legal reason you're supposed to get married? Like do you have to like love?

1299
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,520
I swear to god

1300
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:03,840
I swear to god like part of me wants to just like like go on craigslist and just find someone

1301
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:10,000
Okay, I told someone some of this and they were like you technically have to co-habitate. It's like, oh, well that's uh

1302
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,360
Like I should literally just marry one of my roommates like just for the tax break

1303
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,520
Like I would do it because I don't give a fuck

1304
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,320
Because like who cares I just I'm just

1305
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,800
If it would save me money, fuck it

1306
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,440
Once we accepted that like I mean a gay marriage or whatever. It's fine. I don't care

1307
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,320
It's just like, okay

1308
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:33,440
That's obviously not for the traditional breeding practices that presumably marriage was for once we said like that's normal and fine

1309
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:39,760
It seems to me. I'm not trying to make like a slippery slope disrespectful argument. I'm just saying we're now we're just saying it's like for basically

1310
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,440
Any purpose we want which is fine. I don't care. So

1311
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:49,040
Doors open. Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure anything involving getting it getting a break from the government

1312
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,840
Well, there'll be extra scrutiny involved just because the government totally sucks

1313
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,720
I just don't understand like what the standard is though

1314
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:02,160
Like what is a legitimate marriage as opposed to an illegitimate one now. You gotta love each other. I don't I don't know

1315
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,720
It seems like the the the condition is cohabitation

1316
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,520
Oh, I guess that's fair. But I

1317
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,400
I just aren't you already cohabitating with like five other people

1318
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:16,480
Yeah, exactly. I should literally just fucking gay marry one of my roommates and

1319
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,200
Why not not give a fuck?

1320
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:25,360
Yeah, all right. Anyway, let's go to uh next one. Oh, right. We okay. This is a PC purgatory application

1321
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,040
All right on the count of three one two three slaps

1322
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,600
Relyaminated resume on table

1323
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:38,640
What's up PCP? I'm here to apply for the new job known as the head of the PC purgatory

1324
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,240
And my qualifications are simply this

1325
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,280
For the past by the time you're listening to this

1326
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,680
15 episodes, I've had one to three voicemails about her episode

1327
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,440
And well, that's why I think I should be the head of the PC purgatory

1328
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:05,040
And because none of my voicemails have either been grailed or jailed. So let me know what you think. Thanks

1329
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,160
That is quite a distinction to be on that. Is this the same guy as the proving being god?

1330
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,120
I believe that it is. I believe that it is. Okay, like I can't so

1331
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,480
I I mean this guy obviously leaves a lot of fucking voicemails as we're hearing

1332
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,560
This guy obviously leaves a lot to be desired

1333
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:31,920
We know who blew through our fucking storage and got got us that warning from speak pipe now

1334
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:37,680
Oh, yeah, it's your fault you fucking clod by the bio. You know what a small update on the speak pipe

1335
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,160
We still have that message up top saying like you have full user account, but they're still going in

1336
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,960
I mean, do I need to clear it out? I'm kind of want to see how far we can push this before it

1337
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:54,960
You know here's my proposal mate. I feel like we wait. We see how it goes and if we do end up getting charged

1338
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,040
I think we make this guy head of PC purgatory and his job is to pay that fee

1339
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,560
Haha, ooh, I like this plan. This is a good plan. Although at any time we could just delete all the old voicemails

1340
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:10,720
That might take a while, but uh, it'd be really funny. It'd be really funny

1341
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:15,440
Um, good thing we have somebody in charge of the PC purgatory to do that task for us. Thank god for that

1342
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,240
All right, I'm first voicemail

1343
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:24,640
I'm all for I'm all for outsourcing that shit. Um, all right. Here we go. Next one is Linus lucky

1344
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,560
All right, and let's play on the count of three one two three

1345
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,600
Hey, I got a question for all the art boys in the pcb. How do you guys feel about people drawing glued fan art of your characters?

1346
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:39,920
Like I know ben said he's really touched and honored when somebody takes the time to draw a character that he made

1347
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,400
But would that change if they made like

1348
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,320
Vince with a giant slong porpoise into his roommate? I forgot a name. I'm sorry

1349
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,200
Also, I would like to use the zoomie as a flesh like goodbye

1350
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,840
No, uh, I would feel I mean, I wouldn't be like mad

1351
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:04,320
I wouldn't really like it just disappointed. I would just be kind of like

1352
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:10,320
Yeah, I'd still be flatter that someone was drawing them, but I'd be kind of icked out

1353
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:18,480
What if he's totally realistic? I mean like having vinston like an or an orgy or whatever, uh, uh, I mean that's possibly unrealistic

1354
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,040
Oh, like like if it was like true to the character or something

1355
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:26,240
Yeah, what if he was just jacking off alone in his room as I'm sure he does, uh, you know, yeah

1356
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:34,240
That would be I mean, that's better. Obviously still still I just don't I just don't want to see that but like whatever right

1357
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:39,040
My standards are way lower any any fan art you want to do is fine in my book

1358
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:43,120
If that's that's how you want to make it happen then go for it

1359
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:48,320
Yes, spread the word spread the word you retweet explicit flesh light usage is zoomie porn

1360
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,280
If it's tasteful if it's tasteful

1361
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,280
That sounds like a definition of tasteful

1362
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,040
Well, you never know

1363
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,680
Never know who you're dealing with but uh, that's yeah

1364
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:05,280
If if twitter still had moments, I'd make a whole nsfw fan art moment and I'd put them all in there

1365
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:10,480
So people could browse them. Okay. I would not I would not I would not retweet nsfw

1366
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,480
Fan art, but I it's not that I not because I don't appreciate it

1367
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,720
It's because it's not my brand anyway. My twitter is not a place for the

1368
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,360
It's always it's always interesting when I see

1369
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:27,360
Accounts I follow that are like seemingly not doing porn, but then they just retweets porn out of nowhere

1370
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:32,480
And I'm like, I mean, that's fine. I'm not offended. Just wasn't expecting it. Yeah. Um, yeah. All right. Anyway

1371
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:38,160
Oh, wait, there was something I was going to say about this. I can't remember what it is. So maybe I'll remember later

1372
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:42,800
Okay, whatever. Let's move on for our last voicemail. Uh now this one. Okay. Here we go. This is

1373
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,160
119

1374
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:50,240
Which I believe is the number we selected last week as our, you know, we were asked to select a number

1375
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:55,200
We memed him with pi and now we've chosen hard the number 119. Okay. All right

1376
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:00,320
Because it was 119 backwards. Cool. So, uh, so let's hear what he has to say on the count of three

1377
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:05,520
Finally one at long last the saga will conclude. Okay. One two three

1378
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,760
119

1379
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,880
Pretty good number. I was rooting for 144

1380
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,400
But for the purpose of my bid, it doesn't really matter too much

1381
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,240
But I still like 119 as well. So thanks for suggesting that

1382
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,440
Anyways, this is where the bit was going

1383
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,720
I'm about to drop some truth bombs

1384
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:29,680
All right, the war on normal people page 119

1385
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:37,520
Compounding the problem is that Americans now move across state lines and change jobs at

1386
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:41,040
lower rates than at any point in the last several decades. Oh, no

1387
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,880
The annual rate of interstate relocation dropped from about

1388
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,520
5

1389
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,440
70 to about

1390
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:54,160
1.6 percent, you know what I'm bored. I'm bored. Let's just end it. Let's just end it. I'm done

1391
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:59,280
You know, you know, I got the bit Munchie gave me. Yeah. Good. Good job. Good job

1392
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:06,400
You mean us into playing three whole voicemails for you unless you're unless your voicemail god in which case it's like a hundred

1393
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:11,120
He concluded it by the way, this in case you don't realize this is Andrew Yang's book book

1394
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:15,760
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, I knew that the war on normal people you know, but I don't know about everybody

1395
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:21,920
Munchie gave me his like info and signed me into his um audible account

1396
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,800
So I have access to all of his audio books. Um, I listened to um

1397
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,680
God in the state by uh, bakunin, um, which was fine

1398
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,600
um

1399
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,600
and then uh

1400
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,720
I started listening to the war on normal people

1401
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:46,720
And you just like I thought uh, I quit it because it was boring because I've heard all the interviews with him

1402
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,840
I know

1403
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:54,000
Right. I know everything he has to say his book is just like it's just like a longer version like it's like adam

1404
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,320
I wasn't good. I didn't like it

1405
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,360
I didn't wasn't learn anything. No, I feel a little bit bad about cutting that

1406
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:04,880
Should we just in the editing let him play the whole thing before we know? Okay. All right. Fuck it. Go read

1407
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:09,200
You know all the arguments, but does everybody else out there know all the all the points?

1408
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,480
Yeah, but

1409
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,880
Reading I feel like if you want to listen to short form versions of entry yang's points, there's more

1410
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:20,400
Interesting ways of getting it. Okay. All right. I appreciate the bit though. Uh, mysterious stranger

1411
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:24,880
We need like a name for this guy. It's fine. That's his name. Um, I'm just saying with pie

1412
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,360
You could have gone 14 percent down page three or whatever. That's exactly what I was gonna say

1413
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:35,280
Why not just start down a couple lines on page three? That's uncreative thinking god voice god

1414
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,560
You need to step up your game, sir. You could have made it work

1415
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,920
But I forgive you. I I forgive you. I just I just

1416
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,440
I just was listening to it and I was like, uh, yeah

1417
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:51,680
Yep, truckers if you listen to a bunch of a lot of american sure do work as truckers

1418
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:56,240
Uh, yeah, automatic cars sure are gonna put them out of business soon

1419
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:02,800
I've heard yawn. I've goes back to accruing capital maliciously and exploitatively

1420
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,000
I've heard this before yang yang

1421
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,960
How dare he make the same argument? I mean, that's probably why I mean, you know, bernie or whatever

1422
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,720
I mean a lot of people are like, yeah, we've heard bernie's point. I mean, it's to his credit

1423
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:19,120
He says the same thing, you know, because he's been consistent his entire political career

1424
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:24,480
Yeah, it's not that it's not that like I've heard this before and it's dumb. It's just yeah, I've heard this before

1425
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,920
It's you know, I don't need it. I don't need to hear it again

1426
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:33,280
It's in you know, it's kind of similar to our I don't know at least my youtube content whatever you want like a currently

1427
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,680
Like a constantly rolling

1428
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,840
Exposure to new people because the old people are very aware of the things you say

1429
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,080
So you want it just to access new people

1430
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:47,200
So you want to like repackage your ideas in a way that's satisfying for old folks and like

1431
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:52,320
Engaging and interesting for new people or something. Sure. Yeah, I don't know sure balancing acts

1432
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,760
No

1433
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,400
Oh, by the way people the reason we were doing that one two three thing

1434
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,040
I almost forgot

1435
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:01,360
This is what I was thinking of before that I forgot is because rhythm bot is like broken and not working or something

1436
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,320
I don't know why it's doing that. That's why we had to count down weirdly

1437
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,960
And we're sick of it. I don't know all shit. It's it we're having issues at issues

1438
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,600
Elias are could have just edited out the countdowns and then

1439
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,720
No, okay. Well, maybe we'll get to do that, but

1440
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:22,080
It's got to be the real shit dude podcast experience. It's like you're here in my gross room with you, right?

1441
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,200
One time on the pizza party podcast and ben is committed to bringing down the quality of our show

1442
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:33,360
Speaking of speaking of legitimate podcast experience like we do very little uh, like cutting and tweaking at least historically we have

1443
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,360
So I I feel like that's at least somewhat to our credit that we're able to be engaging in high

1444
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,360
That's true for the most part

1445
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:44,320
But I was curious if did you said on his appearance on the on the piece of party podcast years ago

1446
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:49,680
They like heavily edited it and sped it up actually did they do that to yours as well ben? Not that I

1447
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:54,080
Know of I don't think so. Okay, they they they made um

1448
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:59,440
Some very only do it if they think it needs it. I think pan made some very minor like cuts

1449
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:06,240
But like for the most part it's just as as were recorded just upload it as is

1450
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:10,240
Okay, I was and you know actually that reminds me there was another voicemail

1451
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:17,200
I didn't play that was someone saying like ben it's one thing for you to come on the pcp and make your long political points

1452
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,440
It's another thing to go on pan pizzas

1453
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:26,960
Podcast and interject your obnoxious unwanted political discourse into their their precious baby

1454
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:32,640
How could you do such a thing? Those fucking cowards wouldn't even agree that we should smash capitalism

1455
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,400
Oh, those those those fools those rank amateurs

1456
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:42,960
They wouldn't even they didn't even have anyone in mind that they're voting for in the democratic primaries on it

1457
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,400
Like I'm honestly shocked and a little bit embarrassed for them

1458
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:50,400
When is the primary? Is there like time to figure that out? It's like next year, isn't it?

1459
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:53,360
It's it's it's not a good amount of time. It's a way as a way

1460
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,560
But you should have a fucking clue at this point. All right

1461
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:02,240
You are overestimating the political engagement of your average cartoon reviewer on youtube

1462
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,480
What what do you mean?

1463
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:13,120
No, come on. Uh, don't they know how much sur plus capitals being removed from them? They need they need they need burning more than anyone

1464
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,200
They just don't know to pay for their fucking to pay their fucking

1465
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:25,280
Animation school bills like like debt that they went into like because fucking go fund me is not gonna make it for 99% of them

1466
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:30,560
They just need to open up that Kickstarter get that cool 12 grand a year and you know

1467
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:37,680
Engaging I have achieved I have achieved the freedom dividend and I did it and I did it through Kickstarter, baby

1468
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,680
Although papers did it for me

1469
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:45,360
I just want to reiterate because I found this fascinating the way that like and I I said this to you in our chat, which was just like

1470
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:52,000
Uh, actually, you know of interest my dad and I assume, you know, I assume your dad as well

1471
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:57,600
Has been like donating. He's been just been giving us like a couple hundred bucks every once in a while

1472
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,680
Putting it into like a retirement fund. Oh

1473
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,240
Well, he does that he does that for like a um, it's like a holiday like a christmas and birthdays

1474
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,320
He'll put like a deposit is like a gift

1475
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,080
Yeah, he'll put like a deposit. He'll deposit some money into like a um

1476
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,880
Like a like a Roth IRA fund

1477
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:18,080
Basically, but what what I found interesting was for years. He'd been begging me to like Nate. It's in a fund

1478
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,640
That's like not making any money. I need you like it's it's in this company that like does investment for you

1479
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,560
What you're supposed to do

1480
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:29,440
Fidelity I'm learning all this for the first time. I know I did it. I went like no I didn't because I'm an idiot

1481
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,840
No, I finally did I finally did

1482
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:36,400
Take his advice and go and like call the company up and have them put it into a

1483
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,080
Um, well, there's a couple the one that they yeah

1484
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:47,840
I had them put it into a thing called fidelity go, which is a like a mutual yeah a mutual fund that's managed by an algorithm

1485
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,760
Yeah, so so what it is for those who don't know it's like

1486
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:57,760
I mean, it's it is I assume yours is still a because there's there's like tax reasons like we can't get the money until we retire

1487
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,840
It is still an IRA, but it is okay

1488
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:05,440
So so we have like the same thing then I think and it's that you you you put money into it and the people at fidelity

1489
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:11,600
Kindly invest that money for you. And so now technically both of us like own some small stop

1490
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:15,280
I mean, that's what that's what a mutual fund is. That's what it is. I'm learning

1491
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:21,200
I had no idea about any of this shit until just now and so now it's like so I'm finally getting it

1492
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:27,120
I'm like now I actually have a real stake in like the the economy the economy

1493
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:33,920
And if if the market does well those stocks will like increase in value and I will when I retire

1494
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,280
Gain money. I mean, that's that's the idea. That's the idea

1495
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,960
Theoretically yes

1496
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:45,440
So like up to this point. I kind of didn't understand why like I like people would say like, oh no the market's doing bad

1497
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,440
My retirement money. I'm like, don't you like why would that affect your retirement money?

1498
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:54,240
I don't understand but it's because your investments have invested in this shit. Yes

1499
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,560
It all it all makes sense to me now

1500
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:02,720
I don't know my best thing just sounds like a way of putting a ball and chain around you and tying you down to this capitalist system

1501
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:05,120
So when ben blows it up everyone's involved

1502
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:11,200
Oh, yeah, I mean draw. I should withdraw my funds before I start my real revolutionary praxis

1503
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,640
True, although you'll have you'll lose like taxed some amount it like because it's it's the reason

1504
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:21,120
So this is the interesting thing you like quote-unquote you can't take it out until you retire

1505
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:25,440
But if you do it just gets taxed like I don't know some pretty decent amount

1506
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:31,200
So like 10 or 20 percent or something which can be a lot if it's like your your you know retirement fund or whatever

1507
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:36,960
So you want to just leave it there and let them like that's why it's all making sense to me now now

1508
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:40,080
Because all that money's there. It's supposed to be there until I retire

1509
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,280
We you're supposed to pump money into it everyone, you know regularly

1510
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,320
So more money is there can be invested the whole market grows

1511
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:50,000
It's like I now have a stake in the economy doing well

1512
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:56,080
That isn't like solely dependent on just the value of the american dollar, which was everything I had up to this point

1513
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,080
That's where like all my money was now

1514
01:38:58,640 --> 01:38:59,760
it

1515
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:05,360
Now I like the mark if the market grows my investment in the market grows and I'll have more money

1516
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:10,560
So I hope america doesn't crash and all those all those good things. It's funny. I find uh, did you?

1517
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:13,120
Do you just bring this up because you were

1518
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,200
interested in talking about

1519
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,360
The market and interest rates and stuff

1520
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:22,640
I mean because because now yes because now I finally actually have like

1521
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:28,640
An actual experience of real capitalism like I get it now. I'm in there. I'm doing it

1522
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:34,320
And like I feel the urge to like look at the markets and and and and here's the here's the dark cloud

1523
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:37,680
I'm sort of getting it because right now. What if somebody came to me?

1524
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,680
Let's say I was I had like a billion dollars invested and someone was like, oh, hey, Nate

1525
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:47,440
Did you know like these big companies that perhaps you have lots of like stock in they're actually like

1526
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:53,920
Exploiting their workers and they're like doing bad things and they're you know, I don't know polluting the environment

1527
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,240
And they're like, Nate, we should like tell people

1528
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,960
I want you to do it for some reason and I'm like, oh, but I have a lot of stock invested in them

1529
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:07,040
So I think I'm just gonna like not tell the world about these horrible things these companies doing so I can personally profit

1530
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:12,320
From their growth and I'm like, I'm starting to see the picture. I'm starting to get it

1531
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:16,640
You should sell your stock immediately because someone else will do it and then

1532
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:22,320
You can like get fucked. That's what I would do. Um, well, yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm going to keep doing it

1533
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,960
I mean, it's first of all, it's not that much money and I find it interesting

1534
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:30,320
But like I'm I'm getting why these things can be bad and how bad negative things can happen as a result

1535
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,320
you you're

1536
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,720
Are you saying that you are

1537
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:43,440
Understanding why a purely profit-motivated system might have downsides. That's correct, Ben. That's correct

1538
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:48,800
Now you'll stand by it seems like a pretty good system for for helping out the world

1539
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:53,600
And I think it comes down to us as individuals to police these people if they're doing good or bad things

1540
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:01,440
But I can see I'm just saying I can see I see why corruption could be rampant in the system and uh

1541
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:07,760
Could be a new perspective now that I've got experience. Yeah, I don't know might it might theoretically run rampant

1542
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,920
It might perhaps it's possible. Yeah, everyone wants a word with you

1543
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:20,240
Um, I should relook at those things with my newfound understanding of of these of these things. Um and ron good boys

1544
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,240
It's uh, you know, it was kind of a hassle

1545
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:28,960
But uh, it was a pretty good. It was a pretty good fucking gift for dad to do to set up a fucking IRA

1546
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,960
I'm sure I'll appreciate it

1547
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:36,160
Sure, I'll appreciate that in the future. Like I could theoretically have done it myself, but I certainly wasn't going to

1548
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,120
Well, you know, the other thing was while I was doing this

1549
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,840
I opened up another like a non-retirement account that's basically just like investing in the market

1550
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,880
And I'm thinking about just like putting some money in there of my own

1551
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:52,720
I should keep my like like I keep my fucking money in a checking account and like I need to not do that

1552
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,920
Yeah, my money's been in a checking account as well and it is retarded

1553
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:02,880
It is stupid and I'm just losing out like every time I go to my bank. They're like, do you want to open a savings account? I'm like, uh,

1554
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,320
that's

1555
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,600
Work by

1556
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:12,640
Yeah, it's just the worst idea financially uneducated as a populace and these things are so important. They keep us under their capitalist thumb

1557
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:21,920
Well, we luckily we have the internet. They can't repress our uprising now as us. We've become ethical responsible investors and owners of capital

1558
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,080
That's what we need to do as a populace

1559
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:27,520
And uh, I'm a I'm a work on it seize the means of investment

1560
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,520
Exactly. There you go. Um, so there I thought that was an interesting story. Um, I think this is cool

1561
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:38,640
I'll let you know how it goes boys. I'm keeping an eye on the market. I'm invested in the outcome

1562
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,280
That's why they call it that

1563
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:49,120
I got the fidelity app on my phone now. So like I I'm thinking really you're so you're that into it

1564
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,480
Well, I mean, let's not exaggerate here. I I downloaded the app

1565
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:55,280
I checked it like once when I first got it. So like I'm not like

1566
01:42:55,840 --> 01:43:00,880
I mean, I this we're like there was an episode of Seinfeld where Seinfeld invests like $5,000 in the market

1567
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:05,280
I called them up. I had them put it into fidelity go and then I was like in like six months

1568
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:10,640
I'll call back and ask like how it's going and if it's like if I've lost all my money. I'll be like, fuck you

1569
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,240
Uninvest now

1570
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:17,600
I see that's the great thing by dad just giving us this money in this in this fund

1571
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,680
Like I didn't have to like weigh like I wanted to invest this money

1572
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,720
Do I this is not like this is not like a bunch of free money trust fund

1573
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:29,920
This is like a collective amount that has been built up over like years and years of like him putting small amounts in

1574
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:35,760
For like Christmas and birthdays and stuff. Very true. This is not like, oh, you just set us up with a fucking trust fund or whatever

1575
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:40,480
Indeed indeed, although I suspect we will inherit a good amount of money

1576
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,880
When they kick the bucket, but we'll see we'll see how that goes one day ladies. Um

1577
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:49,920
I mean, maybe I mean they own I mean they own a house never know firsthand

1578
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:53,280
I mean, they do own a house. So I mean, that's that's a considerable

1579
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:57,200
That's a considerable value to be extracted. I mean, I'll just lay it

1580
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:02,240
I mean, I was talking to dad yesterday about this and I I mean dad was we were joking about this and I was just like

1581
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:07,840
Dad, have you ever considered like putting a cap on your lifespans that you don't use up all my money when you're, you know

1582
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,200
Decrepit and you know, what do you think about that? And he was like

1583
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:18,560
Generously, he said, Nate, I knew you're half joking about that and uh, only half joking dad only half joking

1584
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:22,800
I mean, this really happened. This really happened. I mean it was in fact a joke

1585
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,360
But every joke has a little kernel of truth to it, you know

1586
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:33,360
Yeah, that's what i'm saying. Michelle jokes mean something. You can't just say, oh, that's just a joke. Don't worry about it. No

1587
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,280
What's the joke? What does it mean? What's the joke sir? What's the joke sir?

1588
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,400
What's the joke sir? That's my new thing

1589
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,200
I'm gonna tweet that at trump every day

1590
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:49,200
What's the joke sir? What's so funny sir? Have you no shame sir?

1591
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,120
You know, I'll just a final point on it. It seems to me a little bit silly

1592
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:54,560
Oh, you know what? I guess to be fair

1593
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:59,360
I get why people don't like when the president is obviously being an asshole and and joking

1594
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,120
But I think it is pretty clear. He is in fact joking and much of this thing

1595
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,880
I mean, I guess some of the time is that appropriate. Is that appropriate?

1596
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:12,800
That's debatable. That's debatable. I mean, but when people say it is entertaining and that's what i'm on twitter.com for

1597
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:17,360
I like we just you got to take the argument for what it actually is and if people are like

1598
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:22,800
Trump really did stack those hamburgers a mile high fact-checked not in fact true

1599
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:27,440
Um, you know, which is just being a little silly. Is that a specific reference that I don't know?

1600
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,080
At one point

1601
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:37,200
Trump literally said that we stacked hamburgers a mile high and like factcheck.org they did the research turns out debunked

1602
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:41,840
He did not stack those. Do you that would be that would be literally

1603
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:48,320
75 000 hamburger patties, which you know what seems unrealistic frankly on its face

1604
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,720
We have no reports of such a stack

1605
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:55,040
Not one eyewitness account, but trust deranged words

1606
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,200
so

1607
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:02,160
You know, thank god, we're here to be the fact-checkers. All right, there you go. I see that's I see that's all there is to it

1608
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:08,160
Um, so I I'm glad you're all now voting trump in 2020. It's gonna be a good time. That's right. Can't wait. I'm glad we converted you

1609
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,800

And what else we got at tb crassinators on twitter?

1614
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:31,920
PCB minecraft is still under construction. But by the time you hear this, I think it will be back up and running

1615
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,680
No, they said it though. I I'm saying it. I'm saying it. We're we're in good shape. I want to do more

1616
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:40,560
I want to get in there. I haven't been in the new server yet

1617
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,680
That I really think we're very close to it being finished and it will be back up and running

1618
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:50,960
If I play in this minecraft server, it will be the second time I've ever played minecraft in my life

1619
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:55,760
Well, it's gonna be a great time. I can guarantee that. It's never been a better time to start

1620
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,600
It's never been a hotter topic

1621
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:07,280
It's just unironically let me just say unironically the community of people that have come to that minecraft server are hugely active

1622
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,440
Even though the server is down

1623
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:14,720
And we've got like 80 people who pledged that's a huge community way bigger than I expected it to be

1624
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:21,920
People seem to really like the couple people that were hanging out in Bufalantopia. Can we yeah, can we please burn down Bufalantopia?

1625
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,200
Then we will definitely go back to Bufalantopia. Absolutely

1626
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:32,640
Yeah, okay, can't leave that chapter. I can't I was thinking I was thinking the the next time we stream we should start on Bufalantopia

1627
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:36,800
And like make it our our final visit. I say it every episode, but I

1628
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,280
We can't we can't leave it like no

1629
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,640
Just like Clyde Cash and Jack Thaddeus. We can't die by their hand

1630
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:50,080
We can't let them kill us by ending the server. We have to be the one to put Bufalantopia down

1631
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:55,840
You know, we should do we should ceremony and then go to the server and start new phalantopia or both or both

1632
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,840
On tupia or whatever the fuck we want to go now new phalantopia

1633
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:06,880
Head on down but patron a patreon.com slash pcb minecraft five dollars for your monthly joining and then head on south

1634
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:13,120
Follow the path that's that's well trodden down to cool guy village where all the cool guys are building their houses

1635
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:19,200
But perhaps somewhere else out in the ether. We'll have a new phalantopia. We'll be out there where the new phalantope

1636
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,840
Be uh, oh

1637
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,280
Yeah, it'll be

1638
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,600
Oh, that sounds great, but we should we should go to Bufalantopia

1639
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:32,240
We should everyone should release their claims and then we should all go buck wild with the flint and steel and just lighted all the blaze

1640
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,560
Yes, let it all burn down

1641
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,120
It sounds good. We have burned down your Bufalant's

1642
