1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, hello, welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's Gibb's

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
not here today, I don't know what she's doing. Some nonsense I guess.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
God rest.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Got ripped, but we've got Tectonic Improv, and Gamer's Tavern, aka Chrono, here in the

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
studio, here live in the studio, live studio audience.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Woo!

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Woo!

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, alright!

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Woo!

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm back!

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Woo!

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, it's been a while.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
True.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I should start this off with one of my customary jokes.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
God.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Of course.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's hear it.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's have it.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ham sandwich walks into a bar and orders a beer, and the bartender says, sorry, we don't

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
serve food here.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, that?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll play devil's advocate here, and say that that request is more than reasonable.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ham sandwich, come on.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He can't even, he'll just get all soppy, like wet bread is gross.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,720
That's just racism, because there's no law, like there's a law against serving minors.

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
He'd get in trouble.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,000
There's no law against serving food, so that's just victory.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, but it's for some good.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's foodism.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, just like Jim Crow, right?

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, exactly.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ham sandwich loss.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Separate but equal, right?

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, okay.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm going to spoil something that's going to happen later on in this podcast.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I think you might have heard that the Speakpipe mailbox finally filled up.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Congratulations everyone.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You broke it.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It was supposed to only hold like a hundred megabytes, because we have the test, what

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
do you call it?

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The trial period.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, we have the trial period free membership.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It should have filled up like years ago, but it just kept letting us do more and more.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But at some point, a couple people messaged me and said, wait, and yet we got a new one

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
just yesterday.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How can this be?

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I was going to say, I was hoping that meant that we would have less voicemails this time.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's what, yeah, we would all hope.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, maybe, possibly.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I'm looking and, yeah, actually we do.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, we have fewer than usual.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I think, but here's the thing.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will just go back and I will delete old ones from the, yeah.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So next week, by the time you're listening to this, it should be okay to send more.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But between then and now, the box will be full and I'm sorry about that.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The, yeah, trial period is 100 megabytes free.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Our current storage uses 1.86 gigabytes.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So we really, yeah, storage use 1.46 gigabytes out of 100 megabytes.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So we really got a ratio.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All I can say to that is ratio.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you like know for certain you have a trial account?

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Maybe like Nate or someone just sprung for like a full account and you just never noticed.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know how this works.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't, it's possible.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It says, it says this is the limit.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Wait here.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Fair enough then.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Here's our little, here's our little sidebar.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can see for yourself.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I swear I'm not bullshitting you.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There's the blam screenshot down at the bottom, storage used.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, that's 1.46 gigabytes out of 100 megabytes.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, I wasn't lying.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, that's up to me.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't know.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't see anything wrong here.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You know, for those who don't know, one gigabyte is 1000 megabytes.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
True.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Because you know nowadays a lot of people don't know that.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You know, zoomers probably have no idea what megabyte even is.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Because the units just don't go that small?

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Isn't it like a little different from like 1 to 1000?

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Isn't it like a slight discrepancy?

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, it's like maybe 1,024 or something like that.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I remember.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Wait, why?

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I fucking computer code shit.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Who cares?

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I remember looking something up about it.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Because when I made my Super Mario Land video, for some reason I put a little diatribe in about the difference between a megabyte and a megabyte.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A megabyte.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
A megabyte.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, like what's a megabyte?

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is that a pun?

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No, it's just a different type of measurement.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm not going to speak on exactly what it is.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is it something in like base 64 or some crap like that?

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think so.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Maybe.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've never heard of it, but I have heard of megabits.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A megabyte equals two, oh it's two to the 20th bytes, or it's just over a million bytes.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So it's slightly more than a megabyte, but it's in base 64 or whatever.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I've got to wonder where it's used, or if it's like...

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think it's very base.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Very base.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Very base.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think it would be used in a context in which you are using binary code, because it's base two.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I think that's probably why it exists.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But yeah, it just happens to be functionally almost the same size as a megabyte.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll be darned.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, that's funny.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I wonder if they sound similar on purpose.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well now that we know that gender isn't binary, I think we need to retire binary code.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, I think it's got to go.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's off the spectrum.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
True.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Very problematic.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Ones and zeros.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We've got to do quantum computing.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's kind of like how the hard drives, they used to be masters and slaves.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, oh yeah.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
RIP.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You have male and female cords, or outlets, or whatever.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What did I see?

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I saw a really funny meme that I thought was very clever, and here's what it is.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It was a Mr. Incredible face.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The happy one, and then the black and white scared looking one.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It was jobs in which...

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
When at your job, someone asks you to do...

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Someone, jobs that require you to work with male on male or something like gay.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Work for gay, right?

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And it's like, baker, good.

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah, make a cake for the gay people.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Something else, wedding planner, blah blah blah.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Last one was electrician.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh yes, oh yes.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You see, the comedy came from when one frame of reference suddenly came into unexpected conflict with a second frame of reference that used the same vocabulary.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The joke was very human.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It caused a surprise reaction in me that gave me a sensation of delight and caused laughter.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Very human podcast.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It reminds me of that clip that you tweeted ages ago where Trixie was explaining some kind of joke.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, I vaguely remember that.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I didn't remember what the joke was, but it was something like...

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you remember what the joke was?

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh yeah, I think it was something about majors and minors, and I think it was a quote on the album.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It was a rap verse, wasn't it?

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah.

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, she was explaining that somehow you see the...

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes, yes, yes.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It was a Mr. Girl lyric about sex with minors, but he meant the joke was it was a play on minors as in children versus minors as in people that work in a mine,

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
which has never been done before.

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Never heard that one before.

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes, she was like, oh, here's why this is genius.

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Here's the brilliance of this pun.

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You see, it conflates the meaning of two different words that sound the same but are written differently.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Very human.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, you know what they say, you should never explain a joke.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Never under any circumstances, even if asked.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah, exactly.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
See, if you have to explain a joke...

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Explaining a joke is like saying the n-word, you should never do it.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In...

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's the...

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Ronald Reagan, in politics and comedy, if you're explaining, you're losing.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What's the actual quote?

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What was the actual thing he said?

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think he said, oh, oof, ouch, oh, it hurts so bad.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Take me to a hospital immediately.

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, the hellfire is burning.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Margaret Thatcher, my friend, saved me.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Actually, speaking of Reagan,

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
did you guys see that the guy that tried to assassinate Reagan has a YouTube channel?

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
John Hinkley Jr., that's right.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He's been making music recently.

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He just recently, I think last June, got taken off his probation, so he was looking to tour.

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Looking to tour?

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
To a couple of venues, but like every single venue keeps canceling on him.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Because he's John Hinkley Jr.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But that's fucked up.

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let the man play.

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's all I say.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He served, he served.

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He did his time.

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He's rehabilitated.

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He did his time.

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What is this?

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, I think he did like 40 years or something.

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Too much.

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He only got out a couple of years ago, and only just recently his probation came out.

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think he's just recently able to post online.

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I think he had someone else doing it for him until then.

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
When will, god damn it, when will they let, when will they let freakin, oh no.

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I forgetting their names.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Molly and Orissa.

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The Slenderman girl.

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
When will they let them post online?

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't know.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
They're not serving time, are they?

211
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Because they're like writers.

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
One of them was let out fairly recently.

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But I think she is still on probation and not allowed to use the internet.

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Morgan, justice for Morgan and Anissa.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh yeah, because it wasn't one of them.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
One of them was sort of the ringleader and the other was just kind of like a follower sort of thing.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So they were more lenient on the follower.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I know you talked about this last week.

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I haven't listened to the episode.

220
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't know what the official conclusion was.

221
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
From their testimony, they both kind of seemed to suggest the other one was in charge.

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But I'm pretty sure that Morgan is the one that did the actual stabbing.

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And Anissa is the other one.

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And so I think it was probably safer for them to get her out of there.

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Whenever you're in trouble, just blame the other guy.

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah.

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Seems to be working out.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They're already on probation maybe.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It worked for Anissa. Anissa, I don't know.

230
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The kid they stabbed didn't die, right?

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
She could have. She was pretty close to dying, but she did not die.

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, they came pretty close to severing a fairly major artery, but they didn't.

233
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, that story was fucking crazy.

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Little known fact about me, I fucking loved Slenderman YouTube shows.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I watched all of them, even the really bad ones. I watched them.

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Are you talking about like Marble Hornets?

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, Marble Hornets, Evermint Hyrid, Tribe 12, Dark Harvest.

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I watched some Marble Hornets because it was recommended to me.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I watched a bunch of it.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I wasn't around for when it was like popular.

241
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah.

242
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I got the DVDs, baby.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
They did. They had a Blu-ray too. Unfortunately, the Blu-ray is sold out.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't think they make it anymore, but yeah, I got the DVDs.

245
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The menus are really good.

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
DVDs of Let's Plays.

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It is kind of like that.

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh my god.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It was kind of like Marble Hornets was like what, 2009, 2010?

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And the DVDs I think were like early 2010.

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So it was like one of the first ever YouTube things I ever got as physical media.

252
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's on my other shelf, so I'm not going to grab it and survey it right now.

253
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It was pretty good.

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The DVD menu was pretty well made.

255
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
They had a commentary for all the episodes.

256
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Aren't there like a million episodes?

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I think there's like 60 something.

258
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They span it over three seasons, quote-unquote.

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So they did like creator commentary tracks.

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
They did, yeah, for every episode.

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's amazing.

262
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, that's cool.

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That actually sounds great.

264
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And that should be done with a PCP as well.

265
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Did you guys do that a couple of times?

266
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's a great idea. We did it once.

267
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think we just did it once, but yeah, the creator commentary track.

268
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Actually, I think you did it a few times.

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Patreon.com. That's procrastinators.

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If you want to hear the director's commentary of...

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't even remember which episode we did it of.

272
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I think it was an early one.

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Probably the first one, right?

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, it might have been the first one.

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It was an early one.

276
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I think you did it a few times and I was on for one of those.

277
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
One of the episodes was the first episode I was on.

278
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No, what? You're right.

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I think we actually did it.

280
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think we did it twice.

281
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That sounds right.

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah, maybe one of them was the first one.

283
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Anyway, it worked great.

284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It made perfect sense in an audio medium and nobody complained.

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, that's how I remember it.

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Anyway.

288
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It doesn't seem like that terrible of an idea.

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's a bit...

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think some people said it's a little confusing because you keep hearing the same voices.

291
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh, sure.

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
One is past Ben and one is future Ben.

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The one is commentating on the other and it can be a little hard to keep track.

294
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think...

295
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, whichever one doesn't sound like he's talking through a tin can is the normal Ben.

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's true.

297
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Also, my voice just changed over the years.

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
My voice became higher pitch for some reason.

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Did you originally record lying on your stomach or something?

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Do you know what?

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Actually, I think I did.

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Not all the time, but I think I probably would record lying on my stomach.

303
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, there was a time when I did that.

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That might have something to do with it then.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's a very Ben core thing to do.

306
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, now that you mention it.

307
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There's that Let's Player streamer Northern Lion.

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I watched him for a really long time.

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In the early days, his voice is a lot deeper and a lot less animated, I guess.

310
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Nowadays, he sounds different.

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You could chalk that up to just like,

312
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh, well, he's been doing this for a long time.

313
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He's more comfortable.

314
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's also because I remember hearing that he used to record lying on his back with his laptop on his stomach,

315
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
playing the games.

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's going to change how your voice sounds.

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Even if I stood up instead of sat down when podcasting, it sounded a little different.

318
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's a strategy.

319
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There definitely were episodes where I wouldn't lie on my back with my laptop on my stomach.

320
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I would lie on my stomach with my head in hand hanging over the front edge of the bed

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
with the laptop on my floor in front of me.

322
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, wow.

323
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Voice actors need to take notes because this is how you really do it.

324
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This is how you get range.

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's the professional podcasters tip right there.

326
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That one's for free.

327
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
How do you think Mel Blanc did it?

328
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
All those amazing voices.

329
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Marvin the Martian.

330
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He was lying on his stomach for a lot of them.

331
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, he's lying on his stomach on his back doing pull-ups.

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Lying in different positions.

333
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They never got back to me about my voice acting audition for that stupid deaf Pina cartoon.

334
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh, I'll never make it.

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Is there something happening with that?

336
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I haven't been listening to the PCP for a while.

337
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I fell off the wagon.

338
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm recently catching up.

339
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Weeks and weeks ago, he just put out a casting call for voice actors for some cartoon he was making.

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I said, sure, why not?

341
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I just recorded some lines and sent them.

342
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I didn't hear anything back.

343
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's fucked up.

344
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you have any nepotism you could use?

345
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Do you have a cheesy note or something?

346
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't know.

347
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I guess I was like, if on some chance he knew who Ben St. was,

348
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
if he'd seen the Sonichu lecture or something,

349
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
maybe that could have helped me name recognition-wise,

350
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but to my knowledge, nothing came of that.

351
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And it's probably been too late at this.

352
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Either the project's canceled or he picked someone else.

353
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Surely, surely.

354
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Which is not okay.

355
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So I'm not cool with it.

356
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm going to be very mad.

357
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm going to dislike bomb the video.

358
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm going to lead a social media campaign against it.

359
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm going to make it personal.

360
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm going to make it his problem.

361
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And then he's going to rue the day.

362
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah, I mean...

363
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That guy has some controversies under his belt, right?

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah, probably.

365
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't think I've ever seen a Daphne video.

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He's fine.

367
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I guess he calls people out.

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Oh, that sounds great.

369
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah, his shtick is that he's monotone.

370
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, that's a great shtick.

371
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah, it's a good one.

372
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, I know that shtick very well.

373
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Speaking of voice acting, I wanted to briefly mention

374
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
that infamous scene in Mega Man X4.

375
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I think you talked about it before.

376
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I mean, this can't be happening.

377
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, there's no more point going on in this world.

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What am I fighting for?

379
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I skipped a line, didn't I?

380
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No, Iris, no.

381
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Don't hate humans, Zero.

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You can't hate humans.

383
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I agree with the colonel.

384
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
We must fight for our independence,

385
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
for we are the replifors.

386
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm a fucking good game.

387
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Well, I just wanted to mention that

388
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I was curious about listening to the original Japanese version

389
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
because I heard it was better.

390
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
How could it not be?

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I looked it up and it does sound way better.

392
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Here's the link to the clip if you want to listen to it.

393
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's kind of a shame that the US version

394
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
got really bad dubbing

395
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
because I think the story to this game

396
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
would have been pretty good if the dub didn't suck so bad.

397
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I agree.

398
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It completely turns Iris' death into a huge meme.

399
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That said, Iris was introduced in this game

400
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and I feel like I wouldn't really care about her regardless.

401
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The way they handled it,

402
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't think there was anything they could have done

403
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
with the presentation to salvage the character of Iris.

404
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The performance here is actually kind of impressive

405
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
because I don't know the Japanese voice actor's name,

406
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
but his screams were like gut-wrenching.

407
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I was surprised by how good this performance was.

408
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm almost there.

409
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah, that's a good anime scream.

410
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I love a good anime scream.

411
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, that's good.

412
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's totally good.

413
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Have either of you played Mega Man X or Maverick Hunter X for the PSP?

414
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Is that the remake?

415
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, I have not.

416
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The voice act?

417
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, I don't blame you because it was only on PSP

418
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and I don't think they put it on any PSN store.

419
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I just philosophically disagree with the idea of going back

420
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and remaking the game because it wasn't good enough?

421
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I agree with that.

422
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I feel like it's not...

423
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I would never really say it's definitively better than Mega Man X.

424
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It seems more like they're trying to reboot things

425
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
because you've probably seen...

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I remember you talking about the Day of Sigma OVA or whatever.

427
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There's slight story discrepancies between the games,

428
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
but I like the voice acting in that game a lot.

429
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The English dub.

430
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
In Maverick Hunter.

431
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The thing is though is that that came out so much later

432
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
that dubbing standards in anime just was way better by then.

433
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You have to remember that Mega Man X4 came out in 97

434
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and most anime back then were dubbed horribly.

435
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
If you watch a lot of anime from the time, this dubbing sounds pretty familiar.

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah.

437
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I think some anime had gotten a cut above this at this point,

438
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
but when video games...

439
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I took to Final Fantasy X for voice acting and video games to be not fucking terrible.

440
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I learned from Mage that we didn't really get this in America,

441
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
but in some countries, dubbing simply...

442
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
They didn't even take out the original audio.

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They just...

444
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
One person just narrated the subtitles.

445
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah, Mage said that when she watched Dragon Ball Z,

446
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
it was just have someone's voice recorded over the unedited original Japanese audio,

447
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
just sort of repeating the lines but in Lithuanian or the native place,

448
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
the native language, the vernacular.

449
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That sounds interesting.

450
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I want to check out Lithuanian Dragon Ball Z.

451
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, I mean, it'd probably be easier if it were a language you understood,

452
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
but yeah, just imagine like...

453
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Japanese is still there.

454
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Just someone is just one guy.

455
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's saying the lines.

456
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's like the PCP commentary tracks.

457
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah, it's like...

458
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I should do a solo Ben.

459
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I should do a solo Ben?

460
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Wait, you know what?

461
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm going to do that.

462
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm going to do a solo Ben cast commentary track on one of the solo Ben cast.

463
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm doing it.

464
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
No, I'm doing it.

465
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm writing it down.

466
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That's a great idea.

467
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm 100%.

468
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yes, thank you.

469
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Excellent.

470
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay.

471
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm trying to think of some early video game dubs that I think are pretty good.

472
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Like Metal Gear, Solid is good.

473
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, it's probably one of the best ones.

474
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You know, I'm playing the old Resident Evil games,

475
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and I actually kind of like the Resident Evil 2 dub,

476
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
even though it's corny and cheesy.

477
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah.

478
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Other RE games, although RE1 is kind of...

479
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I have never played Resident Evil, any of them.

480
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But I have, you know, there's sort of a...

481
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I've heard people say, I mean, sort of the goofy, like, wrong...

482
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
No, it's Silent Hill.

483
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Silent Hill is the one that I hear people say that, like,

484
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
James is, like, stilted and kind of objectively bad delivery

485
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
actually sort of increases the uncanniness.

486
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, I've heard people talk about that as well,

487
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
that, like, because Guy Sihi, I think, is his name.

488
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
He wasn't, like...

489
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
He wasn't a voice actor or, like, a professionally trained one.

490
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
There's, like, this funny story where he was taking his daughter to a rehearsal

491
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
or an audition to play the little girl in the game, Laura, I think, is her name.

492
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And she didn't get the part, but they asked him to try for James,

493
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and he got the part.

494
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And I've never played Silent Hill,

495
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
but I did watch a Let's Play of it years ago,

496
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
so I basically know, like, the story, and I can comment on the performances.

497
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And I think the voice acting in the game is actually really good,

498
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
because, like...

499
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That's Silent Hill 2 or the first one?

500
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
2.

501
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
2, yeah, I should have clarified.

502
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Because, yeah, it does sort of sound, like, sort of stilted and odd,

503
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:06,000
but in sort of a more, like, a homely way than, like, an incompetent sort of way.

504
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't know.

505
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Because, like...

506
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Can I have something about it?

507
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Silent Hill, either, so...

508
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But I've seen that...

509
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I've seen that... is it that Twin Perfect series?

510
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
About the...

511
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The games.

512
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What is that series called?

513
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
That second thing, Silent Hill or something?

514
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't think that's it.

515
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Two Peaks?

516
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That's where the name comes from.

517
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah.

518
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I've actually never seen those Twin Perfect videos,

519
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
but I have watched another video a couple years ago,

520
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
basically talking about how that Twin Perfect series

521
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
is inadvertently responsible for putting a lot of the blame

522
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
onto this one Silent Hill producer named...

523
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes.

524
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What's his name?

525
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Tom Hewlett.

526
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Tom Hewlett.

527
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, they go pretty hard on Tom Hewlett in that...

528
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I might...

529
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, okay, it's called The Real Silent Hill Experience.

530
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Nate recommended it to me years and years ago.

531
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I have kind of come to...

532
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I kind of think the guy's evil.

533
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I kind of think the guy is evil a little bit,

534
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
the Twin Perfect guy.

535
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
He seems like a douchebag.

536
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's perfect, isn't it?

537
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Aren't there two people?

538
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There is, but the other one quit,

539
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and I think has apologized for a lot of...

540
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think specifically for the harassment that Tom Hewlett received.

541
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But the other guy has not.

542
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's a shame because...

543
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I've never even seen those videos,

544
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and I remember back in the day that a lot...

545
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I remember people blaming this one producer dude, Tom Hewlett,

546
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and I watched this video a couple years ago.

547
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It's a two-part, but whatever.

548
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I think you or someone else might have shown me this one.

549
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah, because I didn't know anything about it.

550
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I saw the Twin Perfect one, and the Twin Perfect puts...

551
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
They say they're not doing this, but...

552
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And then they name-drop on it.

553
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You come away with the impression that basically this is Tom Hewlett's fault.

554
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I assume that that is not entirely their invention.

555
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I assume that probably a lot of the community put the blame on him, too,

556
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and they sort of echoed that sentiment.

557
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But then it just reinforced it.

558
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
My outside perspective is,

559
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
oh yeah, Tom Hewlett, that guy who ruined Silent Hill.

560
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And I don't even know anything about any of this.

561
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It seems so weird in hindsight

562
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
to foot the blame at some dude who may have had

563
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
some small amount of creative control regarding the series.

564
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
When it's fairly obvious that,

565
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
since it's a Konami game,

566
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
who the fuck else ruined Silent Hill but fucking Konami?

567
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They ruined everything.

568
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I was under the impression that every Silent Hill game

569
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
was handled by a different team.

570
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The first three or four were done by an internal team

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that disbanded shortly after, I think.

572
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And then the rest of them, yeah,

573
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
they got done by different teams at Konami

574
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
or outsourced from Konami.

575
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Way forward actually did a couple of Silent Hills, I think,

576
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
which Tom Hewlett works at way forward now, by the way.

577
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What else did way forward do?

578
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
They make a Chante series, I think, right?

579
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Oh yeah, yeah, okay.

580
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
They're fairly well known for making licensed games

581
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
that are better than you would expect.

582
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And then every once in a while they do an original game

583
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
that's like an indie darling.

584
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
They were supposed to make that Advance Wars remake

585
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
that Nintendo delayed because of the Ukraine crisis

586
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and is still not come out.

587
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Advance Wars?

588
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah, they were remaking Advance Wars 1 and 2 for Switch.

589
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Are they like in Ukraine or something?

590
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Is that why the...

591
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The...

592
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I've never played Advance Wars, but from what I understand...

593
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I did play it back on the Game Boy Advance

594
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and I could ever beat the Final Stage.

595
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The Black Hole Army, Sturm is too fucking hard

596
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
on the Final Stage for Kid Me.

597
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I think they delayed it partly because, I mean,

598
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
there was a big war in the news

599
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and the game's called Advance Wars.

600
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Oh, because it's about war and war is bad.

601
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
War's bad, everyone's like, wait a minute.

602
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
We don't want to advance war, we want to reduce war.

603
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's stupid.

604
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But also, the villain,

605
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
the main villain faction of the game is a Russian analog.

606
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So I guess they wanted to avoid all controversy altogether.

607
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But it's silly.

608
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The game is apparently completely done

609
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
and has been done for months.

610
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
They should just release it.

611
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That's the thing, if you're going to wait for a moment

612
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and there's no war to release this game,

613
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
then you're going to be waiting a long time.

614
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Honestly, I feel like...

615
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah, some people might get mad,

616
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
but I kind of just feel like nerds who are into war stuff

617
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
would just be more excited

618
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
if it reminds them of a current ongoing conflict.

619
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I feel like that might move units, I don't know.

620
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Ha, move units. No pun intended.

621
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah.

622
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I think it's, since Advance Wars is made by a Japanese company,

623
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
they have maybe weirder views on this

624
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
compared to other developers.

625
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Possibly.

626
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I don't know.

627
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I can see why they would want to do it,

628
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
but it's not like this crisis is going to end.

629
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I mean, it's not over still.

630
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What are you going to do? Never release the game?

631
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Because a war happens?

632
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
A silly little war? Come on, we want video games.

633
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Exactly, exactly.

634
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Let's not lose perspective of what's really important here.

635
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Video games.

636
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I think also it has to do with Nintendo specifically.

637
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They're very adverse to anything that is controversial.

638
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
They want to be family friendly.

639
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah, I mean, I guess that is true.

640
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You want to know what a real...

641
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's actually kind of weird that they even have a war-based game at all.

642
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Do you know...

643
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well, it's kind of cartoony.

644
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I feel like that's how they get away with it.

645
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Until that one on DS when it's not.

646
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It is very cartoony, but at the same time,

647
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
it is about just regular people fucking killing each other

648
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
in a fucking field of battle on operations.

649
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But at the same time, Andy doesn't know what an airport is.

650
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I vaguely remember that.

651
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
There's something really funny.

652
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
A really dark coincidence with Advance Wars

653
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and the original Game Boy Advance game.

654
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It came out, I believe, September 10th, 2001.

655
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So...

656
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
No!

657
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm pretty...

658
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
No!

659
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Sturm used Meteor!

660
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm looking this up to get specific.

661
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I know it came out right around 9-11.

662
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Are you saying that Intelligent Systems did 9-11?

663
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm not saying they didn't.

664
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
No.

665
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
We couldn't prove that.

666
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Ah, jeez.

667
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
September 10th.

668
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Yep.

669
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
September 10th.

670
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
September 10th.

671
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That's crazy.

672
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
If only...

673
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You know what?

674
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
If only they had just done for the war in Afghanistan

675
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
what they are now doing for the war in Ukraine

676
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and delayed the game,

677
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and we wouldn't have done 9-11.

678
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So maybe they're right after all.

679
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
In honor of Operation Iraqi Freedom

680
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
we are delaying Advance Wars.

681
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It will release when all the troops are gone

682
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
from the Middle East.

683
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Nintendo should have used their power.

684
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
We could have ended the war so much sooner.

685
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Because Osama bin Laden's like,

686
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, fuck!

687
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I wanted to play that!

688
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
George W.

689
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's just like, ah, come on.

690
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I love Andy.

691
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
That's exactly what would have happened.

692
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein's in his little hidey hole

693
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
playing elite copy

694
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
with his little head sticking out or whatever.

695
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Just think of what...

696
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
All of this could have been avoided.

697
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
If Nintendo was just a little less callous

698
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
with their video game releases,

699
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I think this is the learning lesson.

700
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Nintendo needs to use their platform for good.

701
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
They need to be better.

702
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Instead of cancelling,

703
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
instead of copyright striking YouTubers

704
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
for using video game footage,

705
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
they should be copyright striking

706
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the United States government

707
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
for conducting various CIA-backed coups

708
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
around the world.

709
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
They need to DMCA the United States government

710
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
for committing wars.

711
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I believe that is our intellectual property

712
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
that you're infringing upon.

713
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You're emulating wars?

714
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I don't know.

715
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
They didn't buy the hard copy.

716
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
They copyrighted anything that has to do

717
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
with advanced warfare.

718
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Speaking of the Game Boy Advance

719
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and speaking of Mega Man,

720
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I played some zero games recently.

721
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
My feeling from my adolescence

722
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
was that they were the best,

723
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and I'm happy to say I was right.

724
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
They are still the best Mega Man games ever made.

725
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
The Zero Series is a big blind spot for me.

726
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I know Chrono likes them,

727
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and I know you like them,

728
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
but my experience with Mega Man Zero

729
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
was walking into a GameStop

730
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
when I was seven,

731
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and then in the GBA kiosk...

732
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It would be very challenging for a seven-year-old.

733
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah.

734
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
As you'll see shortly,

735
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I think it was 0-3

736
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
was in a kiosk thing.

737
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's just a good-ass video game.

738
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I was playing it.

739
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I think I got to a boss and then died.

740
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I was like, well, fuck me. This is way too hard.

741
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Had you had any experience with Mega Man before that?

742
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah, I played X back in the day,

743
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and Legends.

744
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I feel like if you can beat the X bosses,

745
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
you can beat the Zero boss.

746
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I never said anything about beating it.

747
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I just played it.

748
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I could probably beat it nowadays.

749
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I know there's a collection that you can get.

750
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah, the Zero and X.

751
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'd be curious to try it.

752
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I've never played ZX.

753
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's so good.

754
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I know that...

755
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Are you playing it through an emulator

756
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
or just that collection thing?

757
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
No, I'm playing on the Visual Boy Advance emulator.

758
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Word up.

759
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I actually prefer Gameplay-wise.

760
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I prefer the X 1 through 4

761
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
to the Zero series.

762
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But I think as far as the story is concerned,

763
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
the Zero series is definitely...

764
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's more cohesive.

765
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah.

766
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
What really stands out

767
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
is just the fact that

768
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
in the Zero games,

769
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
when you're not on a mission,

770
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
you're in the base

771
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
and you can just walk around

772
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and talk to the other people

773
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
who live in the base and the other people

774
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
who are being affected by the war

775
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
that you're fighting.

776
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's such an obvious thing

777
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
to include.

778
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It just makes the game a million times better.

779
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah.

780
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And in the first one,

781
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you can actually go to the missions

782
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
from the base directly without warping there.

783
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
They kind of pulled Dark Souls

784
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
where they made the first one

785
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and they gave it this really cool

786
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
connected, continuous world

787
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
that was really cool.

788
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And they were like,

789
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
that was hard.

790
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Kind of is hard, I guess.

791
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I guess it's hard.

792
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But it was appreciated.

793
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And they didn't do it again.

794
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Which is fine.

795
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I guess.

796
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
From a story standpoint,

797
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
the events of one game

798
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
lead into the other one.

799
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And it feels like the world

800
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and the characters are changing

801
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
from a game to game basis

802
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
that carries over.

803
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
The problem

804
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
with the X series story-wise

805
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
is that every time you beat one game

806
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
the next game starts and it just feels

807
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
like everything resets back to

808
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
the default values.

809
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Pretty much.

810
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Well, we beat Sigma,

811
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
but he's a freaking ghost in the machine now

812
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and you can't actually beat him.

813
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So I guess he'll be back.

814
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I know that Dr. Wiley

815
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
always came back in the Mega Man series

816
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
but it always rubbed me the wrong way

817
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
that Sigma would come back in every game.

818
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
For some reason, there was a disconnect there

819
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
that it always seemed kind of cheap.

820
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Like the second time in the second game

821
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
when he comes back, okay, that's fine.

822
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Because he turns into a data thing.

823
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
That's interesting.

824
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
There comes a point where

825
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
they should have stopped.

826
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah, bring him back

827
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
every couple of games, I guess.

828
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I haven't played it,

829
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
but I think in X7

830
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
or X8, he comes back

831
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and he's all

832
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
fucked up looking and mutated because

833
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
he's like, yeah, he just keeps coming back.

834
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I think that was X6.

835
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
He comes back as a zombie.

836
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But he's not the same.

837
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's like they knew. We really shouldn't keep

838
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
dragging this guy back, but we have to do it.

839
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Actually,

840
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
X6, technically, Sigma wasn't

841
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
the actual final boss

842
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
even though you fight him as the final boss.

843
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah, he was that gay guy.

844
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
He was a scientist.

845
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
He was some red-white scientist.

846
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Yeah.

847
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
He was the main one putting the strings

848
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and he revived Sigma for some reason.

849
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Well, because you need to fight Sigma at the end.

850
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah, literally.

851
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Sigma has nothing to do with that one,

852
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
but then at the end he's like, okay,

853
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
hey, you beat me.

854
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
My machinations have been unraveled.

855
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Final note, I did revive Sigma just in case.

856
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So go fight him as well.

857
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Okay, thank you.

858
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Crazy about that is the

859
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
final battle with Sigma in that game

860
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
is probably the most unnecessary in the series

861
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
so far. The music is probably

862
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
the best Sigma battle out of any

863
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
of the Sigma songs. It's like a remix

864
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
of the first three. It's really good.

865
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I don't remember the music.

866
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Actually,

867
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I don't know if it's a spoiler to reveal it,

868
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
but at the very end of X8

869
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
you don't fight Sigma, surprisingly.

870
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's Luminae, right?

871
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I never played X8.

872
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I have not...

873
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I haven't played that one either.

874
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I know who Luminae is.

875
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I always heard that it was better

876
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
than 7, but like

877
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
better than 7 is not

878
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
really a high bar.

879
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah.

880
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But I think it's better than X5

881
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and 6 as well.

882
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Oh, yeah. X6 is kind of...

883
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
X6 is bad.

884
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I would say 5. I don't really like 5.

885
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I think 5 is where

886
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
it kind of went off the deep end for me.

887
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, I consider 5 bad, to be honest.

888
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It has an interesting story, but everything else

889
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
about it sucks.

890
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
5 is pretty whack.

891
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
He's the bad guy in 5.

892
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You know, the whole cannon thing where you have

893
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
a random chance of getting a different ending.

894
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Oh, yeah.

895
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You can fire the cannon whenever you want,

896
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
but if you beat all the stages

897
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
you have a better chance

898
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
of the cannon being successful.

899
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Even if you beat all the stages,

900
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
you can still lose, lol.

901
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And you can still get the bad ending.

902
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Why not?

903
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's right there.

904
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It's right there.

905
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
If you beat all the stages,

906
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
you get the good ending.

907
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I don't know. Come on.

908
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Why would you make it random?

909
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's bizarre.

910
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah, the Zero Games.

911
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I don't think this is the case,

912
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
but the story is tight enough that you would

913
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
think that they went into it planning to make

914
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
4, and they were like, here's the plan.

915
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
1, 2, 3, 4, done.

916
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Apparently that's not the case.

917
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Because I guess I read in an interview

918
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
or something that, like,

919
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
after X3, they were planning on making X3

920
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
the end.

921
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But then, like...

922
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
But fans wanted to know what happened

923
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
with Dr. Vile.

924
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So we had to make 4.

925
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Dr. Vile?

926
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Dr. Vile.

927
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And it's like...

928
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Oh, zero, zero.

929
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I thought you were talking about X.

930
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I was like, who the fuck is this?

931
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
In Zero 3,

932
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
they ended it,

933
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and it literally ends with

934
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Dr. Vile is back,

935
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
and he's in charge now.

936
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And that's the ending.

937
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And we were surprised.

938
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Fans were unsatisfied.

939
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Fans wanted to know what happened

940
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and it's like, yeah.

941
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
What did you think was going to happen?

942
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Ah, jeez.

943
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And then they fucking made it,

944
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and 4 has the best fucking ending.

945
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
4 has the best ending, the most definitive ending.

946
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
They brought it to a conclusive,

947
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
satisfying resolution.

948
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Yeah, I watched Gamer and Savarin's video

949
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
on that ending. It seemed pretty cool.

950
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Right, right.

951
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I remember first experiencing

952
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
that ending back when the game came out,

953
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and I beat it.

954
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And then back then, I was like,

955
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
this is a really great ending.

956
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So then, like 10 plus years later,

957
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I was still thinking about that ending,

958
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
so that's why I wanted to make a video on it.

959
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yeah.

960
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Literally,

961
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
the best ending that any Mega Man game has

962
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
because it actually has one.

963
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah, they actually had the courage

964
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
to end things

965
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
for certain,

966
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
not leave it up in the air with all the other ones

967
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
that they usually do.

968
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
How tied in is the ZX series?

969
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I know it takes place like...

970
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Isn't the plot of ZX is like, it's like

971
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
years and years later,

972
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
and like kids,

973
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
they get data of

974
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
0 and X, and like, where them is like,

975
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
armor, basically.

976
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, they do a funny...

977
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Kids in the future do a funny fusion dance

978
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
to

979
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
call upon the power of the ancient

980
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Reployed Heroes

981
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and become superheroes.

982
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Well, when you say it like that,

983
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
it sounds kind of stupid.

984
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Oh, sorry.

985
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I haven't played it myself,

986
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
but yeah, the plot seems very

987
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
very Saturday morning cartoon.

988
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Like, they wanted to make a Mega Man game,

989
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
but they were kind of embarrassed about

990
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
what they were doing, so they tried to

991
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
make it distant.

992
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's...

993
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But also, pretty much the whole ZX

994
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
story sounds like

995
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
just a big pastiche

996
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
of homage. They're just like,

997
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
let's make it a...

998
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah, the stories in those games are kind of

999
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
underwhelming, but I like

1000
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
the concept of

1001
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
humans that can transform into

1002
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
the X

1003
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and zero heroes and stuff.

1004
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I've always been a sucker for

1005
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
the Super Sentai or Power Rangers

1006
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
concept of superheroes.

1007
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I think it's a very

1008
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
silly place to take the series,

1009
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
but I'm not like...

1010
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
completely against it.

1011
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I'm just kind of...

1012
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I just kind of find it

1013
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
amusing, like, hmm, okay.

1014
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Really? That's what you're going to do

1015
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
with it? I mean, alright.

1016
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Sure. Well, it's never going to be as cool

1017
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
as what the Mega Man Zero series did.

1018
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's hard to imagine.

1019
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I think...

1020
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I really just miss Mega Man.

1021
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Having played through

1022
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Legends and Legends 2 recently,

1023
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
yeah, Zero used to be

1024
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
a far and away favorite. I thought it was obviously

1025
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
the best game. I think it probably still

1026
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
is, but I think Legends is probably my second

1027
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
favorite. Legends is a really...

1028
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Legends

1029
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
accomplishes what it sets out to do.

1030
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
It succeeds at being the kind

1031
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
of game that it's trying to be. I would say

1032
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I would say about as well.

1033
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It's not around the heart. It's not around as well as

1034
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the Zero's game. They do have a lot of heart.

1035
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It's really well realized. I love

1036
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
the aesthetic.

1037
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
They figured out Z-Targeting

1038
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
in a 3D game.

1039
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, yeah.

1040
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You know, I realized

1041
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
as I was playing through Zero 2

1042
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that it really reminds me of Phenotopia.

1043
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You know that game? No.

1044
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It's an indie game

1045
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
made by some guy.

1046
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It was released on Newgrounds.

1047
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
It was published by Newgrounds.

1048
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's a side-scrolling platformer,

1049
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
but it's pixel-arc based.

1050
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Oh, I heard you talking about this.

1051
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah, I used to compare it to Cave Story

1052
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
because it sort of looks like

1053
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Cave Story side-scrolling pixel-based,

1054
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and it is an action game, but

1055
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
the combat is really clunky

1056
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
and the moment-to-moment

1057
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
gameplay of it

1058
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
is about

1059
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
a lot of it is about finding

1060
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
objects and bringing them to the

1061
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
people that want them in exchange for stuff,

1062
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
which feels like

1063
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Mega Man Legends a lot.

1064
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And it's also,

1065
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
thinking back on it, the story of Phenotopia

1066
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
is about delving into ruins

1067
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
of a mysterious origin

1068
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and nobody knows where they are,

1069
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and it turns out your protagonist

1070
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
has a secret connection to the creators

1071
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
of these ruins.

1072
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
That certainly sounds familiar.

1073
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Very, very similar.

1074
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Now that I've

1075
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
played all of it.

1076
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Legends is just one of those games

1077
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
that indie developers really like.

1078
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah, I think

1079
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
probably if I went back

1080
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and read that guy's blog, he probably

1081
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
would mention Mega Man Legends somewhere.

1082
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I feel like the connections are pretty similar.

1083
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I like Mega Man Legends, but

1084
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I do have issues with the controls.

1085
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It has those old-fashioned

1086
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
tank controls

1087
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
from a PS1 era.

1088
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I like Legends 2 controls

1089
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
much better.

1090
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I think the reason I bounced off Legends as a kid

1091
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
was because, yeah, I liked the

1092
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
sort of twitchy action

1093
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
of Mega Man, and so I picked up Legends

1094
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
and I think I found the combat really slow

1095
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
and clunky, and I was like,

1096
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
yeah.

1097
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's really hard to turn

1098
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
around and target enemies

1099
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and actually attack them effectively.

1100
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It's interesting because

1101
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I'd say Mega Man

1102
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
on NES,

1103
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Mega Man probably has some of the best feeling

1104
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
like platforming

1105
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
games on the entire library

1106
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and same with X on Super Nintendo.

1107
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Yeah.

1108
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Legends would be the best

1109
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
of the cream of the crop feeling

1110
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
3D games,

1111
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
but even Capcom kind of stumbled a little.

1112
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Not even close.

1113
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Their priorities were completely different.

1114
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But it still sort of pays off

1115
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
because people really,

1116
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
really like Legends regardless

1117
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
because the aesthetic and the world

1118
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and everything else

1119
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
is top-notch.

1120
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah.

1121
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I do like everything else about it.

1122
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The voice acting is pretty good

1123
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and the cutscenes are fun.

1124
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It is.

1125
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
That game has pretty decent voice acting,

1126
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'd say.

1127
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
You know, I'm thinking back to it

1128
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
and I can't remember any times

1129
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
when I thought the voice acting was bad

1130
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
in a way that stood out,

1131
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
so I am forced to conclude

1132
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
that the voice acting was good.

1133
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
There you go.

1134
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
It's a little cheesy.

1135
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It's like a Saturday morning cartoon.

1136
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Um...

1137
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
No one sounds like they're asleep

1138
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
or are

1139
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
asking what they're fighting for.

1140
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's way better than

1141
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Dr. Light from Mega Man 8.

1142
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Zero.

1143
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
If I become one of them,

1144
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
you have to finish me, Zero.

1145
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Don't be ridiculous, X.

1146
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I'm cutting off communications.

1147
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
If I were you, I would fight Dr. Huawei.

1148
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
A lot of them.

1149
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
A lot of them.

1150
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
When I was a kid,

1151
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I didn't realize how bad voice acting

1152
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
was in X4, so I actually kind of

1153
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
liked it back then.

1154
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Now I can see it's

1155
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
horrible. I still like it. I think it's pretty awesome.

1156
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
If anything, the only problem with it is that it's too quiet.

1157
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The voice acting is too quiet.

1158
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I can't hear it.

1159
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's so quiet.

1160
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I think they should have just left

1161
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
the Japanese voice acting and added subtitles.

1162
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Oh, like X6?

1163
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Yeah.

1164
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
If they were too lazy to get to dub it,

1165
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
then just do that.

1166
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
No dubbing is better than bad dubbing.

1167
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Exactly.

1168
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It depends on how story heavy

1169
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
the game is, but

1170
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I guess if the dub is bad, then yeah.

1171
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Something like a Mega Man X game,

1172
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I don't think it really matters.

1173
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It doesn't necessarily need an English dub,

1174
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
but I did think it was really funny

1175
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
that they just didn't even bother

1176
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
to dub X6 because they knew the game

1177
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
was a fucking trap.

1178
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
The issue with X5 and X6

1179
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
is that they didn't even have anime cutscenes.

1180
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
They just had static

1181
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
images.

1182
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
They put no effort at all into the cutscenes

1183
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
in those games.

1184
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I didn't really even mind the static images as a kid,

1185
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
because

1186
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
all the art in the cutscenes

1187
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
or the stills are on model

1188
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
well enough. That said,

1189
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
it is kind of lame that what is supposed

1190
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
to be like Zero's final

1191
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
hurrah is just resorted to

1192
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
stills.

1193
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It just stepped down from the anime cutscenes

1194
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
of X4, which were

1195
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
impressive to look at.

1196
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
They look really cool.

1197
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
The Sigma Zero fight

1198
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
is really badass.

1199
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It's like

1200
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
the reaction to the cutscenes in

1201
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
4 was bad, so instead of

1202
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
improving them, we're

1203
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
not going to do cutscenes anymore.

1204
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I don't think they were aware of

1205
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
the reactions back then.

1206
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
They probably didn't know the reactions

1207
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
until after the internet became

1208
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
more popular.

1209
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That's true, and it was just

1210
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
the English that was terrible.

1211
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Probably in Japan, it was fine.

1212
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I think it's just budgetary reasons.

1213
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
They just kept getting lower and lower

1214
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
budget.

1215
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
It seemed like for X4, they had a pretty big

1216
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
budget.

1217
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
They wanted to go big with that one.

1218
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It was X5 and X6.

1219
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
They just wanted to make it

1220
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
really cheaply.

1221
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I'm looking this up.

1222
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Apparently, the

1223
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Phenotopia remake

1224
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
was released on Switch last year.

1225
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I saw. I was looking that up.

1226
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It's all steamed, too, I guess.

1227
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I knew that they were making

1228
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Phenotopia 2,

1229
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
but apparently, they were

1230
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
being developed at the same time,

1231
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
but apparently they have stopped making

1232
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
it when they're doing something else now.

1233
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't know what that is.

1234
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
At least they're still around.

1235
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I don't know

1236
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
why remake it, though.

1237
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Artists

1238
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
love

1239
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
finding something they made early on

1240
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
and then trying to improve upon it.

1241
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah, like George Lucas.

1242
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah, like George Lucas.

1243
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
God, I hope he didn't George Lucas

1244
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Phenotopia.

1245
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I would like to play the remake

1246
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
just to see

1247
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
what is different.

1248
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I know they added

1249
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
cooking systems and stuff,

1250
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
which could be fun,

1251
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
but I don't know. I feel like Phenotopia was

1252
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I feel like it was just fine.

1253
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Yeah, that's the issue I had

1254
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
was Maverick Hunter X

1255
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
is that I felt Megaman X didn't need

1256
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
a remake.

1257
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It was really, really good as is.

1258
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Well, I haven't played it.

1259
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
The question is that it's there to

1260
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
update the lore.

1261
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Sort of.

1262
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I feel like the lore didn't need an update

1263
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
because they updated the lore

1264
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
in the subsequent games.

1265
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I do like

1266
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
the Day of Sigma

1267
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
video,

1268
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
but besides that, I felt everything else

1269
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
was kind of unnecessary.

1270
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I think it is mostly

1271
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
fine.

1272
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It's a good game on its own.

1273
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I would probably never play it over the original

1274
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
X.

1275
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
That said, it does have

1276
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
some extra stuff.

1277
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The Vile mode is kind of cool.

1278
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The only problem with it is that

1279
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
when you play,

1280
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
you play as Vile,

1281
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
instead of how X gets powers

1282
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
from all the different Mavericks he fights,

1283
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Vile has

1284
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
this equipment mechanic where

1285
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
before a stage, you give him certain

1286
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
pieces of equipment that

1287
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
changes Musa out

1288
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
around. Just pretty cool.

1289
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It's pretty cool.

1290
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
It's a neat little addition.

1291
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
The problem is that

1292
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
he has this song

1293
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
that plays

1294
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
throughout the entire game.

1295
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
They don't play the stage music.

1296
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
They play some butt metal.

1297
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Wow.

1298
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
They throw every level and you

1299
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
get fucking sick of playing as Vile

1300
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
two stages in.

1301
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It's really weird.

1302
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
That really is a bummer.

1303
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I think it's the same song for all the stages.

1304
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Yup. It's the same exact song.

1305
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
It's some generic

1306
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
shitty butt metal riff.

1307
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It's so bad.

1308
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
That is unfortunate.

1309
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
There's no zero.

1310
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
You don't get to play a zero. I know he dies,

1311
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
but come on.

1312
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Vile also dies at the end.

1313
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah. Vile dies too.

1314
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
They could have done something to

1315
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
play a zero.

1316
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Why wouldn't they make a zero mode?

1317
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
That seems like such an obvious inclusion.

1318
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It does because when you play X,

1319
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
there's a lot of moments where zero says

1320
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
he's going to scout around or he's going to do

1321
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
something off-screen.

1322
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
That's true.

1323
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That would have been a perfect

1324
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
opportunity to have a zero mode

1325
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
where you get to see what he does off-screen.

1326
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
At the beginning he says

1327
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I'll...

1328
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I'm going to find Sigma.

1329
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
At Sigma's Fort, I think he says

1330
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I'll

1331
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
make a frontal assault on Sigma

1332
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
on the fortress while you

1333
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
sneak in while I distract

1334
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
the main forces.

1335
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It's something like...

1336
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I assume it was just

1337
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
time restraints or something.

1338
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Zero was a staple in all the games at that point.

1339
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
But if they had the time,

1340
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I think it would have been cool if

1341
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
you get a zero mode and he goes through

1342
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
remixed stages.

1343
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That would be different because

1344
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
we got to get the game out.

1345
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I understand

1346
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
that that's

1347
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
gamer entitlement to ask,

1348
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
why didn't you make even more game?

1349
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I feel like simply implementing

1350
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
another character to play through the same stages.

1351
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I appreciate

1352
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
the novelty of a vile mode.

1353
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I think that's cool.

1354
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Why would you not have a zero mode?

1355
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It seems like such an obvious inclusion.

1356
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Seems like it wouldn't have been that hard.

1357
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
The intention they had was to

1358
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
remake the entire X-Series

1359
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
just like how they were going to remake

1360
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
all the classic games with

1361
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Mega Man Powered Up.

1362
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It seems a little like George

1363
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Lucas-ing to me. I'm glad it didn't happen.

1364
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah.

1365
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I think Powered Up is probably

1366
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
a better

1367
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
reimagining.

1368
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I'm sorry, Powered Up has Oilman

1369
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
and that's racist.

1370
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Oilman? Yeah.

1371
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I don't think

1372
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
they should have made Oilman.

1373
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
They probably shouldn't have made Oilman.

1374
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I think they changed

1375
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
them into purple in the US release

1376
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
like with Janks and Pokemon.

1377
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
They pulled the Janks, I see.

1378
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Yeah.

1379
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I don't really care for the cutesy

1380
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
art style of Powered Up

1381
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
either.

1382
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Again, I haven't played it, but I've seen it.

1383
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I don't see the appeal.

1384
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I don't like what I've seen.

1385
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
What I think it does better than

1386
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Maverick Hunter, though, is that

1387
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
it has a lot more bang for your buck.

1388
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It has a level designer.

1389
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yeah, there's a level editor.

1390
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
That's neat.

1391
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You can't play a zero on

1392
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Maverick Hunter X, but you can play

1393
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
literally every robot master in Powered Up

1394
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
and Roll.

1395
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
That's cool.

1396
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
If you could play as Chill Penguin

1397
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
in Maverick Country,

1398
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
that would be sick.

1399
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
That would be so sick.

1400
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Yeah.

1401
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Imagine your plan is

1402
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Spark Mandrill trying to go through

1403
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
the little boss doors.

1404
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
It just has a little

1405
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
discharge.

1406
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But obviously,

1407
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
if you're going to play as any robot master

1408
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
in Powered Up, you have to play as a oilman.

1409
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I just can't relate

1410
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
to a character of a different race

1411
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
than myself.

1412
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
If you woke to play as an oilman,

1413
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I'm sorry, this is terrible.

1414
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I'm ashamed of myself.

1415
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Remake's bad.

1416
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Remake's bad and I disagree with him

1417
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
philosophically.

1418
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Kind of, I guess.

1419
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I was playing the Resident Evil Remakes

1420
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
recently.

1421
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I just beat Resident Evil 2

1422
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
and everyone

1423
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
really likes that one.

1424
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I just started three and I know

1425
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I like that one.

1426
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Having played

1427
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
the older ones,

1428
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
recently,

1429
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I feel like I have a pretty good frame of reference

1430
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
to quantify

1431
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
what is good about the remake

1432
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
and what isn't, etc.

1433
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I liked Resident Evil 2 Remake.

1434
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I don't know if I liked it as much as the original,

1435
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
but

1436
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
it still kind of

1437
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
justifies itself in my head

1438
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
as a pretty

1439
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
significant reimagining

1440
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
of the events of that game

1441
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
and has enough

1442
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
where I can kind of see

1443
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
them existing concurrently.

1444
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I would never say

1445
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
don't play the original, just play the remake

1446
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
for Resident Evil 2.

1447
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I would say play both

1448
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
because they're both good games.

1449
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
What's different?

1450
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Well, obviously,

1451
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
it's a big

1452
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
budget 3D

1453
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
AAA game now.

1454
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It's got the over-the-shoulder camera.

1455
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
The original

1456
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
was pre-rendered

1457
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
to tank controls.

1458
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
That's a completely different

1459
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
play experience.

1460
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It plays completely differently

1461
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and the layout of the police station

1462
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
and the other levels are different

1463
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
to some degree.

1464
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's a lot like...

1465
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
There was this section in the game.

1466
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Let's see how we can reincorporate it

1467
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
in a new way.

1468
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
There was a lot of stuff I was seeing

1469
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
or I was like, oh, this kind of reminds me

1470
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
of this part of Resident Evil 2

1471
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
and now it's like this.

1472
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
That's kind of cool.

1473
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It plays Resident Evil 4?

1474
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Here's the thing.

1475
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
People always say that

1476
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
and

1477
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I guess it's similar

1478
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
in the sense that

1479
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
it's third-person shooters over the shoulder

1480
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
but the way

1481
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
you're meant to play

1482
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
in Resident Evil 4

1483
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
is completely different from

1484
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
the later remakes

1485
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
because in RE4

1486
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
the game

1487
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
just showers you an ammo

1488
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
at least on the normal difficulty.

1489
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
It showers you an ammo

1490
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
and it gives you all the opportunity

1491
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
to shoot the guys

1492
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
and then tackle them to the ground

1493
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
and stuff. You're basically encouraged

1494
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
to just kill everything

1495
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
and it's fun.

1496
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I replayed Resident Evil 4 recently

1497
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
and that game is so fucking good.

1498
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I remember Resident Evil 4

1499
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
coming out and getting

1500
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
10 out of 10s in Game Informer.

1501
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It was one of those games that got

1502
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
critically acclaimed

1503
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
way back in the day

1504
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
and basically wrote the book

1505
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
so like you would expect

1506
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
you'd expect

1507
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
it probably hasn't aged that well

1508
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
it's kind of the first to really do

1509
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
a lot of these things and it really hasn't

1510
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
it just feels so fucking good.

1511
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I don't know how to describe it.

1512
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I have high hopes

1513
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
for the

1514
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
RE4 remake

1515
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
and even if it

1516
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
comes out and is great

1517
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I would still recommend people play the original because it's...

1518
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I feel like remaking

1519
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Resident Evil 4 seems kind of unnecessary.

1520
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah.

1521
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It kind of is.

1522
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I'm not going to say it isn't because

1523
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
the game holds up perfectly fine nowadays.

1524
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I feel like they're just kind of doing it to do it.

1525
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
But if the game comes out good

1526
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
then it's two good games, right?

1527
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That's

1528
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
how I feel about the Pokemon remakes now.

1529
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I think that's a...

1530
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Do you really need Shining Diamond

1531
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
and Glistening Pearl or whatever?

1532
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
No.

1533
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
The game industry is kind of headed

1534
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
to where the movie industry was

1535
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
where they're just remaking a lot of old stuff

1536
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
because they can't come up with anything new that's good.

1537
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Is it like

1538
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
the Squatters rights thing, right?

1539
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You've got an IP but if you don't do something

1540
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
with the IP you can lose the rights to it.

1541
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Yeah.

1542
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I'm sure the Pokemon company doesn't have that problem

1543
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
but...

1544
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
You've got to keep the brand relevant

1545
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
by releasing something every so often.

1546
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I'm thinking of Square

1547
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
because they made a lot of Final Fantasy games

1548
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
that everybody hated so then they were like

1549
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
well everybody likes Final Fantasy 7

1550
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
so let's just release nothing but

1551
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Final Fantasy 7 games until

1552
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
forever I guess.

1553
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
That's kind of how it feels.

1554
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I know that they...

1555
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I mean they do...

1556
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I guess a 14 is a pretty big hit.

1557
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Yeah.

1558
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
14's its own completely different beast.

1559
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I think 14

1560
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
initially everybody hated it

1561
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
but then they were updated it

1562
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
and massively changed it

1563
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
and now it's people like it.

1564
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
It got a new producer

1565
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
and the guy basically turned the ship around

1566
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
and turned it into their biggest cash cow.

1567
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's wild that that is possible.

1568
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It's one of those

1569
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
one in a million big success stories

1570
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
for something like that.

1571
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I mean it's...

1572
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I think it's a more popular MMO these days

1573
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
than even WoW

1574
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
which is...

1575
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I definitely hear more people talking about 14.

1576
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah, me too.

1577
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It feels like the first

1578
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
time in a long time that

1579
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
an MMO has felt like relevant

1580
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
like people are talking about it.

1581
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Which is shocking.

1582
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I kind of never thought that would happen again.

1583
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It seems deserved.

1584
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Here's the thing.

1585
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Why would you name your MMO

1586
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Final Fantasy 14

1587
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
and then release a single player game

1588
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
that's Final Fantasy 15?

1589
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
This had a chip on my shoulder

1590
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
back when...

1591
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
When 11 came out and it was an MMO

1592
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
it always perplexed me.

1593
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
They should have just called it Final Fantasy Online.

1594
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I know.

1595
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It seems so obvious.

1596
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
It means that they thought it was a good idea.

1597
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
They were just so committed

1598
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
to the numbering system.

1599
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
We can't...

1600
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Too late now.

1601
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Too late now. Sorry.

1602
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
The other 11.

1603
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
If we don't do it

1604
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
people won't take the game seriously.

1605
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
If we call it anything other than

1606
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Final Fantasy Number

1607
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
people will think that's an admission of failure

1608
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
for saying this isn't a fake game.

1609
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
That was probably their thought process

1610
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
when making 11.

1611
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I think so.

1612
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
If we call it Final Fantasy Online

1613
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
people will see it as a side project.

1614
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
We got to get people to play it

1615
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
by calling it 11.

1616
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
You haven't played all the Final Fantasy

1617
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
unless you've played 11.

1618
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Which is a shame

1619
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
because from what I understand

1620
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
11 holds up perfectly fine on its own.

1621
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
It's a pretty well-liked game.

1622
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I don't think it really needed to be 11.

1623
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It's just a name

1624
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
at this point.

1625
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
It doesn't really matter.

1626
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
But it is strange.

1627
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
It is.

1628
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
It's just so stupid from a marketing standpoint

1629
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
because

1630
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Final Fantasy 14 is supposed to outlast

1631
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
15 and 16

1632
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
until it has an online one.

1633
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
It seems dumb

1634
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
to tie it to an old number.

1635
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I don't disagree.

1636
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
If it's successful

1637
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I assume they intend to eventually

1638
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
make a Final Fantasy 18

1639
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
or whatever. That is another MMO.

1640
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
They're going to continue

1641
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
drilling into this bad idea

1642
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
of, you know...

1643
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
You think it's a bad idea?

1644
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Or are you in the numbering system?

1645
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I'm shocked they still...

1646
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I'm shocked they're still numbering them.

1647
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
They're like one of the only companies

1648
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
that still does that.

1649
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yeah, at some point other ones

1650
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
start to not hyphenate.

1651
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
They start to use colons.

1652
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
They get embarrassed of the number.

1653
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Final Fantasy 7?

1654
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Fuck, there's 7 of these? How embarrassing.

1655
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Final Fantasy...

1656
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Can't all be the final one.

1657
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Let's make a

1658
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
control all delete webcomic

1659
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
about that.

1660
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
How can they all be the final fantasy?

1661
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Ahhhh!

1662
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Thank you Penny Arcade. Very cool.

1663
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
What were we talking about?

1664
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Oh, a fucking

1665
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
tie back to Resident Evil.

1666
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Resident Evil 7

1667
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
is called Resident Evil

1668
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Biohazard.

1669
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
But the VIL

1670
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
in 7 is like

1671
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
accented. So it looks like a 7

1672
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
in the evil. And Biohazard is the Japanese name

1673
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
to Resident Evil.

1674
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
So what's the name of Japan?

1675
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It's called Biohazard Resident Evil 7.

1676
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Wow!

1677
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
And then they have Resident Evil

1678
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Village

1679
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
where they do the thing again

1680
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
with the numerals 8 in the village.

1681
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Isn't that clever?

1682
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Wait a minute.

1683
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Yeah, it is.

1684
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It's cute.

1685
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
That's pretty cute.

1686
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Yeah, they did it.

1687
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I think Japanese companies

1688
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
are one of the only ones that

1689
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
do this kind of thing

1690
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
where they have a number

1691
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
into like

1692
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
they release so many sequels

1693
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
with numbered titles.

1694
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Because I can't think of

1695
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
like western

1696
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
equivalence to that.

1697
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Well, you know, you got

1698
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
the wizardry games. Those got to like 9

1699
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
or something.

1700
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Same with Ultima.

1701
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But those are pretty old. I can't think of anything that got to

1702
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
like 16.

1703
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
True.

1704
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
True, true. I think Final Fantasy might

1705
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
be the one.

1706
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Unless there's like some obscure like

1707
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
shitty shovelware game that's on like

1708
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Majang number 70 or something.

1709
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Bloons.

1710
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Yeah, Bloons got to like 6 tower defense games.

1711
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Okay, not even as many

1712
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
as I thought.

1713
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Wait, what's that one?

1714
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
What's that like

1715
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
turn based flash game

1716
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
with the anime characters?

1717
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
You're gonna have to be a little more specific.

1718
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
You have to be more specific.

1719
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It has the slimes.

1720
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Oh god, this isn't narrowing it down at all.

1721
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Adventure quest?

1722
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Oh, it sort of feels like Adventure

1723
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
quest.

1724
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Oh god, this is gonna haunt me.

1725
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Ragnarok online.

1726
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Your main character

1727
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
is like a blonde pirate guy

1728
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
who like summons swords.

1729
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It was on

1730
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Newgrounds. He summons lots of swords.

1731
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Oh god!

1732
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
That was like a combination of one piece of Final Fantasy

1733
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
The side character,

1734
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
the cute side character is a slime

1735
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
but he's like a little cat

1736
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
necko slime or something like that.

1737
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Oh no, sword

1738
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
quest

1739
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
sword adventure

1740
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
anime

1741
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
anime quest adventure

1742
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
sword

1743
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I can't

1744
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I can't handle it.

1745
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Google. Google.

1746
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Pirate

1747
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
anime

1748
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
cat

1749
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
slime sword

1750
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
summon

1751
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
quest. God help you.

1752
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Give me.

1753
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Please.

1754
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
This is gonna be the hardest thing to find.

1755
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I'm not.

1756
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I'm gonna lose it.

1757
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I'm gonna freaking lose it.

1758
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Wait, I'll add Newgrounds to the list.

1759
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Battle

1760
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
something

1761
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I never played

1762
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
many Newgrounds flash games

1763
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
back in the day.

1764
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I played my fair share.

1765
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Epic battle fantasy.

1766
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I think I actually remember hearing about that one.

1767
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Let me post the screenshot.

1768
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
What a generic name.

1769
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Yeah, I think

1770
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I think that's the point.

1771
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Yeah, probably.

1772
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Is Cloud Strife unlockable?

1773
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I think you should win an award

1774
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
for winning this one.

1775
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Epic battle fantasy.

1776
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Pow.

1777
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Blammo.

1778
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Oh, geez.

1779
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Hell yeah.

1780
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It reminds me of Maple's story.

1781
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
It does.

1782
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
It's a...

1783
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
We have Dragon Quest at home.

1784
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Yeah, it's not really like that.

1785
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I mean, it looks like that, but it's got that

1786
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
freaking chibi how to draw anime

1787
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
style, but

1788
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
it's just a very...

1789
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
It's just a side-scrolling...

1790
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I mean, it's a turn-based...

1791
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
It's basically just a turn-based

1792
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
RPG, like battle

1793
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
gauntlet with no...

1794
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I mean, there's a story, but

1795
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
it's just about

1796
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
using big magic to do big

1797
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
attacks on enemies.

1798
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It sounds like Phantom's Revenge.

1799
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I was going to say, it's Phantom's Revenge.

1800
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
But good.

1801
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Damn.

1802
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It's got...

1803
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Phantom's Revenge only has one sword.

1804
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Oh, man. It's been so long

1805
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
since I've listened to the

1806
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
PCP and I was catching up.

1807
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And I just recently got

1808
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
past Ben releasing

1809
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Phantom's Revenge, so I got to ask...

1810
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
That's like four months ago.

1811
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
The post-mortem.

1812
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
How does it feel four months out

1813
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
from release?

1814
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
The post-mortem is,

1815
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
you know, it got the...

1816
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I think it got... It's a crude

1817
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
like 500 downloads now,

1818
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
which is, you know, that's nice.

1819
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Cool.

1820
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I think the game came out good,

1821
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
came out pretty much exactly how I wanted it

1822
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
to, which, I mean, what more can you ask

1823
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
for? My

1824
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
goal is...

1825
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
You know, because I'm

1826
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
still trying to get the book printed

1827
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
and when I do the Kickstarter, I'm hoping

1828
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
that the Kickstarter is

1829
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
a big success and gets eyes on it

1830
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
and maybe some more people check the game out

1831
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
from

1832
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
hearing about it through that.

1833
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
That's my hope, anyway.

1834
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Are you still considering that idea

1835
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
of like

1836
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
scraping out

1837
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
the Sonichu references to make it

1838
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
more palatable, or was that just a slight

1839
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
musing from months

1840
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
gone by? That would...

1841
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
That would be... If I did

1842
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
that...

1843
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
That would take a lot of work,

1844
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I feel like. It would...

1845
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I mean, it would just be a matter of changing

1846
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
sprites and changing some dialogue.

1847
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
If I did something like that,

1848
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
it would basically be in...

1849
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I would basically just create

1850
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
a sequel. I would just

1851
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
make another game that

1852
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
had similar, like, systems

1853
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
and just different

1854
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
enemies or something,

1855
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
which I don't have any immediate plans to do. Yeah,

1856
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I did think about, like,

1857
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
should I scrape this of Sonichu

1858
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
because Sonichu is

1859
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
brand poison? And I think,

1860
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
like...

1861
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It wouldn't be the same game,

1862
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
so...

1863
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Maybe I would come back to it

1864
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
and make it

1865
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
basically a different game or a different

1866
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
version that is its own

1867
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
thing. That is not

1868
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Sonichu related.

1869
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
You'd be able to use a lot of the

1870
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
codeface still, right?

1871
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I could... Like, assets?

1872
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Yeah.

1873
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Or just, like, the way the game works.

1874
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Yeah, I could definitely

1875
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
recycle a lot of it

1876
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
into...

1877
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Yeah, there's a lot I could reuse.

1878
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I don't see why you have to remove

1879
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
the Sonichu references

1880
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
since they're all, like, enemies

1881
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
and bad guys.

1882
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I don't know. My thought

1883
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
at the time, and I think it probably has some

1884
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
truth to it, is just that, like,

1885
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
any association with Sonichu

1886
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
at all, to a certain kind of person

1887
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
that's, like,

1888
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
just so hideous.

1889
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Just so hideously off-putting and, like,

1890
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
basically synonymous with

1891
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
all sorts of

1892
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
negative things.

1893
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I'm just thinking, it's like

1894
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
if the bad guys were Nazis,

1895
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
you wouldn't say, like, oh, man,

1896
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I gotta get rid of all these Nazis.

1897
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I don't want to have any references.

1898
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I don't think it's the same

1899
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
because everybody

1900
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
knows what World War II is.

1901
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It stands to reason that

1902
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
if you are putting

1903
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Sonichu in your game, then you know

1904
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
what a Sonichu is, which means

1905
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
you know about Chris Chan, and some people

1906
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
just, like, don't want

1907
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
anything to do with that at all.

1908
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah, everyone knows what a Nazi is.

1909
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yeah, everybody knows what a Nazi is.

1910
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
And Nazis are, like, a

1911
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
relevant, historical villain.

1912
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
If you're

1913
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
making Sonichu-related content,

1914
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
you are choosing to put this in front of people,

1915
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
you're making choices,

1916
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
and they're bad choices, and people don't appreciate it,

1917
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
and that's what I did.

1918
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
But to be fair,

1919
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
you did it at a time, you know,

1920
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
in a different time when it wasn't

1921
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
four times.

1922
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I know what you mean.

1923
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I think

1924
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
there is some cringe factor.

1925
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
There's a cringe factor with

1926
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Sonichu that, like, if you are describing

1927
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
the game, and it's like, oh, it has

1928
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Sonichu's in it, in any extent,

1929
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
people will be like, oh, that's cringe.

1930
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
That makes the game cringe.

1931
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Which honestly, I can't really,

1932
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I get it.

1933
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Wasn't that always the case, though?

1934
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Anything related to Sonichu

1935
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
was always cringe, even,

1936
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
you know, before current events.

1937
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Listen, there's people

1938
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I mean, you know

1939
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
that Sonichu redrawn, someone

1940
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
re-drew it from Rosichu's perspective?

1941
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
No, I don't know

1942
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
that, but...

1943
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Someone redrew, like, a chapter

1944
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
of it from Rosichu's perspective, and

1945
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
that redraw had good art

1946
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
and it was, like, rewritten

1947
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
to be good.

1948
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
And it was, like, the person that made it

1949
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
was talented and he did a good job

1950
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
and it's a good comic. However,

1951
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
it's still Sonichu

1952
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
and it's still, like,

1953
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I don't know, I think

1954
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
to a certain extent, it's like

1955
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
this idiot wasted their time

1956
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
making Sonichu content.

1957
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Like, what a freak.

1958
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Disgusting.

1959
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I feel a little part of me feels that way

1960
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
about myself.

1961
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
So, you know...

1962
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Well, shucks.

1963
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I contain multitudes, is what I'm saying.

1964
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Yeah, so...

1965
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Don't worry about it.

1966
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
At least you didn't waste, like, 15 years

1967
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
writing 500 reviews.

1968
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I

1969
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
will waste my time

1970
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
doing something. I swear to God.

1971
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Don't you, don't you doubt it.

1972
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I want, I want to talk about those

1973
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
for a second, because I

1974
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm meaning to say this for a while, and since

1975
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
you, Gamer's Tavern, are on this

1976
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
podcast with me, I suppose I can

1977
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
now.

1978
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I was, I actually went back

1979
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
and I was looking at some of your, like, old

1980
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
you're on your website, like, your old, like,

1981
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
blog posts or, like, your reviews

1982
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
or whatever. Just, like, your writings, I guess.

1983
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And, you know,

1984
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I guess I don't really know what I

1985
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
expected, but

1986
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
you're really mean in those,

1987
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I've noticed.

1988
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Really? Yeah.

1989
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
It was a different time.

1990
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I haven't read a lot of your text

1991
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
reviews.

1992
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Gamer's Tavern's

1993
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
text posts were, like, because, you know,

1994
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
you hear him on the podcast and he's a pretty

1995
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
mild-mannered guy, you know, he's a little corny,

1996
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
funny corny jokes. So, you know,

1997
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I expected, like, some

1998
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
some, like, some dry

1999
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
witty, sort of,

2000
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
like, uh,

2001
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
deadpan analysis of some

2002
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
sort, but he's a lot fireier.

2003
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
The fire in his heart burned

2004
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
bright, I'd say.

2005
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I feel like that was, sort of, just

2006
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
indicative of the time.

2007
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And, you know, just being younger.

2008
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Like, it was an era of angry reviews

2009
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
and an era of, like,

2010
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
insult, insulting something.

2011
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Yeah.

2012
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I mean, he's right here,

2013
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
so I guess he could speak for himself.

2014
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Well, you know, that was,

2015
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I started the site nearly 20 years ago.

2016
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
So,

2017
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
you know, I was different back then.

2018
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Yeah.

2019
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
You know, when I first started

2020
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
writing, I kind of had a bit of

2021
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
a persona on my website.

2022
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
That's why I figured

2023
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
that's what that was.

2024
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
It was different from how I am

2025
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
in person, so it was

2026
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
kind of like a

2027
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Maddox, you know, Maddox.

2028
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It's kind of like

2029
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
that kind of thing.

2030
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
But I didn't

2031
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
know who Maddox was at the time.

2032
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
You know, so I thought it was being

2033
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
completely original.

2034
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
It's hard for

2035
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
me to imagine you with, like,

2036
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
a, I'm being mean

2037
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
gimmick. That's crazy.

2038
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Yeah, it was being kind of

2039
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
mean and cynical and

2040
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
egotistical and narcissistic.

2041
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
But I was kind of doing it

2042
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
in, like, a self-deprecating

2043
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
way.

2044
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It's part of the joke.

2045
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It's so funny.

2046
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
So I did that for a while,

2047
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
but then when I realized

2048
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Maddox already did that before

2049
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I did, I kind of stopped

2050
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
because...

2051
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Yeah, I guess that is a bit...

2052
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I didn't want people to accuse me of copying him.

2053
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Yeah.

2054
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
People probably accuse Maddox

2055
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
of copying someone else.

2056
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Yeah, and there's a lot of, like,

2057
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Maddox copycat writers

2058
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
that used to exist back then

2059
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
in, like, 2005.

2060
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I'm sure Maddox wasn't the first

2061
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
person to, like, do

2062
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
comedy in a sort of, like,

2063
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I'm being an over-the-top

2064
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
asshole on purpose sort of

2065
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
way.

2066
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Yeah, probably not.

2067
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Yeah.

2068
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Who would contemporary critics

2069
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
have compared Maddox's comedy to

2070
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
at the height of his power?

2071
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Sean Baby, I guess?

2072
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Yeah, that's another one.

2073
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Did Sean Baby exist when Maddox

2074
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
was writing the best page in the universe?

2075
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Yeah, Sean Baby was, like, late 90s.

2076
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Yeah, Maddox started, I think, in 97.

2077
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Was he? Yeah, I think so.

2078
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I'm not super knowledgeable on Sean Baby,

2079
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
but...

2080
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I still don't know anything about Sean.

2081
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I've heard the name, I don't know who that is.

2082
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Yeah, he's, like, an old

2083
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
internet writer. I'd say it's, like,

2084
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
him and Maddox are, like, kind of, like,

2085
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
old guard that are somewhat still around.

2086
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I think Sean... Didn't Sean Baby, like,

2087
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
found Cracked or something?

2088
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I don't know. I'm not sure

2089
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
what Sean Baby did later,

2090
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
but I know, you know,

2091
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I think he used to write for EGM or something.

2092
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
He used to be a video game magazine

2093
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
writer, then he started writing on the

2094
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
internet.

2095
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Are there any, like, stand-up comedians

2096
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
that have a persona that's, like,

2097
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
oh, I mean to children, like,

2098
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
dead baby jokes? Yeah, all of them.

2099
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yeah, basically.

2100
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I mean, dead baby jokes, that was

2101
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Andrew Dice Clay's saying, wasn't it?

2102
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I'm not familiar

2103
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
with the man's work.

2104
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
But, perhaps.

2105
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Yeah.

2106
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I think most male comedians, you could

2107
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
probably find them making a joke about how they hate kids.

2108
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I'm just saying, you know,

2109
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
the animatics stick

2110
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
came... did not come

2111
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
spring fully formed.

2112
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm sure he was influenced

2113
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
by comedians and stuff,

2114
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
but he was probably the first, like,

2115
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
major internet person

2116
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
to do that style of humor.

2117
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Because he started in the late 90s,

2118
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and, you know, the internet

2119
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
barely existed back then.

2120
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I know that

2121
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
my friends

2122
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
were really into Maddox when he was

2123
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
running the best page in the universe.

2124
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Well,

2125
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
a lot of his old writing, I think,

2126
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
is, you know, was pretty good for the time,

2127
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
and some of it still holds up.

2128
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I don't know why he, like,

2129
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
stopped and, you know,

2130
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
started doing other weird

2131
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
stupid nonsense.

2132
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Yeah.

2133
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I don't know, maybe he just

2134
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
maybe he'd run that

2135
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
stick into the ground.

2136
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I mean, he's doing it for a long time.

2137
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
He's doing YouTube videos later,

2138
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
and those weren't as good as the articles,

2139
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
but, you know, some of them were fine,

2140
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I guess. They were pretty popular, though.

2141
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Yeah.

2142
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I don't know why he didn't continue doing them,

2143
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
because they were getting good views,

2144
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
and, you know, some of them were okay.

2145
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
You know, some of them were decent.

2146
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I think...

2147
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
He famously had that cuck one,

2148
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
which kind of

2149
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
started a lot of things.

2150
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Yeah, that one wasn't that great, but...

2151
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
There were a couple of other ones that were

2152
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
fine, you know.

2153
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I think just the issues he was having

2154
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
with Dick Masterson

2155
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
maybe

2156
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
demoralized him, and he didn't want to work

2157
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
on content anymore.

2158
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It's funny, I still see him

2159
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
every once in a while,

2160
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
just like on a scant

2161
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Twitter post every now and then.

2162
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I'm just like, oh yeah, he's still around, huh?

2163
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So, you know,

2164
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
there's that.

2165
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I'm reading an article

2166
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
by Sean Baby

2167
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
from February 12, 2012

2168
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
called four, quote,

2169
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
geek humor books

2170
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
by authors who understand neither.

2171
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I'm already laughing.

2172
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
It's possible Maddox

2173
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
was inspired by Sean Baby, you know.

2174
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Pure...

2175
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Yeah.

2176
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Let me see here.

2177
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I'd say they're contemporaries.

2178
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I've never heard him mention Sean Baby,

2179
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
but

2180
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
here's a sample

2181
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
from this article.

2182
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I guess this is a real

2183
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
book that's being

2184
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
reviewed.

2185
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
This is very,

2186
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
it's kind of like Maddox's thing,

2187
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
but Sean Baby did it first.

2188
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Hmm.

2189
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Write a book? Yeah, Sean Baby

2190
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
already did that pal, sorry.

2191
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
No, Sean Baby didn't write this book.

2192
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
He's reviewed, he's lampooned.

2193
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
This is a real book from

2194
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
1993

2195
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
by some guy

2196
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
and he's featuring.

2197
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
It's being featured here.

2198
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It's like when Maddox

2199
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
reviews an old book or something

2200
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
and, you know... Oh my god.

2201
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Maddox did an article reviewing old

2202
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
book covers, I think.

2203
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Yes.

2204
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Well, wasn't that one of the,

2205
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
that was one of the

2206
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
basis for his

2207
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
one of his books that he sold?

2208
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Or no, he like, made fun

2209
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
of kids drawings in one of them.

2210
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
How do you get...

2211
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
What do you get when you cross Pac-Man with a sweater?

2212
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
An owl pack a

2213
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
sweater. Ah, jeez.

2214
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Woo! I think we found

2215
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
where Gamers Tavern gets his jokes from.

2216
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Yeah, pretty much.

2217
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Maddox was inspired by Sean Baby.

2218
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Gamers Tavern

2219
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
was inspired by good old John Byrne.

2220
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Yeah, pretty much.

2221
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I mean, like a

2222
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Titan of the industry.

2223
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Uh...

2224
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Uh...

2225
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Those were different times.

2226
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I gotta tear my eyes away. I can't read this

2227
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
whole article right now. That's just rude.

2228
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
That's just rude.

2229
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
To my listeners and my guests.

2230
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I haven't been posting on the website much lately,

2231
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
but I do make YouTube videos

2232
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
sometimes.

2233
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I saw you made a video

2234
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
talking about or

2235
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
showing off all of the

2236
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
enemy descriptions

2237
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
in Mario RPG.

2238
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And you got Cybershell to voice them.

2239
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Wait a minute.

2240
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Yeah, that sounds...

2241
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
That sounds great.

2242
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I want to see that video.

2243
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Yeah, that was

2244
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
that was a very

2245
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
time-consuming project.

2246
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I could see that.

2247
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
That's in decent views.

2248
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Okay, I'm gonna check this one out.

2249
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Enemy thoughts

2250
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
in Mario RPG.

2251
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
That's awesome.

2252
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
In Mario RPG, you have this ability

2253
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
where you can see the enemy's

2254
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
one-on-one. Yes, Psychopath.

2255
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Very interesting name for that.

2256
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Yeah, Malo's Psychopath ability.

2257
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
You know, I remember

2258
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
when I was a kid,

2259
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
my dad is a psychologist

2260
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
and I played that game and I saw that ability

2261
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
and I didn't know what that word meant

2262
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
and I asked my dad like,

2263
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
hey, what does that mean?

2264
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
He seemed disturbed by the question.

2265
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I

2266
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
feel like it's some sort of mistranslation

2267
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
because shouldn't it be called telepathy

2268
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
or something?

2269
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Because Malo's reading the guy's minds, right?

2270
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yeah, it would be...

2271
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Yeah, the name doesn't make sense.

2272
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
What's the word when you read people's thoughts?

2273
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
It's not clairvoyance.

2274
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Oh, not telepathy.

2275
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Telepathy is telekinesis, right?

2276
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
No, telepathy is when you can

2277
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
speak with your mind.

2278
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
But reading other people's thoughts

2279
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
is...

2280
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
there's a specific word.

2281
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Is it clairvoyance?

2282
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
No, clairvoyance, I think, is like

2283
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
seeing and fearing at a...

2284
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
No, it's seeing at a distance.

2285
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
You're clairvoyant if you can like see what's happening somewhere else

2286
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
from where you are.

2287
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I think so. Wait.

2288
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Clair...

2289
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
clairvoyance is...

2290
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
That's how it works in Psychonauts.

2291
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Oh, perceiving things or events

2292
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
in the future or beyond normal sensory

2293
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
contact, okay.

2294
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

2295
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Okay, I guess it does include the future.

2296
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Regardless,

2297
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I saw the ability

2298
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Psychopath and Mario RPG

2299
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
and I thought I was going to get some fucking badass

2300
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
sicko mode move

2301
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
and then I just got the

2302
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
bestiary move, basically.

2303
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Okay, no, you were right.

2304
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Telepathy encompasses

2305
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
both speaking with the mind

2306
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
and hearing others with your mind,

2307
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
so there you go. Yeah, that makes sense.

2308
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Telepathy is what they...

2309
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I don't know why it's called that.

2310
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
It's pretty baffling.

2311
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
But I actually...

2312
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I think the last time I was on

2313
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
the PCP

2314
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I mentioned I was working on

2315
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
a new project,

2316
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
the video.

2317
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Yeah, probably.

2318
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
And I don't remember if it was on the episode

2319
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
or off the episode, but I described...

2320
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Let me see your channel.

2321
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I kind of, like,

2322
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
described it ambiguously.

2323
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
You know, so this is

2324
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
that video I was working on.

2325
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
That was months ago.

2326
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Because I basically wanted to make a video

2327
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
that would contain, you know,

2328
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
the old gamer's tavern humor,

2329
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
but wasn't a let's play

2330
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
video.

2331
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Because let's plays aren't really

2332
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
that popular anymore.

2333
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
So you mean it's this Mario one?

2334
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Yeah.

2335
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Listen, I'm excited

2336
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
because Mario RPG

2337
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
is one of my favorite games

2338
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
ever, and I don't know,

2339
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
just I want to

2340
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
hear jokes about

2341
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
the things that are in it.

2342
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I'm the market for this.

2343
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
It was basically the inspiration

2344
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
was to, you know,

2345
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
pick a game that a lot of people like,

2346
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
but show something off

2347
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
about that game that a lot of people don't know

2348
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
about, including people who do

2349
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
like it.

2350
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I'm certain there are some messages

2351
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
in here that I've never read before.

2352
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Yeah, and then also combine that with

2353
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
the gamer's tavern humor

2354
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
that everybody knows and loves.

2355
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Okay.

2356
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
We'll link that

2357
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
in the description. I will watch that

2358
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
after the podcast is over.

2359
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I want to consume

2360
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
that content. It was a pretty

2361
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
ambitious project, you know, because I had to go

2362
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
through all the enemy

2363
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
dialogue, which was

2364
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I think there's around 210 lines.

2365
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Is there

2366
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I was going to ask how many there are.

2367
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
There's 210. Do you do like commentary

2368
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
on each one? I kind of do

2369
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
like a quick rapid fire joke

2370
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
or comeback on each one.

2371
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Hmm.

2372
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I don't want to spend too much time on each one

2373
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
because the video is already 28 minutes.

2374
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I understand.

2375
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I understand.

2376
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
So I got a cyber shell to read

2377
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
the enemy lines.

2378
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
It's a good

2379
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
that way it's a, you know, he reads

2380
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
a line and then I respond to it.

2381
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Basically the gist of the

2382
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
video.

2383
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Ah,

2384
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
it's on my list.

2385
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
He did. He did a

2386
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
lot of work, you know, so

2387
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
yeah, major thanks to cyber show.

2388
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Yeah, to read 210

2389
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
line. So that's

2390
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
quite an ordeal.

2391
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Man.

2392
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I want to read lines.

2393
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I want to read lines in people's videos.

2394
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
And I was pretty

2395
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
surprised how quickly he

2396
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
got all the lines done.

2397
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Is that I kind of just ask them

2398
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
and then by like a day

2399
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
later, a couple of hours later, he was

2400
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
done with all of them.

2401
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Oh, wow. Does

2402
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
cyber shell just like

2403
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I see I hear his voice popping up in a lot of

2404
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
videos. Does he just like

2405
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I don't know, does he

2406
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
like advertise that like that's

2407
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
something he does or do you just

2408
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
a lot of people ask him to do that.

2409
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I think they can just ask him. Just because

2410
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
they've heard him in other stuff and they were like, let's

2411
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
get that guy.

2412
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I don't know, but I got

2413
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
him because

2414
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
first of all, I know him and

2415
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
we know each other and

2416
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I was

2417
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
inspired actually to make this video from one

2418
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
of his videos. He did a video on

2419
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
the

2420
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
NPC dialogue and Sonic Adventure

2421
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
and that's where I got the idea

2422
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
for this video.

2423
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I'm trying to remember if I've seen

2424
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
that cyber shell video.

2425
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I think it came out like last year or something.

2426
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I feel like I would have seen it, but I don't

2427
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
really remember it, but

2428
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
okay.

2429
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
He just seemed pretty appropriate

2430
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
and he's

2431
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
pretty good at reading lines. He has a way

2432
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
of doing it that's kind of funny.

2433
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
So that's what I needed. I needed

2434
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
a funny reading of enemy

2435
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
dialogue and Mario

2436
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
RPG.

2437
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
What we need is a Mario RPG remake.

2438
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
We need that

2439
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
remake. We need an HD. We need Over the

2440
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Folder.

2441
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
You know, actually

2442
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
when I was a kid, I was really disappointed

2443
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
that we never really got a sequel

2444
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
to Mario RPG.

2445
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Paper Mario

2446
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
is supposed to be like the sequel, but

2447
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
it's totally different. It doesn't feel

2448
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
anything like

2449
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
the original.

2450
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I'd say Mario and Luigi series is closer

2451
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
to capturing the Mario RPG

2452
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
feel, especially since

2453
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Alpha Dream was made of

2454
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
X Mario RPG

2455
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
devs.

2456
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
It doesn't play the same

2457
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
because you play

2458
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Mario and Luigi instead of

2459
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Mario and Luigi.

2460
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
It's still not quite the same.

2461
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
There's something missing.

2462
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I always

2463
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
was just like,

2464
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
why wasn't there another one?

2465
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
I didn't get a

2466
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
N64 so I couldn't play

2467
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Paper Mario.

2468
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Was Paper Mario 2 on the N64?

2469
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
It was on Gamecube.

2470
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I didn't get one of those either.

2471
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I'm a little younger

2472
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
so I was more attached to Paper Mario.

2473
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I only played Mario RPG

2474
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
when it came on Virtual Console

2475
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
and I thought it was alright.

2476
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I did eventually go back and play the Paper Mario

2477
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
games and they're good and I like them.

2478
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
But they're not the same.

2479
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I do like the Paper Mario games as well, but

2480
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
they lack the feel of

2481
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Mario RPG.

2482
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I did have

2483
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Game Boy Advance.

2484
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I did play

2485
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
at least the first

2486
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Mario...

2487
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Mario and Luigi.

2488
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Superstar Saga.

2489
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
That's good.

2490
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
The good thing about Mario RPG

2491
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
not really having a real follow-up

2492
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
is that it will remain

2493
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
forever distinct.

2494
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
There's nothing like it

2495
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
and it seems like

2496
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
there will never be anything like it.

2497
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Can you imagine

2498
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I don't even know

2499
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
if I would want them to

2500
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
try to follow it up?

2501
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Yeah, that's a good point.

2502
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Sometimes a sequel or

2503
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
a bunch of sequels can kind of ruin

2504
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
the legacy of the original.

2505
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Especially now,

2506
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
30 years later,

2507
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I just think

2508
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
they couldn't do it.

2509
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Whoever

2510
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
made that game

2511
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
is no longer the same.

2512
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Those same people don't exist.

2513
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
The world is such

2514
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
a different place that it would never

2515
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
be the same.

2516
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
So whatever.

2517
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Just...

2518
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
There's no hope

2519
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
of ever fully

2520
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
recapturing the magic exactly.

2521
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
So just leave it.

2522
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
It's always going to be different.

2523
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Yeah.

2524
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I think the reason for that is because

2525
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Mario RPG was co-developed

2526
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
by Square

2527
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
and Paper Mario

2528
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
was made just by Nintendo.

2529
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Yeah, intelligent systems.

2530
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
It lacked that Square touch.

2531
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Yeah.

2532
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Yeah.

2533
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
There's no Qlix.

2534
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Yeah, Qlix isn't in it.

2535
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
There's no Qlix. Mario's

2536
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Paper Mario is not the sequel

2537
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
because there's no Qlix.

2538
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I mean, I don't know.

2539
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Did Square write

2540
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
the dialogue?

2541
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I don't know how to...

2542
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
It didn't...

2543
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Chrono, you might know this.

2544
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
The Final Fantasy VI

2545
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
localizer Ted Woolsey

2546
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
write the dialogue for Mario RPG.

2547
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Well, you mean translated it, right?

2548
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Yeah.

2549
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I think so, but I'm not...

2550
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
For all intents and purposes, his dialogue

2551
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
in the English version.

2552
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Yeah, he's known for...

2553
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
He did Final Fantasy VI

2554
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
and also Secret of Mana.

2555
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Yes.

2556
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Maybe he did more RPG,

2557
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
but I'm not positive.

2558
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Let's see.

2559
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I think... I know Ted Woolsey.

2560
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
But I think

2561
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
maybe Square wrote the script for the game,

2562
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
the original Japanese script.

2563
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Yeah.

2564
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I kind of doubt that Nintendo did.

2565
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Yes, yes. He did.

2566
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
He did...

2567
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
He did translate Mario RPG.

2568
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Yeah, that makes sense because he translated

2569
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
most of the Square's big games back then.

2570
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Yeah.

2571
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Seems like Mario RPG

2572
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
was his last translation

2573
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
job for them.

2574
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I think I read

2575
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
in an interview with...

2576
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I think it was Shigeru Miyamoto

2577
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
when Square wanted Mario to have a sword.

2578
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Yes.

2579
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
It was against that, so he told them

2580
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
to change it into a hammer or something.

2581
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Wait a minute.

2582
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
The story I heard was like

2583
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
he was presenting it at

2584
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
like a conference or something and he

2585
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
this sounds fake. This sounds like a fake story.

2586
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
But he was like giving a presentation

2587
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
to an audience and he showed

2588
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
a slide of Mario with a sword

2589
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
and a slide of Mario with a hammer.

2590
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
And like

2591
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
the audience cheered louder

2592
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
for the hammer or something.

2593
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I swear I read that somewhere.

2594
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I didn't hear it like that, but I don't know

2595
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
maybe that's what happened.

2596
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
That sort of sounds like another story

2597
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
with Miyamoto from around

2598
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
that time when

2599
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Rare was making Donkey Kong 64.

2600
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
They gave...

2601
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
You can see this in previous footage, so this is real.

2602
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
This happened.

2603
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
You can see Donkey Kong

2604
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
with like a realistic gun

2605
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
because he has the coconut gun

2606
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
that fires and spurts.

2607
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Well originally they were just going to be real guns.

2608
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
And

2609
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
when they showed it to Miyamoto

2610
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
he was apparently really

2611
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
surprised and offended

2612
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
that they would give him a gun

2613
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
which apparently...

2614
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Why would you do that?

2615
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
So instead,

2616
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
when he saw that

2617
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
he came back with

2618
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
a little quick drawing

2619
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
of him with like a coconut gun

2620
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
instead and they just did that.

2621
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
So it sort of sounds similar

2622
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
to that story. I don't know

2623
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
if you got stories mixed up or anything

2624
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
but I could totally see

2625
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
something like that happening because

2626
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
90s game development was fucking wild.

2627
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Yeah.

2628
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Hey, you want to know a fact.

2629
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
When translating Super Mario RPG

2630
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Woolsey wanted to name

2631
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Punchinello James Bomb.

2632
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Though the idea was nixed.

2633
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
One reference to James Bond

2634
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Punchinello introducing himself

2635
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
as the names Nello

2636
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Punchinello remains in the final game.

2637
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I didn't know that.

2638
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
It's pretty interesting.

2639
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I would be curious

2640
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
to know

2641
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
what...

2642
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
if someone has ever re-translated Mario RPG

2643
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
to be more

2644
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
a more faithful translation.

2645
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And to see if the translation

2646
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
is just like really dry and lame

2647
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
and that like

2648
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Woolsey is what

2649
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
kind of helped to make that game's

2650
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
style feel so...

2651
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
That would be really interesting

2652
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
actually.

2653
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I heard that was a case for Paper Mario.

2654
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
The original Japanese script was

2655
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
boring and then the translators

2656
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
they added a lot of humor

2657
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
and references

2658
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
that weren't an original script.

2659
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I...

2660
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I know there's a few stories like that

2661
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
where like the original

2662
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
the original

2663
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
script was just kind of

2664
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
bland and it was

2665
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
quote-unquote punched up in localization

2666
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
for better or for worse. Mostly for better.

2667
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I think that was

2668
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
mostly in the thousand year door

2669
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
sequel.

2670
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I could see that. Not to say

2671
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
that the original Paper Mario wasn't funny

2672
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
or anything or charming

2673
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
as it was but like thousand year door

2674
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
was a lot

2675
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
quipier I'd say

2676
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
in a good way.

2677
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I like thousand year door

2678
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
who doesn't like thousand year door?

2679
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Also in the last few years I found out

2680
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
something that I didn't know about Mario RPG

2681
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
was that the soundtrack was composed

2682
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
by Yoko Shimamura

2683
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I think her name is.

2684
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
She's the one who did Kingdom Hearts

2685
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
soundtracks later on.

2686
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
And Street Fighter 2.

2687
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
She's like

2688
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
video game royalty.

2689
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
She's very very good at what she does.

2690
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
She's been doing it for a long time.

2691
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
That's from what you said.

2692
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Sorry.

2693
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I used to think

2694
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
that Mario RPG was done

2695
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
by the typical square

2696
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
composer of the time. His name is

2697
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Nobuu Umezu.

2698
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Yeah, Uematsu.

2699
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I didn't know it was actually

2700
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Yoko that did it

2701
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
recently. But it makes sense

2702
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
because it does sound like her music.

2703
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
She has kind of like a signature

2704
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
style.

2705
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Shimamura also did

2706
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
what else did you say?

2707
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Kingdom Hearts.

2708
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
That's what she's most known for nowadays.

2709
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
She also did a Legend of Mana

2710
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
for the PS1.

2711
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And actually there's a track

2712
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
in Legend of Mana that sounds exactly

2713
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
like a Mario RPG track.

2714
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Which Mario RPG track?

2715
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
It sounds like the Mushroom Kingdom one.

2716
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Okay.

2717
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
It's the magic city

2718
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
track from Legend of Mana.

2719
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Let me see if I can find it.

2720
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I'm trying to remember how the

2721
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Is that?

2722
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I know that one.

2723
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Mario Kingdom or the Mushroom Kingdom?

2724
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Yeah.

2725
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Yeah, it's something like that.

2726
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2727
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
So, if you're playing a RPG,

2728
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
fuck that chest

2729
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
that you can only get in that one room

2730
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
by jumping on that one toad's head

2731
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
that runs through that room one time.

2732
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
And you can never get the chest again.

2733
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Yeah, I remember.

2734
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
And then your radar beeps for the rest of the game.

2735
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Okay, that always

2736
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
stumped me as a kid.

2737
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I never know this.

2738
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Her first project was Live Alive.

2739
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
She just got a remake recently.

2740
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
What is Live Alive?

2741
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,240
She did the soundtrack to that game.

2742
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:41,880
Live Alive was a JRPG made by Square Enix.

2743
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,160
It never came out over here.

2744
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:47,280
It was only in Japan for Super Nintendo.

2745
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:50,360
It was directed by the Final Fantasy IV guy.

2746
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:53,400
That's what he did after.

2747
01:45:53,400 --> 01:46:01,480
And it's basically like you play as like eight different characters in different scenarios

2748
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,560
and it has like sort of like a grid based combat.

2749
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,360
I think you would like it then.

2750
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:12,600
I beat this game actually on an emulator back in like two thousand and three or four maybe

2751
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,600
two thousand five.

2752
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:14,600
Yeah.

2753
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:21,840
It's kind of one of those like great like top five RPG games you never got one of those

2754
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:22,840
games.

2755
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:23,840
I want to play it.

2756
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,840
I want to play it.

2757
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,840
Yeah.

2758
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:28,160
It got a fan translation years ago.

2759
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,160
I am.

2760
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:30,160
That's how I beat it.

2761
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:31,160
I beat it back then.

2762
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,160
It's pretty good.

2763
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,160
It's pretty interesting.

2764
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,560
I am listening to this track.

2765
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,560
It does.

2766
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:36,560
It does sound.

2767
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,560
Yeah.

2768
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,640
I can definitely hear the similarity with the Mushroom Kingdom.

2769
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,640
Oh yeah.

2770
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:42,640
Yeah.

2771
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:46,640
Actually I played Legend of Mana when I was younger and I never made the connection between

2772
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:54,480
this track and Mario RPG until now for some reason but it does sound very similar.

2773
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,160
Legend of Mana is the PlayStation one right?

2774
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,160
Yeah.

2775
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,160
Yeah.

2776
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,160
Yeah.

2777
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:03,480
It came out I think in either 99 or 2000 I think it was 2000.

2778
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:10,920
I always get Legend of Mana mixed up with Dawn of Mana which I think is the PS2 one

2779
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,520
that's apparently really bad.

2780
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,520
Yeah.

2781
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:14,520
I never played that one.

2782
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,880
I rented Legend of Mana one time and I played it a little bit and I didn't really get into

2783
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:24,680
it and I had Sword of Mana on the Game Boy Advance which I think is sort of a remake

2784
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:28,160
of like Seikenden Setsu one.

2785
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:29,160
Yeah.

2786
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:34,520
It's a remake of that which was released here as Final Fantasy Adventure on the Game Boy.

2787
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:35,520
Right.

2788
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,520
Right.

2789
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,520
Yeah.

2790
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,720
I mean it's a big remake.

2791
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,720
They changed a lot.

2792
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:41,720
Yeah.

2793
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:42,720
It's pretty different.

2794
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,720
Yeah.

2795
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:44,720
Hmm.

2796
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:45,720
Um.

2797
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:46,720
Video games.

2798
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:47,720
I love them.

2799
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:48,720
I have to pee.

2800
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:49,720
I will be back in a second.

2801
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:50,720
Go right ahead.

2802
01:47:50,720 --> 01:48:06,160
Well you know Legend of Mana is pretty interesting because it plays like Secret of Mana but I

2803
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:14,360
think the gimmick is that every time you beat an area or a quest you can place a building

2804
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:20,360
on the map and you can choose where you place the building and depending on how you place

2805
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:25,680
the buildings it affects certain elements in the game.

2806
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:32,440
The Mana series always seemed really interesting to me but I only I've only played Secret of

2807
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:42,160
Mana for a little bit and Secret of Mana is I mean it's a it's a it's a game.

2808
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:47,520
But I also remember watching your Children of Mana review.

2809
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:48,520
Yes.

2810
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:55,680
I have very extensive knowledge of Children of Mana which is probably not the best first

2811
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:58,400
impression to the series.

2812
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:02,640
Yeah I um I played that a little bit when it first came out and then I think in the

2813
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:09,840
last few years I went back and I beat it you know it revisited and it's a it's okay but

2814
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,760
it's kind of repetitive I think.

2815
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,760
Yeah.

2816
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:18,080
The the gameplay is really it really wears itself out very shortly.

2817
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:22,640
I don't know there is something sort of captivating about it or at least there was when I was

2818
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:29,440
a kid and it looks really pretty but um uh I it was one of those games I beat because

2819
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:36,120
they had not because I really liked it and it's a it kind of is pretty fun for the first

2820
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:41,360
dungeon or two but then after that it becomes way too samey.

2821
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,880
Especially since they expect you to do like side quests where it just go through those

2822
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:45,880
levels again.

2823
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:46,880
Yeah.

2824
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,800
Which is like uh I'd rather rather rather rather rather rather.

2825
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:55,240
It does kind of feel a little bit like one of those uh I guess quick cash-ins because

2826
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:58,880
is like they worked hard on the assets and building the core of the game but then the

2827
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:03,680
rest of it is just uh copy and pasted side quests.

2828
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:10,640
Yeah and the story isn't really anything to write home about either.

2829
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:15,640
But uh in my opinion one of the best mana games I think is Seikend Incense 2 3 which

2830
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:21,600
hmm try to localize right as trials of mana here.

2831
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:26,840
That was another one of those games that it kind of like Live Alive was one of those like

2832
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:30,640
never ever games which is amazing that it got localized.

2833
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:37,440
Yeah I uh I beat that game in 2014 uh because it got a fan translation I think around that

2834
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:39,840
time maybe a few years earlier.

2835
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:40,840
We hadn't before.

2836
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:44,440
No actually I had an old fan translation from the early 2000s.

2837
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,680
Oh that was like a shitty one though.

2838
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:50,040
And I just didn't get around to beating it up to 2014.

2839
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,120
Oh alright alright.

2840
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:58,520
And I published a review on it uh on my website back then you know that's the only reason

2841
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:05,120
I remember I beat it in 2014 because the review was written uh you know so that one is really

2842
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,120
good.

2843
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:07,720
I was very impressed by it.

2844
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,440
It's something I want I want to try.

2845
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:16,560
I bought that mana collection a couple of years ago and I played a little bit of Trials

2846
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,440
or Seikend Incense 2 3.

2847
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:24,800
I was playing with my uh with my brother though and you know to co-op in a game like that

2848
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:29,200
you kind of have to like align schedules and then it's like uh if I want to play and he

2849
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:32,400
doesn't want to play kind of shit out of luck so it just kind of never really got off the

2850
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,400
ground.

2851
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:34,400
Yeah that's right.

2852
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,400
I played it.

2853
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:36,400
Oh welcome back.

2854
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,080
Yes.

2855
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:42,680
That's the issue with these games is that uh if you can line up your schedule so that

2856
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:47,200
you can play with a friend or two every time it's probably going to be like one of the

2857
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:53,240
greatest experiences but if you can't do that you know most people can't do that uh then

2858
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:57,280
it's not going to be as good but it's still pretty fun as a single player.

2859
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,480
What are we talking about now?

2860
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:05,880
You know uh Trials of Mana Seikend Incense 2 3.

2861
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:09,920
It was uh it was a Mana game that came out on the Super Nintendo but never came out over

2862
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:15,760
here uh until like a couple of years ago when Square like dug up the ROM and localized

2863
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:16,760
it and remade it.

2864
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:21,200
Yeah I'm not sure why Square did that but uh pretty nice of them.

2865
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:29,680
Uh yeah it was surprisingly uh surprisingly out of character yeah charitable cause like

2866
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:35,680
you know they were remaking the game so they really had no reason to bother localizing

2867
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,840
the original.

2868
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:38,840
I see.

2869
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:44,200
Uh but they did so uh cool now we have two versions of the game awesome.

2870
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,840
Okay all right all right.

2871
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:52,880
Yeah and I uh I beat that one in 2014 and also published a review for it back then.

2872
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:57,160
Yeah this is really it's a really pretty game too.

2873
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:04,040
Hang on wait uh Trials of Mana yeah Trials of Mana there there's uh the the Super Nintendo

2874
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:10,240
version the the 3D remake they made uh I think I heard it was pretty good but it's definitely

2875
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:14,880
kind of low rent compared to like your Final Fantasy 7 remakes.

2876
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:15,880
Yeah.

2877
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:16,880
But that's okay.

2878
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,200
This not not everything needs to be like a huge dick.

2879
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:26,080
Well I prefer the original artwork I think the original art is uh fantastic.

2880
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:33,320
Yeah because at the time this was like the big dick triple A uh experience because this

2881
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:39,000
is like some of the best looking like sprite art on Super Nintendo yeah it's a square game

2882
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,500
so.

2883
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,600
And the music's pretty nice too.

2884
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:45,640
Yeah I should give this a try.

2885
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:49,600
Why did is this the one where you turn into a werewolf?

2886
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:53,120
I think that's one of the characters yeah one of the characters is named Kevin and he

2887
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:57,080
turns into a werewolf at night and he gets pretty strong.

2888
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:02,960
Oh yeah what man I think wait yeah you made it did you make a video about this chrono

2889
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,680
this this game uh no I just uh wrote a text review of it.

2890
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:12,680
Okay because I yeah I've seen this and like yeah the sprites look so good why would you

2891
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:20,480
not bring this that it was so good it's such a good looking SNES game what a waste.

2892
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:28,920
It was in the middle of that like time uh where RPGs still hadn't completely uh captured

2893
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:36,960
the west yeah or at least so they so square assumed I I think they did at least by the

2894
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:43,080
by the Super Nintendo I think the RPGs were doing all right for themselves uh because

2895
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:48,520
I know I know I was playing like Final Fantasy IV and stuff or at least my brother was.

2896
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:53,280
Okay they uh they claimed that RPGs weren't popular in the west but they didn't release

2897
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:56,000
a lot of them here until later.

2898
01:54:56,080 --> 01:55:02,800
Yeah and like you know mana is like it's kind of like an action RPG but you know it's not

2899
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:07,800
like Zelda and there's scary numbers in it so I assume we wouldn't like it.

2900
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:11,840
Have you uh are you do you know do you know Secret of Evermore yeah I was actually going

2901
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:17,400
to bring that up because that's kind of that I was just I just saw it recommended underneath

2902
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:23,240
in the Google image search I just did and it just I I've never played Secret of Evermore

2903
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:29,120
I just reminded me that like I used to see it on like the blockbuster shelf and I thought

2904
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,960
the cover art was scary.

2905
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:37,160
Uh that game is weird because it's um I don't really know anything about it just I remember

2906
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:42,040
seeing it and being intrigued because it's square soft but also being like I'm unsettled

2907
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:50,600
by this creature uh correct me if I'm wrong chrono but I'm pretty sure this was made by

2908
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,840
a western studio.

2909
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:56,720
Yeah it was made by I think a square of America at the time.

2910
01:55:56,720 --> 01:56:00,520
It was American division.

2911
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:07,680
It was sort of like the it has like a contemporary setting sort of uh or you like time traveling

2912
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:11,600
stuff the the whole point of the game was that like we need something that American kids

2913
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:15,640
will like and that's yeah basically the the hook of the game.

2914
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:20,560
And actually a lot of people in the early 2000s anyway uh hated this game because they

2915
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:25,920
thought uh you know it wasn't made by the original Japanese square developers so it

2916
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:32,160
sucks but uh I don't I don't think it's that bad it's actually pretty alright.

2917
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:35,880
Seeing seeing the the cover art with this like blonde kid with what is he holding like

2918
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:42,440
a bone yeah like like for his dog a wrench or something yeah his first weapon is a bone

2919
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:49,600
that uh uses it's actually in that cover it's awesome actually I like this really captivating.

2920
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:57,560
Seeing that reminds me of uh of um Star Star tropics uh which was like they made they made

2921
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:02,040
that to be another like oh let's make a game that appeals to Americans yeah so we'll we'll

2922
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:06,480
set it we'll make the kid like an all-american football player and we'll name him like we'll

2923
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:12,400
name him like John Henry or something his name's uh uh Mike Jones the same yeah yeah

2924
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:19,840
Steve Smith is something yeah what is what is the name of the guy in this like the American

2925
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:25,800
version of Secret of Mana yeah I think I saw the name and I think I think I might have

2926
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:32,680
assumed that it was like a sequel or something to Secret of Mana uh those are my two favorite

2927
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:38,640
games on the SNES as a kid Secret of Mana and Mario RPG then you probably like uh Trouser

2928
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:43,520
of Mana because it plays it's like Secret yeah I think I would I think I would have

2929
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:51,760
loved Secret of Mana I can't I can't believe they didn't let me play it yeah it's it's

2930
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:55,960
frustrating there's a lot of cool games we didn't get ever I think like Front Mission

2931
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:01,600
Gun has it the real reason probably didn't bring it over is because it had a large script

2932
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:07,920
so it would have been really costly to translate and this was uh in 95 so uh it was towards

2933
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:13,000
the end of the Super Nintendo's lifespan yeah I'm sorry how much how much could how much

2934
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:18,800
could it cost how much could it cost to translate all the text in a SNES game well well believe

2935
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:25,440
it or not back then uh it was pretty difficult to translate text and games because uh I think

2936
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:30,840
the the western developers they didn't have the same two owns that uh the Japanese developers

2937
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:36,760
had to change the text it was kind of uh from a coding standpoint it was complicated yeah

2938
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:42,440
you couldn't just like you know find and replace Japanese text and paste in English script right

2939
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:46,440
like Tim Rogers talks about that in that Final Fantasy 7 video yeah they sometimes would have to

2940
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:52,360
hack the game's code in order to make it work with uh different font sizes and stuff he I've seen

2941
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:58,440
I've seen Let's Mosey yeah I know he talks about like having to I don't know he talks about like

2942
01:58:58,440 --> 01:59:03,320
having to do it through on like a spreadsheet he doesn't really talk about like the the technical

2943
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:10,120
aspects of it I guess it makes sense that you might have to do coding at some point you might

2944
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:15,720
have to actually go in and like fuck with it to make it display properly and and and etc I think

2945
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:22,440
also a Japanese text is more condensed than um English so whenever you translate anything the

2946
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:26,920
lines are longer and then they don't fit and then you have to figure out a way to make them fit

2947
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:33,160
which sometimes requires hacking the game's code yeah you need extra text boxes probably

2948
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:40,680
uh and so I mean I get I get that yeah back then like uh you can even see it on The Secret of

2949
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:46,840
Evermore uh case here they're like they don't say anything about the game they just call it a 24 meg

2950
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:52,360
action adventure just to say like oh it's it's the file size is big that means the game's good

2951
01:59:52,360 --> 02:00:00,040
like uh Secret of the Trials of Mana was probably like a really big game like a couple megabytes at

2952
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:06,040
least and you know like the more yeah it's it's like nothing now it's fucking don't even

2953
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:13,240
no please the thought four megabytes Jesus Christ that's like million that's millions of

2954
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:22,040
but like back then like the more the bigger your game was the the more it cost to make the cart

2955
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:28,040
so I assume they just saw like how huge that's actually that was and like that's one of the

2956
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:34,280
reasons why Japanese RPGs on the Super Nintendo are so expensive to buy now because they didn't

2957
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:39,080
manufacture many copies of them back then as as it was so expensive to make those cartridges

2958
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:44,600
they're pricier back then too yeah they were costly sometimes you would have to spend like

2959
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:52,920
80 or 90 dollars just to buy brand new I mean Nintendo game back then did well I mean um am I

2960
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:59,960
wrong do do all the uh SNES cartridges not all have the same chips in them uh some it depends

2961
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:04,680
there's a lot of uh Super Nintendo games now they have different chips some of them they have a

2962
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:11,960
specialized uh hardware chips like the Super FX chip which is it's like basically a graphics card

2963
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:18,680
or a GPU built into the cartridge that would enhance the Super Nintendo's uh graphical capabilities

2964
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:24,680
when attached yeah it's it's how you got stuff like star fox yeah that's how the Super Nintendo

2965
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:30,520
could do 3d polygons with star fox and then there's also uh you know the memory like uh

2966
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:37,080
this secret ever evermore was on a 24 meg cartridge when they say they mean megabit not

2967
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:43,320
megabyte by the way oh okay okay so three three megabyte game right here big deal

2968
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:52,760
yeah did um I mean we're like we're rpgs like more data intensive than other than like platformers

2969
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:58,280
yeah because they were bigger yeah worlds with more graphics to store and stuff I think um

2970
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:04,040
they could have just made a bigger platformer then and lazy it would have been nice I think the biggest

2971
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:12,680
Super Nintendo game is either Tales of Fantasia or Star Ocean it's one of those because uh because

2972
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:19,320
those games straight up have voice acting in them I never played either of those and uh I probably

2973
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:24,760
would have been stoked too but yeah yeah I think how do you put how do you put voice acting on a

2974
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:31,400
SNES cartridge all right well let me tell you why would you do that just the flex seems insane

2975
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:37,880
seems completely insane I think it really is Star Ocean had a special compression uh technology

2976
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:44,920
that allowed it to store more data into Super Nintendo cartridge it's called sd something

2977
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:52,680
yeah it's it's it's a add-on chip I think and uh a lot of like flashcards or whatever couldn't

2978
02:02:52,680 --> 02:03:00,200
replicate it for years yeah but I remember reading about either Tales of Fantasia or Star Ocean in

2979
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:07,160
Nintendo Power in the late 90s and um back then they kind of made it seem like those games were

2980
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:14,360
going to get released in the US eventually and then they didn't so I was um I was watching

2981
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:22,760
which I was watching some Kim Justice video about it was about RPGs in Europe but specifically

2982
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:30,120
about like a magazine there was like a particular European magazine that covered JRPGs and that like

2983
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:36,520
that sounds cool oh yeah let me try and find that video because it was pretty it was pretty good

2984
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:43,000
I think the magazine I read this stuff in was like game players or something and they changed

2985
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:50,520
their name later in the 90s to get to what uh they renamed themselves but there were a lot of

2986
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:59,720
really cool uh gaming magazines back then oh here we go here I found the exact video uh

2987
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:10,280
Kim Justice the story of JRPGs in the UK before Final Fantasy 7 Super Play magazine that is such

2988
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:16,600
like a niche topic yeah that's that's Kim. The UK had really bad luck even worse than the US when he

2989
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:26,520
came to RPGs because the the history the history of uh of uh of platformers on this on the ZX Spectrum

2990
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:33,240
I've only seen one Kim Justice video and it was I'm sorry to make fun of her voice

2991
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:38,840
it's just very funny but I like her videos a lot actually I like this great I like the one I saw it

2992
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:45,640
was on um Oasis's Be Here Now album so I thought she was I thought she was a music channel no I

2993
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:51,880
haven't seen that one but I'm curious because I've only heard her talk about video games

2994
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:57,960
I found her through her Peter Molyneux uh like like basically like the biography of Peter Molyneux

2995
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:04,440
which is I actually just rewatched that the other day it's good yeah uh yeah I'll have to I'll have

2996
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:09,880
to check this out yeah I think um I think the UK didn't even get Final Fantasy 6 or Chrono Trigger

2997
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:15,560
uh they did yeah they got some sort I think they were not officially released but I think

2998
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:21,640
there were there were like uh underground there were like indie venues that could potentially

2999
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:30,360
provide you with with with hacks of some some games uh uh they uh there was a scene I think they

3000
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:36,680
didn't get Chrono Trigger but uh they did get uh TerraNigma which is kind of that's uh that was

3001
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:43,640
unusual is a US didn't get that one yeah yeah I I really want to play that one I still haven't

3002
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:49,640
played it yeah I beat that one a couple years back and I also reviewed it it's uh quite good

3003
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:56,360
uh I've managed to remain unspoiled uh about the game I hear the story is really good so I'm

3004
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:04,520
uh curious to play it someday yeah it's um it's similar to Illusion of Gaia it's yeah it's made

3005
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:12,840
by the Act Razor and Illusion of Gaia Dev's Quintet okay uh oh yeah Act Razor is fucking awesome

3006
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:16,680
it's really good Act Razor is the one where you play as like the angel like you're recreating

3007
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:23,960
society or civilization yeah I've I like only learned about these games through like um uh

3008
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:31,080
speed uh uh what's the the speed convention there's speed running game game yeah games

3009
02:06:31,160 --> 02:06:35,640
don't quit okay I've seen people play them as games don't quit I'd never seen any of these before

3010
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:44,120
yeah I really like uh I really like Soul Blazer by Quintet I think that that's like a really uh

3011
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:52,440
competent action RPG from like the early SNES and I uh Illusion of Gaia I don't like as much

3012
02:06:53,240 --> 02:07:00,120
honestly yeah though it's it's a prettier game it feels a little less uh good to play I don't know

3013
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:05,240
something about it but I still haven't beaten it which is why I haven't played Terranigma yet

3014
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:11,480
well most people prefer uh most people prefer Illusion of Gaia to Soul Blazer but um I like

3015
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:17,160
both of them both uh pretty good I don't know something about Soul Blazer I like how simple it

3016
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:23,800
I guess it is compared to Gaia actually Soul Blazer has a gimmick in it that's pretty similar to

3017
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:29,720
something from Dark Cloud yes it is similar I I do like Dark Cloud a lot so that might be why I

3018
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:35,800
like it more it's like in Soul Blazer you you start out with an empty uh town that there's like

3019
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:42,760
nobody there and then you explore dungeons and as you kill monsters in dungeons the town gets

3020
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:49,560
repopulated yeah and buildings appear in the town as well and by the end of the game the town is

3021
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:56,440
huge and bustling so Dark Cloud had almost the same thing uh for some reason I don't know if the

3022
02:07:56,440 --> 02:08:02,680
two games are related Dark Cloud's also kind of similar to Actraiser too I would you know because

3023
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:10,200
you can build stuff as well now something about uh I really I'm really fascinated with Quinta

3024
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:15,800
as a developer because they made really weird games back then when a lot of people like were

3025
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:23,960
still figuring out like even like how a platformer works well these guys were making like sim action

3026
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:29,480
hybrid games and they just kind of dropped off the face of the earth after the 90s I always

3027
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:34,760
wanted to make a video like kind of like dissecting whatever happened to them but I don't really feel

3028
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:41,640
like I have the resources necessary to do that well I highly recommend uh you try Tere Nigma

3029
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:46,600
because it gets really interesting towards the end you know it's a very uh it seems like a

3030
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:52,920
really fascinating game I have this is a really funny story I bought a cart a Tere Nigma cart

3031
02:08:53,560 --> 02:09:00,360
uh a PAL version of it and I have like a I have a super NT so I can just play a PAL cartridges

3032
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:07,720
just fine I thought it was the English translation but it's the German I have a German cart of

3033
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:15,560
Tere Nigma so I turned the game on I'm like oh I haven't but that's fine you just have to

3034
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:25,160
learn German no big deal uh yeah but my my German is completely ruined is over I have

3035
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:34,840
not taken German since high school uh yeah man those guys were cool

3036
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:49,080
well you know what they say um 2d beats 3d any day of the week I was 2d 3d pd I was uh

3037
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:56,920
I was just looking at I I was gonna complain because I thought uh I started at Mega Man

3038
02:09:56,920 --> 02:10:02,280
04 and I saw some of the in-game graphic or some of the in-game cutscene images and I thought

3039
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:08,520
okay they don't this is not Toru Nakayama this is not drawn by Toru Nakayama they don't have

3040
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:16,440
the guy they lost the guy no but I'm looking at this article and I guess that's not true like

3041
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:25,000
Toru was still working on it he still drew like promo images and stuff for uh uh uh ZX and stuff

3042
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:31,080
but some of the some of the art in that some of the art is definitely not from his pen maybe he was

3043
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:35,560
like more of a backseat for this one more of a backseat more of a concept art he didn't do all of

3044
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:41,960
the in-game cutscenes probably got some some schlubs to do some of it Ben they were they were

3045
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:47,560
so caught off guard about the fan demand for a new Mega Man 0 they couldn't they were like oh we

3046
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:52,840
didn't tell Toru that he was gonna have to make a game that actually finished the story like we

3047
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:59,720
were just we didn't think it's really unexpected uh we didn't we didn't renew his contract oh god

3048
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:05,400
now we gotta give him benefits for another year of this bullshit oh we can't afford him

3049
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:10,120
let's just get an intern to like kind of trace just kind of copy his character designs for some of

3050
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:15,320
these uh for some of these uh in-game for some of these cutscenes uh you'll never notice

3051
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:28,120
um you know what i did yesterday you want to know this is not video games sorry i'm sorry

3052
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:36,680
i went sailing yesterday oh if you can believe it yeah i went on well i wasn't really sailing

3053
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:41,880
because there wasn't very much wind there was occasionally wind mostly the motor was on for

3054
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:48,440
a lot of it but i went on a boat my uh my dad and my brother went uh deep sea fishing yesterday

3055
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:55,000
so they were also on a boat deep sea fishing yeah they didn't catch much kind of a bust

3056
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:01,480
like of a trip how deep how deep are we talking uh they just go like a i guess a couple miles out

3057
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:07,080
from the from the coast to i'm like i'm like some schooner or something i don't know do they uh

3058
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:12,680
do they dive into the ocean and use spears or harpoons to catch their prey

3059
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:19,000
we got to go down in the mariana trench and find like get the like you know in um in uh uh

3060
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:26,120
in the harvest not harvest moon something valley stardew valley in stardew valley you

3061
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:31,880
catch the deep sea fish when you go down in the in the submarine or whatever and you catch like the

3062
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:36,920
weird uh lantern fish and stuff you gotta go you gotta go way down for the really deep fish

3063
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:42,440
that's what you want see i always know trade them for more for more for more money i always knew

3064
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:46,360
i was doing something wrong when i go fishing i don't have a submarine that's what i need

3065
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:57,640
a submarine yeah exactly you cut yeah uh uh yeah i don't know i just i went on a boat that's all

3066
02:12:57,640 --> 02:13:04,040
i'm sorry that's all i have to say i was on a boat how how would you get the boat uh my my dad

3067
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:09,720
and his friend co-own a small sailboat together and they love it it's like it's like my dad's

3068
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:15,480
a hobby basically that's cool him and his him and his buddy sail this boat it's their thing

3069
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:21,560
and i haven't been like christopher cross or something christopher cross yeah sailing

3070
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:28,280
yeah forget it never mind i'm not i'm not familiar someone someone in the comments maybe

3071
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:34,440
we'll get it forget it doesn't matter the uh i hope you had fun on the boat i had not been on the

3072
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:41,320
boat for i've got to be like 10 years now the last time i went to this i didn't go on the boat i

3073
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:45,640
didn't get on it but the last time i saw the boat actually it was a different boat because they

3074
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:51,560
they traded they like sold a different boat and they bought a replacement uh but uh the last

3075
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:59,080
time i saw the boat was like probably five or six years ago and it was to film nate's footage

3076
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:07,160
for a best anime ever one piece oh that that'll chest not great video by the way it was to record

3077
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:14,440
i i stood on the dock in a recorded footage of nate on the boat and uh still waiting for that video

3078
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:23,640
uh that's a pretty good use of uh of a boat if i ever saw one right that's production value

3079
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:29,000
that's production value right there um yeah it's like a it's like a jon tron video

3080
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:40,600
oh yeah it's exactly like that me uh me and uh michael from reps to go where we're sitting on

3081
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:48,120
footage of of something we recorded like a year ago now for basically use whenever we feel like

3082
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:56,040
using it i guess so it's maybe not exactly the same as you want to give a hint uh no i i think

3083
02:14:56,040 --> 02:15:02,280
i've already said too much all right it's just it's something we uh we met up at like last year

3084
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:09,720
we did some recording fair enough just as like uh well we're together we might as well do something

3085
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:16,440
for the channel i guess you know i yeah good point you know you know i binged reps to gog uh a while

3086
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:22,600
ago oh yeah i watched the whole catalog yeah excellent quite and it's quite enjoyable yeah

3087
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:30,040
i'm uh i'm hoping i think i think michael's just about the finish uh the kingdom hearts review

3088
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:36,840
that's been a millstone around his neck for a while now god that's like a game that i've heard of

3089
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:42,680
yeah it's i don't come to reps to gog for games that i've heard of uh me neither sometimes

3090
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:51,160
did the whole thing where you're trying to review every ps2 game ever yeah you review every ps2 game

3091
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:59,480
oh god it's a quite a massive undertaking it is how many games are is that i think there's a couple

3092
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:08,840
thousand okay and how many videos have you made like 20 hey gotta start somewhere yeah yeah the ps2

3093
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:14,200
has like more games and almost any console and a lot of the games are really long if you that's uh

3094
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:20,760
that's kind of why we we did it because yeah isn't it the funniest game to funniest console to review

3095
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:27,480
every game for the the the the sort of uh what do you call it sort of the unofficial uh the unofficial

3096
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:36,040
mascot of it is sisyphus pushing yes yes yeah that that was it was a very inspired choice there

3097
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:42,680
in my in the time uh i think last time i was on here i was saying i was gonna do an enter the

3098
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:48,600
matrix reps to god which came out i saw yeah yeah i was gonna say you did that one and uh i recently

3099
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:57,320
finished the digital devil saga 2 1 and i've been focusing on doing a uh a channel or a video

3100
02:16:57,320 --> 02:17:04,680
for my main channel it's kind of a big video so it's kind of just like very slowly chipping along

3101
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:11,160
at that just kind of like it it's one of those things where as i'm making it i'm like oh my god

3102
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:17,720
can i like actually do this or should i just like i'm still in like the i can still give up but i

3103
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:23,000
really don't want to i want to i want to get it done and that feeling yeah that's how i thought

3104
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:34,040
when i was doing the mario rpg video yeah it's uh it's a it's a commentary video i think that's

3105
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:40,120
the most i want to say about it like you know like the mathematosis commentary videos yeah those are

3106
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:48,040
like bar none my favorite videos on youtube and i like i love watching those and i always wanted

3107
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:54,760
a commentary video for game i'm making one on right now and since no one else is gonna do it

3108
02:17:54,760 --> 02:18:00,840
i will that's basically it that rules i'll watch it yeah unless it's a game unless it's a game that

3109
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:06,840
i really hate now you'll probably it's a pretty likable game the only problem i'm having right

3110
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:13,240
now is that like i'm worried that there's kind of been a bit of like a kickback or a pushback

3111
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:19,560
against like the whole like big video craze that's kind of been taken over youtube the past couple

3112
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:25,800
of years you think so uh i i you know i see it every now and then you know the only the only

3113
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:31,720
reason people push back against it is because they're popular and people like them i i think so too i

3114
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:38,440
i think so they get haters i think it's you know there's like some uh fair criticism there where

3115
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:43,720
it's just like oh it's a long video you're just you're repeating yourself you're it's just uh

3116
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:50,680
it you're just uh synopsizing what's what happens in the game or the show it really yeah there's

3117
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:56,520
some it really depends sometimes they can they they feel padded because they're repetitive and

3118
02:18:56,520 --> 02:19:01,640
sometimes it's just synopsis and those are two pitfalls that those kind of videos can fall into

3119
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:06,280
they don't they're not all like that yeah it's some some of them are for sure it's something

3120
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:13,000
i'm really trying to avoid when making my video uh it's pretty difficult to write a script at the

3121
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:21,320
same time it is for so many hours yeah i do think i do think that a video if a video is long enough

3122
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:28,520
it's okay for there to be a certain amount of repetition because it's certain certain concepts

3123
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:35,800
will bear repeating like when they become relevant in multiple different like times in the narration

3124
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:41,880
i don't so i i don't i don't i don't think repetition is is like is it is it is a mortal sin

3125
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:49,560
but some of yeah some some it's a it's a pitfall it's okay it's something i can see the criticism on

3126
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:57,400
but i also kind of it also sort of feels like you know these like big videos that people make on

3127
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:04,440
youtube are something that you could only see online or like on youtube like uh you're never

3128
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:11,960
gonna watch you're never gonna see someone talk about x thing for uh for like like four hours on

3129
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:17,640
like on like an actual produced television show just no you know it's sort of embracing like you're

3130
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:23,960
never gonna see uh uh somebody like cyber shall talk about uh the chow garden for like one or two

3131
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:31,240
hours in a video exactly exactly and that's something i think people should uh should embrace a little

3132
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:37,480
more when dunking on quentin reviews for his really long boring i carly videos or whatever i

3133
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:44,040
i think that i think that all the criticism of those videos is completely warranted and yet

3134
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:50,840
i like them yeah well you know sometimes like i just watched like a fucking six hour video about

3135
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:56,600
lost which is basically the bill the billiam one yes i'm halfway through the the new billiam lost

3136
02:20:56,600 --> 02:21:04,120
video it's this is my this is my genre i will defend the long video yeah format i think it's great

3137
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:08,520
i like that video a lot because it wasn't i mean it was sort of he was just sort of talking about

3138
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:14,840
the plot of the show and he did himself a bit a lot of that is synopsis something i did like about

3139
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:20,600
it is he also manages to talk about the pop culture about lost at the time which is something that

3140
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:26,680
people who binge watch it like what i did uh won't really know seeing that like hey they literally

3141
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:34,200
made magazines about what happens on this one show it's so weird or like all like the press

3142
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:41,400
junkets where it's just like uh so who's the hunkiest on the island i get i i mean i get that

3143
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:48,840
they're i get that a little bit just the just the sheer scale of it though yeah yeah it was huge

3144
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:59,480
and is is hillary hillary clinton like name dropping it so so funny yeah it uh in an alternate

3145
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:05,000
timeline that would have been the the pokemon go to the polls kind of yeah i think so form a community

3146
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:11,240
to to find out what's what the heck is going on in loss i don't know it in the the pop culture

3147
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:18,440
sections almost sort of justify the length of um yeah of the video because it's sort of it's

3148
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:27,480
inadvertently tells you that lost was this juggernaut that never that like had had so much of a

3149
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:34,760
following that uh yeah someone will watch a six hour video talking about it it it's interesting

3150
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:39,960
i like i like that video quite a bit yeah it's nice to have that uh cultural context

3151
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:47,400
because that's not something you're gonna get to be watch it now yeah reminds i mean um the other

3152
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:53,640
one that jumps to mind is the jenny nicholson uh vampire diaries video which kind of goes into

3153
02:22:53,640 --> 02:23:01,240
huh i haven't seen that one it's good i know about it and it it it does it does just it does

3154
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:06,680
describe the plot of the show it does summarize the show but it also talks kind of about like

3155
02:23:07,240 --> 02:23:14,360
production production uh uh things like what was going on with like the studio and the cast

3156
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:19,960
and crew and the deal with uh like the original author and the rights to the franchise and and

3157
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:28,360
all that stuff it's great yeah um but you always have to uh give like a promise of whatever it is

3158
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:35,480
you're talking about you have to always at least describe some of the plot yeah yeah there especially

3159
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:42,600
for our television show uh i'm just hoping to get this video done because i would i would like it to

3160
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:47,880
be like a big i haven't i haven't made a video since or on the main channel since october so

3161
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:54,760
i feel i feel like i kind of have to be like here's here's my grand return or whatever i would like

3162
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:59,560
i would like for it to be a nice statement you you and me are in kind of the same boat then

3163
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:05,080
because i have not put out a video in a long time well you're not primarily a video guy you

3164
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:09,560
you're still not really along with the comic i have yeah i have done some other stuff in the

3165
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:14,760
meantime but still you know this is kind of my yeah it's kind of like my return to youtube like hey

3166
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:19,960
guys i finally sorry i haven't made a video in a while yeah and and mine is also going to be

3167
02:24:19,960 --> 02:24:30,280
it's gonna be pretty large i think is the plan so so i hope i hope the video goes well yes and

3168
02:24:30,280 --> 02:24:37,320
you're not gonna tell me what it's about yeah uh maybe after the podcast i guess okay when do you

3169
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:44,600
i mean do you have a do you have a time frame in mind uh i i basically like i want it

3170
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:53,160
as soon as it's uh as soon as i finish the script like the script i'm uh i'd say i'm like a little

3171
02:24:53,160 --> 02:25:02,200
under a third done and uh you know obviously i prefer you and stuff but uh since it's a commentary

3172
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:10,040
video uh that the video editing part of it uh goes by significantly faster than um a regular video

3173
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:15,720
would all right just because you're just kind of talking over your gameplay footage right yes yes

3174
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:25,480
yeah yeah this video is gonna be uh scripted it is yes aren't you tectonic improv yeah ha ha

3175
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:31,560
very funny you know you know funnily enough you know you know actually i am a little surprised

3176
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:39,560
that like you'd fully script out like a commentary um because okay i've done i've done a few commentary

3177
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:47,800
videos before i did a cave story one and uh a one on super mario land and uh when i made my cave

3178
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:54,760
story video i think i made i was making videos like a year at that point and um basically i was trying

3179
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:59,160
i was basically like looking over at matthew matosa's homework and being just like okay well

3180
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:04,600
how does he do it and then just basically trying to copy him and i'm pretty sure that his demon

3181
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:10,920
souls and dark souls commentaries are not scripted yeah which it like you can tell because of how

3182
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:17,160
natural he sounds when he talks but like that is amazing to me is amazing that that man you know

3183
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:23,160
through like several takes obviously but like he was able to talk and talk and he just has he just

3184
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:31,320
has that much to say yeah it's really amazing and i tried to do something similar when i made

3185
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:37,960
my cave story commentary and i think i got five minutes into into the initial recording and

3186
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:43,240
just kind of like i stopped it and i was like this isn't gonna work and i i had i had the scripted out

3187
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:51,320
well you could okay i mean were you planning to like commentate over like the full unedited

3188
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:58,520
playthrough no no uh the for how big the game is it's definitely there's definitely going to be

3189
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:06,280
cuts like a lot of cuts but yeah the the idea is still i still want the idea to sort of be like

3190
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:12,920
this is a a playthrough of the game you were getting you were getting like the game and not

3191
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:19,800
yeah this this is a substitute for the original product this is not fair use yes yeah yeah i i

3192
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:29,400
intend to be uh taken down by nintendo yes for this for this video but like uh i'm looking at the the

3193
02:27:30,040 --> 02:27:36,760
on just like the raw footage right now and it's like well over 10 hours and like fuck that i mean

3194
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:41,320
couldn't couldn't get me to write write something like that for 10 hours and make it interesting

3195
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:47,080
oh so the video so the game is one that's over 10 hours uh putting that down in my

3196
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:52,440
on my little on my little checklist yeah just cross-reference how long to beat.com

3197
02:27:53,000 --> 02:28:03,160
every game that can be beaten under 10 hours but yeah it's uh it's a it's a game it's a video game

3198
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:08,680
it's honestly cool i can't imagine writing a script for anything that's several hours long

3199
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:16,680
you know that's uh must be real hard and um you know you know i i mean i was thinking about it

3200
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:23,160
it's actually i was surprised to realize that like an hour narration is only like 1500 words no no

3201
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:30,440
10 minutes sorry 10 minutes is 1500 words right or or uh something around that it depends on how

3202
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:37,960
fast you talk obviously so an hour long video then is only maybe like like it's like 9 000 words

3203
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:45,080
which i mean is it's a lot to write but uh i feel like on a if you're really feeling it and you

3204
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:52,840
really have a lot to say i feel like i could write 9 000 words in a day yeah uh like well my

3205
02:28:52,840 --> 02:29:02,360
cave story commentary was uh it was like a little under two hours i think yeah and it's 19 000 words

3206
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:08,120
yeah yeah that's like well that sounds about right novel it's well below novel length

3207
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:15,000
mm-hmm and i guess uh i just find it really hard because all my stuff usually is uh jokes one

3208
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:23,160
after the other yes so it's not easy to write uh like one hour worth of jokes of course well it

3209
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:29,000
helps that i don't try to i don't try to be funny in my videos most of the time it's it's i think it's

3210
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:36,920
easier to write uh more or at least for me i i find it easier to write more dry analytically than uh

3211
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:45,960
than to really have like a lot of uh humor or whatever put in because i mean you know i gotta

3212
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:52,520
think of a joke and like you know think of joke takes a lot of time gotta be clever my the video

3213
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:59,080
that i of that will not be named is it's it's not scripted it's not like scripted scripted i have

3214
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:05,960
notes i have many bullet points and i have any anytime i for a few for maybe a month or two now

3215
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:11,880
i have been every anytime i think of something funny that is relevant to the subject at hand

3216
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:16,680
i open up a little i have a little notepad and i just have like a list of jokes and i'm like okay

3217
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:22,040
i'll just i thought of a funny a funny joke i'll just write that or a funny thing to reference

3218
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:27,000
i'll put that in there in roughly the the period and i'll just when i'm recording i'll just okay

3219
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:31,400
make make sure to make sure to mention that make sure to not forget to actually this is uh this

3220
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:37,720
is how uh larry david does his uh does curb your enthusiasm he mentioned it in an interview

3221
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:45,240
yeah he walks around with a notepad in his pocket all day and every time he comes up with a joke he

3222
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:51,080
uh jots it down and then when he goes home he transports everything into a larger notepad

3223
02:30:51,160 --> 02:31:01,560
and then he turns that into an episode huh hmm hmm i'm a genius so this is uh how a lot of

3224
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:07,640
professional comedians do their uh come up with their comedy well i guess maybe that maybe that

3225
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:13,960
tells me that i've i'm not completely fucking it up yet because it's kind of hard just to sit down

3226
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:20,120
and just come up with jokes in that moment yeah no usually you come up with them uh

3227
02:31:20,840 --> 02:31:26,120
you know uh while you're going about your day every once in a while i have a little thought

3228
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:30,840
and i'm like oh that's funny i'll write that down and then i've let them i've let them build up

3229
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:38,760
for that's actually how i i do my videos as well i have a giant uh joke uh text file on my computer

3230
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:48,760
with like hundreds of funds and it's almost the rosetta stone it's almost like it's almost like

3231
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:55,480
creativity is like a is like an ongoing process damn it's all it's almost like yeah

3232
02:31:56,360 --> 02:32:02,680
hmm this is just learning learning so much about about life and about the artistic method

3233
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:07,720
this is just this is like old pcp when we talked about uh being content creators remember that

3234
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:17,240
remember that they're really really old pcp yeah the the early days pcphq guys any day now

3235
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:26,120
yeah we just have to move everybody to the same location yeah everyone was at virginia beach

3236
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:32,200
we're waiting for you chrono give it it changed every like five months ever here uh

3237
02:32:33,560 --> 02:32:40,760
you ever hear asperger's digi bro rap no no i haven't but it sounds uh sounds amazing

3238
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:50,520
it's um did you record it before or after uh the the beatings alleged beatings i should

3239
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:55,480
tell you let the alleged beatings give me a break there's no evidence there's no evidence on the

3240
02:32:55,480 --> 02:33:02,200
books i don't i don't i don't want i don't want to slander the man yeah uh uh uh he's a good boy

3241
02:33:02,200 --> 02:33:09,640
good boy you did nothing wrong uh the uh some might say there's no there's no this i'm i'm not

3242
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:14,440
trying not to get too serious but there is no there is no credible there are no credible yes

3243
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:20,280
yes yes um but anyway but anyway um in the in the digi bro rap i don't remember the whole thing

3244
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:26,120
off the top of my head but i do remember there's some bars in there about pcphq and how it's

3245
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:37,480
fucking stupid i guess uh he does have a point he he did have you know what he he you got a

3246
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:44,280
handed to him just like ices you got a handed to him uh what were we talking about before uh

3247
02:33:44,280 --> 02:33:50,680
before that um something about uh video game activity is uh i love video games and i love

3248
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:58,920
video games as well i would play them all day well i i actually hate them oh no i'll do you

3249
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:08,360
want better i hate everything so is that yeah that's uh isn't that a youtube channel i saw i saw a

3250
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:14,520
tweet the other day that was asking like what's a creator who's like lost their fame or lost their

3251
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:20,440
their uh their cloud or whatever you know lost their audience yeah and someone said i hate everything

3252
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:25,640
and like i don't i don't think i guess i haven't heard much about him in a while but like he's

3253
02:34:25,640 --> 02:34:31,960
got to still be big right yeah he he has um he has that podcast with uh yms and Ralph the

3254
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:38,680
movie maker and then like that other podcast with his friends jar media yeah i was thinking of jar

3255
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:46,440
media what's the one with with yms uh the sardonic cast yes yes yes so like he's still around and i

3256
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:54,680
think he's still i think i think he still has like a uh a a dedicated fan base he maybe but

3257
02:34:54,680 --> 02:35:02,520
does he not put out like regular ihe videos much anymore that's a good question i have not

3258
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:07,640
been subscribed i hate everything i just i was surprised to see that because i i never heard of

3259
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:14,120
any like downfall of that guy uh but only one that comes to mind it's not a lot of stupid answers

3260
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:20,280
to that question he doesn't upload a lot yeah he hasn't uploaded since or seven months ago it's the

3261
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:27,160
last time he uploaded so i guess he just focuses more on uh it's not as long as me so yeah yeah

3262
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:34,680
his focus is more on side stuff i think he's still you know he hasn't fallen off in like a in

3263
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:39,320
like a way i would use is that definition is like a big career i feel like i'm like a

3264
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:44,840
and what i was gonna say that was a jauntron way well jauntron still gets views his jauntron

3265
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:50,280
does still get his public perception i think has fallen in in certain crowds his public

3266
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:55,240
perception has fallen and i i mean i just don't think he's funny yeah i haven't in addition to

3267
02:35:55,240 --> 02:36:01,320
finding him personally repellent yes well he's i would say like he used to be but for some reason

3268
02:36:01,400 --> 02:36:06,920
he still gets a lot of views he does oh great great a under a does that guy even post anymore

3269
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:14,520
i think he does at least somewhat frequently hmm um haven't heard a peep about him in a long

3270
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:19,400
long time that's who that's who i think of when i think of like big creator who's fallen off you

3271
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:23,960
know it's not all like old-ass let's players like to buskis or something oh i mean i think the last

3272
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:29,320
thing i heard about great a under a was like that he had done some covid conspiracy yeah i think he

3273
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:37,160
was like an anti-vaxxer maybe i don't want to sound sounds believable yeah yeah yeah the only the only

3274
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:45,320
one i can think of is uh digipro well of course whatever i got replaced by somebody else whatever

3275
02:36:45,320 --> 02:36:50,760
happened to him you know what what where did yeah like what like what is yig studio and who is this

3276
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:56,680
and who is this weirdo and like the the halloween costume i saw i saw people commenting and

3277
02:36:56,680 --> 02:37:02,040
here discord about uh i hope giga released like a video talking about like a bunch of

3278
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:09,160
prominent uh anti-tubers and how uh like a history like a history of anti-tube yeah and

3279
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:15,960
i guess trixie is just like kind of footnoted which is pretty sad in the grand actually that's um

3280
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:23,320
that's kind of interesting how uh it trixie isn't mentioned into big anime sphere anymore

3281
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:29,880
you know what it makes sense to me because she was always like never like part of that

3282
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:36,360
she heard her brand was always being like i'm set i'm not like them i'm better than them and

3283
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:45,880
now she and she got what she wanted i guess yeah i i guess yeah uh don't like her no sir

3284
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:53,000
there you go no sir you guys thought you were safe huh you thought you weren't gonna get a

3285
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:59,720
trixie reference well guess what you did it took like two and a half hours is that a trixie reference

3286
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:07,160
is that is that a trixie reference oh bad stop talking about trixie oh my god i can't i can't

3287
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:23,000
i'm too angry my feelings were to her sad sad but true uh uh well hey i was gonna suggest

3288
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:28,120
that we could start a voicemail if you feel like it unless there's anything else you'd rather do

3289
02:38:28,120 --> 02:38:36,200
before that uh well actually there's one last thing i want to uh i want to show you okay it's uh

3290
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:44,280
it's not really much to say on it it's just uh this is a really funny song oh fuck yeah there's

3291
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:53,800
an n64 game called buck bumble where you play as a cyborg cyborg bumblebee with guns and stuff

3292
02:38:53,800 --> 02:39:00,120
yeah the song kicks ass and the most notable thing about this game is a title screen music

3293
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:09,320
uh buck to the buck oh it's pretty uh pretty interesting i recommend everybody listening

3294
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:16,120
to this to uh check that out i'm cringe i'm cringing i'm cringing i'm bumping my head

3295
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:22,760
yeah that's uh that's kind of the intended effect well i don't know if they intended it but uh

3296
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:31,080
that's the effect it provides i remember uh renting this game as a kid many years ago and i uh i went

3297
02:39:31,080 --> 02:39:36,680
back and i beat it recently and the only thing i can remember about it is this song uh i have so

3298
02:39:36,680 --> 02:39:43,240
it's not that good i have never heard of it ever uh well it's not it's not horrible but it's kind of

3299
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:49,720
like uh playing it's basic yeah you know there's not much to know about it it's like lover

3300
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:57,080
yeah but uh i completely forgot about this song until i played it again and it's uh

3301
02:39:57,960 --> 02:40:05,000
it's it kind of reminds me of like the dk rap from donkey kong 64 it's not as endearing as that but

3302
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:14,040
it's no i would no definitely not but it's still kind of weird and gringy it's hey hey

3303
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:19,080
why why did they make this yeah that that's exactly what i thought

3304
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:24,600
what i was thinking to myself as i listened to this this is like a 3d collectathon like platformer

3305
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:31,320
like an action platformer no it's like an aerial 3d shooter you fly around and you shoot at stuff

3306
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:37,960
hmm i think it's kind of like those uh star wars games uh on n64

3307
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:43,800
you shoot around uh you shoot shield generators to destroy stuff

3308
02:40:45,400 --> 02:40:50,760
it's uh basic like search and destroy kind of gameplay you know the game itself sucks but the

3309
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:57,560
song is i think worth listening to well i'm i i now i can never unhear it uh

3310
02:40:58,520 --> 02:41:06,280
uh who would you call this like it's like drasta so okay okay i know it's uh i don't know

3311
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:13,320
a jive jamaican guy singing for some reason i don't know why they they thought that was very

3312
02:41:13,320 --> 02:41:19,160
european yeah what what's what's them what's thematically yeah it's it's very a year a european

3313
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:27,080
trying to do jamaican drum and bass yeah it's really what what what's thematically relevant

3314
02:41:27,080 --> 02:41:32,520
about this song to the game is is my exactly what's what's well what's the motivation here

3315
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:40,440
his name is buck bumble and he bumped to the buck to the bump to the buck buck to the bum

3316
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:45,960
bumble so he like he he bumbles and he bucks his name's buck bumble

3317
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:53,080
yeah that explains everything so it's drum and bass i'm getting there yeah okay it is the 90s

3318
02:41:53,640 --> 02:42:02,040
it is the 90s we are in the 90s we are living in the yeek era and uh and buck bumble instead of

3319
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:06,920
yeah instead of uh gushing about like like uh final fantasy and legend of zelda in that game

3320
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:13,480
they should have been like super excited to play buck bumble on the n64 yeah why not you know

3321
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:18,680
with music like this um you know the the sad thing is the rest of the music at the game

3322
02:42:18,680 --> 02:42:23,000
isn't like this at all oh lamb the rest of the music is like generic

3323
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:29,800
that was weak would have been nice if the entire soundtrack was like this

3324
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:33,880
it would have it would have at least it would have at least

3325
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:44,760
been something to say about about buck bumble um yeah uh the the speaking of long videos you

3326
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:51,560
know who hasn't made a video in a while uh well i think everybody in this uh in this call

3327
02:42:51,560 --> 02:43:00,600
accounts long video long video man hasn't made a video in a while um you might get it i might get

3328
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:08,680
yeah i know you know this person i got thumb through my five billion subscribers

3329
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:13,480
bum to the bum to my bum to my bum yeah i gotta i gotta bum to the buck bumble gotta

3330
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:18,920
gotta buck my bumble real quick well it can't uh it can't be cybershell because he made a dreamcast

3331
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:25,320
video not that long ago i think no it is not cybershell and i did see that dreamcast video

3332
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:32,680
uh and i was uh entertained the sneaker has been uploading recently so i guess it's not him

3333
02:43:34,760 --> 02:43:41,800
yeah no uh although i haven't seen his newest uh output i don't normally watch his yakuza videos

3334
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:49,080
because i don't really i'm not in that space i don't play it's fine i don't play them but i

3335
02:43:49,080 --> 02:43:53,640
i did binge all of his yakuza videos at one point so i guess somewhere in my mind i'm like

3336
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:59,000
i'll watch another one if he makes more of yakuza videos but i haven't done it yet

3337
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:05,800
uh all right you give up yeah i give up it's tim rogers it's tim rogers actually

3338
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:14,120
yeah doh doi what'd he say he was uh what did cypes i was gonna say cybershell uh cyberpunk set

3339
02:44:14,120 --> 02:44:19,560
2077 came out review came out in like october last year hasn't been like a year it's been it's

3340
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:27,480
getting close to a year i i'm yeah well doesn't he take a while to do his videos he does sure

3341
02:44:27,480 --> 02:44:36,360
well sure and he also said he was gonna not uh overwork himself on the next one which this might

3342
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:42,760
be why would it take so long it's it's just funny that like the initial the initial action button

3343
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:49,720
uh model was one video a month and uh isn't isn't that cute isn't that what a card

3344
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:55,720
yeah yeah uh i mean he described yeah that's what he says he's gonna do in the final fantasy seven

3345
02:44:55,720 --> 02:45:02,920
review uh but then no uh then did he say the next one's earthbound right i think he suggested

3346
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:08,280
the next one would be earthbound for season two i think he said that he would do an earthbound video

3347
02:45:08,280 --> 02:45:14,440
but i think the next one i think he says in the cyberpunk video that the next the next next review

3348
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:22,920
is is uh it's some playstation game called like something my summer vacation oh some japanese

3349
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:29,800
yeah yeah uh yeah i don't know what that is i'm looking uh that seems like it could be cool i don't

3350
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:34,280
i've never played the game i'm really interested he said he was going to review final fantasy four

3351
02:45:34,280 --> 02:45:39,960
and i'm really i really want to see that one because i love final fantasy four did he say he

3352
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:48,360
was going to do six uh i don't think he said six hmm it's his favorite six would be pretty

3353
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:55,240
interesting i think yeah he wrote he wrote that i mean he i know he wrote that article at one time

3354
02:45:55,240 --> 02:46:00,680
about like uh the time about the time he bought final fantasy six i did find that and read that at

3355
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:08,680
some point i should i should read more of his uh his blog or like his website i haven't read that

3356
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:15,640
much of it i wasn't aware uh then he had a website with written articles yeah he does yeah i should

3357
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:21,320
probably him and some other people it's not he didn't write all of the reviews on there but yeah

3358
02:46:21,960 --> 02:46:27,800
i should probably check that out as someone who also did that for like you know 20 years

3359
02:46:28,520 --> 02:46:33,080
maybe i mean i i can't speak i can't speak to the quality of what's on there

3360
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:39,880
i read i read some of his uh i think it's like his top 100 games of all time and uh you know

3361
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:45,800
i obviously i read some of like the the higher the higher ones i think um i think he puts another

3362
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:52,040
world at number one which is uh another world's a great game and it's nice people talk about it

3363
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:59,960
but i've seen i've seen a lot of i use this phrase lovingly i've seen a lot of highfalutin

3364
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:06,760
critic types uh praising another world it's one of those years it is yeah i've never played it but

3365
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:12,920
in fact i never even knew about it like when i was younger i first heard about it super nintendo

3366
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:18,360
uh like platformer out of this world is what it was called in super nintendo yeah oh yeah it's

3367
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:25,160
is made by the um uh eric chahi the uh part of darkness guy right i i beat that one recently

3368
02:47:25,160 --> 02:47:34,360
it's uh pretty interesting it's uh well it famously inspired uh eco that's oh did it you know what

3369
02:47:34,360 --> 02:47:39,880
one of its claims to fame and i didn't know that but i it seems obvious now that you say it eco

3370
02:47:39,880 --> 02:47:46,360
convinced miyazaki to make games so eco is responsible for dark souls ergo and another world

3371
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:52,840
is responsible for dark souls i didn't know that i i'll i'll it's it's like it's one of those your

3372
02:47:52,840 --> 02:48:00,280
favorite game developers favorite games yes yes it's it's also it was also made by one guy so it

3373
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:05,240
has that like sort of auteur feeling to it it's a cool game you can beat it like an afternoon

3374
02:48:05,800 --> 02:48:09,800
i think i've seen him i think i've seen a matthew mitosis video about another world

3375
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:14,920
and i've definitely seen a lot of video about heart of darkness i don't know who

3376
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:20,440
matthew did one on heart of darkness i don't maybe that's on another world maybe but he

3377
02:48:20,440 --> 02:48:25,320
oh wait he mentions another world when he's talking about abes odyssey yeah that's that's

3378
02:48:25,320 --> 02:48:32,600
what i that's what i'm thinking of i did i oh sorry i did a uh i did like a short little video on a

3379
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:39,000
on another world in the g video so you maybe probably also thinking of that i might i might

3380
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:43,640
definitely be thinking of that are we now getting to the point that the new sorry i'm sorry that's

3381
02:48:44,120 --> 02:48:48,600
i'm trying to change the topic but you finish your thought before i go on it's it there's a

3382
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:53,800
lot of reviews out there of another world you know yeah i was just gonna ask are we now getting to

3383
02:48:53,800 --> 02:48:59,480
the point that uh the wait for the next action button has now been longer than the wait for

3384
02:49:00,120 --> 02:49:05,400
cyberpunk 2077 no are we are we pat how long was the wait for a cyberpunk review

3385
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:10,520
oh oh you mean the review i thought you meant the game itself because the game no like 2038

3386
02:49:11,080 --> 02:49:16,120
no no no uh oh that's you know it's a good point i think it was only like eight eight months i don't

3387
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:21,880
think it was a whole year yeah token between toky meky memorial and 20 cyberpunk toky meky came out

3388
02:49:21,880 --> 02:49:30,600
in january and cyberpunk came out i think in october uh yeah so it's close i can't do the

3389
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:38,680
math right now but uh i think i think oh yeah yeah yeah because it's august so oh yeah so so yeah

3390
02:49:38,680 --> 02:49:44,040
it would be to be 10 months i think the yeah i think it's the same i think we're the same yeah

3391
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:50,360
yeah yeah amazing it's uh that's not really that much time in the grand scheme of things uh i mean

3392
02:49:50,360 --> 02:49:56,520
after all yeah not really once didn't upload anything for like two years yeah but here's the

3393
02:49:56,520 --> 02:50:02,200
thing though i mean when the cyberpunk review came out it was like i mean how many combined

3394
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:09,000
hours is it like 12 hours it's like eight hours i think yeah seven reviews some of which

3395
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:13,480
encompass like an hour and a half some of which are like 20 minutes i had thought

3396
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:20,760
that the next one would not be that size i was under that impression as well and i don't think

3397
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:27,320
it'll be as big as the cyberpunk video but are eight you know he also could be uh he could be

3398
02:50:27,320 --> 02:50:34,920
like backlogging them you know so so they uh like he's recording footage for a bunch of different

3399
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:42,760
games uh maybe if we followed his patreon maybe he he's more specific about their reviews yeah

3400
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:49,240
used to do that i know he streams every friday for some reason it doesn't i don't feel like the

3401
02:50:49,240 --> 02:50:55,640
weight has been too excruciating for a new tim rogers video i guess because i was i mean i was

3402
02:50:55,640 --> 02:51:02,360
surprised to learn to realize how long it has been yeah no i don't disagree because it has been a while

3403
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:09,320
he just thought i i guess i'm just surprised i thought it would be sooner but uh what i mean

3404
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:16,600
you know whatever these things they uh they take time yeah uh i just uh i just and i'm not paid

3405
02:51:16,600 --> 02:51:23,480
and i'm not paying any money so i have no i can't complain god damn you yep i'm consuming the content

3406
02:51:23,480 --> 02:51:29,800
for free uh all right what do you think about a voicemail now all right let's go all right

3407
02:51:29,800 --> 02:51:36,040
let's go there's only like eight or nine i think um was it because they they all got sent to the

3408
02:51:36,040 --> 02:51:44,840
incinerator or people just weren't so talkative this week i i assume that uh yeah they stopped

3409
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:50,680
being able to send them because the inbox got full i will i will empty out the old voicemails

3410
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:56,440
from the inbox man what uh you're you're doing the voicemails in like what 2018

3411
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:03,080
is that when you started there's gotta be some old-ass voicemails in there i

3412
02:52:04,600 --> 02:52:12,040
i there must be yeah there must be oh no i almost i hate to do it i hate to go back and and delete

3413
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:18,680
well how am i gonna how am i gonna sort through 1.4 gigabytes and and not delete any of the good ones

3414
02:52:20,680 --> 02:52:30,760
i can't do it it's impossible it's impossible no i'm gonna i'm gonna have to just select all

3415
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:38,120
delete like half of them yeah well you know they're immortalized in the the the podcast

3416
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:44,840
episodes so you know they exist still you know what here's here's the the silver lining there

3417
02:52:44,840 --> 02:52:49,400
back in the day when nate was in charge of it so many of them didn't get listened to and they're

3418
02:52:49,960 --> 02:52:55,080
i'm sure there's so many hidden gems in there that will just be right in the trash and i'll never

3419
02:52:55,080 --> 02:53:01,720
know and i'll never have to mourn them because i will i'll never experience what i uh i sent a

3420
02:53:01,720 --> 02:53:07,320
i sent the voicemail once that uh nate decided wasn't good enough for the podcast i'm pretty sure

3421
02:53:07,320 --> 02:53:13,240
do you remember what it was about nate uh used to screen uh the voicemails yeah he did yeah

3422
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:16,760
good good old days remember that he would he would pick out like a handful of them

3423
02:53:17,080 --> 02:53:20,760
um back when we back when the pcp cared about quality

3424
02:53:20,760 --> 02:53:30,520
hmm right yeah that was a long time ago my voicemail it was uh i forget why it came up but i was

3425
02:53:30,520 --> 02:53:39,720
talking about uh i think tom tom tommy oliver for for all the viewers who forget who that is uh

3426
02:53:41,400 --> 02:53:46,520
was said on like a podcast that like heart gold and soul silver is just like better in every way

3427
02:53:46,520 --> 02:53:51,880
to gold and silver or just like gen two's the best gen and i i basically just i'm actually

3428
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:55,320
in a voicemail which you know fair enough that you don't play that because i think it was kind of

3429
02:53:55,320 --> 02:54:04,120
long okay okay uh i don't even remember what i said i think i i think i agree with them i think i

3430
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:10,920
kind of agree with them uh i if if i listened to the specific podcast again i could probably get

3431
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:19,480
the gears rolling again okay uh i won't i won't make you try it out yeah uh your old uh grievance

3432
02:54:20,840 --> 02:54:26,520
i think i basically just don't really like the level scaling and joto or the uh well well that's

3433
02:54:26,520 --> 02:54:31,400
not really that's not a problem that's a problem with both versions yeah it's something they could

3434
02:54:31,400 --> 02:54:36,440

3449
02:56:07,480 --> 02:56:12,920
i wiped to the evi girls but like i didn't want to draw that this is like uh this is like looking

3450
02:56:12,920 --> 02:56:19,080
up the wikipedia the wikipedia article to the biopic and finding out like oh wait a minute rudy

3451

didn't catch the winning touchdown what the fuck they just made that up for the movie no

3452
02:56:27,960 --> 02:56:35,720
what do you mean remember the titans isn't real uh the first voicemail is not a voicemail it's an

3453
02:56:35,720 --> 02:56:46,360
image i guess so here i'm gonna post the link uh for that um okay so i hear what i'm gathering from

3454
02:56:46,360 --> 02:56:53,320
this is that greenhouse gases are just going to go down see i don't know the the guy just posted

3455
02:56:53,320 --> 02:56:56,920
the image so i don't know what he's trying or what they are trying oh wait wait there there's a

3456
02:56:56,920 --> 02:57:03,800
caption here in parentheses it says they it says they did it so i guess this is i still i

3457
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:08,680
congratulating them on the reduction in greenhouse in us greenhouse gas emissions

3458
02:57:09,640 --> 02:57:17,960
i mean well it could also be ironic but i don't really know what i mean i know that this this

3459
02:57:17,960 --> 02:57:23,800
act this inflation reduction act just got passed by the house i don't know if that means i think it's

3460
02:57:23,800 --> 02:57:29,160
the last good that's senate doesn't it oh and it might just the trajectory down towards the

3461
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:37,400
paris target yeah good just better than nothing i know that uh midgar produces a lot of greenhouse

3462
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:44,120
gas emissions so we need to we need to do something about that city what uh here listen to the the

3463
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:51,800
avalanche conspiracy theorists uh look the lifestream is perfectly renewable energy it's fine

3464
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:58,040
we elected joe mansion because our mako reactors if we close down the mako reactors you know then

3465
02:57:58,040 --> 02:58:03,560
what about our jobs what about our jerbs we're gonna lose we're gonna lose all our all our all

3466
02:58:03,880 --> 02:58:11,880
industry to nibbleheim uh uh those the those god damn wutai soldiers they're gonna take all

3467
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:18,760
our jobs this communist wutai you know the wood the wood the wutai are manufacturing eco we gotta

3468
02:58:18,760 --> 02:58:23,880
stay we gotta stay even with them they're gonna overtake us if we don't uh if we don't keep if

3469
02:58:23,880 --> 02:58:27,960
we don't keep sucking up the like sucking up mako we gotta keep we gotta keep the mako make

3470
02:58:27,960 --> 02:58:37,240
the mako flowing i stand with president rufus president rufus has said that he president rufus

3471
02:58:37,240 --> 02:58:44,760
has said that you know uh we as americans we have to embrace diversity and we have to really formulate

3472
02:58:44,760 --> 02:58:51,720
a strategy to form a committee to make an inquiry into the possibility of future greenhouse future

3473
02:58:51,720 --> 02:59:01,480
lifestream uh uh ref refinement uh reductions with targets set as as early as 2075 so uh you

3474
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:08,360
know the leaders they they've got to handle don't worry about it it will be renew completely carbon

3475
02:59:08,360 --> 02:59:13,800
neutral by year you're never going to see like so like stop complaining we will be lifestream

3476
02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:18,520
neutral we will be we will be we will be putting as many uh dead people's souls back into the

3477
02:59:18,520 --> 02:59:25,240
lifestream as we are sucking up power but devouring them to create a materia

3478
02:59:25,240 --> 02:59:32,680
by the time it happens you'll be part of the lifestream exactly so so they say and that's a relief

3479
02:59:33,400 --> 02:59:38,840
and isn't that just a relief and that's a good thing you can you can peacefully go into the

3480
02:59:38,840 --> 02:59:47,080
lifestream knowing that you will uh your your contribution will offset will eventually offset

3481
02:59:47,080 --> 02:59:52,680
the amount that you used uh in your day-to-day life while you were alive before you yourself are

3482

3498
03:02:02,920 --> 03:02:10,840
other that because you're like black like what's going on there somebody asked that somebody asked

3499
03:02:10,840 --> 03:02:14,520
that one time he thought he thought yeah he thought that me and nate were black and that's what we

3500
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:19,480
called each other brothers it might have been a joke it might have been a joke but like how can you

3501
03:02:19,480 --> 03:02:26,520
tell that's a good joke if it was a good if it was a joke it was a very funny one um but anyway uh

3502
03:02:26,520 --> 03:02:34,120
uh not yet wink not yet wink that's my answer long distance it never works never works but maybe

3503
03:02:34,120 --> 03:02:39,560
but it but it might for us but it but it might for us you know they're always just they're always

3504
03:02:39,560 --> 03:02:47,000
just diluting themselves you see once once you get work for us once you get php uh pcp a hq

3505
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:55,240
going then it'll be possible then we can get then we can get married for the tax rate you know what

3506
03:02:55,240 --> 03:03:01,080
my dad asked me and this sucks i hate this but my dad asked me if i was gonna get married and i said

3507
03:03:01,080 --> 03:03:06,840
and i said i don't know and he said and then he pressed the question which i didn't like so i uh

3508
03:03:07,400 --> 03:03:12,920
so i responded with uh that i i that i would love to get fake married i would love to get

3509
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:19,160
fake married just for the tax write-off and then my mom was like there's not really a tax write-off

3510
03:03:19,160 --> 03:03:25,400
i was like what i guess there's not there's really not that much benefit to it the best

3511
03:03:25,400 --> 03:03:31,800
the best benefit the best financial benefit reason is that uh you and you and a spouse together

3512
03:03:32,440 --> 03:03:40,840
might uh qualify for like a lower tax bracket but um there's not i thought there was like a

3513
03:03:40,840 --> 03:03:46,120
bigger i thought there was like a bigger standard deduction that you get if you're married but no

3514
03:03:46,120 --> 03:03:52,440
it it's it's you get double the standard deduction that's because it's two people filing jointly so

3515
03:03:52,440 --> 03:04:00,280
like it it's equal so what a fucking ripoff well just uh just remember if you do get married

3516
03:04:00,280 --> 03:04:09,480
be sure to livestream uh uh well it's i would say i would say the real the real uh reason

3517
03:04:09,480 --> 03:04:14,840
for you and give to get married is so like you could get the the green card right i mean that's

3518
03:04:14,840 --> 03:04:21,160
the real that's the real prize not the tax just like just like my conspiracy theory that raw that

3519
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:28,200
the holly and ross's marriage was a green card a green card yes as far as i'm concerned it's it's

3520
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:36,120
true it's it's true to me and that's all that's all i need that the the did i ever explain that i

3521
03:04:36,120 --> 03:04:43,320
probably explain i i vaguely remember this uh because ross is canadian right australian australian

3522
03:04:43,320 --> 03:04:52,040
okay well you know it's the same thing yeah yeah right my my my my my completely spurious uh uh

3523
03:04:52,040 --> 03:04:58,600
claims just based on like uh i don't know just based on that the i think i think holly described

3524
03:04:58,600 --> 03:05:07,320
herself as asexual uh before well so i remember i mean i mean i guess i know i know i know asexual

3525
03:05:07,320 --> 03:05:13,240
people can have sex and be horny and be sluts and and well i don't even i don't even mean that i

3526
03:05:13,240 --> 03:05:20,680
just mean like you know you can marry someone and still like like them love them i i i i i

3527
03:05:20,680 --> 03:05:23,800
my claim is not even that they don't like each other in fact you would have to like someone a

3528
03:05:23,800 --> 03:05:29,000
lot to uh marry them just to get them a green card i suppose you would yeah it's kind of

3529
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:37,000
a commitment yeah exactly okay yeah sure you know what i don't know truly truly i am speculating

3530
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:41,880
on matters that i have no insight into whatsoever but that's the fun of it you know that's that's

3531
03:05:41,880 --> 03:05:54,120
the best kind um next one is oh it's a vocaru link uh from fuck best guy ever dot mp3 at voicemail

smash video i yeah i mean that's silly it's silly you should do that maybe it was uh too much

3572
03:10:36,600 --> 03:10:44,120
pressure because you know he's a kingdom hearts guy and he did those smash videos it makes too much

3573
03:10:44,120 --> 03:10:51,160
for him well he needs maybe he needs to take some personal fucking responsibility and uh and and

3574
03:10:51,240 --> 03:10:55,880
take up the mantle he needs to make that smash video before someone else does

3575
03:10:57,160 --> 03:11:03,160
now now it's timely before it's too late before it's really the clock is ticking sore has been out

3577
03:11:10,920 --> 03:11:16,920
20 years then it becomes nostalgic again so maybe that's playing the long game playing the long

3578
03:11:16,920 --> 03:11:23,640
game he won't make it now he'll make it 20 years from now uh uh when the audience has aged up and

3618
03:16:20,120 --> 03:16:29,880
what is this dragon i think they just he just gave tom a dragon i think i think he just wanted to

draw a dragon uh well this is the the sorceress that was lost i don't know i can't i can't i

3620
03:16:40,040 --> 03:16:45,640
can't think of it i was trying to think about tom references oh it's tom tom's jojo stand

3621
03:16:45,720 --> 03:16:51,640
spinal tap that's i saw i saw that that's clever that one's pretty good yeah

3622
03:16:53,000 --> 03:17:01,080
with each spine gained the user grows stronger and more mobile each spine adding to the arms of

3623
03:17:01,080 --> 03:17:05,320
the star and multiplying its strength by tenfold the limitation and release of this power is

3624
03:17:06,040 --> 03:17:18,040
is when the user steps on a crack so this has its own lore behind it this guy yeah he's he's

3625
03:17:18,040 --> 03:17:27,000
started uh he started doing uh jojo stands as well uh wait i'm just gonna post that i'm

3626
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:31,320
trying to post like the most zoomed out versions of all of these sorry some of the some of the

3627
03:17:31,320 --> 03:17:38,360
the ones that i'm posting are repeats and then most of the man most of these are about tom

3628
03:17:39,640 --> 03:17:43,160
and that's lame what about me it's the tom arc

3629
03:17:46,680 --> 03:17:50,600
tom gets a heart because his spine sure doesn't does that make sense

3630
03:17:50,680 --> 03:17:52,360

3644
03:19:34,280 --> 03:19:40,120
shot of the whole comic so that's inconvenient i'll have to post this like a pcp fan fiction

3645
03:19:41,160 --> 03:19:48,520
yes yeah it's becoming more and more common for some reason more and more of the voicemails are

3646
03:19:49,960 --> 03:19:54,040
i think this but this must be inspired by by new the comics about me and gib with the

3647
03:19:54,200 --> 03:20:08,120
sounds like a real pcp episode if only um okay uh delightful uh tom is strong and scary and that

3648
03:20:08,120 --> 03:20:16,760
is what we've learned today uh the next voicemail is another vocaru uh three two one go my hope is

3649
03:20:16,760 --> 03:20:21,480
that that you know that kind of frequent content thing like best ever will be the things people

3650
03:20:21,480 --> 03:20:28,440
are really hoping to see for me uh and then like the pcp the potty cast uh and of course

3651
03:20:28,440 --> 03:20:35,400
content being like the new place for the faster content the stuff that's about you know timely

3652
03:20:35,400 --> 03:20:40,680
releases that me and digi can whip up stuff about um i mean yeah you could probably find a gold

3653
03:20:40,680 --> 03:20:47,880
mine of uh of old pcp episodes where yeah things someone said did not exactly pan out as planned

3654
03:20:48,600 --> 03:20:55,160
plan oh wait a minute are you telling me are you telling me that these that these plant that

3655
03:20:55,160 --> 03:21:02,360
these well-laid plans gong agree what the fuck next you're gonna tell me that the best laid plans

3656
03:21:02,360 --> 03:21:09,400
of mice and men often go awry that doesn't know i wouldn't i wouldn't uh uh that's funny to hear

3657
03:21:10,200 --> 03:21:20,200
the um uh i mean content was frequent content was frequent when it happened

3658
03:21:21,880 --> 03:21:25,720
yeah i guess i don't really remember but yeah it was it was it was frequent ish

3659
03:21:26,760 --> 03:21:33,960
i can't it's hard hard to hard to really i would lay the blame on nat not for ending

3660
03:21:33,960 --> 03:21:42,680
content but for beginning it uh i would say it was the mistake there uh uh and then uh and then

3661
03:21:42,680 --> 03:21:51,800
you know everything else oh oh yeah potty cast dead uh law okay what was the other one he said uh

3662
03:21:53,240 --> 03:21:57,720
did he say bestie boy the side channel i don't know if anything's uh he said the pcp was uh

3663
03:21:57,720 --> 03:22:04,280
oh the pcp oh that's that's you know he's he's extricated himself i don't know i mean uh

3664
03:22:05,560 --> 03:22:11,640
listen i can't explain why people do the things they do i'll never know and neither will name

3665
03:22:14,280 --> 03:22:19,160
and he not he just he just refuses he will simply he will simply refuse to speak on the matter

3666
03:22:19,880 --> 03:22:26,840
uh you get it like a another job again recently no one knows you want to explain uh i don't i mean

3667
03:22:28,280 --> 03:22:33,480
to be honest i don't i don't really know like i don't really talk to him about it much he doesn't

3668
03:22:33,480 --> 03:22:39,400
like tell me things i don't know i i do kind of know what's going on with him but i feel like

3669
03:22:39,400 --> 03:22:47,960
he wouldn't appreciate me like divulging what he's up to and stuff i just uh it's nothing

3670
03:22:47,960 --> 03:22:52,280
remember he made a big i don't i don't really have it i don't really have anything like a

3671
03:22:52,280 --> 03:22:59,400
super interesting to say but uh just remember uh when he started doing a bunch of youtube videos

3672
03:22:59,400 --> 03:23:05,800
he made a big deal about how he quit his job to do youtube full time um yeah and then but then he

3673
03:23:05,800 --> 03:23:10,920
doesn't really upload that frequently anymore and then people people said he did less videos

3674
03:23:10,920 --> 03:23:16,760
after he went full time yeah so i just assumed that he got a job again later but uh i don't know

3675
03:23:16,760 --> 03:23:27,000
um i i don't feel like i should you don't have to confirm one way or the other about it

3676
03:23:27,720 --> 03:23:32,120
i mean honestly he doesn't really owe us i feel like and i feel like he would he would

3677
03:23:32,120 --> 03:23:35,720
he would tell people what he's up to if he wanted people to know what he's up to

3678
03:23:37,160 --> 03:23:44,280
yeah i um i respect that you know i kind of uh i don't divulge many details about myself

3679
03:23:44,760 --> 03:23:51,000
and and unlike and unlike stuff like the pcp uh like rad contenters unlike that like that's not

3680
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:57,640
that's his business so like whatever yeah i'll i'll leave it to him to talk about his life

gathered when i was catching up uh this this guy called in and he started doing a samurai

3708
03:27:20,360 --> 03:27:32,280
thing right yes uh i assume he has stopped doing that and um no uh well i think the i think ethan

3709
03:27:32,280 --> 03:27:39,320
ralph is the samurai reincarnated actually yeah but yeah i think this is technically a continuation

3710
03:27:39,320 --> 03:27:46,040
but from what i understood that the guy who did that one was not the same person who does the uh

3711
03:27:46,040 --> 03:27:53,320
the other samurai sama voicemails so it's sort of like a non-canon it yes continuation

3712
03:27:54,840 --> 03:28:00,600
yes that's correct but it seems like there's no samurai mentions at all in this one so maybe

3713
03:28:00,600 --> 03:28:08,840
this guy has spun it off into his own it's it's now just the adventures of the baby that and great

3714
03:28:08,840 --> 03:28:17,400
now a samurai and a baby wants to kill ben well which which uh which one aren't there two babies

3715
03:28:17,400 --> 03:28:24,520
and the baby might also be the samurai depending on what you consider canon to these voicemails

3716
03:28:24,520 --> 03:28:28,680
oh god can we get a lecture on this stuff it's kind of it's kind of open to interpretation

3717
03:28:28,680 --> 03:28:35,800
honestly honestly pcp voicemail lore lecture i like what a fucking like masturbatory lecture idea

3718
03:28:35,800 --> 03:28:42,680
i've heard i've heard stupider ideas uh i guess um wait a minute wait a minute

3719
03:28:44,120 --> 03:28:45,720
earlier in this episode

3720
03:28:48,440 --> 03:28:53,240
oh no i would know it'll not a lecture i just remembered i feel like i had a good idea for a

3721
03:28:53,240 --> 03:29:03,000
video and i remembered it was uh it was um wait was it phenotopia yeah yeah you what would i make

3722
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:06,920
a video about why did i think oh i should make a video about that like what would i what would i

3723
03:29:06,920 --> 03:29:15,320
say about uh the aesthetic of the game reminds you of megaman legends yeah i guess like games like

3724
03:29:15,320 --> 03:29:23,960
that maybe huh maybe maybe something maybe i was thinking like the history of the development

3725
03:29:23,960 --> 03:29:27,880
of it or something because like that guy's been vlogging not vlogging that guy's been

3726
03:29:27,880 --> 03:29:35,080
blogging his development for like 15 years really uh yeah uh shit i forget his name

3727
03:29:35,640 --> 03:29:42,040
i think he's like i think he's korean or something uh but uh whatever um

3728
03:29:44,200 --> 03:29:48,120
the uh no it's good legends is uh is a legend at this point

3729
03:29:51,240 --> 03:29:56,760
hey there we go there's there's a there's a chrono a chrono ism it's about 25 years old

3730
03:29:56,760 --> 03:30:03,160
now at this point megaman legends yeah i think so would it come out in like late 90s 97 yeah

3731
03:30:03,160 --> 03:30:10,360
yeah okay wait same year as something else my birth yes megaman x4

3732
03:30:12,280 --> 03:30:18,840
maybe 97 that's uh yeah someone would be x4 someone said that something else some other game

3733
03:30:18,840 --> 03:30:25,400
came out in 1997 earlier on this podcast final fantasy seven was it i thought that was 99

3734
03:30:26,200 --> 03:30:35,800
no that one 99 was eight yeah oh okay um i don't know whatever uh i'll listen back to this episode

3735
03:30:35,800 --> 03:30:41,800
and i'll recall everything that i forgot in the course of making it of course yeah actually listen

3736
03:30:41,800 --> 03:30:55,320
back to this stuff sometimes sometimes i do on it not never uh it's impressive is it

3737
03:30:57,080 --> 03:31:06,840
or is it sad uh i guess the listeners can decide that one that's right as as they will

3738
03:31:06,920 --> 03:31:13,960
as they want to do uh but i guess i guess i'm done uh i've i've talked about all the video games

3739
03:31:13,960 --> 03:31:23,720
that i have opinions about ever no more no more uh i'm done the voicemails so i mean uh i'll open

3740
03:31:23,720 --> 03:31:30,600
the floor back up to you guys if you've uh had want to share anything with the class

3741
03:31:32,840 --> 03:31:34,520
uh okay well

3742
03:31:36,920 --> 03:31:41,000
i don't obviously like i said earlier i don't have any videos coming out anytime soon

3743
03:31:42,280 --> 03:31:49,640
i imagine but uh so i will instead um you know check out reps2gog obviously but i also i want

3744
03:31:49,640 --> 03:31:56,200
to i'm just gonna show a completely unrelated channel so we review every playstation 2 game

3745
03:31:56,200 --> 03:32:04,040
oh god yes reps2gog rex reps2 dog should you should be able to find it pretty easily it's kind of

3746
03:32:04,040 --> 03:32:10,280
it's kind of the only thing quite like it yeah like when you search it but um i want to recommend

3747
03:32:10,280 --> 03:32:20,360
another channel i found just uh it's a small channel and it is basically reps2gog for playstation

3748
03:32:20,360 --> 03:32:25,960
and this guy it's a guy who commented on i think it was my digital devil saga review

3749
03:32:26,600 --> 03:32:31,080
basically it's like oh wow this is a really good video i just stumbled you know it's like i just saw

3750
03:32:31,080 --> 03:32:36,120
this is very similar to something i'm doing and i checked them out and uh he's actually really good

3751
03:32:36,920 --> 03:32:44,520
his name is blue bidya game and here you go blue bidya game this is the video first video of his

3752
03:32:44,520 --> 03:32:50,280
eye watched and uh yeah he seems he seems like a really cool guy i was talking to him a little

3753
03:32:50,920 --> 03:32:56,040

3756
03:33:09,080 --> 03:33:14,840
less than a year ago and i think he has about as many videos as we do how long have you been going

3757
03:33:15,720 --> 03:33:22,200
at least two couple couple years yeah okay i see i see i see playstation games are a little

3758
03:33:22,200 --> 03:33:28,760
bit shorter i think than ps2 games so maybe it's easier to get him out faster maybe yeah but there's
