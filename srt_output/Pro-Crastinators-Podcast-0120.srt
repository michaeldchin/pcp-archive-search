00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, it's a pleasure to have you.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is 120, isn't it?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is episode 120, that's correct.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Episode...

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We got all the power stars, everyone.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is that...

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh, right.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yoshi is confirmed for Smash.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, can we get Yoshi on the podcast?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yoshi!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There he is.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I checked his Twitter the other day, and he said some real racist shit.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't know if we want to get into that.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's true.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We got to keep his race realism to a minimum on this podcast.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm the best guy ever, and we're joined today by Yoshi.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wahoo!

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wahoo!

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's me, Yoshi.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
All right.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Also Munchy's here.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You know it.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's Yoshi's digits.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There he is.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Ben St.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You know, I remember, like a couple days ago, I thought of something really funny that I

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
would say for my intro on the next PCP.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's totally gone.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No one will ever hear it.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll never remember what it is.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So I'm just going to disappoint everyone.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's what you wrote it down.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Ben, it would have been so easy for you to just say that and not have actually come up with

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
any thought.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then just think to yourself, I'm going to just say that I have thought of something.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to say that I've thought of something on the podcast.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This whole thing can be a little just as bad.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't believe you.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Curious.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No one will ever know.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And also, it's also Mage.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I am forever suffering.

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hello.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Greetings, individuals.

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's another one of these that you've signed up for, signed away your soul in time for another

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
episode.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Here we go again, everybody.

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There it is.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Shout out.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I checked my podcast listing app, which I use to listen to other podcasts, Cast Box

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
on Android.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Shout out and free advertising.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Shout out if you're listening to this on Cast Box right now.

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We have two comments, one of which I don't even think is pertaining to the podcast.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I have no idea what it is.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here, I'll get it up right now.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The procrastinators.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We have something like 400 watches or something.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's absolutely better.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Just like us.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, no, no.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We only have 100.

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Wait, where is this?

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The two comments on...

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's on a podcast listening app, like one of the most popular podcast apps on Android.

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Basically, I have no Android listeners is what this means.

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
By Austin Baker, you guys want to wrap these up?

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh my God, what are the implications that the episodes need to be shorter or that this

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
whole thing we're doing just needs to stop now?

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's a wrap, though.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's a wrap.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh my God.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I love you, Austin.

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
All right.

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then by Xavier Jackson, I don't know what the fuck this means.

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The vague helicopter parent slash millennial pussy slash let kids fight and get bullied

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
narrative was lame, especially in the light of the common counter example she presented.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What the fuck is this guy on about?

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Maybe he commented on the wrong podcast.

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Lately, I get all these comments from people where they take whatever I've said and then

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
assume that because it sounds kind of like something some philosopher said, that I am

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
basing it off of that or whatever other thing they've heard of.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
For instance, in my video about Isiah from Doodadada that I posted the other day, I got

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
two different comments being like, oh, your Hobbesian social ideas are incorrect.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I was like, I don't even know who Hobbes is.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Maybe they're not saying you read Hobbes.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Maybe they're just comparing your ideas to those of Hobbes.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
One of the guys literally described me as trying to out Hobbes Hobbes.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was like, well, I haven't read.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I was like, what exactly is the problem in this video?

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He's like, well, it's clear that you just got all your ideas from Hobbes.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm like, I don't know who Hobbes is.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know how that's possible.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I only know Calvin.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I haven't gotten to Hobbes yet.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm very confused right now.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The weird thing about it is that a lot of the times, the things I'm saying might be

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Calvin and Hobbes.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They might be close to them.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
God damn it.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes, they are.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sorry.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They're named after Calvin and Hobbes.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
A lot of the times, the things I'm saying, they might sound tangentially similar to

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
what these guys are saying, but the part that I didn't say that they would have is the

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
most important part.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
People take the fact that you said something kind of similar, and then they just extrapolate

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that you also mean the rest.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's like, no, I don't mean the rest.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I mean the part that he said that was correct, and not the part he said that was incorrect.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So when this guy says like, helicopter parents, I don't think any of us would encourage helicopter

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
parenting.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I think that we might have said something that was kind of helicopter parents.

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Did anyone use that phrase?

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't know.

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think I've talked about stuff about that.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's the one where you're kids and over.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, it's when you turn into a helicopter.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Right.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's when people...

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, it's when Yoshi gets the helicopter power up.

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's when people are trying to disparage trans people, and they say, I identify as an attack

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
helicopter.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's helicopter parenting.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Right, right, right.

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But yeah, I'm sure that we probably said something that indicated we were okay with

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
something that could be construed as helicopter parenting.

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
As though thinking one thing that's fairly overreaching is okay, and then just extrapolating

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
oh, we all just think helicopter parenting is okay.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And it's like, no, we didn't go that far.

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We went a little far.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I mean, it's ridiculous to just extrapolate because one's philosophy has some connection

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
with a philosopher that you reach the exact same conclusions.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I mean, it's the Hitler family.

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's so easy.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's so easy to just hear things that people are...

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, that's true.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Right, so easy to just hear one sentence that could have started.

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's like some alt-right video, and just assume what someone is saying.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It just is some dog.

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I want to say, I want to say...

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have a relevant experience.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have a perception of forever color.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have a relevant experience, recent kind of.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Some people might have seen it on Twitter that I posted.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
A while ago, there was this video on YouTube, and they were doing an animation meme.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They were playing my animation meme in the corner, I'm guessing for reference or for

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
audio or whatever, and I left a comment.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Are they doing the same meme?

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Aren't they animating the same meme or something?

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, they're animating something themselves.

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Like, incompletely or something, Ryan?

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What?

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Never mind.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, just go on.

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Go on.

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What they were doing is fine.

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They were taking my idea for the animation meme and doing their own with the characters

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
they were presenting, and that's fine.

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's what animation memes do.

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The issue I had, the small issue I had, was that they were playing my video at the top,

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and it's not breaking into laws or rules or whatever, but they didn't credit me or anything,

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and I would have preferred if they had.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's just common courtesy.

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It is common courtesy.

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, and I left a comment saying, in polite terms, I said,

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
hey, maybe you should maybe not use other people's videos in the corners,

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
or if you're gonna do that, at least credit them.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And then, like, I also edited the comment later on,

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
because I saw a lot of people saying, oh, you copied, oh, you traced,

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and I was like, no, that person did not trace,

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and an animation meme is basically taking the same idea

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and just doing it with your own characters, kind of.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Did this person acquiesce?

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Did they put you in the description or anything?

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No.

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, really?

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, it's eight months later, at least, still haven't credit me.

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Eight months later, wow.

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
They're probably not going to do it.

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's just bad.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They probably don't give a shit.

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, the issue is not there.

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like, okay, whatever, things like that happen.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I politely, even in my comments, I said,

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
this person is not tracing me.

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They are not copying me.

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Please, to all the people that are saying that they are, they're not.

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This animation meme is fine.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The only issue I have is that, you know,

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
they could have at least credited me.

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's all.

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's the small issue I had with the video.

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Did they play other videos or just yours?

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No, it was just that animation meme,

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and they used the audio from the video they were playing of my video.

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So it was just, in that instance, it was just my video,

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but I have seen on their channel, they did it at least once

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
with some other video, I think.

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I haven't really researched them.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I mean, I guess this person just doesn't really care about the good crediting.

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The thing is, though, I got a lot of replies to that comment,

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
just like, how dare you bully this person

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and think that they're stealing you.

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why do you think, you know, they're not stealing from you,

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you're just bullying them, you're harassing them.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's just like...

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, is it because you're big?

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They're the one who took your video.

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is it because you have more subs, so it's like punching down?

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Probably.

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Probably, but the thing is, like, they didn't even read what I said.

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I specifically said to the people that were harassing the person

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
is like, this person is not stealing from me.

220
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just wanted them to credit my video since they used it in their video.

221
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And the people go on and think that I was...

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There was...

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I mean, I'm totally with you, Mage.

224
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There was an incident, I mean, a while back,

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
that everybody probably remembers.

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There was just an...

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I made my video about communist glasses not being orange, whatever.

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And, like, I used a picture of a cosplay girl who...

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah.

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
She, like, had very orange glasses for her coming to cosplay.

231
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I used the picture and said, like,

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
ah, this is bad, like, ah, you know, you suck.

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Like, something along those lines.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And she commented saying, like, hey, you have stolen my work

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and put it, and have used it.

236
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And, I mean, she was just very upset.

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't think she asked me to, like, take it down, but she was mad.

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm really glad you brought this up because that attitude pisses me off so much

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
when people say things like that about their fucking fan work.

240
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because I want to say to that woman, did you ask anyone

242
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
on the Girl in the Gone production team

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
if you could use their character and intellectual property

244
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
because they can sue you for that?

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I think that if this picture was, like,

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
if this picture was, like, paywalled or something,

247
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
then I think she's got a point.

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But if this was something that she, like, made and tweeted

249
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and, like, posted publicly, I don't think...

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If it was paywalled, then it's super illegal

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and she shouldn't be able to paywall her, like...

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But people do that.

253
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
People, like, cosplay.

254
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, yeah, it's like a Patreon cosplay or something, you know?

255
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I think that's all...

256
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I think I love that that economy exists,

257
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and I would defend the idea that it should be possible

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and companies should embrace it because it promotes their characters.

259
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Like, that's why they're not going around shutting all this stuff down,

260
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
but, like, all of it is technically, you know, they can.

261
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like, it used to happen at a lot of anime conventions.

262
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like, they could probably issue some kind of cease and desist

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
if they were so inclined.

264
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Like, in the artist alley, there used to be lots of stories

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
of, like, anime company representatives

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
just going around and being like,

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
hey, you're not allowed to sell art of our character

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and just shutting down stalls.

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Like, Disney famously does that.

270
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, I was thinking.

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was thinking.

272
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I was in Anime Expo recently.

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was just in the artist alley, and it hit me.

274
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is totally fucking illegal.

275
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like, you can't just sell pictures of Pokémon.

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Right.

277
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, okay.

278
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
When you say it's illegal, what it is is it would be a...

279
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think it's a civil issue where they may be doing something

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
that a company would have a claim to object to,

281
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
but until they object, it is not, like, really an issue,

282
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
or it's not quote-unquote illegal.

283
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think it is definitely...

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, I guess it's theft of intellectual property, right?

285
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I mean, I just don't think that's a great...

286
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't know.

287
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I sympathize with the companies that want to protect their brand image,

288
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
but, I mean, I think we're all better, obviously.

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It has someone who makes derivative quote-unquote artwork on the Internet,

290
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
but she sympathizes with desire.

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, when I was researching copyright for a few reasons,

292
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I did come across, like, it's not good.

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's not legal if you're sort of like,

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
let's say the company is making fleshy toys,

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and you start making fleshy toys of the same characters,

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and, you know, that's obviously very wrong.

297
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So, like, if you create competition with their intellectual property,

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
or whatever, something like that, so...

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The idea behind fair use is that it's only fair use

300
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
if it doesn't compete with the original product

301
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
or could not stand as a replacement of it.

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's always the defense I use with my videos,

303
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
because, like, I obviously use tons of footage from anime,

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
but it's like, this in no way is representative of the product,

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
because I've cut it into a bunch of random 10-second clips

306
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
that I'm talking over it, and it's like,

307
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you're not getting the experience of watching the show.

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So, like, if it was something that directly competed,

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and even then, I'm going to defend my stuff,

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
because I don't care if it actually is legal to do what I do.

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm just going to appeal to the logic of these companies,

312
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and, like, for instance, Sentai Filmworks got in contact with me.

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You guys can see that in this picture.

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I've posted it in the chat that has my DMs in it.

315
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But Sentai Filmworks took down my

316
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Astroscore Sucks Part 12A and 12B video,

317
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
which is where I was, like, defending Shivery of a Failed Night,

318
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
which is their show.

319
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's the one that they own.

320
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's the one that I was, like, you know, saying is better.

321
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And so I just basically went on Twitter and was like,

322
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
hey, everybody, this company took down my video.

323
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why don't you tell them how that makes you feel?

324
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And there was, like, dozens of people saying,

325
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
like, I only watched this show because of that video,

326
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
or, like, I bought this show from you because of this video.

327
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You need to bring it back.

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Right.

329
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And when enough of that happened, Sentai contacted me,

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and their response was to the effect of, like,

331
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
hey, we really appreciate that you promote our videos,

332
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
our content.

333
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We hope you keep doing it.

334
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Like, we'll get in contact with our Flagger team.

335
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Now, granted, they haven't actually gotten my videos back yet,

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
so this is not me praising Sentai Filmworks for doing the right thing.

337
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hopefully it's just bureaucracy that's loaded up at this point.

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, I hope so.

339
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But in any case, like, you know, it's not that I actually care

340
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
whether my video is fair use or not.

341
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I kind of approached it like, hey, guys, if you take down my video,

342
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
you're going to piss off your own fans.

343
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You're going to piss off the people who want to support you.

344
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So, like, you know, this is not in your best interest as a business

345
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
to take this action, even if it was legally correct.

346
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Here's a question.

347
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Here's a question.

348
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, we're talking about, talking about artist alley artists drawn like...

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wait a minute, before we finish that,

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I just want to put a cap on what I was saying about that girl,

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
which was simply that.

352
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
When she requested, I mean, she was mad that I used her video,

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
or that she used her picture, and just expressed disinterest.

354
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What I did was I credited her in the comments,

355
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
which I think was in the description,

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
which I think was a completely reasonable request,

357
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and I would do so of anyone.

358
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If you look at my videos these days,

359
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
you will see me crediting as much fan artist physically possible

360
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and asking anyone who wants credit to let me know,

361
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and I will add you, because I think that is the right thing to do.

362
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But I would never, ever take it down at someone's request.

363
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh, God, no.

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We're using this.

365
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I've had my fair share of people coming to me with the same request

366
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
of like, hey, can you put a credit for me in the description and stuff,

367
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and it's amazing how snooty them and their fans will get.

368
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
One time I used...

369
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I mean, they feel taken advantage of, so I sympathize.

370
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But one time I used this dude's...

371
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This dude did a heavy metal cover of a Kill Law Kill song,

372
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and I just showed a short clip of that video of him playing the song in my video,

373
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and he's like, hey, man, kind of a dick move to not give me credit or whatever,

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and then I added the credit to the description,

375
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
but in response to him or on his channel and stuff,

376
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
there was just tons of his fans being like,

377
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
oh, it's wrong to steal people's content,

378
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and I'm like, again, you did not ask the permission to make a Kill Law Kill theme cover.

379
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is a cover of a corporation's intellectual property, yeah.

380
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And no one ever complains that I've got all this footage from the anime in there,

381
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
which is equally like, you know, I'm not crediting Trigger.

382
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's punching down.

383
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't really believe in the whole punching down paradigm, though.

384
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I get it. I think it makes sense. I just think you should keep some perspective.

385
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I think you should punch anyone who's wrong.

386
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's my stance on punching.

387
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I don't like punching. It's a complicated thing, I guess.

388
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What were you saying? You were going on about some bullshit, as I recall.

389
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's right. I'm queuing up after Ben.

390
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sure.

391
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So you got some fan artists, the artist Allie, selling like a really nice painting of a really nice painting.

392
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Samus.

393
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
No, of a hit Montab.

394
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You got this absolutely scrumptious hit Montab, you know, just rendered in glorious-

395
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's even more sexual.

396
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The realistic light on this hit Montab is just unreal.

397
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's like you really had hit Montab too much.

398
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You can feel the hip hop beat emanating from the canvas.

399
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He just leaps off the page with his enthusiasm for battle and dancing.

400
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But anyway, here's my question.

401
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is that taking away from...

402
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you think that a person who is buying that work of art,

403
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
would they have otherwise purchased a work from Nintendo,

404
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
a piece like a hit Montab poster officially sold by Nintendo or something?

405
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They're going to think that this is a really weird monster that they're not going to even know what it is that they don't know what it is.

406
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No, no, no. That's not what I'm asking.

407
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm asking you, without the artist, without the fan artist, would they...

408
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Look at it.

409
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Did this artist take the sale away from Nintendo?

410
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Would that customer have gone to Nintendo to purchase an official hit Montab merchandise?

411
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're right, Ben. The answer is no.

412
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The answer to that is no, but you can think about it from another perspective as well,

413
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
which I'm sure is how the company thinks of it.

414
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's that this product would not exist, if not for Nintendo and the Pokémon company, whatever,

415
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
creating this intellectual property that you are now capitalizing on to make a sale.

416
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I could certainly see why they deserve perhaps at least a share of what's going on there.

417
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's not a matter of necessarily whether it competes with something they already have.

418
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's whether it could potentially compete with something they intend to create,

419
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and like the fucking Samus remake, remember?

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Or even more importantly, to all of us, and the Fighting is Magic video game, where...

421
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Of course, of course.

422
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
All of these...

423
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There's a great video about this by that dude...

424
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What's the name of the black guy from Two Best Friends Play?

425
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh, Wully.

426
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, Wully. He had made his own channel and his first video was about addressing this idea

427
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that the reason these games all get shut down is that these companies...

428
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If they don't shut down your game, it makes a precedent that they don't do that,

429
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and that they allow this, and it makes it legally harder for them to defend themselves later

430
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
if they did want to make a competing product with you,

431
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that they can't just shut down your game after having allowed it to exist, basically.

432
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I think also the reason why they shut down Pixelmon after years of not doing anything...

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
People speculate it, I'm not sure, but I think it's because they release later on Pokemon Quest,

434
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
which is like, you know, QB Pokemon sort of creatures,

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and aesthetically, it's similar-ish.

436
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I mean, I don't really see it, but people have been speculating that's why they shut it down,

437
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and I'm a little scared if that's the reason.

438
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah, like from a business perspective, it's a business, and actually it's a fiduciary responsibility.

439
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Fiduciary, yo!

440
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Fiduciary, that's right, that's right.

441
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It is their fiduciary responsibility, like if they have a publicly traded company,

442
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
to protect the earnings of their shareholders to do whatever it takes

443
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
to preserve profits now and any potential profits in the future.

444
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So it's... I mean, yeah.

445
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't speak too angry with them.

446
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I know the whole, down with the corporations, down with the big man, yada yada.

447
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But I can't be angry if they're just doing stuff to protect their intellectual property,

448
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
so if they have to do it...

449
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I think we all kind of just wish it didn't have to be that way, but, you know...

450
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But yeah, I wanted to say just a little bit, as a content creator,

451
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
as, you know, I used to do Fannert and stuff like that, as one of those people

452
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
whose art gets used on the internet.

453
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I would just like to say, like, the things like reposting my art, I don't approve of it.

454
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Like, if you let's say... I really hate Pinterest because of it.

455
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I despise Pinterest.

456
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's just, I hate when my art gets taken to a different site and then posted without my permission.

457
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
With Pinterest, I think most of it is credited.

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Some of them are credited wrong, and there's nothing I can do about it.

459
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But, um...

460
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, I hate my art being taken to a different site and then, like, just losing track of it, so to speak.

461
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
My fucking Galco video has been reposted to Tumblr many times and accrued millions of views,

462
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and that's a real shame for me, you know, financially and whatnot.

463
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Would have been nice if everyone just came to YouTube to watch it, and I earned the pittance of ad revenue that it gets.

464
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Could have just embedded on Tumblr, too.

465
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah.

466
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hey, Ben, going back to your...

467
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Hang on, Major's still finishing a point.

468
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, it's just like, but with, let's say, fan art for things...

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Hold on, now a last one point.

470
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
My art, yeah, okay.

471
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
When I do fan art for a character, like, for instance, Mothit, my very first Undertale fan art,

472
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
it's quite popular, and it was, I think, used in design, but the proceeds from that design were for charity or whatever.

473
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yes, Z.

474
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's pronounced Z.

475
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
In my head, I called it Zine, and it's a habit.

476
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I wouldn't mind so much, but you're not the only one.

477
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Shut the fuck up, it's not Zine.

478
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, it's Zine.

479
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It doesn't make any sense.

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Wait, Zine, did you make the Zine?

481
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Major, what's the, I don't know, what's this about a Zine?

482
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, it got featured in the Zine, I think, but I didn't get any money from it because it was for charity.

483
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's just to sort of emphasize how popular it got.

484
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like, they contacted me and they asked if they could use it because I didn't go to them, they came to me.

485
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's kind of flattering.

486
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Anywho, but like, yeah, it's quite popular, and several people have asked, go on and actually messaged me and asked me,

487
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
like, hey, could I use this as a picture for my musical cover on YouTube and stuff like that.

488
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And I'm like, fine, I'm more than happy to let people do that with fan art of characters if, you know, they ask.

489
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And they, like, it's not a repost, but they do their own thing with my art.

490
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So it's kind of like, what's the word, transformative in a way?

491
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah, sure, somewhat.

492
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You know, they're not just...

493
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's using it for our purpose, it's not just taking the artist's position.

494
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Well, what if my purpose is just to make money by reselling Major's art, like, on a poster?

495
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Like, that's my purpose.

496
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, then no.

497
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh, then no.

498
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah.

499
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
No, no.

500
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm here, I'm here to commodify Mage and the...

501
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
As he does with all women.

502
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
No, that's right.

503
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There's a difference.

504
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't objectify, commodify.

505
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, it's a way of saying that.

506
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But yeah, like, so I'm pretty...

507
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What a progressive that bit.

508
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Guys.

509
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But yeah, like, I'm perfectly fine with people, like, asking for...

510
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You know, if they ask for permission and they credit me and they use it in that sort of thing, that's fine.

511
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I've seen several people re-uploading the video, like, the sort of animatic thing of the dubbed, like, Papyrus, Sans, and Metaton, like, they go on a date or whatever.

512
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That video, it got, like, it was my most popular one for a while.

513
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

514
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And people have re-uploaded it.

515
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
However, they did credit it in me and they dubbed over with their own voice.

516
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So, I don't...

517
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Okay, there's something there.

518
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
There's something okay there, kind of.

519
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah, so, like, I don't mind it too much.

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm not too happy about it.

521
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I would have preferred if they had asked, I guess.

522
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I would have probably said, yeah, sure, okay.

523
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I think one of them did, and I did give them a get-go.

524
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So, yeah, those sort of things, fine.

525
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
When it's fanart as well, like, I can understand why you want to use it in that way, so long as you give credit to me and, you know, doing something trans-morbid, not just re-posting it.

526
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm usually fine with it.

527
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Fine with it.

528
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You know what?

529
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This makes me rethink a little bit my statement before about how, like, the whole punching up, punching down thing is irrelevant.

530
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Because, like, if you, for example, just took, like, any anime and did a fan-dub over it, like, I wouldn't blink twice.

531
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'd be like, this is fine.

532
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But if it was, like, one person's animation, like, on their YouTube, I'd be like...

533
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah, the funny thing is there's definitely a difference in kind.

534
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:24,000
There's obviously a difference in the way that we perceive those things because of how we perceive those companies and people, but I think that's wrong of us to do.

535
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You might be right.

536
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What I hate about the whole idea of punching up, punching down is that it stratifies, like, you're putting worth on people on the basis of their social clout, which is totally unfair.

537
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Because it's not as though someone having more attention means that they have more rights or a better life, you know?

538
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
To suggest that because someone's famous, they are now just open to criticism.

539
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's like, why would that person, how is them getting famous forfeiting their right to be treated the exact same way that you would be treated?

540
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Especially when fame is not a linear, like, thing that makes you just happier or, like, better.

541
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And I don't understand what the metric is that we are now allowed to make this person sign all the shit on, you know?

542
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think I know why people feel that way.

543
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And it's because of the perceived power that, like, famous people have, specifically, where, like, they have a...

544
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And this is a real thing of influence, of being able to shape the world to a degree.

545
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So you want to help me wrap up your point?

546
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I want to quickly wrap up my point.

547
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Kujoto, Arbok, Hitmontop, Pitmonly.

548
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, Ketchum.

549
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No, no, no, I'll be quick.

550
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Hitmontop's Gen 2, you stupid motherfucker.

551
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
He's not in the poker world.

552
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Hitmontop, please continue.

553
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'll be quicker.

554
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What I was talking about was mostly about, like, fan art and fan work and stuff like that.

555
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
When it comes to my OC as personal art, I am a lot more strict about people doing that.

556
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And I would probably not allow it, even with credits, because those are my creations.

557
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And I'm like, I'm a nobody on the internet.

558
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
If someone took it, if someone takes my fan art of a character and they'll go like,

559
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
oh, yeah, that's a character from that game.

560
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And, you know, they get pretty...

561
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Major, quick question.

562
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That makes sense to me, but here's my question.

563
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Why doesn't that same level of, like, protectiveness extend to something like a Sans or Papyrus

564
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
or just, like, any famous online character?

565
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Like, why doesn't it go to those guys?

566
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I suppose because, like, I don't own the characters, so I can't...

567
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So you just leave it up to whoever actually, like, owns them to worry about that stuff?

568
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
No, it's not like that. It's just like...

569
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I would understand that.

570
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's like...

571
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm more protective of my characters because my characters are mine and I love them and I would hate...

572
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It would devastate me, people taking them for their own.

573
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And, like, you can't...

574
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Like, when my art is used with my permission, it's usually, like, for a cover song,

575
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
for a cover for a song.

576
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's like a thumbnail for a video, something like that.

577
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
If they're, you know, they're talking about the topic and they're just using my image

578
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
to illustrate what they're talking about or what they're doing.

579
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's not taking those...

580
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
They're not taking my characters and claiming it as their own with my OCs.

581
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
No one knows what those OCs are, who those OCs are.

582
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Like, I think the only sort of exception is for when people would review specifically my OCs and my art,

583
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
stuff like that.

584
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's the only exception because that video is, you know, about me and my art rather than, like...

585
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But if someone takes my OCs and use them, like, I don't know, as a talk sprite,

586
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
or as a background image while they're talking about something irrelevant,

587
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
people start associating my art, my character.

588
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I would say that goes beyond, like, fan art at that point, where that's...

589
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, that is someone, like, that's using it in a way that competes with your content.

590
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Like, you're basically...

591
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah.

592
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That person is now altering the narrative of your character in a way.

593
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Like, I understand what you're concerned about is, like, this person is going to make your character

594
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
associated with something that has nothing to do with you,

595
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and now you've lost control of the narrative surrounding your character.

596
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

597
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah, and I think that even famous characters, like, I would say probably...

598
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Even Sans has been almost completely co-opted by the much more popular variant of Venom Sans.

599
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I was going to say that, like, that's definitely something that's happened with, like,

600
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
the Undertale characters where there was, for a while, like, everyone ascribing,

601
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
like, specific, like, you know, gender denominations and stuff to them that become...

602
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah, Crying Sans is a perfect example.

603
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Like, yeah, people have created this alternate version that has nothing to do with what Toby Fox presented,

604
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and, like, whether or not he's okay with that, like, he could have made a public statement or whatever,

605
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
but, like, the fact is that this character has gotten away from him culturally,

606
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and I don't even know if I think that's unfair.

607
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I appreciate why for someone like Mage, who, again, sees herself as an Internet nobody,

608
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
it's like, if you haven't even had the chance to tell the story you wanted to tell with these characters

609
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and other people are already telling an alternative story, then it's like, your story just never got told.

610
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And I do think that that sucks, and, like, I would argue that it's something that I wouldn't want people to do,

611
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
but I also don't know if I think that it's wrong, per se. You know what I mean?

612
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Like, if we're going to extend that to people who are Internet nobodies,

613
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I feel like that same respect should be paid to someone like Toby Fox, you know?

614
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Feelings-wise. In terms of my emotional reaction, there's definitely a spectrum there.

615
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
We're drawing a picture of Sans in a cool different outfit or something.

616
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That's one end of the spectrum, and then on the other end is taking Mage's character

617
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and using it as a talk spread for a completely other personality and some other work and not crediting them.

618
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There's a continuum between there, and definitely at some point it starts to feel wrong,

619
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
but I don't know exactly at what point does it go from a fan work to a transgression.

620
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
If Undertale had just sold Shiddly and nobody liked it, I feel like all our feelings would change on this matter.

621
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It also depends on how the person themselves feels, though, because for me, I might create a character

622
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
that I don't have any intentions with, and then if someone wants to use my character as a talk sprite,

623
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'd be like, hey, sounds like a way to market my character and potentially draw attention,

624
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
but I might contact this person and ask how I could work with them.

625
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Again, there's a million possibilities with all of it, and it really just comes down to just respecting people's emotions or not.

626
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,000
If Mage comes out and says, hey, don't use my characters, it's not that I think that there needs to be a legal precedent

627
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
or anything that she can defend them, it's just like if you respect Mage as a person,

628
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
don't do the things she doesn't want you to do, and if you don't care, then just expect her to hate you.

629
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
If you do that kind of thing without credit, then you're stealing, and that's definitely wrong.

630
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
If you do credit them, but you do something that the author does not want you to do,

631
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
even if you credit them, it's maybe not wrong in the way that stealing is wrong,

632
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
but it's like, I'm doing this without the permission of the author, the original creator does not want this.

633
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I guess in the perfect world, that would be a stain on your work that should make people not appreciate it and not like it,

634
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
but I'm sure that not every case does that happen.

635
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's not like a legal wrong, it's just a social wrong.

636
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's highly disrespectful that I think about it.

637
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You're taking this person's work, their hard work, their creation, and they're not speaking about me specifically,

638
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
now I'm thinking about something else, but you're taking their work, and you're using it, you like it enough,

639
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:09,000
you're using it for your own gain, but you don't respect the creator of the work you're using enough to go along with their wishes.

640
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I think a lot of it is really just laziness.

641
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It would be so easy.

642
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
We can't take someone to court for this, but we can job lynch mob them and slander their name on social media.

643
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Let me play the other side of the field for a second here, though, and try to explain why I think most of this happens,

644
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
because in cases like Crying Sands, the kind of people...

645
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Who is Crying Sands, though?

646
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I know there's so many Undertale versions, but I've never heard about Crying Sands.

647
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Crying Sands is just the general trend.

648
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Immediately after Undertale got big, people would tend to draw scenes of Sands getting really emotional and crying.

649
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Because the idea is essentially that because Sands has been through the most out of everybody,

650
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
that people depict him crying because it's reasonable to expect him to be a sad boy,

651
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
there's just nothing in the game that actually presents that angle.

652
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We don't see him crying.

653
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The temptation there is because he's such a together guy, and he's the most powerful and the most knowledgeable,

654
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
to depict him breaking down is like, this is the ultimate, this is the ultimate emotional whatever.

655
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
To talk about why I think people would draw that, it's because people are pathetic.

656
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
When you think about why would somebody...

657
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Especially artists, let me tell you.

658
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Why would somebody need Undertale in their lives?

659
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You need it because it gives you something.

660
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
As a human being, it enriches you in some way.

661
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And for some people who don't have the huge cavalcade of media,

662
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
all of us, we have a shitload of stuff that we like.

663
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
None of us is just into one thing.

664
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Even if we all did absolutely love Undertale, it's none of our only thing.

665
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And I can imagine somebody who gets into this game.

666
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm only into one thing, Digi.

667
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Keto, continue.

668
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Of course.

669
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I imagine that if somebody got into Undertale, and that was their whole world,

670
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and it was the only way they really understood how to express their innermost thoughts and feelings,

671
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh, shoot, I did draw crime scenes.

672
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That's exactly what kids are like.

673
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Kids use cartoons and shit.

674
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
These kids are playing Undertale, and they're going like,

675
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
How do I represent what this made me feel when I don't have my own characters?

676
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't have my own ideas.

677
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And it's free social cloud online because you're drawing this character that people already care about.

678
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
People care about your art automatically, whereas you could not build that by yourself.

679
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That is laziness, but I understand why if you're a kid and you don't understand

680
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that the people who made this stuff had to work so hard to create these things

681
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
to learn how to create good characters.

682
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Toby Fox obviously is not a newcomer.

683
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Even if it's his first game that made him popular,

684
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
this dude's been creating stories and music and art for a very long time.

685
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah, he had to mention he's been on the inside of the Homestuck,

686
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
so he's obviously been around down the street.

687
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Exactly.

688
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What's that made?

689
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I did draw sans crying, I linked it.

690
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
That's hilarious.

691
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I need that to enrich me as a person.

692
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
There's another reason why I just figured out why people want to repost this and share it.

693
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The first sentence is please do not repost slash use without permission.

694
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Well, let me tell you what my first thought is when I see that sentence.

695
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's what I'm thinking about doing right now.

696
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
There's always a question that comes up every once in a while,

697
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
you know, what Pokemon is the PCP?

698
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
What would the PCBs for Sona be?

699
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What sans would be?

700
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
What emotion sans is the PCP?

701
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You can call that one right now.

702
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Hitmontop is a pretty similar color scheme.

703
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm prepared to just say hitmontop is sans.

704
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Wait.

705
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
That was not the question.

706
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It wasn't though.

707
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
No, but valid answers.

708
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'll take one again.

709
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That's kind of relevant to what I was saying.

710
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
For a lot of kids who only have so many media points of reference,

711
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
they tend to constantly do that kind of comparison.

712
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Everyone in my group of friends corresponds to an undertale character.

713
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's like everyone in your group of friends

714
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
corresponds to a member of a group of friends

715
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
in literally any game or piece of media you could play.

716
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Which sex in the city girl are you?

717
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Exactly.

718
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Which golden girl are you?

719
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
That's all they've seen.

720
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm Rose.

721
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm the mom.

722
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm the mom.

723
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You are the mom.

724
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I used to do that with my friends when I was eight

725
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and we saw Rose on YouTube.

726
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
We all did it.

727
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
In the PCP, we used to do it all the time.

728
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Talk about which my little pony guys were we.

729
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But then we would just extrapolate that into every other show.

730
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I've made any show I watch.

731
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I could take the characters and say,

732
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
oh, that one's Nate.

733
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
That one's Kion we did it with.

734
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Oh, your Ritsu, your Rainbow Dash.

735
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No shit.

736
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Any sporty character is going to be Nate, you know.

737
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah.

738
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah.

739
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You said social cloud a minute ago.

740
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Sorry to take this, we can go back to what we were talking about before,

741
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
but I want to mention that I was thinking about this the other day.

742
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It makes me very upset.

743
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It makes me despair to think about why people like things.

744
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Because sometimes it feels to me in life that people,

745
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
especially on the internet and just like in public,

746
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
people like things as a public performative display of allegiance.

747
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
People like things and are vocal about liking things

748
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
in a way to ally themselves with this thing.

749
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
With certain YouTubers, right?

750
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Maybe someone wants to be like,

751
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
maybe people want to be like armored skeptic or what's that other guy?

752
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Sargon of a cottage or what's that, you know, these douchebags.

753
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And so, you know, they're going to make videos that are like them.

754
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
They're going to like them on Twitter.

755
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
They're going to retweet their shit and be a big fan of them

756
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and shout them out if they make their own videos.

757
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And that's true of like everything.

758
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I feel like people like Undertale or people, I don't know.

759
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Ben, this is also true of you.

760
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It is true of me.

761
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And the point is that there's no escaping this.

762
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
There's no escaping this.

763
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I would say this is the purpose of art.

764
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Like, I think that what it mostly is there to do is to...

765
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It feels impure.

766
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It feels like all love.

767
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
All love is impure love.

768
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Accurate.

769
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I think it's all of this art and all of the way we respond to it is

770
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
it's us reaching into ourselves and trying to figure out who we are.

771
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And then we see something that makes us say,

772
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
oh, that's what I am.

773
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Now I get it.

774
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Now I understand why I think this way.

775
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You know what this is?

776
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And then you just keep collecting those, you know?

777
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That is the micro opposite side of the coin against like widespread politics.

778
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Because politics is like the exact same thing only on the macro level.

779
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
We're like politicians.

780
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So like, I feel like when people are telling like, oh, politicians are evil.

781
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Like us doing this thing is like aligning ourselves with groups that don't like perfectly represent us.

782
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Like yes, the scale is different, but it is the same sort of problem.

783
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Right.

784
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Only like an individual level as opposed to politicians trying to align us in groups.

785
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I feel like maybe my example was weird there.

786
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Like, I don't know.

787
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Do you think that people like publicly perform their love of something like Undertale or Homestuck or whatever?

788
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Because like, I think there's like some, like you could do that because something speaks to you

789
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
and because you feel passionate about it and it means a lot to you.

790
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You could also maybe do it because it's cool and because you think it makes you look cool to like this thing.

791
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
That's definitely a part of it.

792
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Personally, as a person who has created fan art for things, I usually do it because I really like the characters.

793
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I usually draw characters.

794
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I like the characters and I just sort of like want to...

795
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
What do you mean by like though?

796
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Define like.

797
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Incidentally, I think we can all refer to ourselves as people who have made fan art of things.

798
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It's kind of like all of our...

799
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I mean like drawn fan art, I guess.

800
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
When I made that image, I drew it.

801
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I think we also have drawn fan art of things.

802
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
When I finished Lisa for the first time, I spent a couple days.

803
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I worked on this piece of Lisa fan art that was really, I'm pretty proud of it.

804
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Oh, that Lisa.

805
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

806
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And on the one hand, like I did it because like I love the game and I love the story and I love the character

807
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and I love the ending and I just wanted to depict the ending in like a cool way.

808
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I think I've said this before, but like when I do fan art of something, it's like I love this thing so much.

809
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I want to like participate in its glory a little bit, you know?

810
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

811
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I want to be a little part of this thing that I think is great.

812
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But also...

813
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I want to like...

814
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm sorry.

815
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
For me personally because...

816
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Wait, let me finish this point.

817
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
What do you mean by that?

818
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
God damn it.

819
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
But in addition to that, I also was very gratified to see that like that image is relatively high

820
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
if like you search Lisa images, like it turns up fairly easily in a Google search

821
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and it did really well on Twitter and I think the creator retweeted it and stuff.

822
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And like so I was like...

823
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
That's because you did such a good job of understanding it.

824
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Like me and Lisa, there's like a Lisa link.

825
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Hang on, wait.

826
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
There's like a Lisa link.

827
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
God damn it.

828
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Everyone live the fuck up.

829
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
There's like a thing between me and Lisa.

830
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Like I'm...

831
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And I was gratified.

832
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I was like, I think it's cool that I am associated...

833
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I want to be associated with this thing because this is the thing that I think is good.

834
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You know what I don't like about that?

835
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
All this stuff.

836
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I feel like...

837
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Doesn't it feel a little impure?

838
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Yes.

839
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Like, ah, look at this cool thing someone else made.

840
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Let me just hitch my wagon to this and ride it for a while.

841
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Here's why.

842
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
No, yeah.

843
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
That's my problem.

844
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,700
I really want to blow this all wide open here because first of all, let me ask you, what

845
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,000
is the purpose of language, of communication?

846
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It is to bridge the gap in discrepancies between the information we have, right?

847
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,760
Like I know a thing, I want you to know the same thing so I say it to you.

848
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,160
And we have the English language, we have all these different spoken languages that

849
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,440
are good for that.

850
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:14,560
But sometimes the idea is so complex that even if you understand it, you have no idea

851
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,960
how to communicate it except in reference to someone else who has already communicated

852
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,960
it.

853
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,640
So, like, Ben resonates with Lisa super strongly because it says something that he agrees

854
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,240
with very strongly.

855
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,200
And maybe there's not a way for him to easily or concisely explain that in words, but Ben

856
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,000
is capable of drawing pictures that perfectly capture what he likes about Lisa.

857
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,720
Like what about this game says the same thing that he's thinking?

858
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,000
If nothing else, it probably highlights the moment that Ben most strongly resonated with,

859
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,480
which in itself is like a distinct form of like a pinpointing.

860
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,160
It's focusing in on this one thing.

861
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,920
So when Ben posts that and when there's two layers to it, like he just said, there's

862
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,960
the layer of like, I wanted to show my appreciation for this thing that communicates something

863
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,200
that I agree with and want to also say, like, and I'm saying it in my own way with a little

864
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
twist.

865
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,320
I'm making my version of the statement, but it's close enough to the original and it's

866
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,800
so it has so much of the same appeal as the original that the people who like it inevitably

867
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,280
will also like Ben's art.

868
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,840
And that's why it is so popular and that's why he also in turn feels good about feeling

869
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,800
like he best captured what was good about this game, you know, better than other artists

870
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,800
were capable of.

871
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,880
Would you agree with that, Ben, as my analysis of your fan art?

872
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,520
Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.

873
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,560
I get little tingle.

874
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,040
When I think about that picture, it makes me think about the ending of Lisa and I just

875
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,120
get, I get, I get a weird like tingly, I get a weird like breathless sensation just because

876
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,040
I love it so much.

877
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:49,040
I wanted to say something before Lisa, like with me with me personally, it's like a part

878
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,040
of me is like, okay, so I really like this thing, right?

879
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,880
And I want to sort of participate in the thing that I like.

880
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:01,960
So I sort of like create the art for it, just like to express myself, express my like love

881
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,360
for it and sort of practice.

882
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
Major, I'm sorry.

883
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,600
Can I interrupt real quick?

884
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,640
Because the PCP just got a one-darl patron from Past Analysis, baby.

885
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,640
Hey!

886
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,640
Welcome, buddy.

887
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
Hey, Past Analysis.

888
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
What's up?

889
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,640
Hey, see you at BronyCon, dude.

890
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
Yeah, BronyCon.

891
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
BronyCon 2019.

892
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:25,160
Oh, oh, oh, can we please, can we please grandfather in Past Analysis be a CMC member of the PCP?

893
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Can we, can we?

894
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Can we upgrade?

895
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
Can we upgrade?

896
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,160
Okay, I wasn't here last week.

897
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,120
What about that we are going to BronyCon 2019?

898
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,120
Briefly, I think.

899
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,120
Supposedly some of you are.

900
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Yeah, and we are.

901
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,960
We see a Briterite that's not a joke, that is not a joke, everyone.

902
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,320
We're not like doing that, you know, to make you laugh, Brony.

903
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,320
No.

904
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,320
No.

905
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,320
We are actually going to BronyCon.

906
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,320
Well, it is, it is pretty, it is really fucking funny.

907
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,320
But we are.

908
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,320
Okay, okay, sure.

909
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,320
But I'm doing it for real.

910
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
But I'm doing it for real.

911
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
That's a sigh.

912
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
All right, that sounds good.

913
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
But I totally interrupted Mage.

914
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
I'm sorry.

915
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
I'm going to mourn.

916
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
Please continue.

917
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
And now I forget.

918
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Oh, I'm so sorry.

919
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
It was just really fucking funny.

920
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
No, it's okay.

921
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
It's okay.

922
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,760
But yeah, if Pest is reading it, hi Pest, I haven't heard your name in years, probably

923
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
literally years.

924
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
I heard that name in years.

925
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Exactly.

926
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,320
Why can't we get patron from Dr. Wolf?

927
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
Soon.

928
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,320
Why, why, why are we so below Dr. Wolf?

929
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,320
Oh, no.

930
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
Oh, no.

931
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,000
Pest analysis is actually cool and I want a patron from him.

932
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,560
If Dr. Wolf patroned us, I'd be like, what's happening?

933
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,560
Is this subterfuge?

934
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,600
Like, I've been talking shit about this guy for years.

935
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,640
He hasn't even done anything new to me.

936
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,160
I mean, he probably doesn't even know.

937
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
I mean, you know, I don't know.

938
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,160
Different world.

939
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,440
I don't think it's possible to talk shit about somebody online and then not get sent

940
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
it.

941
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,440
Yeah, maybe.

942
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,640
Like, I guess every time someone even so much as mentions me on the internet, someone

943
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,920
sends it to me and I don't know why because I don't necessarily want all of it.

944
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,960
I do and it's people who are like other YouTubers and who I don't expect, like who I don't see

945
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,960
it coming from.

946
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,160
Like sometimes it'll be people who I've been like, for a recent example, there's a YouTuber

947
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:07,280
called Ocelot, O-S-C-I-L-L-O-T who like I collaborated with back in 2015 and like I thought his videos

948
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,280
were super cool.

949
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,480
It was one of the few like anime analysis channels I was kind of excited about.

950
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,920
But he kind of disappeared to go become an editor for another guy who I don't care about.

951
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,760
And like recently, like, he was just talking shit about me like really aggressively on

952
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,480
Twitter and like not tagging me or anything.

953
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,840
Was that person MatPat and did he commit suicide?

954
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
Oh, jeez.

955
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,840
Well, first of all, MatPat didn't commit suicide.

956
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,840
First of all, it's not even the same, it's not the same guy.

957
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,680
Well, I'm just, because you said this guy became an editor, so I thought, oh, he's probably

958
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,680
the editor that got himself from, you know.

959
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,680
You just had to think about it.

960
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,320
No, where it was confusing is you said was this guy MatPat and I thought you were talking

961
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,320
about the person I was describing.

962
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,880
No, I meant the guy that he went to go edit for.

963
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,120
Yeah, I feel you.

964
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,160
I get it now.

965
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,280
And it is funny in retrospect.

966
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,400
By the way, I am mildly curious who he's working for.

967
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,560
It was Mr. AJ Cosplay, now known as the Cartoon Psych.

968
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
The guy who edits for.

969
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
No idea who that is.

970
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,040
He's a guy who does like a lot of videos about dub acting and shit.

971
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,040
I don't care about it.

972
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:17,360
But so this us like I was like talking shit about me and Zen Huxdable like just quote

973
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,880
tweeted him was like, yeah, you should probably tag at DigiBraw if you're going to talk shit

974
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,880
about him.

975
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,880
Sure.

976
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,800
Thank you, Zen, for telling me that like this guy who I've been telling people is like one

977
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,120
of the cool anime analysis channels for years is now just shitting on me for no apparent

978
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,360
reason all over Twitter.

979
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,080
So I do like when people send me stuff like that because I want to know like, you know,

980
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,880
before I go talking people up who are apparently hate me for no reason.

981
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,880
I understand.

982
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,880
What was he saying?

983
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,160
He was talking about some weird dream he had where he had to have like an analysis debate

984
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,160
with me.

985
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,560
The way he was describing it was like, yeah, I had to listen to his insufferable fucking

986
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,600
prick voice, arguably, or whatever, just like, I was like, what did I do to this guy?

987
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,840
I fucking paid him for a collab one time.

988
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,480
I paid him money last time we interacted.

989
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,480
What?

990
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:11,280
I love I love people that give me money like Cy, who paid me to design a t-shirt.

991
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,800
So I promoted his Kickstarter because I want to encourage people giving me money.

992
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,680
And I, for what it's worth, the last time I talked shit about Cy all the time and he

993
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,400
talked shit about me and we both give each other money in support.

994
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
So there you go.

995
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,400
Oh, God.

996
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,400
What a great relationship.

997
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,360
Can we please, can we please just back, can we please back up a moment and discuss what's

998
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,360
really important?

999
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,440
Because Ben, about your, about your example in the R.S.T.A.L.Y. about a hip-mon-top painting.

1000
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,440
Yeah.

1001
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,840
I fucking pray I want there to be a beautiful hip-mon-top painting because look at this

1002
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,880
change you want to see in the world.

1003
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,400
This hip-mon-top, hip-mon-top is one of the Pokemon that is banished from ever having

1004
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
any merchandise whatsoever.

1005
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,240
This is the official Pokemon store.

1006
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,280
And hip-mon-top, zero matches.

1007
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,560
They're not a single piece of plush figures and pen, training cards, clothing, home

1008
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,640
offices, video games, or all other categories.

1009
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,320
No beauty, no beautifully rendered oil paintings of hip-mon-top art galleries.

1010
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,680
I literally own a hip-mon-top plush.

1011
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,120
Like I can't see it from here because it's blocked.

1012
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,000
Why are they selling it then?

1013
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Why are they afraid to bring it back out?

1014
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
They must have made it.

1015
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Why are they silent hip-mon-top?

1016
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Like sold at some underground office.

1017
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
What are they hiding?

1018
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah, why are you silent hip-mon-top?

1019
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
First of all, it's Jones and now hip-mon-top.

1020
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
When does it end?

1021
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,160
All you guys are telling me right now is that I could sell this hip-mon-top on eBay for

1022
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,160
a lot of money.

1023
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,160
That's what I'm getting at.

1024
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,160
Yeah.

1025
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,160
The market is surging with demand for hip-mon-top right now.

1026
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,160
I need that hip-mon-top.

1027
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,160
Bad!

1028
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,160
Bad!

1029
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,160
Did you get it?

1030
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,160
Bad!

1031
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,160
Like everybody, everybody.

1032
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,160
I need it!

1033
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,200
If you're listening, invest in hip-mon-top now.

1034
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,200
The price of the sky rise.

1035
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
That's true.

1036
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,200
On the hip-mon-top plushie, does he have a tail?

1037
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,200
I don't have it on me, but I mean, it's an official plushie.

1038
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,200
I got it in like back when Gen 2 came out.

1039
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,200
But that's the question because like you see Munchie has been spamming us with hip-mon-top

1040
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
images.

1041
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,200
And like at the very first one, it looks like he has like either a third foot or a tail,

1042
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,200
but then the following ones.

1043
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,200
That's his penis mage.

1044
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
That is his penis.

1045
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,200
No, he's got a little.

1046
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,200
This bulbous.

1047
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
Yeah, he's got a little.

1048
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
Yeah, he's got two of them.

1049
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
You know what I'm saying?

1050
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,240
The one that I just got from the show, you can see his tail if you look very carefully

1051
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,240
at his.

1052
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,240
Oh, yeah.

1053
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,240
Yeah, okay.

1054
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,240
He's definitely supposed to have a tail, although it seems like it varies in length.

1055
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,240
Like sometimes it's just a tiny little nub and sometimes it's long.

1056
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
Maybe that's a gender difference.

1057
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
I'm curious.

1058
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,240
Maybe it extends.

1059
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,240
Because like, yeah, like look at the very first image.

1060
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,240
He has very long legs, but then the following images is very stumpy.

1061
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,280
It attracts it to help with his spinning.

1062
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,280
Yeah, like, like, yeah, like, yeah, that makes sense.

1063
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,280
Okay.

1064
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,280
Wait, wait, wait.

1065
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,280
This is so, yeah, in like the 3D, the 3D models, his tail is like incredibly short, but then

1066
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,280
in like the old sprites, it's relatively long.

1067
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,280
Like you can see like a connecting like, like strand or whatever.

1068
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,280
That's so weird.

1069
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,280
And I hate it.

1070
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,280
Do you guys remember the 3D?

1071
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,280
I hate the move to 3D.

1072
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:07,320
Do you guys remember the Hitmontop game in Pokemon Stadium 2, where you spin around

1073
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,320
as Hitmontops and they're like, Beyblade each other out of the arena?

1074
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
Beyblade?

1075
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
Dude, that's what it says.

1076
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
That sounds sick.

1077
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,320
Have you guys not played Pokemon Stadium?

1078
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,320
Listen, everything you guys say in Hitmontop is going in one ear and out the other, because

1079
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,320
all I know is that I need that.

1080
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,320
I need it bad, did you?

1081
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,320
I need that Hitmontop bad.

1082
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:31,360
Okay, so like one episode before the last one, I mentioned about a topic I wanted to

1083
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,360
talk about, and we were going to talk about that topic today, but like we started talking

1084
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,360
about other things and we're already an hour in, so I really want to talk about the topic

1085
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,360
right now.

1086
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,360
We're only 50 minutes in.

1087
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,360
I'm down.

1088
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,360
I'm down.

1089
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,360
I get it.

1090
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,360
There is no topic, first of all.

1091
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,360
Second of all, I want to talk about a very disappointing interaction that I had on Twitter,

1092
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,360
because I saw...

1093
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,360
Were you asking why for Hitmontop?

1094
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,400
Were you just connected to what we were just discussing, or are you just like listening

1095
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,400
to the fact that Mage wants to do a topic, and then being like, no, I want to do the

1096
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
topic?

1097
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,400
No, it's not connected to Hitmontop.

1098
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,400
It's connected to what we were talking about before Hitmontop.

1099
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,400
Okay, all right.

1100
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,400
Let's wrap it up.

1101
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,400
All right.

1102
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,400
What do you got?

1103
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,400
All right, so I saw...

1104
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,400
None other than Christine Weston Chandler was tweeting about how much she loved...

1105
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,400
God, what the fuck is her name?

1106
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
No, I love Kim Possible a lot.

1107
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Oh, okay.

1108
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
And I saw an opportunity, right?

1109
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,440
Of course.

1110
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
Sure.

1111
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,440
And I was like, wow, this lady, she's into my shit.

1112
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,440
So I tweeted at her, and I was like, do you like any other pony analysis channels?

1113
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1114
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,440
I saw this tweet.

1115
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,440
I'm a big fan of T-Bat, personally.

1116
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
And she responded.

1117
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,440
She said she did not say anything about T-Bat, but she responded that she liked Kim Possible

1118
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,440
a lot and Dr. Wolfe.

1119
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,440
And I want to say that...

1120
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,480
I think that it is very telling...

1121
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:59,480
I think it is very telling that Chris Chan does not appreciate T-Bat and loves Dr. Wolfe.

1122
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:04,480
So listen, she has allied herself with Dr. Wolfe by publicly professing her liking for

1123
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,480
it, but not with T-Bat.

1124
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,480
So T-Bat is pure.

1125
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,480
T-Bat is pure and good.

1126
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,480
Dr. Wolfe?

1127
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,480
Yeah, that's true.

1128
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,480
Or T-Bat just is just not the standards that Chris Chan demands, and you're saying that

1129
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,480
if you want to be...

1130
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
So it kind of sounds...

1131
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,480
If you like...

1132
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
If you appreciate what Dr. Wolfe does, you have...

1133
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,520
If you appreciate what Dr. Wolfe does, you have tastes comparable to Chris Chan.

1134
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,520
I just want to put that out there.

1135
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:27,520
I think it kind of seems like Chris Chan is just into people who are currently doing

1136
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,520
My Little Pony reviews.

1137
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,520
Like, surely if T-Bat came back...

1138
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,520
Oh my god, we've got to bring it back.

1139
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,520
...surely if you maxed her vibe with T-Bat, Chris Chan would have the opportunity.

1140
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,520
Oh, man.

1141
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,520
We've got to let Chris Chan know that the future's looking bright.

1142
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,520
Um, boy.

1143
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,520
All right, Mage, what did you want to talk about?

1144
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,560
It's not a super interesting topic or anything, but I really wanted to talk about it because

1145
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,560
it's one of my favorite topics.

1146
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,560
For like...

1147
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,560
Yes.

1148
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,560
It's one of my favorite topics.

1149
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,560
And I want to talk about dreams.

1150
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,560
Not like your goals or whatever, but like, you know, when you sleep and you have dreams

1151
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,560
and you're like listening...

1152
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,560
I'm not familiar with the concept.

1153
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,560
Please, yeah.

1154
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:08,560
When you close your eyes and you fall asleep and then you see images that are not real.

1155
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,560
Okay, images.

1156
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,560
What concept?

1157
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,560
I mean, those are what dreams are, yeah.

1158
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,600
I didn't launch into it, but I did have an amazing dream last night, but we can talk

1159
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,600
about that later.

1160
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:23,600
I had a dream that I was eating a hamburger and I realized it had a bun on it and it was

1161
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,600
made of bread and it had carbs in it.

1162
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
Oh, no.

1163
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,600
Let me tell you.

1164
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,600
No, let me tell you.

1165
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,600
I'm ashamed.

1166
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,600
Is this just what this is going to be?

1167
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,600
Is just dreams are cool?

1168
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,600
Well, let's find out if it's cool or not.

1169
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:39,600
I'm ashamed to admit that in the dream, I said, well, I already ate half of it.

1170
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,600
I might as well...

1171
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
No!

1172
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
That's the kind of man I am.

1173
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,640
I'm weak.

1174
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,640
I know the feeling very much.

1175
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,640
Oh, didn't we already do a PCP on dreams before?

1176
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,640
Yeah, that's the thing.

1177
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,640
I wasn't sure if we did.

1178
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,640
I asked Nate and he said no.

1179
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,640
Oh, if only there was a way to check me.

1180
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,640
If only there was an incredibly simple way.

1181
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,640
Look at the topics that we've covered up to this point.

1182
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,640
Yeah, I see.

1183
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,640
But what are we...

1184
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,640
That requires...

1185
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,640
That requires sleep and dreams.

1186
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,640
Well, I'm not sure if I was on that one.

1187
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,640
I probably was, but regardless, the thing is...

1188
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
Talk about it again.

1189
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,680
Yeah, the beauty about dreams is that you get them almost every night.

1190
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,680
And for me specifically, I get several nights.

1191
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,680
So, you know, it's a topic that will never die until I do.

1192
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,680
Will you want to share one with us?

1193
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,680
Yes.

1194
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,680
I actually, funny enough, because it got pushed back the topic,

1195
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,680
I managed to get this really cool dream a few days ago

1196
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,680
that I wouldn't have been able to share it like last episode.

1197
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,680
So lucky me.

1198
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,680
So it was like...

1199
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,680
Why?

1200
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
These things don't make sense.

1201
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,720
Don't nitpick it, because, I mean, it's a dream.

1202
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,720
Sure.

1203
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,720
But it was really cool, and I really hope I do a justice.

1204
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,720
Okay, so a little bit of memory did fade from me,

1205
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,720
so I don't remember where it starts.

1206
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,720
My dreams to have a tendency to shift from one dream to another.

1207
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,720
That's what dreams tend to be like.

1208
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,720
Yeah.

1209
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:02,720
Yeah, so this specific scenario starts with me being a military soldier,

1210
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,720
and I wasn't mage.

1211
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,720
I was this soldier guy.

1212
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,760
And we were in this building.

1213
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,760
It was kind of like a warehouse, but it was huge.

1214
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,760
Imagine the biggest hospital you've ever seen,

1215
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,760
and just that hospital being hollow in a warehouse.

1216
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,760
That's how big and wide.

1217
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,760
It's huge.

1218
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,760
There's no floors between the things.

1219
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,760
It's just very high, hollow.

1220
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,760
And within that warehouse,

1221
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,800
there was like a sort of like almost like a maze-like building,

1222
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,800
and we were taking cover in it.

1223
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,800
This is, by the way, in post-apocalyptic sort of scenario.

1224
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,800
I'm just imagining the Angels of Death anime.

1225
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,800
I have not seen it.

1226
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,800
You would absolutely...

1227
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,800
Well, first of all, have you played the game Angels of Death?

1228
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,800
Because it seems like you're like...

1229
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,800
It's like the most mage aesthetic thing I could possibly imagine.

1230
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,840
The anime especially looks like your artwork, practically.

1231
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,840
It's one of those indie horror games that RPG Maker horror games,

1232
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,840
but it's got an anime adaptation now.

1233
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,840
You should check it out.

1234
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1235
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,840
Was it actually like an indie RPG Maker game that got an anime?

1236
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,840
Yeah.

1237
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,840
Holy shit.

1238
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,840
It's like dope.

1239
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,840
That's how that works in Japan, isn't it?

1240
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,840
I mean, that's not...

1241
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,840
I mean, RPG Maker specific is...

1242
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,840
I mean, I'd imagine that's pretty rare.

1243
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,880
I made an RPG Maker VX.

1244
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,880
It is very popular, and that hasn't gotten an anime from what I've heard.

1245
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,880
I mean, like, Angels of Death is very Ibsque.

1246
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,880
I mean, it's possible that the creator of Ibsque didn't allow an anime to be made.

1247
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,880
Shout out to Master of the Wind, the actual best RPG Maker RPG ever made.

1248
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,880
I never played Master of the Wind.

1249
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,880
You used to talk about Master of the Wind all the time.

1250
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,880
And I had to make fan art that one time.

1251
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,880
I drew that fire guy, whose name I forget.

1252
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,920
Sometimes I think about...

1253
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,920
I did a couple Master of the Wind pieces because you liked it so much,

1254
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,920
and some of them were really bad, and I'm embarrassed about them.

1255
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,920
Well, there you go.

1256
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,920
But some of them were okay.

1257
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
All right, mate.

1258
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,920
Sorry.

1259
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,920
Yeah, but back to the gym.

1260
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,920
So I posted back to the faculty, it was exciting.

1261
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,920
And so it was me, another soldier, and three old people bunkering down in the maze.

1262
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,920
We were getting ready for a war, because we were going to get attacked by opposing forces of other humans.

1263
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,920
And the thing is, we were not going to win this.

1264
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,960
We knew that we were outmatched despite our mazes, despite our coverings,

1265
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,960
despite everything, all the firepower we had.

1266
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:32,960
We were not going to win this.

1267
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,960
We were going to die.

1268
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,960
All these people that were trying to save, all these people are hiding and covering or whatever.

1269
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,960
There's only a few soldiers and a lot of civilians,

1270
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,960
and we were not going to make it if this attack goes down.

1271
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:52,960
So somehow I managed to sell my soul in exchange of winning this war, or rather this battle.

1272
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
However, it had to be conditional.

1273
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I couldn't just snap my fingers and win.

1274
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I had to win it with the way this force tells me to win.

1275
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And if I don't do it, I lose my soul and I lose the war.

1276
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I lose out.

1277
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
However, I took the risk regardless.

1278
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And what I had to do, I had to sort of like quote unquote back step one on my own

1279
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and kill them in front of this specific guy from the opposing forces.

1280
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,040
And if that person dies, then the war is over, basically,

1281
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,040
and the truce is had, peace is had.

1282
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,040
So I did what I had to do.

1283
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,040
I killed the guy.

1284
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,040
No, no, wait, hold on.

1285
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,040
So the forces come in and they start shooting at us,

1286
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:42,040
and they even went on top of the, what do you call it, the scaffolding, I think, that's the thing.

1287
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,040
On top of the building, they uncovered the building.

1288
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,080
They were shooting us from top down.

1289
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,080
And I wasn't getting hit, but I killed several of them.

1290
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,080
I got a few headshots.

1291
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,080
That was cool.

1292
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,080
Wow, you're so good at this mate.

1293
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,080
It's incredible.

1294
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,080
Wow, I know, right?

1295
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:06,080
So the forces went in, and the reason I couldn't just immediately do it,

1296
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:11,080
is because I had to have a specific guy come in and walk into a certain position.

1297
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,080
So we had to take some damage.

1298
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,080
But once the guy was in,

1299
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,120
so I killed one of our own.

1300
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,120
And once the guy was dead,

1301
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,120
the big boss guy called off the forces and was like,

1302
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,120
okay, you know, whatever the truce.

1303
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,120
During the battle, though, one of the old guys

1304
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,120
that we were protecting,

1305
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,120
his heart stopped, I think,

1306
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,120
and they were trying to resuscitate.

1307
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,120
What's the word, resuscitate?

1308
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,120
Resuscitate, yeah.

1309
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,120
Yeah, they were trying to resuscitate.

1310
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,120
And I was like, okay, let me do it.

1311
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,160
But I'm going to try, because I have plot armor,

1312
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,160
and I'm the protagonist.

1313
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,160
I should be able to do this, right?

1314
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,160
So I went in there and I tried my best.

1315
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,160
All I could manage was give that guy one last breath to open his eyes,

1316
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,160
and that came out creepier.

1317
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,160
I was like, I can save the guy.

1318
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,160
And I was really sad.

1319
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
I was heart torn.

1320
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,160
Old people dying is the saddest thing to me.

1321
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,160
And so it was very...

1322
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,160
Even for a lot of sadness, I'm afraid.

1323
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,160
It was heartbreaking.

1324
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,200
But we had no time to mourn,

1325
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,200
because of the whole the ruckus.

1326
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
Ah, yes, the ruckus.

1327
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
Yeah, all the ruckus.

1328
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
The telltale ruckus.

1329
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,200
Because of all the noise we created through the wars.

1330
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,200
Like, the zombies were moving it,

1331
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,200
because, like I said, it's not class apocalyptic unless they're zombies.

1332
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,200
So the zombies were moving it,

1333
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,200
and we had to evacuate.

1334
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
But thankfully, zombies are slow,

1335
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,200
so we could evacuate in an orderly fashion.

1336
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,240
And we would...

1337
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,240
It was very easy to do.

1338
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,240
They were not a threat.

1339
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,240
Zombies are never a threat in my dreams,

1340
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,240
even though in all my apocalyptic dreams...

1341
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,240
How often are zombies in your dreams?

1342
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,240
Very often, actually.

1343
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:57,240
See, I finished watching The Walking Dead a while ago.

1344
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,240
So like ever since,

1345
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,240
and even a bit before that,

1346
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,240
like ever since and a bit before that,

1347
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,240
I get these apocalyptic dreams.

1348
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,280
They are varied in setting.

1349
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,280
Not all of them have zombies.

1350
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,280
Some of them do.

1351
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,280
Zombies are rarely a threat.

1352
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,280
They're just sort of in the background.

1353
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,280
So like, yeah, we were moving out,

1354
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,280
and then me, this other soldier guy,

1355
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,280
and this doctor lady,

1356
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,280
we had to sort of like separate from the group,

1357
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,280
because, you know, I kind of killed one of my own.

1358
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,280
And even though I did it to win the war,

1359
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,280
people wouldn't necessarily know that,

1360
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,280
so I kind of, you know, had to high tail it out of there.

1361
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,280
So we started to move,

1362
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,320
and this other lady that's starting following us,

1363
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,320
and she was from the opposing forces,

1364
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,320
and I know that she was able to manipulate water,

1365
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,320
like some sort of waterbender or whatever.

1366
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,320
And she was very dangerous,

1367
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,320
and the fact that she was tailing us,

1368
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,320
even though she was trying to play it cool,

1369
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,320
like she wasn't tailing us,

1370
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,320
oh, she's just traveling in the same direction,

1371
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,320
was kind of like sketchy.

1372
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,320
And then like,

1373
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,320
so we ducked into this like shady hotel sort of thing,

1374
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,320
where we met with another soldier

1375
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,320
that wasn't there.

1376
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,360
And he was on our side,

1377
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,360
but he wasn't there for the battle.

1378
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,360
And apparently,

1379
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,360
the person I killed,

1380
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,360
it was his best friend,

1381
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,360
and when he learned

1382
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,360
the best friend had died.

1383
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,360
Oh, talk about awkward.

1384
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,360
He didn't necessarily know that I killed him,

1385
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,360
but he learned that he had to die,

1386
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,360
like, and he decided,

1387
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,360
and because of a traitor,

1388
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,360
he decided to go find the traitor,

1389
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,360
and like, he also had some sort of powers as well,

1390
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
but if he had to,

1391
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,400
but if he didn't do it,

1392
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,400
it would undo my wish,

1393
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,400
and my soul would just go to waste,

1394
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,400
you know, because the world will start all over again,

1395
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,400
and I wouldn't be able to,

1396
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,400
you know, do it again,

1397
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,400
so I had to go after the guy

1398
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
to stop him

1399
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,400
from doing whatever he was going to do,

1400
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,400
and I remember like the last part of my dream was like,

1401
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,400
he was in this pod,

1402
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,400
and he was about to activate the pod

1403
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,400
to do something, like teleport or whatever,

1404
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
and like, I slammed open the door,

1405
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,440
I reached into the pod,

1406
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,440
I was like,

1407
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,440
the handout is like, you know,

1408
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,440
come with me, I'll show you the truth

1409
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,440
or something like that,

1410
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,440
and then the dream ended.

1411
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,440
Alright.

1412
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,440
I checked, we have not done a PCP on Dream,

1413
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,440
but we have done a PCP on Sleep,

1414
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,440
in which we explicitly say

1415
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,440
how much we did.

1416
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,440
I also did that same research.

1417
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,440
Well,

1418
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,480
I always like talking about dreams,

1419
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,480
and I'm, you find what's interesting.

1420
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,480
Have you heard this phrase,

1421
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,480
have you heard the expression

1422
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,480
that dreams are incredibly interesting

1423
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,480
only to the person telling the story

1424
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,480
of their dream?

1425
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,480
No, because I want to hear about other people's dreams,

1426
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,480
and I always find it fascinating.

1427
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,480
Well, sure, sure.

1428
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,480
Well, one time,

1429
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,480
I think I've probably told the story

1430
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,480
on the Sleep episode,

1431
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,480
but I haven't.

1432
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,520
If I could get,

1433
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,520
the story doesn't mean anything to me,

1434
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,520
but like, if it possibly,

1435
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,520
like, all my dreams have

1436
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,520
very clear meanings,

1437
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520
like, they're all shit, they're all nightmares,

1438
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,520
they all suck, and I hate them,

1439
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,520
but like, it's pretty easy

1440
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,520
for me to extrapolate what they're about,

1441
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,520
because almost all of them are-

1442
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,520
Oh wait, sorry, that was just real life,

1443
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,520
my mistake, I confused the two sometimes.

1444
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,520
All of my dreams are just about me

1445
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,520
being lost in a big place,

1446
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,560
with people and or trying to protect

1447
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,560
someone, so like,

1448
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,560
they're all like direct responses

1449
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,560
to things that are going on in my life

1450
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,560
or my general mind state,

1451
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,560
it's usually obvious,

1452
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,560
and they're all basically the same,

1453
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,560
they follow the same few templates,

1454
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,560
so like, it sounds like you have a lot of dreams

1455
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,560
where there's zombies and shit,

1456
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,560
but they're not a threat,

1457
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,560
so like, I don't know,

1458
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,560
do you think that this has anything to say

1459
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,560
about you personally?

1460
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,600
Not really, okay, I have two types of dreams,

1461
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,600
at least I categorize into two types of dreams,

1462
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,600
one dreams where I am mage,

1463
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,600
like, in real life self,

1464
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,600
and one where I'm not mage,

1465
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,600
which is basically what this dream was

1466
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,600
and a lot of my coolest, my awesomeest,

1467
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,600
my most badass dreams are when

1468
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,600
I'm not my real self,

1469
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,600
like, I could be like, quote unquote,

1470
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,600
the mage. Okay, see that sounds like

1471
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,600
it says something about you that maybe you

1472
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,600
think that the only way you could be awesome

1473
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,600
is by escaping

1474
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,640
and not thinking of yourself

1475
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,640
as yourself.

1476
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,640
But isn't the only way

1477
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,640
to detain if something's cool or not

1478
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,640
is if you haven't done it already,

1479
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,640
like, if you're just going to be yourself

1480
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,640
in any dream, do anything that you've normally done

1481
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,640
that's never going to be cool.

1482
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,640
Well, it depends on if you think yourself is cool.

1483
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,640
No, I love myself, that's no secret.

1484
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,640
Yeah, woo!

1485
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,640
So like, if you don't like yourself,

1486
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,640
then any time you would see yourself

1487
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,640
doing something awesome in a dream,

1488
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,680
like being you.

1489
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,680
It's like an experience of like

1490
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,680
playing a game or role-playing something

1491
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,680
like that, like experiencing an experience,

1492
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,680
you know, in a safe environment.

1493
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,680
And I like that.

1494
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,680
I like those dreams, they're very fun.

1495
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,680
When I have dreams about me being me,

1496
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,680
it's usually like callbacks to the past

1497
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,680
and the people that I don't want to remember

1498
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,680
and it's like, it's nagging me

1499
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,680
about things that I don't want

1500
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,680
to think about or talk about

1501
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,680
or want to move past, like a lot of my dreams

1502
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,720
are like me, always have me

1503
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,720
being back at school

1504
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,720
during those years that I dreaded the most

1505
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,720
and I hate that.

1506
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,720
It's a callback, I guess it was

1507
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,720
traumatic to me or something.

1508
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,720
Yeah, it's unresolved trauma.

1509
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,720
I think dreams for the most part

1510
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,720
are just like things,

1511
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,720
they're attempting, it's your brain

1512
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,720
attempting to understand the things

1513
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,720
that it doesn't understand,

1514
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,720
but like it doesn't,

1515
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,720
it's showing you these images

1516
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,720
of you at all, it's like it's trying to help itself.

1517
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,720
It's trying to like put things in their place

1518
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,720
and like in my dreams I always see,

1519
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,720
I always see random

1520
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,720
faces and locations

1521
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,720
that I have been to or like people I have known,

1522
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,720
but they're not accurate.

1523
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,720
Like the relationships

1524
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,720
and the scenarios are not accurate

1525
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,720
to what those people really were, but it's like

1526
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,720
there's a reason that these people

1527
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,720
are here and that this scenario is here.

1528
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,720
It's just that that reason is jumbled.

1529
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,720
It doesn't have a clear, coherent meaning,

1530
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,720
but like through looking at the broad scope

1531
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,720
of all the dreams put together,

1532
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,720
I can figure out broadly what they're about.

1533
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,720
You know, like the fact that

1534
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,720
most of my dreams end with me

1535
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,720
literally being on the run

1536
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,720
from like a massive group of people

1537
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,720
is like obviously I am afraid

1538
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,720
of society coming after me.

1539
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,720
Like that is something I've always been dealing with.

1540
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,720
Are you a lucid dreamer, Digid?

1541
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,720
No.

1542
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,720
If I figure out that it's a dream,

1543
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,720
most of my dreams end with me dying.

1544
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,720
Like most of them end when

1545
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,720
or are about to die or like surrounded

1546
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,720
or trapped. Like my dreams usually

1547
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,720
end when it reaches the point where

1548
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,720
I am fully

1549
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,720
Yeah, exactly. It's when I

1550
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,720
reach the point of having the least control

1551
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,720
and like I usually am straight up

1552
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,720
immobilized or like about to die

1553
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,720
and that's when I wake up.

1554
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,720
I...

1555
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,720
All my dreams are nightmares about either

1556
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,720
I can't find...

1557
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,720
It's all about I can't accomplish something.

1558
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,720
I am lost and I can't find my way.

1559
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,720
Or other people do not

1560
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,720
want to assist me in doing something.

1561
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,720
Mine are often about being lost but specifically

1562
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,720
being left behind.

1563
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,720
It's that I'm trying to catch up to the other

1564
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,720
people who I was with before.

1565
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,720
Yeah, I have a lot of those

1566
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,720
dreams as well.

1567
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,720
That's sad.

1568
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,720
I don't think I dream that much.

1569
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,720
I don't have that many

1570
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,720
or I don't remember most of mine.

1571
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,720
Like I remember that hamburger

1572
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,720
dream.

1573
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,720
I hadn't had one in a while.

1574
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,720
It's a very exciting dream though.

1575
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,720
It's a very straight forward dream too.

1576
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,720
I think I feel like what I know

1577
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,720
what that one's about. I was just dreaming about

1578
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,720
eating and then I noticed that I was eating bread

1579
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,720
and I was like, ah shit, oh well.

1580
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,720
And that's the story.

1581
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,720
I had another one like not that long ago

1582
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,720
and I...

1583
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,720
Your dreams are all just keto nightmares.

1584
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,720
That's all you're having is keto nightmares.

1585
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,720
It's been one thing now.

1586
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,720
Yeah, that's it.

1587
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,720
That's the only one I can remember

1588
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,720
in recent memories.

1589
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,720
Wasn't the other one also about eating a burger

1590
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,720
or something?

1591
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,720
That's the same one that I was just talking about.

1592
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,720
I have a question about your dreams.

1593
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,720
We've all expressed our displeasure

1594
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,720
with this dream about dreams.

1595
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,720
I love this.

1596
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,720
You guys can leave.

1597
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,720
I want to talk about dreams.

1598
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,720
I have a question.

1599
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,720
Have you attempted or

1600
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,720
has there ever been a scenario

1601
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,720
whenever you were chased?

1602
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,720
Have you ever turned around

1603
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,720
and asked them why they're chasing you?

1604
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,720
Uh, no.

1605
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,720
Because I know why they're chasing you.

1606
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,720
There's a movie.

1607
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,720
He knows what he did.

1608
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,720
Exactly what I did.

1609
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,720
What's the movie?

1610
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,720
Why MS review a movie where that happens?

1611
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,720
Where like the kid...

1612
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,720
Wait, no. That's what happens in Stranger Things.

1613
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,720
Stranger Things Season 2.

1614
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,720
Bob tells the kid

1615
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,720
next time you have a dream about the thing

1616
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,720
turn around and tell it you're not afraid of it

1617
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,720
and then he does that and it fucking murders him

1618
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,720
and he gets fucked up and everything's ruined.

1619
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,720
The reason I asked is because

1620
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,720
I had a similar dream.

1621
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,720
Spoilers, bitches!

1622
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,720
I had a similar dream when I was younger

1623
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,720
and some scary force

1624
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,720
was chasing me

1625
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,720
and I had no idea why.

1626
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,720
I think it was like a witch but not like a humanoid

1627
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,720
witch. It was terrifying.

1628
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,720
It had me cornered

1629
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,720
and I had no clue

1630
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,720
why it was chasing me so I turned around

1631
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,720
and it was like, why the fuck are you chasing me?

1632
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,720
And it just got stumped.

1633
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,720
And I woke up.

1634
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,720
You stumped it?

1635
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,720
Yeah, I stumped it.

1636
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,720
It didn't attack me.

1637
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,720
I was like, what the fuck are you chasing me?

1638
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,720
What's your problem?

1639
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,720
I woke up.

1640
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,720
That's how you deal with a bully mage for sure.

1641
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,720
I don't have necessarily nightmares.

1642
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,720
Whenever scary things happen

1643
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,720
I usually interpret it as

1644
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,720
like, holy cow,

1645
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,720
that's some cool shit happening.

1646
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,720
Or like, I lose a dream

1647
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,720
and then I just sort of like

1648
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,720
bonk it on the head and it goes away.

1649
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,720
My nightmares are usually

1650
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,720
when I'm completely alone

1651
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,720
in a completely empty town

1652
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,720
and no one's there

1653
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,720
and I just wander alone

1654
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,720
and something's there.

1655
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,720
I never see it. It's some sort of unknown force.

1656
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,720
And it's

1657
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,720
the patriarch

1658
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,720
lurking behind every shadow.

1659
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,720
It scares the living crap out of me

1660
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,720
in those dreams.

1661
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,720
Yeah, sounds scary.

1662
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,720
It's always there.

1663
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,720
Being alone is one of the scariest things

1664
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,720
for me for sure.

1665
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,720
The worst times is

1666
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,720
if it's evening

1667
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,720
and the lamps are on

1668
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,720
the street lamps are on

1669
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,720
and it's evening

1670
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,720
and the lamps are a source of light

1671
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,720
but everything else is getting darker

1672
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,720
and growing darker and it's like

1673
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,720
that sort of emptiness.

1674
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,720
That's the only thing that sort of scares me

1675
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,720
in my dreams nowadays.

1676
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,720
Everything else is just like, oh, well, that was cool.

1677
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,720
So...

1678
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,720
That's cool.

1679
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,720
Like I said before, I don't dream often

1680
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,720
but I had a particularly vibrant dream

1681
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,720
last night that stuck with me.

1682
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,720
Good timing.

1683
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,720
Yeah, it was good timing.

1684
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,720
Yeah, quickly.

1685
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,720
So, I don't know how I got here.

1686
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,720
No, don't.

1687
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,720
Well, I don't know what the situation was

1688
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,720
but something was going on

1689
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,720
with Michelle

1690
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,720
where she was doing a fashion show

1691
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,720
or something

1692
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,720
and she had weird dreads

1693
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,720
like Kerrigan from Starcraft 1

1694
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,720
and

1695
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,720
she was wearing this purple dress

1696
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,720
and I was in the crowd watching this on stage

1697
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,720
and she was going out with a bunch of other people

1698
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,720
doing stuff

1699
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,720
and I don't know, it was like

1700
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,720
some celebration of her

1701
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,720
and she had done something like

1702
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,720
maybe it was her quinceanera

1703
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,720
I don't know.

1704
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,720
Yeah, that's the one.

1705
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,720
I don't know what it was

1706
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,720
but it was something going on celebrating her

1707
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,720
and I was watching from the crowd

1708
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,720
and feeling slightly uncomfortable

1709
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,720
about the whole affair.

1710
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,720
The only reason it sounds like that

1711
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,720
if you're someone who doesn't generally have dreams

1712
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,720
is it's all about Michelle.

1713
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,720
It's obviously because you now have a new element

1714
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,720
in your life that you have to

1715
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,720
now reconcile in your brain.

1716
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,720
Well, newer.

1717
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,720
Well, I don't want to get personal

1718
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,720
but we've been talking about

1719
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,720
just some real shit recently

1720
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,720
so my thoughts are that it's probably relevant to that.

1721
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,720
I had a long period

1722
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,720
of not really having any dreams

1723
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,720
when me and May first started dating

1724
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,720
it kind of had quelled

1725
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,720
my nightmares for a while

1726
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,720
and after things that happened last month

1727
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,720
I have non-stop had nightmares

1728
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,720
about people trying to take her away

1729
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,720
from me and me having to save her

1730
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,720
all the time.

1731
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,720
People just kidnapping her in a literal

1732
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,720
burlap sack and me having to

1733
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,720
beat the shit out of them.

1734
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,720
Did you pull off the mask of the kidnappers

1735
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,720
next time and see that it is in fact May

1736
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,720
under that. She is the kidnapper of herself.

1737
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,720
Whoa.

1738
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,720
And think about what that means.

1739
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,720
Deep.

1740
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,720
I have a silly dream.

1741
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,720
In my dream

1742
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,720
Digi was doing something

1743
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,720
outrageously

1744
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,720
silly and

1745
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,720
he just one stop.

1746
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,720
Nate was doing his padded

1747
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,720
Registeel impersonation.

1748
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,720
Not normal Registeel, but the Registeel that was removed.

1749
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,720
It looked too much like a Nazi salute.

1750
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,720
I want to see that.

1751
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,720
Over and over and over again.

1752
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,720
Yeah, Google search Registeel.

1753
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,720
I named my Registeel that I caught

1754
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,720
in a Pokemon Go Auschwitz.

1755
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,720
I used to have dreams about

1756
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,720
being out of my relationship

1757
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,720
and that was great and then when I was out of it

1758
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,720
I had nightmares that I was

1759
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,720
not out of it and that leaving it

1760
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,720
was in fact a dream

1761
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,720
and that was terrifying and I would wake up

1762
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,720
to great relief.

1763
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,720
That's my dream story.

1764
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,720
I just want to point out that the

1765
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,720
thing that makes Registeel seem

1766
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,720
so horrible is just that he is

1767
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,720
holding up his left hand

1768
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,720
kind of forward.

1769
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,720
Sort of like a salute.

1770
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,720
It does look like a Nazi salute.

1771
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,720
It wasn't intentional.

1772
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,720
I'm pretty sure.

1773
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,720
No, I'm sure it wasn't.

1774
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,720
I'm sure it was just the only dynamic pose

1775
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,720
they could come up with

1776
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,720
with such a fucking

1777
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,720
horrible close design.

1778
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,720
Alright, let's get the fuck out of here.

1779
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,720
Hey Digi, last episode

1780
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,720
I was talking about my trip to Italy

1781
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,720
and I had a conversation

1782
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,720
and I posted in the real friend initiative chat

1783
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,720
which is in the PCP discord

1784
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,720
about

1785
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,720
city planning.

1786
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,720
What you like to talk about city planning is I alluded to this last episode as well

1787
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,720
because I have some big

1788
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,720
ideas and big thoughts

1789
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,720
and I have a PowerPoint presentation for you

1790
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,720
about something in Italy.

1791
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,720
Go ahead dude, I'm curious.

1792
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,720
I love city planning.

1793
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,720
I don't know if we can talk about this on PCP at all

1794
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,720
but you and me

1795
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,720
Didn't we have a whole city planning

1796
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,720
discussion on one of these episodes?

1797
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,720
Wasn't that like the first formless cast?

1798
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,720
You might have, but I might have been gone.

1799
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,720
I'm pretty sure on the first formless cast

1800
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,720
it was like a massive city planning discussion.

1801
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,720
Sure, okay.

1802
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,720
And I thought you were a part of it.

1803
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,720
If that is the case, then that is the case.

1804
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,720
I was not.

1805
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,720
I don't remember.

1806
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,720
Well, whatever. In any case,

1807
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,720
me and you have been thinking about sea planning a lot.

1808
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,720
And going to Boston

1809
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,720
was the first time that I ever thought about this

1810
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,720
in Boston so much and it's just a well-designed city

1811
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,720
that I started to come up with ideas.

1812
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,720
I started to come up with, I started to concoct

1813
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,720
buzzwords in my head.

1814
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,720
What makes a good city?

1815
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,720
And so I came up with some several buzzwords here.

1816
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,720
Dense, easily navigatable

1817
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,720
and then another one that I forgot.

1818
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,720
You can cut out a syllable.

1819
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,720
That's even one word. That's true.

1820
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,720
Ooh, very nice.

1821
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,720
Those are some buzzwords.

1822
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,720
I know what makes a good city now.

1823
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,720
I know.

1824
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,720
It's navigatable.

1825
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,720
And so you go to Italy and Rome.

1826
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,720
Rome specifically.

1827
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,720
And you think, okay, on paper,

1828
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,720
it's very, very dense

1829
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,720
and you can navigate it.

1830
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,720
But here's the thing.

1831
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,720
Rome is Rome

1832
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,720
and it's been rebuilt on top of itself

1833
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,720
a thousand times over a thousand years.

1834
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,720
They did it once a year.

1835
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,720
You get some crazy shit.

1836
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,720
Yeah, once a year.

1837
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,720
It's all demolished.

1838
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,720
The exact same city but slightly different.

1839
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,720
Well, yeah.

1840
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,720
It's something like 2000 or something.

1841
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,720
I don't know.

1842
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,720
The Roman Empire was well-established

1843
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,720
2000 years ago when Jesus was around.

1844
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,720
But whatever.

1845
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,720
Anyway, so here's the thing about Rome.

1846
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,720
It's super dense.

1847
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,720
You can walk down a Roman road

1848
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,720
and walk down a block

1849
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,720
or so. They don't really have blocks.

1850
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,720
They don't have arcans.

1851
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,720
A street.

1852
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,720
Hundreds upon hundreds of stores.

1853
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,720
It's just so packed.

1854
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,720
But the thing about Rome is

1855
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,720
is that the streets.

1856
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,720
The streets in particular.

1857
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,720
Imagine a back alleyway in America.

1858
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,720
Imagine, you know, you see a space

1859
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,720
in between two stores

1860
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,720
where they keep like a dumpster or something.

1861
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,720
The size of that back alleyway

1862
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,720
are the size of the main streets

1863
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,720
in Rome.

1864
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,720
So there are no big open streets

1865
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,720
the way we as Americans would think of them.

1866
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,720
There are only

1867
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,720
exclusively

1868
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,720
back alleyways that go

1869
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,720
in between buildings.

1870
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,720
Very narrow, narrow streets

1871
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,720
where you literally have to like dodge

1872
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,720
people or if you're a person

1873
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,720
dodge multiple cars.

1874
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,720
When they built these alleys

1875
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,720
they would not have been cars.

1876
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,720
Well, sure.

1877
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,720
That's the case

1878
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,720
for Boston as well.

1879
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,720
They've adjusted

1880
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,720
and they've planned for wagons and stuff.

1881
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,720
But the streets are so fucking dense in Rome

1882
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,720
that you can barely

1883
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,720
it's feel like you're driving.

1884
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,720
It's like you're claustrophobic because you're just surrounded by

1885
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,720
on either side of you

1886
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,720
towering buildings. Like no matter how

1887
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,720
many stores are actually in each building

1888
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,720
it's always three stories.

1889
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,720
It's really bizarre, I've noticed this.

1890
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,720
They're all three stories. So you're gonna have a shop

1891
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,720
on the first level and then just literally

1892
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,720
nothing on the top like, you know, two

1893
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,720
and three levels. And they're just there

1894
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,720
because I don't know, they used to be residential

1895
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,720
back in the medieval times.

1896
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,720
So you have these towering buildings on either side of you

1897
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,720
for just miles. And there's no

1898
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,720
like, especially in Rome

1899
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,720
where there's so much history and architecture

1900
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,720
and you know, oh, you can just walk and see the Charlie Fountain.

1901
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,720
The Charlie Fountain is this view

1902
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,720
like, you know, huge majestic fountain

1903
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,720
that's like a staple of Italy culture

1904
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,720
you know, it's on your postcards.

1905
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,720
It just is in some

1906
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,720
bum-fuck alley. You could just walk

1907
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,720
accidentally, like stumble upon this

1908
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,720
huge tourist destination

1909
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,720
without even trying to. There's no

1910
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,720
like, space for it. It just is

1911
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,720
in the, like, a one by one

1912
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,720
block where a normal

1913
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,720
building would be. It's like, oh, it's just this

1914
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,720
giant, beautiful fountain.

1915
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,720
It's so dense and it's

1916
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,720
over-expense. Like, it's so hard to get around it.

1917
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,720
Let me pause at something. I think that the problem

1918
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,720
with cities like Rome is that

1919
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,720
you build the perfect city

1920
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,720
and it's beautiful and everyone loves it

1921
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,720
so everyone moves there

1922
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,720
and then immediately it is no longer

1923
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,720
the perfect city because

1924
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,720
I agree, Digi, build the wall. Keep them out.

1925
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,720
That's what we gotta do. You just need to build

1926
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,720
more cities. We just need

1927
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,720
there to be, like, every time we hit

1928
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,720
the cap where, like, the city doesn't make

1929
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,720
sense anymore, do another one. And I understand

1930
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,720
why that wouldn't have been possible

1931
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,720
at a time where you had to build your city

1932
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,720
somewhere that made, like, strategic sense

1933
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,720
for, like, combat as well as

1934
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,720
for, like, you know, having enough water

1935
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,720
and resources and everything. But, like, we've

1936
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,720
spent the last 200 years making

1937
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,720
that not an issue anymore. We

1938
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,720
nobody lives next to a farm

1939
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,720
now. Like, we don't have

1940
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,720
to worry about the food being

1941
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,720
nearby anymore. It comes by car. We

1942
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,720
have aqueducts for the water. Even

1943
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,720
the Romans invented that. You know, like,

1944
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,720
there's ways and because

1945
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,720
we don't have to worry about land fighting

1946
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,720
anymore, like, there's not a thing.

1947
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,720
So, like, whether or not it's a tactical

1948
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,720
advantage to build your city here

1949
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,720
totally irrelevant now. So, like,

1950
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,720
there's probably shitloads of places

1951
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,720
that just hadn't been considered places

1952
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,720
where cities could be built before.

1953
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,720
But, like, because

1954
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,720
the big cities are self-perpetuating

1955
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,720
hype machines, like, New York

1956
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,720
City is constantly

1957
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,720
hyping itself as

1958
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,720
the place to go. And so, people are

1959
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,720
going to go there, even though

1960
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,720
it's a city that is

1961
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,720
under constant construction

1962
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,720
because there's so many people

1963
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,720
that the needs of the city are constantly changing

1964
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,720
and they're never met.

1965
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,720
They're never realized, you know?

1966
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,720
Did you know they recently, like,

1967
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,720
like, stop granting

1968
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,720
new Uber license? And they're going to, like,

1969
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,720
have new laws limiting Uber

1970
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,720
consumption because they are

1971
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,720
running, like, taxis and they're

1972
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,720
stuffing up the streets. That's, uh, that's

1973
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,720
makes sense. I mean, like,

1974
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,720
it's kind of like the, um,

1975
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,720
the girl in the gun, like, person

1976
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,720
limit thing, right? Where

1977
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,720
he's like, there has to only be so many people

1978
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,720
on earth or else it

1979
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,720
becomes a problem. And the

1980
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,720
argument from the

1981
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,720
opposition is not so much, hey,

1982
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,720
like, it's like, well

1983
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,720
can we just find a way to make it

1984
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,720
so we can keep expanding the population

1985
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,720
and keep it under control and have it make

1986
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,720
sense? And it's like, I feel like we haven't

1987
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,720
we haven't found that answer

1988
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,720
just yet. But, like, that's what we need

1989
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,720
to be looking for. And until you have that, you ain't got nothing. Right.

1990
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,720
You gotta find that first if you want to build more people

1991
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,720
or whatever. Exactly. And, like, we need to

1992
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,720
find the paradigm that makes sense. And I

1993
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,720
think the problem is that no, not enough

1994
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,720
people understand why

1995
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,720
they want to go to the big city.

1996
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,720
Like, yeah.

1997
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,720
Oh, this goes back exactly

1998
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,720
to, like, St. Helene

1999
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,720
because you're supposed to go to St. Helene,

2000
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,720
why do you want to go to New York?

2001
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,720
It's New York. And you also

2002
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,720
if you're from a small town,

2003
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,720
like, uh, for instance

2004
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,720
Virginia Beach is not necessarily a small city,

2005
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,720
but it has no culture. It has no

2006
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,720
nowhere to go if you're an artist. There's not, like,

2007
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,720
like Victor, who's been, my brother Victor,

2008
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,720
former guest in the PCP,

2009
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,720
we all know who Victor is. We all know who Victor is.

2010
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,720
He's been on the PCP. So Victor,

2011
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,720
you know, he works in

2012
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,720
film in Virginia Beach, which is a very small

2013
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,720
industry. There's no, like, expansion

2014
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,720
there. And so when he looks at the rest

2015
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,720
of the world, it's like, where can I go

2016
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,720
that I can make money doing film?

2017
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,720
He thinks, like, okay, we got

2018
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,720
Georgia because Atlanta

2019
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,720
is a big film town. You got LA

2020
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,720
and you got New York. And it's kind of like

2021
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,720
from the perspective of someone living in Virginia Beach,

2022
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,720
that's all there is.

2023
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,720
Because that's all you hear about. But, like,

2024
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,720
there are other places

2025
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,720
and if not, you could even

2026
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,720
build a place. Like,

2027
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,720
my mentality was always like, hey,

2028
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,720
let's just move all the people who we want

2029
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,720
to work with here, and then we

2030
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,720
have a place. Like, that's, you know,

2031
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,720
the theory behind PCPHQ

2032
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,720
and based on

2033
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,720
the Red Letter Media guys who literally did that.

2034
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,720
They've been fucking Milwaukee. Like, it's not a film city,

2035
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,720
but they have a film career

2036
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,720
there, you know. Granted,

2037
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,720
they're not working in, you know, in the

2038
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,720
big leagues, but, like,

2039
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,720
they are able to produce full-blown indie

2040
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,720
films on the basis of

2041
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,720
their, like, 10 or 12-man

2042
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,720
crew and whoever they can hire on board,

2043
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,720
you know, to work with them in Milwaukee.

2044
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,720
Yeah. Quick aside, quick

2045
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,720
aside, but before we move on, I can see

2046
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,720
the comments now. I just want to make

2047
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,720
sure everyone on the same page is me.

2048
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,720
I'm not saying that New York City is

2049
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,720
Lean Tower of Pisa Tier, a.k.a. absolute shit.

2050
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,720
Lean, uh, uh, New York City

2051
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,720
is cool. It just is the same

2052
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,720
sort of general idea where it's, like, people

2053
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,720
would have the, they don't have a reason to go to New York City.

2054
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,720
New York City, there are reasons to go there.

2055
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,720
I would like to live in New York City.

2056
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,720
I mean, I like Boston. I would like, I think I'd like

2057
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,720
New York a lot as well. Yeah, and this, this whole

2058
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,720
theory that I'm positing is why I ended

2059
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,720
up in Boston, because when I was

2060
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,720
in Virginia Beach, I was looking at all these cities that,

2061
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,720
like, people recommended. I'm like, well, I don't know

2062
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,720
what is supposed to be good

2063
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,720
about these cities until I go there.

2064
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,720
Like, I know Atlanta is supposed to have, like, a big

2065
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,720
film scene, and it is, and a big rap scene,

2066
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,720
and it's a big city, but then you go

2067
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,720
there, and you realize that Atlanta is super

2068
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,720
spread out, and it's really difficult to

2069
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,720
get around, and it's, it's

2070
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,720
dirty, and yeah, it's just like,

2071
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,720
it's not a place that I looked

2072
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,720
at, and went like, wow, this seems

2073
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,720
like the dream, you know?

2074
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,720
It was more like, and so,

2075
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,720
and I went to Atlanta. Where was that? Atlanta.

2076
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,720
Atlanta. Atlanta. Atlanta. Atlanta.

2077
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,720
Uh, I like Atlanta, right?

2078
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,720
It's, I mean, it's fine, but it's not

2079
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,720
nearly like, when I came to,

2080
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,720
like, when I came to Boston, this was a city

2081
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,720
I had no concept of, like, I did not

2082
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,720
know anything about Boston

2083
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,720
at all until I came here,

2084
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,720
but then when I looked at it, I was just like, oh,

2085
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,720
this is exactly

2086
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,720
what I was looking for,

2087
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,720
because even though Boston's not known

2088
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,720
for, like, a film scene, or this or

2089
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,720
that, or like, for YouTubers being here, like,

2090
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,720
I looked at it, and I went, well, this would

2091
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,720
be a great place to do this job.

2092
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,720
It's just a matter of

2093
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,720
setting up perception. Yeah, setting up

2094
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,720
something here, and like, there are already

2095
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,720
other YouTubers who live here, you know,

2096
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,720
right at the gate got to hang out with

2097
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,720
Zenn Huckstable, who's super cool, and I'd love to work with

2098
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,720
them, you know, and like, Tom and Ben were already

2099
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,720
here, and it's just like,

2100
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,720
this can make sense.

2101
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,720
It's just a matter of actually

2102
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,720
going to the city, looking at the resources

2103
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,720
that are available here, and saying, what can we

2104
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,720
build here, as opposed to like, what is there

2105
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,720
already infrastructure for, because if

2106
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,720
you go to L.A. or New York, where

2107
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,720
everyone else is going to have a film career,

2108
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,720
guess what is going to be the most competitive

2109
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,720
market there, is

2110
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,720
going to be the film career, which is why, you know,

2111
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,720
everyone goes to L.A. and fucking works in cafes

2112
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,720
for 15 years while they try to play the screenplay.

2113
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,720
We can be big fish in the small pond. Right, exactly.

2114
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,720
But the thing

2115
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,720
is, there should not be, like, regardless

2116
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,720
of, regardless

2117
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,720
of like, the big fish small pond dichotomy kind

2118
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,720
of thing, it's more like, what everyone should do is

2119
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,720
think about

2120
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,720
what kind of fish you want to be, and what kind

2121
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,720
of pond you want to live in,

2122
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,720
you know, like, it's not just about being

2123
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,720
a big fish in a small pond, it's like, this

2124
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,720
is a pond that suits my

2125
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,720
needs, and so regardless of how big I am

2126
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,720
as a fish, like, I would like to

2127
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,720
live in this pond, and like, let's

2128
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,720
find an ecosystem where it makes sense

2129
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,720
for you to live in, you know.

2130
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,720
There's no reason to stick with this metaphor.

2131
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,720
I can make it work.

2132
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,720
It's fine.

2133
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,720
There's no, it does not impact.

2134
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,720
It's not the same. Anyway, yeah, I just think

2135
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,720
I think we need

2136
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,720
I think the only answer to, like, fixing cities

2137
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,720
is to build new cities, like

2138
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,720
it's not to try to keep building over

2139
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:31,720
the ones we already have, it's like

2140
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:33,720
we need to just go out and find a place

2141
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,720
where we can build, like, an ideal city

2142
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,720
for a certain type of person

2143
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,720
and then get that type of person

2144
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,720
to come there, and then, like,

2145
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,720
just, you know, be like, hey, here, here's

2146
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,720
a spot for you if you think like me,

2147
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,720
you know, and for those

2148
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,720
of us

2149
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,720
on the autistic spectrum, we need

2150
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,720
to build an autism city.

2151
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,720
It's basically what I'm saying, and that's my

2152
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,720
dream right now, is to build

2153
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,720
the autism city.

2154
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,720
Beautiful, beautiful.

2155
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,720
You should definitely learn,

2156
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,720
we talked about this a little bit in chat, did you, but you should definitely

2157
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,720
look into the actual specifics of

2158
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,720
the plan for Epcot, because it is

2159
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,720
the most autistic thing I've ever

2160
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,720
heard, like, everything is, like, perfect circles

2161
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,720
and, like, it's shaped to be, like,

2162
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,720
it looks like a cell. It's very

2163
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,720
interesting. Have you guys

2164
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,720
ever played table?

2165
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,720
I'm planning, me and Tom,

2166
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,720
let me just, let me just launch

2167
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,720
this right now, me and Tom got a new channel

2168
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,720
called I Am Games,

2169
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:31,720
which we also have a t-shirt, we've already sold

2170
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,720
five t-shirts on the basis of one

2171
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,720
tweet, so this is

2172
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,720
already happening, and our

2173
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,720
first videos and our first live streams

2174
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,720
are going to be about fable, so

2175
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,720
there you go, what a coincidence.

2176
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,720
Yeah, that's a good one, okay, like, the reason.

2177
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,720
I've never played a fable game.

2178
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:49,720
Well, you're going to learn all about them

2179
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,720
on I Am Games!

2180
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,720
Go to

2181
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,720

01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,720
and it links to our YouTube channel.

2183
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,720
Are you kidding me? No, I own

imgames.fun, links to the

2185
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,720
YouTube channel I Am Games.

2186
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,720
Wait, why did you

2187
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,720
get a custom URL?

2188
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,720
I am very serious about this t-shirts

2189
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,720
thing.

2190
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,720
I'm very fucking serious, I was just

2191
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,720
looking up trademarks for a second ago,

2192
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,720
and I found out that as long as you just put

2193
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,720
a TM next to your shit, you basically

2194
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:21,720
have a common law trademark, and if you can

2195
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,720
prove that, like, you were the first one to do

2196
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,720
that, then you can

2197
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,720
back yourself up in a court of law, so

2198
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,720
I'm officially announcing

2199
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,720
that I own the trademark to the phrase

2200
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,720
I Am Games, so there you go.

2201
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,720
This is the statement.

2202
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,720
What is the relevance of I Am Games?

2203
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,720
You own the trademark,

2204
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,720
you own the copyright, right?

2205
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:43,720
No, I just, because I just said that, I now

2206
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,720
have the common law trademark by saying that

2207
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,720
just now on this podcast.

2208
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,720
That's why I said it like that.

2209
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,720
I just looked up the

2210
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,720
laws just now while we were doing the show.

2211
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,720
Like, I thought that, like, you have to apply for a

2212
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,720
trademark. If you apply for it, if you

2213
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,720
apply for the trademark, then

2214
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,720
it is, like, in the system, and people can

2215
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,720
look it up, but again,

2216
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,720
the law of trademarking is just if you

2217
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,720
say you own it enough times, then

2218
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,720
like, you do.

2219
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,720
Okay, okay, the reason I brought

2220
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,720
up Fable, though,

2221
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,720
is because, like, when I was

2222
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,720
younger, I really wanted to build

2223
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,720
like, a little town, like, I was like

2224
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,720
when I grew up, I want to build a town, and

2225
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:23,720
like, and the reason I brought up Fable is

2226
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,720
because I was really, I really, really

2227
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,720
loved Fable. At that time, it was

2228
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:29,720
like, the first game I played on the

2229
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,720
original Xbox, on my very first

2230
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,720
console that I officially owned,

2231
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,720
and I really liked

2232
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,720
Bowerstone, and I was like, when I

2233
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,720
grew up, I want to have a town just

2234
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,720
like Bowerstone, and just, like,

2235
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,720
a little bit cleaner, and

2236
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,720
that was, that was my dream town

2237
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,720
slash city sort of thing. I'm good

2238
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,720
to be looking, when I play this game, I'm

2239
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,720
going to be studying the city now that you've said that.

2240
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,720
It's not good, it was

2241
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,720
like, a nine-year-old

2242
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,720
mage. I don't know, because Peter

2243
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:59,720
Malinu is the kind of guy who probably would

2244
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,720
like, involve pretty high-level city

2245
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:03,720
planning into his games.

2246
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,720
It's a very tiny town. Those were

2247
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,720
Peter Malinu games, I forgot.

2248
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,720
And there's this book

2249
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,720
that I want to read called The Timeless Art

2250
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,720
of Building, which is a, it's

2251
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,720
fascinatingly structured, because it's like a full-size

2252
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,720
book, but it's written in such a way that

2253
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,720
if you were to just read all the

2254
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,720
headlines, then you will get, like,

2255
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:23,720
he wrote it so like, every paragraph has

2256
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,720
a headline, and he's like, if you only have

2257
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,720
an hour, just read all the headlines.

2258
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,720
And all the other stuff is just, like, fill in

2259
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,720
information. Basically, like, my compress, decompress

2260
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,720
video is kind of structured the same way

2261
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,720
as this book, which I didn't even fucking

2262
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,720
realize until just now, but that's hilarious.

2263
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,720
Yeah, but

2264
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,720
he talks a lot about, like, the ways that

2265
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,720
cities should be planned, such as, like,

2266
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,720
taking a area, and instead

2267
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,720
of building roads first,

2268
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,720
just observing how

2269
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,720
people traverse the area naturally,

2270
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,720
and then building the roads in those

2271
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,720
paths, and things like that.

2272
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,720
Makes sense. Yeah. And just, you know,

2273
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,720
there's lots of stuff about just the structure of stuff,

2274
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,720
and then they built a campus

2275
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,720
on the basis of his book, like,

2276
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,720
his ideas to, like, test it out.

2277
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,720
But the person who I look up to the most

2278
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,720
for their stance on city planning is

2279
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,720
Hayao Miyazaki, who

2280
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,720
built the Ghibli Museum out of,

2281
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,720
like,

2282
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,720
his ideas about, like, what a perfect

2283
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,720
environment should be, that, like,

2284
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,720
for instance,

2285
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,720
he has a whole poem he wrote about,

2286
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,720
like, the principles that the museum was built

2287
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,720
on, and, like, if you read this poem, it's just

2288
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,720
like, oh, this is just how the whole world

2289
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,720
should be structured. I mean, okay, that's cool

2290
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,720
and all, but rather than look up to, like, an actual

2291
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:35,720
city planner, you're looking up to a guy who built one

2292
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,720
building. Well, it's because

2293
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,720
think about how

2294
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,720
a building is a microcosm.

2295
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,720
You can look at his building as a

2296
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,720
scale model of a city. It's

2297
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,720
basically the way I'm looking at it. Okay.

2298
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,720
No one has been able

2299
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,720
to build the ultimate city, because

2300
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,720
no one guy who imagines it is

2301
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,720
going to then be able to go and fucking

2302
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,720
build it, except for Disney's attempt

2303
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,720
with the Epcot Center. But, like,

2304
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,720
um, and Disney was

2305
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:03,720
unfeasibly rich, you know, and, like,

2306
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,720
had this kind of power, and had already

2307
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,720
built Disney World, you know? If there's one

2308
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:09,720
guy that could do it, it was going to be Walt Disney.

2309
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,720
Right, exactly. And, like, I think the problem

2310
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,720
is that these guys

2311
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,720
don't do enough to inspire

2312
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,720
other people to work with them.

2313
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,720
Like, guys like Hayao Miyazaki,

2314
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,720
who, I think that

2315
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:23,720
a big part of what he has realized

2316
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,720
in his old age, if you watch, like,

2317
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,720
The Wind Rises, I think a lot of that movie

2318
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,720
is about his guilt

2319
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,720
over the fact that he tried to do everything

2320
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,720
himself, that, like, he was so draconian

2321
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,720
and so, like, oh, everything has

2322
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:37,720
to be according to the letter of, like, my vision.

2323
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,720
And, like, I think

2324
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:41,720
that you're never going to get

2325
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,720
enough people to build a city that way.

2326
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,720
Like, you need to have people on board

2327
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:47,720
with you, but also to, like, embrace

2328
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,720
their ideas and to, like, evolve

2329
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,720
the thing, you know? Like, so

2330
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,720
I don't want to build a city based on, like, my

2331
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,720
plan for a city. I want

2332
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,720
to, like, communicate with

2333
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,720
people and all of us come to an understanding

2334
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,720
of what environment we want

2335
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,720
and then set about figuring out how to build that

2336
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:05,720
together, you know? So it's not so much that, like,

2337
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,720
you know. Digi, let's just start

2338
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,720
like a creative Minecraft. We should definitely

2339
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,720
I mean, I think that's

2340
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,720
basically what that exists for.

2341
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,720
Like, I think a lot of these

2342
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,720
a lot of

2343
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,720
modern art is trying

2344
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,720
to help people

2345
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,720
to develop the mindsets that the people

2346
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,720
who create the art have.

2347
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,720
Like, I think that when Notch made a game

2348
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,720
like Minecraft, there was

2349
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:31,720
when he put in those tools, like, for instance

2350
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,720
the red, um, the red, uh,

2351
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,720
what's it fucking called? The redstone, whatever?

2352
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,720
Yeah, the redstone. Like, it's just

2353
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:39,720
teaching kids how to program.

2354
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,720
Like, that's what it's there for, is to teach

2355
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,720
you how to code, essentially, because it

2356
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:45,720
is just, it's just literally built in

2357
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,720
circuit boards. So, like, the reason

2358
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,720
he puts this in the game is he's like, hey,

2359
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,720
let's see what you can create if I gave you

2360
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,720
a three-dimensional coding environment,

2361
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,720
you know? Like, which is

2362
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,720
even more, like, you can create things that you couldn't

2363
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,720
just easily code in real life,

2364
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,720
um, because

2365
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,720
I mean, you could code it into a computer and then it could

2366
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,720
be simulated there, but like, he gives you the means

2367
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,720
to, like, literally just

2368
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:09,720
lay down some redstone bricks and a thing

2369
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,720
like, physically happens

2370
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:13,720
in the reality of this game. And, like, you can

2371
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,720
instantly see what would be the

2372
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,720
results of if you duplicated this

2373
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,720
in reality, but you would need all those materials.

2374
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:21,720
Yeah, coding it in a computer would be too artificial.

2375
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,720
But in Minecraft, you can do it, you can do it

2376
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,720
for real. Again, it's... It really happens.

2377
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,720
Yeah, pretty much. I mean, like...

2378
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,720
No, I know it's... Because you'd have to build

2379
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,720
the code of Minecraft first to even

2380
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,720
have the visuals to simulate

2381
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,720
the thing you're coding. Like, and for

2382
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,720
kids, I think the abstraction

2383
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,720
of just looking at a bunch of numbers is

2384
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,720
why coding is hard. Like, you look

2385
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,720
at a code and you're like, what the fuck does that

2386
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:45,720
say? But, like, when you just lay down

2387
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,720
redstone bricks and shit, and you look at

2388
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,720
it, then it makes perfect sense, you know? Especially

2389
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,720
when you can see what it activates.

2390
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:53,720
So, I do think it's all just teaching...

2391
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,720
I agree. My nephew has

2392
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,720
like, a similar, like, sort of play kid

2393
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,720
specifically for young children. And it has

2394
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,720
like, stuff like, um,

2395
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:03,720
with little electronics and stuff. So he can

2396
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,720
build, like, a thing that he can sort of

2397
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,720
make fly, or have, like, a little

2398
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,720
light bulb light up. And it's, like, a very

2399
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,720
sort of safe kid-friendly environment. And

2400
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,720
like, he was like, fine when he

2401
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,720
managed to build those things. He was very interested

2402
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,720
and that's really neat.

2403
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,720
Maybe like that Nintendo Labo is the same

2404
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,720
sort of thing. I was about to talk about that.

2405
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,720
Like, and a lot of the stuff... Like,

2406
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,720
there's a reason Minecraft is so big in schools

2407
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,720
that, like, it was adapted as, like,

2408
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,720
this major teaching tool. Because, like,

2409
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:31,720
I think that right now

2410
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,720
most of, like, the

2411
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,720
thought leaders in society are of the

2412
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,720
mindset that, like, what we need the most is,

2413
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,720
like, more engineers and more coders

2414
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,720
and more people who can, like,

2415
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,720
bring visions to life.

2416
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:45,720
Because, like, right now we don't need

2417
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,720
soldiers. We don't need, like,

2418
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,720
we don't need people working factories, because

2419
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,720
we can replace them with robots eventually.

2420
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,720
Like, we actually kind of need soldiers, because

2421
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,720
they're all, all people are too fat and we're

2422
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,720
running low. That's true fact. That's true

2423
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,720
fact. Well, we need to also make people

2424
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,720
less fucking fat. That's part of the mission here.

2425
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,720
But...

2426
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,720
Like, Otaku Gonzo Journalism

2427
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,720
Bro Thought Leader

2428
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,720
In my book, I call myself

2429
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:11,720
a prospective millennial

2430
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,720
thought leader, I think. And D-List

2431
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:15,720
D-List?

2432
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,720
No, I think it was D-List Millennial

2433
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,720
Thought Leader. Something like that. In any

2434
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,720
case, like,

2435
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,720
I do think that,

2436
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,720
like, for instance, when

2437
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,720
people talk about, like, the problem of robots

2438
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,720
taking our jobs, right?

2439
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,720
Like, robots taking people's jobs is only

2440
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:33,720
a problem, because people don't know how to do

2441
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,720
other jobs. Like, if

2442
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,720
everyone knew... Imagine if we lived

2443
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,720
in a world where everyone knew how to code.

2444
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,720
Well, we have infinite coding jobs.

2445
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,720
Like, if you just keep coming up with

2446
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,720
new shit to code, that's fine.

2447
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,720
Like, so if everyone who we had working

2448
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,720
the factories was replaced with robots, and

2449
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,720
then all those people just learned to code,

2450
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,720
they would all have jobs. Like, we don't need

2451
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:55,720
these factory jobs to exist, you know?

2452
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:57,720
The thing about the robot jobs,

2453
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:59,720
right? Like,

2454
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,720
it makes me so mad. In a perfect world,

2455
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,720
we would replace, like,

2456
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:05,720
replacing jobs with robots should not

2457
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,720
be a bad thing. No, never.

2458
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,720
That should be what we want, but it's not

2459
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,720
because people want their jobs, because people

2460
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,720
want to work to make money.

2461
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:15,720
But it's totally, but it's totally ridiculous,

2462
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,720
because, like, that's not producing

2463
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,720
any... Wanting to live.

2464
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,720
The problem is that people aren't thinking... That's not producing any additional

2465
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,720
value, it's just, like,

2466
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:25,720
it's just the systems we have in place

2467
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,720
demand labor, even though that labor

2468
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:29,720
is not necessary. And it's a problem of people not

2469
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,720
thinking generationally. Like, there's lots of jobs that just don't need to be done.

2470
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,720
Like, these people are worried about the job,

2471
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,720
like, I understand if you were,

2472
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,720
like, a, you know, a 40-year-old

2473
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,720
man, and you're getting your job taken away by a robot,

2474
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:41,720
I understand why that would bother you, but it's, like,

2475
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:43,720
the reason this job has to be taken by a robot

2476
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:45,720
is so your kid doesn't have to

2477
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:47,720
do this job when you're dead.

2478
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:49,720
You know, like, your kid... Nobody ever

2479
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,720
has to do it again. Right.

2480
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,720
That's just a hefty toll to pay, which I...

2481
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,720
I mean, that's the real problem. Like, we...

2482
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,720
We're asking people to basically be sacrificed

2483
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,720
on the altar of progress in, uh, in a fact.

2484
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,720
Which we should be asking...

2485
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:03,720
Because we don't have a system to support that, you know.

2486
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,720
I would ask of those people who are, like,

2487
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,720
working the factory job, like, why do you value

2488
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,720
your life so much? You're just a fucking factory worker.

2489
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:11,720
Like, get over yourself.

2490
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,720
Just die and let the next generation

2491
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:15,720
take over. You're...

2492
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,720
No, you don't have to die.

2493
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,720
The problem is they'll say the same for all of us in time.

2494
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:21,720
No, and I agree. I think that my...

2495
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:23,720
Like, my purpose is here to just

2496
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,720
inspire the next generation, and then

2497
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,720
when my ideas are so outdated

2498
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:29,720
that I can't help anymore, just let me die.

2499
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,720
Like... I think there's some wisdom to that.

2500
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,720
I honestly do. You know, and that's why

2501
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,720
I think... I think that's why there's so many

2502
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,720
old people who just, like, fuck off to Florida.

2503
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,720
Like, Florida is where you go

2504
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:41,720
when you realize that you can't really

2505
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,720
add anything to society anymore.

2506
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,720
Like, just go to Florida and go, like,

2507
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,720
just sit by the beach and look at the water

2508
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,720
until you're out, you know?

2509
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,720
I think that's... I think that's... I think I'm

2510
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,720
glad I respect the old people

2511
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,720
who have the dignity to just get out

2512
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:57,720
of the way and fuck off to some

2513
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,720
ass-backwards place like Florida

2514
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:01,720
where it's, like, beautiful, but also

2515
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:03,720
everyone's insane.

2516
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:05,720
You know? God, I'm so

2517
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,720
fucking immature. There are still...

2518
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,720
I read them out most of the time,

2519
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,720
but there are still times where I fear death.

2520
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,720
I need... I need to...

2521
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,720
I think it's... I think it's

2522
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:17,720
fair to fear death, but it's just, like,

2523
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:19,720
it's going to

2524
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,720
come unless we can... unless

2525
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,720
we have techno-singularity within

2526
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,720
our lifetime, which I used to... that was the

2527
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,720
only thing that kept me away from fearing death

2528
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,720
before, was, like, oh, man,

2529
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:31,720
I don't have to be afraid because

2530
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,720
maybe, like, according to certain

2531
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,720
projections, I might upload my consciousness

2532
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,720
to a computer, but then, like, all the stuff

2533
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,720
about that also informs you, like, hey, just so you

2534
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,720
know, if you upload your consciousness collectively,

2535
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,720
like, you cease to exist.

2536
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,720
You just become... Right, you know,

2537
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,720
you're just gonna melt into

2538
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,720
the sea of information, and you, as a personal identity,

2539
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:51,720
is no longer real, so it's...

2540
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,720
I've pretty much given up hope.

2541
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:55,720
Like, if I happen, my consciousness gets saved

2542
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,720
in my lifetime, that's great, but I'm not gonna

2543
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,720
back yet. I'm expecting to die.

2544
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,720
I mean, how would you bank on that?

2545
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:03,720
I'm not. I'm not.

2546
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,720
Well, that's a good idea.

2547
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,720
Well, like, what would you do differently?

2548
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,720
What would you do differently at all

2549
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,720
if you thought that one day your consciousness

2550
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,720
was going to get in trouble?

2551
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,720
If one could live one's life differently,

2552
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,720
if you were banking on the expectation that you

2553
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:21,720
would live forever, as opposed to expecting

2554
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:23,720
to die and have to pass on, like,

2555
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:25,720
your information memetic legacy,

2556
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,720
as opposed to your physical presence

2557
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,720
in the world, you know? You know what's made me comfortable

2558
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:31,720
with death is that, like, I used to always say,

2559
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,720
like, I want to upload my consciousness to a computer

2560
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,720
and live forever, and people always ask, like, well,

2561
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,720
what would you do if you live forever? Wouldn't you get bored?

2562
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:39,720
And I'd be like, no, there's endless new information,

2563
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,720
there's endless new art, but now that I've

2564
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,720
recognized that basically all art is exactly

2565
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,720
the same, and that it's, like, all basically sending

2566
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,720
the same message, it's like, oh, well, I don't care

2567
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,720
about consuming all of it anymore, like, you know?

2568
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:51,720
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of overlap for sure.

2569
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,720
Yeah, so, not to mention the fact that...

2570
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,720
You start to see the patterns. I imagine

2571
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,720
as you get older and you see more and more art,

2572
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,720
you start to see the patterns, it starts to look like,

2573
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,720
it starts to be, like, cipher, looking at the code

2574
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,720
of the matrix, you know? You see

2575
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:05,720
the code behind it, and it just gets less

2576
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:07,720
and less engaging, and then

2577
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,720
you die. So, it's all good.

2578
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,720
I think a lot of what keeps us going is

2579
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,720
the wonderment of discovery of the world.

2580
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,720
Like, I'm currently going through

2581
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:17,720
the phase in my life right now, where I am

2582
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,720
in wonderment at discovering the pleasures of

2583
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,720
adulthood, which are the pleasures of childhood

2584
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,720
are, like, a freedom

2585
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,720
to do whatever you want with little to no

2586
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,720
consequences, and have other people worry about

2587
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,720
the details. The pleasures of adulthood are

2588
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,720
taking ownership of your life and

2589
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,720
taking control of your own destiny, and, like,

2590
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,720
steering your ship where it wants to go.

2591
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:37,720
But, like, once you've done that, there's

2592
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:39,720
really, like, you, that's pretty much everything

2593
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,720
there is. Like, you could become, like, an

2594
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,720
adventurer or whatever. You could travel

2595
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,720
to far distant places. But it takes constant effort to make it

2596
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,720
happen, and that's the excitement of it. Is that, like...

2597
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,720
I mean, yeah, that's right.

2598
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,720
It is the journey. It is about the journey.

2599
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,720
Our brains, you know, stop

2600
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,720
growing pretty much by word 25

2601
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,720
or 27 or whatever. Like, I really

2602
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,720
think that our ideas really are going

2603
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:01,720
to calcify in our brains.

2604
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,720
And, like, things like, like,

2605
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,720
all the crazy stuff going on with, like, gender

2606
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,720
these days, and pushing, like, norms

2607
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,720
from, from olden times and all that stuff.

2608
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,720
Like, that all could be 100%

2609
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,720
exactly, like, in 100 years, we'll

2610
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:15,720
look back and be, like, this is exactly

2611
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,720
what we needed. It was 100% moral. But, like,

2612
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,720
everyone alive today, you know, most people,

2613
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,720
the youngest generation is coming up,

2614
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:23,720
they're just, like, those people are, like, yeah,

2615
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,720
this is what we need to do. We're going to push towards this.

2616
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:27,720
And the older people, through no fault of their own,

2617
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:29,720
are just scared and confused.

2618
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,720
And, like, really, I don't think

2619
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,720
those people, many of them, will actually

2620
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,720
change. So, if everyone became immortal,

2621
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,720
these ideas just might calcify

2622
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,720
and we'd stop here. I think that's why

2623
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,720
death and the next generation is a

2624
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,720
valuable cycle to keep, to keep happening.

2625
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,720
I write about this towards the start

2626
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:47,720
of my book that I was saying how, like,

2627
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:49,720
I don't like it, but I agree.

2628
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,720
I was saying, like, I know there's lots of people

2629
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,720
who want to live alone and who might be pursuing

2630
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,720
immortality so that they themselves

2631
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,720
can have more impact. And I'm, like, you know,

2632
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,720
I think that's fine if you really are

2633
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:01,720
a brilliant mind, maybe we could use you

2634
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,720
around for a little longer. But, like, as soon

2635
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,720
as your ideas become dogmatized,

2636
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:07,720
they need to go. Because, ultimately...

2637
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,720
In 200 years. Like, ultimately,

2638
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,720
until the moment that we can say

2639
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:13,720
we escaped entropy,

2640
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,720
there is no reason to stop

2641
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:17,720
evolving. Like, there's no reason to ever

2642
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:19,720
say we have all the answers, we know

2643
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:21,720
what's going on, we know what to do.

2644
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,720
Like, if we're still in the

2645
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,720
universe, if we're still here not

2646
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,720
escaping the inevitable heat

2647
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,720
death of it, then, like, we will

2648
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,720
die out unless we have found that way.

2649
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,720
There's a final boss to be defeated, for sure, still.

2650
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:35,720
And even if it might not even be the

2651
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,720
final boss, like, it's the last one we know

2652
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,720
about, you know, maybe when we get out.

2653
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:41,720
Right. We don't know how it

2654
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:43,720
could be turtles all the way down, but, like,

2655
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,720
until we have escaped entropy,

2656
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,720
we have no reason to stop

2657
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:49,720
because otherwise, like, we will die.

2658
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,720
Like, eventually.

2659
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:53,720
Agreed. I love that expression

2660
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:55,720
trilogy all the way down. It's like, I don't

2661
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:57,720
remember who told me, like,

2662
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,720
recently, I've been recently hearing that

2663
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,720
there was a story written by

2664
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:03,720
Terry Pratchett.

2665
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,720
Yeah.

2666
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,720
Terry Pratchett was who I was written by.

2667
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:09,720
Gib says to Terry Pratchett

2668
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,720
Discworld.

2669
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:13,720
But the story was specifically that

2670
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,720
he was doing a talk explaining the origin

2671
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,720
of the world and how it functioned

2672
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:19,720
stuff, and then afterward, a woman comes

2673
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:21,720
up to him, at least, this is the story

2674
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:23,720
of the story.

2675
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:25,720
I don't remember if it was with you guys

2676
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,720
or with Biter.

2677
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,720
Or afterward, a woman comes up to him.

2678
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:31,720
At least, this is the story that I've heard.

2679
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,720
And says, like, excuse me, I appreciate the talk,

2680
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:35,720
but I want to let you know you've been wrong

2681
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:37,720
about everything. The entire world is, in fact,

2682
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,720
on the back of a turtle.

2683
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,720
No, no, but that doesn't make any sense.

2684
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:43,720
Why would he be giving a talk about...

2685
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:45,720
I'm reading it. I don't know.

2686
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:47,720
No, I'm reading it right now on Wikipedia.

2687
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,720
Turtles all the way down is an expression

2688
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,720
of the problem of infinite regress.

2689
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:53,720
The saying eludes the mythological idea of a world turtle

2690
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:55,720
that supports the earth on its back.

2691
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,720
It's an even larger turtle, which itself

2692
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,720
is part of a column of increasingly large

2693
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:01,720
turtles that continues indefinitely.

2694
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,720
It's literally what I'm talking about.

2695
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,720
It says the origin of the phrases on

2696
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,720
Sir. The world turtle also referred to

2697
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:09,720
as the cosmic turtle. The word bearing turtle

2698
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:11,720
is a mythime, myth theme,

2699
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:13,720
that seems to be the word myth and meme

2700
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,720
combined, similar

2701
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,720
to that of the world elephants,

2702
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,720
encouraged in Hindu mythology,

2703
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,720
Chinese mythology, and mythologies of indigenous

2704
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,720
people of the Americas.

2705
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:25,720
So I guess it's just come up

2706
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:27,720
in a lot of different cultures.

2707
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,720
Many 20th century

2708
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:31,720
attribution claim William James is the source

2709
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,720
of the phrase. James referred to the fable

2710
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,720
of the elephant and tortoise several times,

2711
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:37,720
but told the infinite regress story with rocks

2712
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,720
all the way down in his 1882

2713
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,720
essay, Rationality, Activity, and Faith.

2714
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:43,720
I didn't even realize that this phrase

2715
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,720
actually was about the thing I was

2716
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,720
actually talking about.

2717
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,720
I had no idea it was so specifically about it.

2718
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:51,720
What did you think it meant?

2719
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,720
I just thought... It sounds pretty abstract.

2720
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:55,720
Yeah, I didn't realize

2721
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,720
it was literally about the idea

2722
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:59,720
that the world is resting on top

2723
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:01,720
of a bigger world and all that.

2724
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,720
Yes? Stephen Hawking

2725
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:05,720
Stephen Hawking wrote

2726
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,720
the story about the old woman

2727
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,720
in his 1988 book, A Brief History of Time,

2728
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:11,720
so that might

2729
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:13,720
have popularized. That's probably the story I was trying to...

2730
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:15,720
Okay, and this is weird.

2731
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,720
In his telling of

2732
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:19,720
the parable of the old woman

2733
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,720
saying turtles all the way down,

2734
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:23,720
he says that some say

2735
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:25,720
that it was Bertrand Russell who the old

2736
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:27,720
woman said it to, but that's

2737
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,720
very wishy-washy.

2738
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:31,720
Why would he say that?

2739
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,720
Maybe he thought this was a real story,

2740
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,720
and maybe it is a real story?

2741
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:37,720
Okay, wait, we're splitting hairs.

2742
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,720
It's all bullshit.

2743
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,720
It's turtles all the way down, dude.

2744
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,720
I really love that expression, though.

2745
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:45,720
The mental image I get

2746
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:47,720
is adorable, honestly.

2747
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,720
It's a lot of turtles.

2748
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,720
I've always just pictured the Ninja Turtles

2749
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,720
on each other's backs.

2750
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,720
What is scary

2751
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,720
phrase all the way down?

2752
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:59,720
But to where?

2753
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:01,720
I just mentioned that.

2754
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,720
I'll stack up like these adventure

2755
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,720
time-esque-style turtles

2756
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:07,720
with these really simple faces.

2757
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,720
It's just adorable little turtles.

2758
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,720
I've heard the phrase, I think

2759
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,720
in philosophy class, there was the phrase

2760
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:15,720
bugs all the way down, which is not

2761
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:17,720
really about the

2762
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:19,720
what the Earth is resting on.

2763
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,720
It's about matter.

2764
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:23,720
It's the idea that matter is infinitely

2765
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,720
reducible, that you've got cells,

2766
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,720
and then cells are made of molecules, and atoms.

2767
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,720
And then it's like, oh, Adam's quarks,

2768
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:31,720
quarks, gluons, and then

2769
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:33,720
smaller and smaller things they're

2770
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:35,720
divisible into.

2771
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:37,720
Is it fair to think of the Procrastinators

2772
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,720
as a science fiction podcast?

2773
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,720
Sometimes, sure.

2774
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:43,720
We get into futurism talk every episode,

2775
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,720
like, that's science facts.

2776
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,720
That's true.

2777
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:49,720
Hey, Ben, I'm re-watching No Game, No Life,

2778
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:51,720
and it's awesome.

2779
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:53,720
Yeah, explain to me.

2780
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,720
The part about the sun.

2781
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,720
Yeah, tell me.

2782
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,720
Or the part about the strong.

2783
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,720
No, the electromagnetic force, the strong force.

2784
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:03,720
Okay, so I've got the columns force

2785
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,720
is what we're talking about.

2786
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:07,720
In No Game, the color force.

2787
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,720
Columns force, columns force.

2788
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:11,720
Oh, Coulombs, the Coulombs force.

2789
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,720
Yeah, Coulombs law, yeah.

2790
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,720
Okay, what is this? Please explain.

2791
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:17,720
So, okay, in No Game, No Life,

2792
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:19,720
episode 6.

2793
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,720
There's this part, or maybe 5.

2794
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:23,720
No, it's episode 6. There's a part with the main character

2795
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:25,720
and this...

2796
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,720
I guess I'll describe her as like an angel.

2797
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,720
She's like an all-over.

2798
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:31,720
A very powerful being.

2799
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:33,720
She creates this simulated world

2800
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:35,720
where they're playing a game of sherry-tory

2801
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,720
where every time

2802
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,720
one person says a word,

2803
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,720
that thing will come into existence

2804
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:43,720
and then the next person says a word

2805
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:45,720
and whatever they say disappears from existence.

2806
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:47,720
And so they go back and forth

2807
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,720
creating and destroying

2808
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,720
either physical objects or concepts.

2809
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:53,720
And the idea is that

2810
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,720
the main character,

2811
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,720
because he knows words from...

2812
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:59,720
because it's an Isekai show and he knows

2813
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,720
words from our world that the person

2814
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,720
he's talking to doesn't know what they mean

2815
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,720
and she just kind of ignores the words

2816
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:07,720
that she doesn't know what they mean.

2817
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:09,720
Like he summons an atom bomb.

2818
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:11,720
The first thing he does is summon an atomic bomb

2819
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,720
and that's what causes her to

2820
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,720
put them inside of a force field kind of situation

2821
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:17,720
where basically anything can happen.

2822
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,720
They can die in this game

2823
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,720
but it'll all be fine.

2824
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:23,720
So what he does is

2825
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,720
he removes the crust of the earth

2826
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:27,720
and the mantle

2827
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:29,720
and everything but the core

2828
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:31,720
before eventually removing the lithosphere

2829
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:33,720
and when he does that they start free-falling

2830
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:35,720
towards the center of the earth.

2831
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:37,720
But as they're falling it's like

2832
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,720
who will fall faster

2833
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,720
and die first and they keep removing concepts

2834
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:43,720
and eventually he removes

2835
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:45,720
Coulomb's force from the universe.

2836
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:47,720
Coulomb's force.

2837
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,720
It's the electromagnetic force.

2838
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:51,720
And I guess essentially

2839
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:53,720
what Coulomb's force is is that

2840
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,720
well I mean if you look it up on Wikipedia

2841
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:57,720
it's called Coulomb's force.

2842
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:59,720
Or Coulomb's law.

2843
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:01,720
Guys what the hell is this?

2844
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:03,720
Explain it.

2845
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:05,720
It's a force that is holding things

2846
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:07,720
in place I guess

2847
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:09,720
like without it

2848
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:11,720
everything just collapses in on itself

2849
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:13,720
and becomes a supernova I guess.

2850
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,720
Yeah it's electromagnetic.

2851
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:17,720
So does he immediately die when he does this?

2852
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,720
That's what holds atoms together.

2853
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:21,720
What happens is he does that and then everything

2854
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:23,720
starts getting like more rapidly sucked

2855
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,720
into the sun and because

2856
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:27,720
the person he's fighting is falling

2857
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:29,720
is closer to it than he is

2858
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,720
she dies first.

2859
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,720
What exactly happens when he removes Coulomb's law?

2860
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,720
I forget.

2861
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:37,720
It just all super collapses.

2862
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:39,720
The whole universe folds in on itself basically.

2863
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,720
Does the sun collapse into a black hole or something?

2864
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:43,720
Yeah well okay and that's true

2865
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:45,720
that's cool and that would happen.

2866
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:47,720
The thing that bothers me though is that their bodies

2867
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,720
would have just ceased to exist.

2868
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,720
I thought when I was watching the scene

2869
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,720
as soon as the Earth's lithosphere

2870
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:55,720
disappeared I thought well

2871
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:57,720
wouldn't they just die right here

2872
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:59,720
instantly?

2873
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:01,720
Yeah they'd be in the vacuum of space.

2874
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,720
The way the scene progresses is awesome

2875
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:05,720
but you have to make certain exceptions.

2876
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:07,720
It is awesome but there's no

2877
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:09,720
getting around the fact that if the

2878
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,720
electromagnetic force were just gone

2879
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,720
then all the atoms in your body would just fly

2880
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,720
apart. Maybe they're protected because

2881
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:17,720
they're in this force field? Maybe it didn't affect them?

2882
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:19,720
I don't know.

2883
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,720
I don't know.

2884
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:23,720
That's the reason I brought it up because

2885
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:25,720
I had heard Ben talk about how

2886
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:27,720
simultaneously this scene is why

2887
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,720
he loved the show but also that

2888
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:31,720
he had a bunch of problems with it.

2889
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:33,720
That's why I wanted to run it by him again.

2890
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:35,720
I really like the show but I also hate the show.

2891
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:37,720
What do you hate about it?

2892
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:39,720
I love everything about the show.

2893
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:41,720
I really like the idea behind the

2894
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,720
concepts and the whole game shtick

2895
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:45,720
but the thing is with the games

2896
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:47,720
they sort of like

2897
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:49,720
in a way I do like that they make up the rules

2898
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:51,720
as they go but at the same time there's no

2899
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:53,720
bases.

2900
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,720
They just pull stuff out of their ass

2901
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,720
that was the best game.

2902
01:54:57,720 --> 01:54:59,720
That was my favorite.

2903
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:01,720
The thing about the games in the show

2904
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,720
is that

2905
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,720
all of them have

2906
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:07,720
rules that can just be exploited

2907
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:09,720
in ways that

2908
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:11,720
make them more complicated than

2909
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,720
a simple game would be.

2910
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,720
For instance in the first arc they're playing a game of chess

2911
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:17,720
but the idea is that

2912
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:19,720
the pieces have a will of their own

2913
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:21,720
so as long as you communicate with the pieces

2914
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,720
and you can inspire them

2915
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:25,720
they basically just do anything.

2916
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:27,720
They don't have to move on the board

2917
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:29,720
the way that you instruct them to.

2918
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:31,720
I like the whole idea and the concepts

2919
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:33,720
and stuff like that. It's been a while since I watched it

2920
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:35,720
so this is just an impression that's lasting

2921
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:37,720
so I could be wrong.

2922
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:39,720
I like that.

2923
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:41,720
I like those sort of things

2924
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:43,720
but

2925
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:45,720
it's kind of like

2926
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:47,720
the you you heart of the card sort of

2927
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:49,720
bullshit sometimes.

2928
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:51,720
With the heart of the cards

2929
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:53,720
it's like

2930
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:55,720
he literally just gets the luck of the draw

2931
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:57,720
he just believes in himself a lot

2932
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,720
and gets the right card.

2933
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,720
It's a little hard to put it into words

2934
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,720
because I like the sort of

2935
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,720
randomness at the same time

2936
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:07,720
it could be

2937
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,720
a bit smarter

2938
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,720
and work within the rules it established.

2939
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:13,720
I don't think it ever breaks its own rules.

2940
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:15,720
I don't agree.

2941
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:17,720
I don't think there is any

2942
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:19,720
that the chess solution breaks any of the rules.

2943
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:21,720
I'm not talking about the chess

2944
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,720
specifically. It started well

2945
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:25,720
and I think it just sort of

2946
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:27,720
I don't remember. I think it escalated a bit.

2947
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,720
I don't know.

2948
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:31,720
Please make it your anime suck.

2949
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:33,720
No game. I need to re-watch it.

2950
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:35,720
It was a long time ago.

2951
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,720
I'm in the process of watching it

2952
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:39,720
so I know exactly

2953
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,720
what happens and how I can defend it all

2954
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:43,720
because a major

2955
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:45,720
a big part of the theme of the show

2956
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:47,720
how they win all their games

2957
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:49,720
is just by understanding that

2958
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:51,720
in a deterministic universe

2959
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:53,720
everything has a logic behind it.

2960
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:55,720
You can always analyze

2961
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:57,720
there is no such thing as luck.

2962
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,720
There's no such thing as pure chance

2963
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:01,720
because there's always reasons

2964
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:03,720
that things would happen the way they do.

2965
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:05,720
Just like how you can count cards

2966
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,720
to cheat the odds in Blackjack.

2967
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:09,720
Used as an example

2968
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,720
of a basic way that

2969
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:13,720
as long as you can predict probabilities

2970
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,720
the idea of

2971
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:17,720
the metaphor of the

2972
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:19,720
No Game No Life universe is that

2973
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,720
it's just the exact same as real life

2974
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:23,720
except that people are beholden to

2975
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:25,720
these certain rules

2976
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:27,720
that basically

2977
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:29,720
the rules that already

2978
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,720
apply in the real world

2979
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:33,720
except that people have to follow them

2980
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,720
there's just certain things

2981
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:37,720
you cannot kill people in this world

2982
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:39,720
because God himself has written a rule

2983
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,720
that you can't kill people

2984
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,720
forced to not do the thing

2985
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:45,720
Right. So like whereas in the real world

2986
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,720
people can act against their

2987
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:49,720
best interest and even if

2988
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:51,720
everyone plays the game correctly

2989
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,720
someone can just kill you

2990
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:55,720
in this world you can't

2991
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,720
so like if you can play

2992
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:59,720
the game the best you will win

2993
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:01,720
like is the way the world works

2994
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:03,720
and so that's why the main characters

2995
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:05,720
are taken there because they are the best at games

2996
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:07,720
and whereas in the real world

2997
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:09,720
that does not help them because they are

2998
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:11,720
just two relatively powerless

2999
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:13,720
average Japanese teens

3000
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:15,720
by going to a world where being the best

3001
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,720
at games means you are God

3002
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:19,720
they can be God

3003
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:21,720
is essentially what the show is about

3004
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:23,720
One more thing I have an issue with it

3005
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:25,720
and this one I know

3006
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:27,720
you won't be able to change my mind no matter what

3007
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:29,720
but this is a matter

3008
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,720
of taste so I'm

3009
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,720
willing to accept it but I really dislike how

3010
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:35,720
I don't mind

3011
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:37,720
fan service a lot of the time

3012
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:39,720
but in this show

3013
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:41,720
I hate how they sort of

3014
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:43,720
stop the flow

3015
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:45,720
of the story just to have the scenes

3016
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:47,720
with those fan services and it's very

3017
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:49,720
very obnoxious

3018
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:51,720
the fan services

3019
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:53,720
is part of the message to me

3020
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:55,720
I think it's a big... I'm writing a video

3021
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:57,720
I'm writing a huge video about No Game No Life

3022
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:59,720
so I'll talk about all of this

3023
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,720
but I think

3024
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:03,720
the fan service is important to

3025
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,720
what the message of the show is

3026
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,720
I won't get into it

3027
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:09,720
I'll save it for my video

3028
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:11,720
let's save all of this for another time when I'm not here

3029
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:13,720
let's do all of that

3030
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:15,720
that sounds great

3031
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:17,720
let's go to questions for Christ's sake please

3032
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:19,720
no

3033
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:21,720
I want to talk about that I got really drunk last night

3034
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:23,720
in my discord

3035
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:25,720
in Ben St's Hellfire hand

3036
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:27,720
I had a fucking bone to dig deep in

3037
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:29,720
and we got really drunk

3038
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:31,720
and I vommed

3039
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:33,720
and I puked for the first time and forever

3040
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,720
I don't remember going to bed

3041
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:37,720
but I just remember being over my toilet

3042
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:39,720
forcing myself to puke

3043
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:41,720
which is something that I never ever do

3044
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:43,720
and it was great

3045
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:45,720
and I feel wonderful this morning

3046
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,720
well that's good

3047
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:49,720
and you know what the best part is

3048
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:51,720
a little bird told me

3049
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:53,720
wait no it's not

3050
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:55,720
it is there's no carbs in it

3051
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:57,720
that's horseshit there's like

3052
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:59,720
because alcohol itself

3053
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:01,720
the chemical alcohol

3054
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:03,720
it has calories

3055
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:05,720
but it doesn't have it's not carbs

3056
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:07,720
oh really?

3057
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:09,720
Ben

3058
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,720
I understand that you have a

3059
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:13,720
homestuck book club going on

3060
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:15,720
in your server would you like to explain

3061
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:17,720
to the class

3062
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:19,720
oh yeah

3063
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,720
I do not have a homestuck book club

3064
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:23,720
but there is a homestuck book club

3065
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:25,720
I'm just endorsing it

3066
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:27,720
monetarily and spiritually

3067
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:29,720
you'll be hearing from our lawyer Ben

3068
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:31,720
you'll be hearing quite

3069
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:33,720
an earful

3070
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,720
look

3071
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:37,720
I just think anything

3072
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:39,720
my ownership of

3073
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:41,720
reading homestuck will not be

3074
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,720
besmirched

3075
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:45,720
that ever was written or ever will be written

3076
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:47,720
and that is homestuck and I think that that can only be

3077
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:49,720
a good thing and I support it wholeheartedly

3078
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:51,720
whenever you go to homestuck.com

let's go to the questions

3092
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:19,720
yeah I can't wait

3093
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:21,720
before the questions

3094
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:23,720
about the contest thing maybe mentioned to people

3095
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:25,720
oh right thanks for reminding me

3096
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:27,720
alright guys so you know

3097
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:29,720
you'll be hearing this a week since the last episode

3098
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:31,720
which was the final deadline closing

3099
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,720
for the PCP theme contest

3100
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:35,720
so just to review

3101
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:37,720
it's closed, it's done, you're finished everyone

3102
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:39,720
it's over for you

3103
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:41,720
we are planning to have

3104
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:43,720
the announcement as to the winner next episode

3105
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:45,720
so one week from today

3106
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:47,720
you should be hearing who the new

3107
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:49,720
PCP theme will be

3108
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:51,720
and it'll be glorious, it'll be grand

3109
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:53,720
and we'll probably announce

3110
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:55,720
I think we do like a top 3 announcement

3111
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:57,720
and then we'll just be like

3112
02:01:57,720 --> 02:01:59,720
one is but a bang

3113
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:01,720
and that'll be that, yeah it'll be fine

3114
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:03,720
we'll make it fine, we'll make it real fine

3115
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:05,720
don't worry guys it won't suck like everything else

3116
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,720
right off the top I got a question I can just answer

3117
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:09,720
real quick because this person

3118
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:11,720
Vale asked with the formless format

3119
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:13,720
seemingly being here to stay is there a PCP topic

3120
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:15,720
that you would have wanted to do a PCP-centric episode on

3121
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:17,720
guys the topics are not

3122
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:19,720
gone

3123
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:21,720
the goal conceit here is that

3124
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:23,720
we were making up topics

3125
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:25,720
just for the sake of having a topic

3126
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:27,720
because we almost never have

3127
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:29,720
a natural topic for the show

3128
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:31,720
so if we ever had a topic

3129
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:33,720
we had an idea for we would just do that

3130
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:35,720
topic immediately

3131
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:37,720
that's gonna be it

3132
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:39,720
so no need to fear whenever there's something real important

3133
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:41,720
we wanna talk about we will

3134
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:43,720
I have a pity question here

3135
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,720
it's from Alex Siebel

3136
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:47,720
on Twitter who was one of the contest

3137
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:49,720
one of the submitted us

3138
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:51,720
one of our two songs I think for the contest

3139
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:53,720
he asks

3140
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:55,720
how was pokemon go community day for y'all

3141
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:57,720
I personally was sad about playing alone

3142
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:59,720
but got 15 shinies so that's cool

3143
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,720
also to randoms going through the hashtag

3144
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:03,720
for some reason my trainer code is

3145
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:05,720
652622648067

3146
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:11,720
I know you won't read it on the show

3147
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,720
fuck you Alex

3148
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:15,720
there you go

3149
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,720
anyway I wanted to read it

3150
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:19,720
and it was lame it was suck

3151
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:21,720
it was suck

3152
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:23,720
you got like 15 eebies didn't you

3153
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:25,720
and then I just saw Eevee over and over again

3154
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:27,720
there's no special move

3155
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:29,720
for the eeveelutions

3156
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:31,720
yeah there was

3157
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:33,720
yeah there is last resort

3158
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:35,720
well ok but Gib is reporting that he met real

3159
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:37,720
locals families

3160
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:39,720
it was sick he got a register

3161
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:41,720
I got a register as well

3162
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:43,720
just the word community

3163
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:45,720
I don't have one

3164
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:47,720
he would endorse that Nazi

3165
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:49,720
I don't care about any of the shinies

3166
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:51,720
I don't care about Eevee

3167
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:53,720
I don't care about the shinies either

3168
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:55,720
I still need an umbrella and an espion

3169
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:57,720
I was glad to do it because when they release

3170
02:03:57,720 --> 02:03:59,720
gen 4 there's going to be two new eeveelutions

3171
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,720
and it's going to be hard to get them

3172
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:03,720
so now I've got enough candies that I can get that leafeon

3173
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:05,720
and glaceon

3174
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:07,720
I missed it because I don't understand how event days work

3175
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:09,720
and how they're

3176
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:11,720
I missed it because I understand everything

3177
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:13,720
I didn't know it was like a 3 hour window

3178
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:15,720
bullshit

3179
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:17,720
it's going on right now

3180
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:19,720
is it too late? can I go?

3181
02:04:19,720 --> 02:04:21,720
no it's going on to 5pm today

3182
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:23,720
I'm probably going to do it right after

3183
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:25,720
I must away

3184
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:27,720
actually I had

3185
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:29,720
so I was walking around

3186
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:31,720
and it was like 5 minutes before the end

3187
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:33,720
and I was catching

3188
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:35,720
there was a cluster of eevees

3189
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:37,720
oh I got a magmar and a ray

3190
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:39,720
I got my first magmar

3191
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:41,720
that's cool

3192
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:43,720
I'm standing on the corner

3193
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:45,720
I'm on the campus of Tufts University

3194
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:47,720
and this guy

3195
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,720
he sees me playing

3196
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:51,720
and he's a very

3197
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:53,720
autistic looking gentleman

3198
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:55,720
and he sees me

3199
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:57,720
and we just kind of nodded each other

3200
02:04:57,720 --> 02:04:59,720
and it's raining and he kind of comes over

3201
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:01,720
and he's like can I borrow your umbrella

3202
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:03,720
and so I was like yeah sure

3203
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,720
so it was like alright here you go

3204
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:07,720
so we stayed dry for a minute caught the last eevees

3205
02:05:07,720 --> 02:05:09,720
and we were just shooting the shit for a second

3206
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:11,720
and he was like oh there's a machamp

3207
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:13,720
there's a machamp raid over there

3208
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:15,720
but it's only 4 minutes left

3209
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:17,720
and I was like oh shit we can make it

3210
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:19,720
so we ran over to this machamp

3211
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:21,720
we fought this machamp raid, got him a champ

3212
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,720
it had a terrible moveset, whatever

3213
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:25,720
and then we just bummed around

3214
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:27,720
and tried trading

3215
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:29,720
we traded eridactyls with each other

3216
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,720
we got lucky eridactyls

3217
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:33,720
oh is that a thing?

3218
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:35,720
yeah yeah

3219
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:37,720
it's cheaper to boost

3220
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:39,720
it's not a thing necessarily of higher eevees

3221
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:41,720
because we did a bunch of couple

3222
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:43,720
well maybe it does I don't know

3223
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:45,720
okay fine

3224
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:47,720
shut up

3225
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:49,720
and then we

3226
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:51,720
yep so I got a lucky eridactyl

3227
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:53,720
and that was my community day

3228
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:55,720
one fun thing that actually didn't happen

3229
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:57,720
is I was walking down

3230
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,720
down bubble

3231
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:03,720
and then

3232
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:05,720
being the cleanly man that I do

3233
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:07,720
the saint of

3234
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,720
prestige

3235
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:11,720
there was a homeless woman

3236
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:13,720
there was a frankly disgusting

3237
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:15,720
dirty pig pin

3238
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:17,720
garbage pail kid of a woman

3239
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:21,720
with her husband

3240
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:23,720
her groveling husband

3241
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:25,720
and her pukestane children

3242
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:27,720
and she came up to me

3243
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:29,720
and she held on tightly to my shirt

3244
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:31,720
and she begged me she got on all fours

3245
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:33,720
she got on all eights

3246
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:35,720
fine little legs

3247
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:37,720
she's a succubus she's a spider

3248
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:39,720
and she asked me she begged me

3249
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:41,720
please please can we please trade

3250
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:43,720
rare pokemon

3251
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:45,720
she begged me for rare pokemon

3252
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:47,720
and I had to capitulate

3253
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:49,720
and so I gave this family

3254
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:51,720
this wife I gave this wife

3255
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:53,720
a Mr. Mime

3256
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:55,720
named Mr. Meme

3257
02:06:55,720 --> 02:06:57,720
she gave me an unknown

3258
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:59,720
and after that she was satiated

3259
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,720
and she went off to pawn off

3260
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:03,720
to steal another person's rare pokemon

3261
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:07,720
I think you got the short end

3262
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:09,720
of the stick in that trade

3263
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:11,720
but I mean

3264
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:13,720
also by the way in case you couldn't tell

3265
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:15,720
a woman asking if she wanted to trade

3266
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:17,720
the other day and that's what happened

3267
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:21,720
so here's a light hearted

3268
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,720
question that everyone is sure to have

3269
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:25,720
straightforward opinion on

3270
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:27,720
Pato today asked what do you think of abortion

3271
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:29,720
good

3272
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:31,720
oh it's great

3273
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:33,720
pretty all four

3274
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:35,720
in any context

3275
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:37,720
it's acceptable

3276
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:39,720
cool

3277
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:41,720
prove to me that that baby's life matters

3278
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:43,720
because I don't think it does

3279
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:45,720
that's where I objectively truly stick

3280
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:47,720
I mean I don't think that it's sentient

3281
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:49,720
and is worthy of moral consideration

3282
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:51,720
and so I'm fine with it being destroyed

3283
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:53,720
that's how I feel

3284
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:55,720
next question

3285
02:07:55,720 --> 02:07:57,720
if you died and had a charity foundation

3286
02:07:57,720 --> 02:07:59,720
created in your name

3287
02:07:59,720 --> 02:08:01,720
wait what did mage say? I'm curious about her opinion

3288
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:03,720
I said I didn't even get the answer

3289
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:05,720
but my opinion is

3290
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:07,720
I guess yeah

3291
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:09,720
with uncertain circumstances

3292
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:11,720
that's fine

3293
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:13,720
all circumstances

3294
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:15,720
a certain point it becomes

3295
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:17,720
more of a sentient being

3296
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:19,720
and that's no

3297
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:21,720
I've heard stories

3298
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:23,720
horror stories of women getting pregnant

3299
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:25,720
just so they can do abortions

3300
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:27,720
what?

3301
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:29,720
I think

3302
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:31,720
there were like

3303
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:33,720
some like

3304
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:35,720
nutcase ratfemme sort of people

3305
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:37,720
yeah

3306
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:39,720
that's fucking

3307
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,720
I'm surprised I had never conceived of that

3308
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:43,720
but I'm not I guess I shouldn't be

3309
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:45,720
surprised anyway

3310
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:47,720
if you died and had a charity foundation

3311
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:49,720
created in your name what would you have them do

3312
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:51,720
terrorism

3313
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:53,720
oh

3314
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:55,720
plain and simple terrorism

3315
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:57,720
a charity foundation

3316
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:59,720
I would create

3317
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:01,720
they would be a nonprofit

3318
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:03,720
museum and they would only

3319
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:05,720
show art made on the internet

3320
02:09:05,720 --> 02:09:07,720
from people ages like

3321
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:09,720
8 to 17

3322
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:13,720
okay listen that's fine

3323
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:15,720
that's good but mine is the most important one

3324
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:17,720
and it will save society

3325
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:19,720
my charity foundation would be

3326
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:21,720
help nerds get laid

3327
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:23,720
and what it would be

3328
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:25,720
and it would do everything in its power

3329
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:27,720
to see that young men were quick

3330
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:29,720
to seduce sexy young women

3331
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:31,720
women are fine they don't have to worry about it

3332
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:33,720
it's fine they can fuck anyone

3333
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:35,720
don't worry about it

3334
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:37,720
so they would be dating education

3335
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:39,720
that's exactly what it would be

3336
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:41,720
that's exactly what it would be

3337
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:43,720
my charity would probably be for like

3338
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,720
animal shelters

3339
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:47,720
that's a good one

3340
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:49,720
yeah because

3341
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:51,720
I don't like that

3342
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:53,720
all I gotta say about animals is

3343
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:55,720
when we leave the universe

3344
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:57,720
when we escape entropy

3345
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:59,720
why are we not taking animals

3346
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:01,720
they didn't earn it

3347
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:03,720
because there aren't

3348
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:05,720
they aren't a sin to you

3349
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:07,720
do you think they would take us

3350
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:09,720
I don't care about what they

3351
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:11,720
would take us

3352
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:13,720
I want to see elephants

3353
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:15,720
I'm gonna take the elephants

3354
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:17,720
we can fit them in

3355
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:19,720
we can create new elements

3356
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:21,720
we can just invent better

3357
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:23,720
elephants later

3358
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:25,720
we can just test to create

3359
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:27,720
cooler elephants

3360
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:29,720
I don't want to go there

3361
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:31,720
let's move on

3362
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:33,720
you're typing a lot of things

3363
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:35,720
if you want to join in just start recording

3364
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:37,720
that's fine dude you ain't getting paid

3365
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:39,720
but you can contribute

3366
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:41,720
alright

3367
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:43,720
I had a question I liked this one a lot

3368
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:45,720
it was just at Gergerad

3369
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,720
what was your first experience

3370
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:49,720
with being a depraved individual

3371
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:51,720
um

3372
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:53,720
I love that I like that one a lot

3373
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:55,720
define depraved individual

3374
02:10:55,720 --> 02:10:57,720
I think it's kind of a personal question

3375
02:10:57,720 --> 02:10:59,720
yeah when I turned on that fabled game

3376
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:01,720
Undertale I knew

3377
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:03,720
does he mean like when did you realize

3378
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:05,720
you were a depraved person

3379
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:07,720
I mean he said what was your experience

3380
02:11:07,720 --> 02:11:09,720
with being a depraved

3381
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:11,720
the first like the start

3382
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:13,720
of your slide into depravity

3383
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:15,720
was the first time I ever fucked an inanimate object

3384
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:17,720
I knew

3385
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,720
I mean honestly that's also my example

3386
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:21,720
that's also my example

3387
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:23,720
it's that weird time that I weirdly figured out

3388
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:25,720
how to masturbate in the back of

3389
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:27,720
the minivan

3390
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:29,720
at the end of a soccer game

3391
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:31,720
it was extremely freakish

3392
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:33,720
it was just when I learned what masturbating was

3393
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:35,720
that's what it was

3394
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:37,720
yeah it was really gross

3395
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:39,720
what's weird about that

3396
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:41,720
I don't fuck my club

3397
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:43,720
I mean like we're

3398
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:45,720
I was in public technically

3399
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:47,720
if that is not depraved

3400
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:49,720
like do any of us actually do anything

3401
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:51,720
that is depraved

3402
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:53,720
like obviously none of us are depraved by our own standards

3403
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:55,720
like if we're all like

3404
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:57,720
comfortable with ourselves and what we do

3405
02:11:57,720 --> 02:11:59,720
like I stole like a candy bar

3406
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:01,720
probably at one point in my life from somewhere

3407
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:03,720
like I probably did that I stole a donut from

3408
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:05,720
stop and shop once years ago

3409
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:07,720
I guess that's depraved

3410
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:09,720
I got pregnant just to have an abortion

3411
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:11,720
okay that's depraved

3412
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:13,720
that's what I would think of as depraved

3413
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:15,720
and I haven't done anything like that

3414
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:17,720
so yeah I don't think I have either

3415
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:19,720
sorry sorry

3416
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:21,720
oh you know what no

3417
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:23,720
I have a much better example

3418
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:25,720
it's the time that I made Victor put his face in the toilet

3419
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:27,720
oh no

3420
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:29,720
what the fuck

3421
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:31,720
that is depraved

3422
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:33,720
because growing up I just tortured Victor

3423
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:35,720
by making him do things

3424
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,720
because he's very easy to emotionally

3425
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:39,720
and so like

3426
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:41,720
I probably just like

3427
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,720
I probably told him something

3428
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:45,720
we used to fight all the time about who would do the dishes

3429
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:47,720
because like my dad would always get mad

3430
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:49,720
that the dishes weren't done when he got home

3431
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:51,720
and but neither of us ever wanted to do it

3432
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:53,720
and we would try to like cycle between us

3433
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:55,720
and like have a chore chart and everything

3434
02:12:55,720 --> 02:12:57,720
but neither of us would do it so we would just fight

3435
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:59,720
for like an entire hour and not end up doing it

3436
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:01,720
before he got home usually what would happen

3437
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:03,720
is he would get home and one of us would feel guilty

3438
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:05,720
and start doing it right then

3439
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:07,720
and usually it was him because he was more guilty than me

3440
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:09,720
so what I would do is I would just manipulate him

3441
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:11,720
by constantly being like oh you're gonna let dad down

3442
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:13,720
like oh dad's gonna be so upset

3443
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:15,720
he'd be like well why don't you care

3444
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:17,720
I'm like I don't care you care

3445
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:19,720
so you do it

3446
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:21,720
and then I think at one time we struck some kind of deal

3447
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:23,720
where I was just like yeah I'll do the dishes

3448
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:25,720
if you fucking put your face in the toilet

3449
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:27,720
and like you know gotta do that

3450
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:29,720
yeah probably not

3451
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:31,720
oh

3452
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:33,720
we had these fights like every night for years

3453
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:35,720
like over who would do

3454
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:37,720
like ex chore

3455
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:39,720
because we were just both

3456
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:41,720
so lazy and like

3457
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:43,720
we would get into physical altercations

3458
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:45,720
over it you know

3459
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:47,720
yeah this is not a hard thing but I understand the sentiment well

3460
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:49,720
I felt it as well

3461
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:51,720
the very very

3462
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:53,720
sorry go ahead

3463
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:55,720
the most depraved thing that I can think of

3464
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:57,720
is a spotty memory I have

3465
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,720
when I was like 12 I think

3466
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:01,720
where I

3467
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:03,720
was in my airplane I was flying towards the

3468
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:05,720
world trade centers to blow them up

3469
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:07,720
are you in an airplane right now

3470
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:09,720
someone made you talk

3471
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:11,720
so my auto can be deleted

3472
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:13,720
and then I'll go after you

3473
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:15,720
you sound like an airplane

3474
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:17,720
okay okay yeah okay so like

3475
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:19,720
I think the question was like what's the first

3476
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:21,720
or something like that depravity

3477
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:23,720
first experience with being a depraved

3478
02:14:23,720 --> 02:14:25,720
the first thing I remember

3479
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:27,720
that I would like

3480
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:29,720
considered being wrong but I just didn't give a damn

3481
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:31,720
was like I was like 7

3482
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:33,720
or maybe 6 or something

3483
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:35,720
like that in that ballpark so like

3484
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:37,720
me and this girl

3485
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:39,720
we were like playing

3486
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:41,720
and she had like a lot of cool toys and one

3487
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:43,720
of the cool toys was like a miniature little

3488
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:45,720
zebra toy and it was like

3489
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:47,720
sort of accurate realistic it wasn't like you know

3490
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:49,720
cutesy stylish or whatever it was

3491
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:51,720
realistic and I was all about I'm still

3492
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:53,720
all about those miniature little animal

3493
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:55,720
toys that are look realistic

3494
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:57,720
it's just I was my thing

3495
02:14:57,720 --> 02:14:59,720
and I loved it so much and

3496
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:01,720
okay and

3497
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:03,720
then like few days later

3498
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:05,720
I was walking back

3499
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:07,720
home and I saw on the ground

3500
02:15:07,720 --> 02:15:09,720
that little zebra toy

3501
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:11,720
and it was just laying on the ground I picked it up

3502
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:13,720
I was like oh it belongs to her I should return

3503
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:15,720
it and then I sort of like

3504
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:17,720
paused and I thought

3505
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:19,720
you know if she didn't care enough to take care

3506
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:21,720
of you she doesn't deserve you

3507
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:23,720
so I kept it

3508
02:15:23,720 --> 02:15:25,720
good logic I would have done the same thing

3509
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:27,720
I might actually

3510
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:29,720
still have it though probably not

3511
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,720
actually you know what

3512
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:33,720
I would have done the same thing for the same reason

3513
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:35,720
there was that time that I

3514
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:37,720
kicked Ben in the stomach for literally no reason

3515
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:39,720
because I wanted to see him suffer that's what I wanted

3516
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:41,720
you like drop kicked me

3517
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:43,720
we were lying weirdly I know I've told this before

3518
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:45,720
we're like we're just lying like

3519
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,720
heads on opposite sides of the couch

3520
02:15:47,720 --> 02:15:49,720
and I just lifted my foot and just dropped it

3521
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:51,720
directly into Ben's stomach for no

3522
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:53,720
reason because I felt

3523
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:55,720
like watching a man ride in agony

3524
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:57,720
that's what I felt like doing in that moment

3525
02:15:57,720 --> 02:15:59,720
I felt the moment

3526
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:01,720
I regret it intensely

3527
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:03,720
the time I felt the most depraved

3528
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:05,720
is Ben you witnessed this

3529
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:07,720
I was thinking of this on the show before

3530
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:09,720
when I abstained

3531
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:11,720
from drinking soda for like several months

3532
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:13,720
and then when I was in Georgia

3533
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:15,720
at a wing stop

3534
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:17,720
this was like the most

3535
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:19,720
impulse thing I didn't have no control

3536
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:21,720
over my body in this scenario

3537
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:23,720
I was just putting like I was putting my cup

3538
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:25,720
in the trash and like within

3539
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:27,720
the span of like two seconds I had

3540
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:29,720
like jerked my hand from

3541
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:31,720
the trash can I had stuffed my

3542
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:33,720
because the trash can was right next to like the soft

3543
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:35,720
you know soft drink like pour your thing

3544
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:37,720
I had stuffed it in like a Fanta

3545
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:39,720
orange soda I had

3546
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:41,720
poured one sip I had swigged that one sip

3547
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:43,720
and then I had slammed the cup into the trash

3548
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:45,720
as hard as I possibly could

3549
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:47,720
and then I walked out thinking like what did I just do

3550
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:49,720
was that a dream and like am I awake right now

3551
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:51,720
like was I in control like did I actually just do that

3552
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:53,720
it was like

3553
02:16:53,720 --> 02:16:55,720
it was like my burger dream

3554
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:57,720
and I walked out

3555
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:59,720
and you were like hey what were you doing

3556
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:01,720
I was just like I've done something terrible

3557
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:05,720
I've sinned

3558
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:07,720
I remember you broke your ass

3559
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:09,720
I'm back on that by the way right now

3560
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:11,720
I've been going for like a month

3561
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:13,720
you threw it all away

3562
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:15,720
Kaze told us that you guys were trying to like

3563
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:17,720
be health boys

3564
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:19,720
that's a way to do it man

3565
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:21,720
no I'll never do that

3566
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:23,720
hey by the way post foods going strong

3567
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:25,720
it's going well

3568
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:27,720
I'm drinking it right now

3569
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:29,720
what is post food again

3570
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:31,720
well I'm drinking this this lovely concoction

3571
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:33,720
called huel

3572
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:35,720
it's like uh it's like uh soylent

3573
02:17:35,720 --> 02:17:37,720
the show is turning into a fucking huel ad

3574
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:39,720
week by week I just love huel

3575
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:41,720
what does it taste like

3576
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:43,720
tell me because it mostly just tastes like oats

3577
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:45,720
it tastes like like an oats puree

3578
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:47,720
it's not it's not bad

3579
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:49,720
strawberry oats

3580
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:51,720
paradox crocs asks

3581
02:17:51,720 --> 02:17:53,720
what is the thing that's changed about you most

3582
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:55,720
in the last two or three years

3583
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:57,720
post food baby

3584
02:17:57,720 --> 02:17:59,720
I'm on that huel train everyday

3585
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:01,720
I would say

3586
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:03,720
my answer is uh

3587
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:05,720
caring less and less about myself

3588
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:07,720
and more about other people

3589
02:18:07,720 --> 02:18:09,720
like just just gradually losing

3590
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:11,720
interest in myself and in like

3591
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:13,720
and like

3592
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:15,720
I feel like I spent I had so much focus

3593
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:17,720
on the idea that like no one had understood

3594
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:19,720
the true me and like

3595
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:21,720
now not only do I feel like

3596
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:23,720
people are close enough that I don't that it's

3597
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:25,720
fine but also just that like the true

3598
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:27,720
me is not that interesting and that

3599
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:29,720
like you know it's like

3600
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:31,720
it's like it only needed to be like it needed to be

3601
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:33,720
glimpsed as long as

3602
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:35,720
somebody saw it and understood it that was all that

3603
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:37,720
mattered it wasn't like I had to perform it all the

3604
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:39,720
time it's not like the things I was doing

3605
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:41,720
were so genius that like I had to

3606
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:43,720
like my unique art had

3607
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:45,720
to be out there in the world it's just like as long as

3608
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:47,720
someone got it that it was all

3609
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:49,720
down that Asian obliteration

3610
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:51,720
the self for like the past year

3611
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:53,720
I know it's been

3612
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:55,720
great it's kind of my whole identity

3613
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:57,720
now it's the east

3614
02:18:57,720 --> 02:18:59,720
I mean I've been I've

3615
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:01,720
considered myself like a Taoist ever since

3616
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:03,720
I was like 14 so like

3617
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:05,720
I've been on this path

3618
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:07,720
you know I've been on the Alan Watts

3619
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:09,720
mind train for like

3620
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:11,720
the last decade but

3621
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:13,720
basically I am

3622
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:15,720
lo-fi hip-hop is what I'm trying to say

3623
02:19:15,720 --> 02:19:17,720
I'd say for me

3624
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:19,720
the biggest change

3625
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:21,720
started with my resolution

3626
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:23,720
to like do me a math of a stuff

3627
02:19:23,720 --> 02:19:25,720
it's a redoubling of

3628
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:27,720
my efforts to actually succeed

3629
02:19:27,720 --> 02:19:29,720
in a business and like

3630
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:31,720
economic and like actual life sustaining way

3631
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:33,720
at like

3632
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:35,720
YouTube stuff that's been that was a pretty

3633
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:37,720
big change like decided to me a math

3634
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:39,720
which was inspired by a lot of people

3635
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:41,720
but yeah I mean like that and the whole

3636
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:43,720
we Agua stuff and the way I'm

3637
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:45,720
constantly I'm really focusing on trying

3638
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:47,720
to recajigger my life so I can actually

3639
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:49,720
make it

3640
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:51,720
I don't know if you can accurately

3641
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:53,720
tell what has changed about

3642
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:55,720
you or maybe I'm just not self aware

3643
02:19:55,720 --> 02:19:57,720
to do so but

3644
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:59,720
yeah it's hard

3645
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:01,720
to say what what what have I

3646
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:03,720
much I'll tell you what I think has changed

3647
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:05,720
about you because like I mean

3648
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:07,720
when when I at

3649
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:09,720
the second or third brony con we were at

3650
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:11,720
like you were so out

3651
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:13,720
of control that I

3652
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:15,720
felt the need to keep more distance

3653
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:17,720
from you because of the

3654
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:19,720
fact that I thought like if I have him around

3655
02:20:19,720 --> 02:20:21,720
all the time it will be very exhausting

3656
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:23,720
and about a year later you had changed

3657
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:25,720
enough and like matured enough

3658
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:27,720
that I no longer felt that way and that's why

3659
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:29,720
I wanted you in the PCP

3660
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:31,720
so I would say that you've just become somebody

3661
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:33,720
who's figured out that

3662
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:35,720
if you scare people away

3663
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:37,720
then they will

3664
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:39,720
you know like if you try to just be

3665
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:41,720
constantly freak flag flying

3666
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:43,720
like oppressing people with your presence

3667
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:45,720
then they will not want you around

3668
02:20:45,720 --> 02:20:47,720
and you have decided to care about that

3669
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:49,720
the way I would feel like this is

3670
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:51,720
you can scare someone in an instant

3671
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:53,720
you can scare someone in about

3672
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:55,720
like 0.8 seconds

3673
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:57,720
it takes no effort at all to scare people

3674
02:20:57,720 --> 02:20:59,720
but to terrify someone you have to sink

3675
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:01,720
your claws then that's the long

3676
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:03,720
game if I want to terrify you guys

3677
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:05,720
it's going to be a two or three years

3678
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:07,720
at least

3679
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:09,720
I was glad

3680
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:11,720
I'm glad that's the

3681
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:13,720
and I'm Keto now

3682
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:15,720
that's all that's changed

3683
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:17,720
for me it's like

3684
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:19,720
if I want to shine in a positive light

3685
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:21,720
I guess I could say like

3686
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:23,720
I'm more about defining

3687
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:25,720
the boundaries between me and people

3688
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:27,720
but if I wanted to be either honest

3689
02:21:27,720 --> 02:21:29,720
or in a more negative light I think I've become

3690
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:31,720
paranoid not too much

3691
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:33,720
but like a few years ago

3692
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:35,720
back in the pony days I would be like

3693
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:37,720
oh everyone's my friend hello everyone

3694
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:39,720
I shall call you friend but then

3695
02:21:39,720 --> 02:21:41,720
I realized the sort of

3696
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:43,720
like the amount of

3697
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:45,720
sort of pressure and weight the word

3698
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:47,720
friend really has

3699
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:49,720
and I sort of stopped

3700
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:51,720
calling every single person I've talked

3701
02:21:51,720 --> 02:21:53,720
to once or twice a friend

3702
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:55,720
because like

3703
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:57,720
when you call someone a friend so

3704
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:59,720
easily

3705
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:01,720
I still have a bad habit of sort of like

3706
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:03,720
people like really clicked

3707
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:05,720
and I talk to them like once or twice

3708
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,720
but we really click I sort of end up calling

3709
02:22:07,720 --> 02:22:09,720
them a friend that's

3710
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:11,720
you gotta get into the word buddy

3711
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:13,720
I do a lot of like

3712
02:22:13,720 --> 02:22:15,720
if you listen to my videos you hear a lot of me like dodging

3713
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:17,720
like I'll say things like friend of the show

3714
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:19,720
or my buddy or our pal

3715
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:21,720
or things like that like I really want

3716
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:23,720
to be protective of like the word friend

3717
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:25,720
because people do put a lot of power on it

3718
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:27,720
and when you start calling someone your friend publicly

3719
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:29,720
then they are going to like latch on to that

3720
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:31,720
and be like oh I am this person's friend

3721
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:33,720
and like I suppose

3722
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:35,720
pragmatically other people may then

3723
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:37,720
hitch your wagon to theirs if let's say

3724
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:39,720
this person does some things that you don't

3725
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:41,720
approve of I mean yeah I usually

3726
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:43,720
call people acquaintances or

3727
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:45,720
friendos like friendos is

3728
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:47,720
my catch all for like everyone

3729
02:22:47,720 --> 02:22:49,720
sort of like interact with

3730
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:51,720
friendlet they're all friendlets to me

3731
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:53,720
you're all

3732
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:55,720
you're all mere friendlets before me

3733
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:57,720
I don't know if this is the biggest change in my life

3734
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,720
per se but this is definitely a change that I've noticed

3735
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:01,720
where I've shifted away

3736
02:23:01,720 --> 02:23:03,720
I don't know if like I don't think these are like

3737
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:05,720
mutually exclusive but I've definitely

3738
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:07,720
moved away from

3739
02:23:07,720 --> 02:23:09,720
wanting to be friends with funny people

3740
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:11,720
to be friends with smart people

3741
02:23:11,720 --> 02:23:13,720
I definitely value being

3742
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:15,720
you know smart more than I value being funny

3743
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:17,720
at this point I think

3744
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,720
it reminds me of that highly intellectual

3745
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:23,720
comedy thing that Bobby

3746
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,720
Hill was learning in that one episode

3747
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:27,720
of King of the Hill

3748
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:31,720
Tartuffe

3749
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:33,720
the spry wonder dog

3750
02:23:35,720 --> 02:23:37,720
I think I want to be friends

3751
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:39,720
with funny people and smart people

3752
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:41,720
but I would be friends with someone who was smart

3753
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:43,720
but not funny but if someone was

3754
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:45,720
funny but fucking stupid

3755
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:47,720
I don't think I'd want to be their friend

3756
02:23:47,720 --> 02:23:49,720
I think wit takes a certain kind of

3757
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:51,720
funny if they like to like

3758
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:53,720
give people wedgies for example

3759
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:55,720
and laugh at that

3760
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:57,720
if they open fire

3761
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:59,720
in public places

3762
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:01,720
then I think that would be pretty funny

3763
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:03,720
it would take a certain amount of emotional intelligence

3764
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:05,720
I think that humor is

3765
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:07,720
subjective and I think like

3766
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:09,720
I value

3767
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:11,720
a sense of humor

3768
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:13,720
what's the word

3769
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:17,720
a sense of humor that we share

3770
02:24:17,720 --> 02:24:19,720
I don't remember the proper word for it

3771
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:21,720
but like if we can share a similar

3772
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,720
something like that

3773
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:27,720
if we share the sense of humor

3774
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:29,720
I really value that because if you can have

3775
02:24:29,720 --> 02:24:31,720
a good time and a good laugh with a person

3776
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:33,720
it's a lot easier to get along with them

3777
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:35,720
and understand them and that's very

3778
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:37,720
important in any sort of relationship

3779
02:24:37,720 --> 02:24:39,720
to be able to share the sense of humor

3780
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:41,720
because when you talk to someone

3781
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:43,720
someone cracks a joke and you don't understand it

3782
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:45,720
it's very easy to take offense

3783
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:47,720
and start seeing the person in a very

3784
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:49,720
different sort of negative light

3785
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:51,720
you might find them obnoxious, annoying

3786
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:53,720
and that can build up to negative emotions

3787
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:55,720
that's fair

3788
02:24:55,720 --> 02:24:57,720
this reminds me of a classic line

3789
02:24:57,720 --> 02:24:59,720
from one Sam Hyde

3790
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:01,720
it's from some very popular

3791
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:03,720
YouTube video called like

3792
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:05,720
Sam Hyde gives great life advice

3793
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:07,720
and Sam Hyde says

3794
02:25:07,720 --> 02:25:09,720
I'm friends with stupid people

3795
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:11,720
with smart people, with assholes

3796
02:25:11,720 --> 02:25:13,720
with really nice people

3797
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:15,720
because you can be friends with all of them

3798
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:17,720
in different ways but it's when those people

3799
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:19,720
become vacuums in your life

3800
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:21,720
in whatever way

3801
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:23,720
when they start to like drain life from you

3802
02:25:23,720 --> 02:25:25,720
in whatever way they happen to do so

3803
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:27,720
that's when you know it's like

3804
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:29,720
this person is not going to work out long

3805
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:31,720
and you don't make a big stink about it

3806
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:33,720
you don't write them a big letter

3807
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:35,720
like dude, I think we're really fucked up

3808
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:37,720
what you did, I'm not going to hang out with you anymore

3809
02:25:37,720 --> 02:25:39,720
you simply slowly let these relationships

3810
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:41,720
fade in time

3811
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:43,720
especially younger people think of a friend

3812
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:45,720
as like someone who you want to spend all of your time with

3813
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:47,720
and like for me

3814
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:49,720
I think that you can have categories of friends

3815
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:51,720
who are like this is my friend

3816
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:53,720
for when I'm doing this

3817
02:25:53,720 --> 02:25:55,720
that's what, when you look at like

3818
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:57,720
for instance, you might have

3819
02:25:57,720 --> 02:25:59,720
someone like a hiking buddy

3820
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:01,720
this is a guy who I don't really have anything in common with

3821
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:03,720
other than we both like hiking

3822
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:05,720
but when I want to go hiking

3823
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:07,720
with someone, this is my guy

3824
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:09,720
because like the two of us

3825
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:11,720
it's not simply a matter of you both like it

3826
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:13,720
but that you engage with it the same way

3827
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:15,720
like maybe you have other friends

3828
02:26:15,720 --> 02:26:17,720
who would love to go hiking with you

3829
02:26:17,720 --> 02:26:19,720
but they're not going to take it seriously

3830
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:21,720
or they're not going to have the

3831
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:23,720
they're not going to try to reach the top

3832
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:25,720
or they're not going to be as efficient

3833
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:27,720
and so you want to go hiking with this guy who hikes

3834
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:29,720
like you hike

3835
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:31,720
and so even if you have nothing else in common

3836
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:33,720
it's like you can still think of him as

3837
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:35,720
your hiking buddy

3838
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:37,720
it's funny, I'm watching May play Persona 3

3839
02:26:37,720 --> 02:26:39,720
is about

3840
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:41,720
the different categories of relationships

3841
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,720
that you have and how they, you know

3842
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:45,720
because you have different personas

3843
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:47,720
no person is just one identity

3844
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:49,720
you have different things you care about

3845
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,720
that you can have people

3846
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:53,720
different folks for different strokes

3847
02:26:53,720 --> 02:26:55,720
exactly, that's a perfect phrase

3848
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:57,720
there you go

3849
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:59,720
well, it's a little reversed but fair enough

3850
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:01,720
what she said made sense

3851
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:03,720
in this context

3852
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:05,720
different, yeah

3853
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:07,720
whatever, it doesn't matter

3854
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:09,720
are we done? I think we're done guys

3855
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:11,720
May, did you want to comment?

3856
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:13,720
no, no, no, this is fine

3857
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:15,720
I'm good, I'm fucking great

3858
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:17,720
I got nothing else to say to any of you freaks

3859
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:19,720

3860
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:21,720
