00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Hey, hey, hey, hello everybody and welcome back to Rickstie Minutes. I'm the best guy ever and this is Digibro.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Hey, I don't give a fuck, bitch. What's this? Episode 9?

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
This is episode 9 of season 3. That's right, my dude.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Awesome.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,500
The ABCs of Beth. The ABCs of Beth.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
This is our first, man, this is a game changer. And then in some ways, there's a game changer here.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is probably one of my favorite episodes of the show.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I thought you might go that way. That's interesting. That's interesting.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Because this was probably the biggest core plot development we've gotten in outside of the Council of Rakes and all the sci-fi stuff for the home life.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is the biggest development we've gotten since the first TV episode.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Absolutely correct. You know what's interesting? I think I'll probably have a slightly different interpretation of that about that same exact idea.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But why don't you tell us about it, did you? What went down?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, basically we learn about Beth's past and exactly who she is, which is something I think this show, I don't know if it's ever done a really great job of characterizing Beth.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I couldn't agree more. I couldn't not agree more.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've always liked her, but she's always been kind of in the background.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The main focus has always been her relationship with Jerry and how that changed her.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But this is the first time we learned exactly what she would be without Jerry or who she was before that.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The thing about Beth is that while Beth was a better person, a more interesting person than Jerry,

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
her entire character arc depended upon Jerry and Jerry is the worst.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So in what way could we possibly care about Beth considering that's the crux of her character.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
There was just no way. There was just no way.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And that was a problem I was feeling throughout this season, which is that with them finally having broken up, Beth has not had much to do.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She's just kind of been on this downward spiral of being weird.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Most of the times we cut to her, she's just being fucking weird.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But then in this episode, we get context into that weirdness that maybe she's just always been a fucking weirdo.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Maybe dating Jerry was just a way of putting on a facade of normalcy in her life.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I feel like they were building to this episode with this season so far. I think that was inevitable.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, I think if we were to sort of figure out why in terms of her characterization, why this is.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, I would say it's because Jerry is gone. She no longer feels this need to, I don't know, be a placated mom kind of dude, I guess.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Something like that. I honestly feel like that's giving it maybe a little bit more credit than it deserves.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But nonetheless, I certainly enjoyed what we've seen transposed, fucking happened this episode.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's the word I meant to say, happened.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Transpire.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's the word I was looking for. Thank you.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, yeah, this is an episode about, really, it's a, what was the B plot?

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Right, Jerry.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Jerry and the fuck.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Fuck this alien girl.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Which was hilarious.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He was fucking her. He was fucking her. He knew she had two vaginas. That's cool. That's cool.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I like, that was a great subplot, but obviously the less relevant half of the episode.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Of course.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So, basically, we learn this interesting back and forth that Rick was, in many ways, a terrible father.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But also because he, like, I guess from a young age, he had already corrupted Beth to be just as bad.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Or she just naturally is, she's pretty, she, as he put it, you were a scary fucking kid.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And everything she ever wanted from him was stuff to make people like her.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But it's very apparent that the reason she had those issues was, like, out of abandonment issues over her father.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But, like, to this extreme degree that is clearly, like, something's wrong with her.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No doubt. No doubt.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You know?

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Like, it's not just the daddy issues.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Those are, like, just the catalyst for releasing what is already psychopathy.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, it kind of seems that way.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Though I kind of want to give her a break on that a little bit, because I really do feel like, I don't know,

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I really do want to attach it to, oh, okay, you know what, I don't want to give her that much of a break,

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but I really want to come down on Rick for just being clearly the worst.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Because all the things that he, when he goes through, they go through, like, this, not montage,

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but he just pulls out from this toolbox all the things he had made for, all these, like, crazy, goofy devices that, like, a child might want.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And then they get, like, darker, just, like, a sentient switchblade.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Like, okay, that's kind of weird, why would you want that?

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But, um, like, those are things I could really see most kids asking for,

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
but the thing is, parents know better than to give their children them.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And they know, no, that's when you have to be a parent to tell them no.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And, like, I almost want to blame it fucking all on Rick.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't really know how responsible that is.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You have to say it's all his fault, because he's the fucking parent.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
She was a kid.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like, and obviously he was just placating her because, like, I can easily imagine that Rick, in the brief moments he was around his daughter,

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
she would ask him for something and he would churn it out in a couple of seconds, hand it to her and fuck off.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And be like, this is enough, you know?

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Which is why he creates an entire other universe for her, which she grows up to believe is, like, was just in her imagination.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, that was good.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He creates a whole world for her to enjoy.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And, like, it's really, I really love the scene of Rick, like, going through this world and, like, explaining about how, like, carefully he constructed it to be perfect for her.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That was one of the best things in the episode.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I loved it.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, that it's just such a weird, like, obviously he's at fault here.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Obviously this is all a bad idea and Beth is right, but he really did try his hardest.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Like, he did the best that Rick could as a broken, terrible man to make a perfect place for his daughter.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But just the attention to detail, I mean, like, that is something that I absolutely would have noticed that, like, well, okay, dude, so, okay, you made the grounds squishy great,

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
but there's a river right there, she could easily drown.

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But no, it's fucking breathable water, it's not a problem.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He thought of all, like, the reasonable things.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And the only problem is that, you know, like, a kid lived there for a million years and fucked the whole place up.

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So, well, the biggest problem is that the entire conceit is wrong.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, you know, it's no way to deal with your children problems.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's like if somebody, like, didn't, wait, I'm trying to think of a good analogy here.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Like, if you wanted to build a better toilet and instead you built, like, the greatest sink in the universe,

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
like, it doesn't help the problem that you need to shit, you know?

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, I suppose.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's kind of what he's done here, is, like, the problem is that she needs her dad,

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
not that she needs this, it doesn't matter how perfect you made it,

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
it doesn't matter that you were the most considerate person in the world about how you designed this place.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was the wrong thing to make in the first place.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Very true, very true.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And that's sort of the argument between them, and I thought that was really great.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, Rick, Rick should take some more responsibility, I think.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But on the other hand, so basically all their grievances are like from when she was a kid,

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
these days she's a pretty together person, for the most part, until she has some of these moments later on,

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
where she really, she lets the facade fall away and she embraces her monster mode, which I enjoyed.

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I mean, I think that's probably the real reason she's been with Jerry all this time,

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
because now that we're looking at it from this lens of, because we've seen that in the alternate universe,

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
where Beth and Jerry weren't together, they both become way more successful,

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
but they also go insane and go down like a crazy rabbit hole of depravity and end up together anyways.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
In this episode, we get the sense that if Beth had never had Jerry around, would she ever have gotten anyone?

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's the only reason she ever got someone to be around her, because he was so weak-willed

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
that he could put up with the fact that she's an insane person.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Here's this woman who's like a psycho bitch, and who would possibly want to be with her other than the weakest man in the world,

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and there's a reason they were together for so long.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
She's afraid to have to be by herself, because we see now what happens.

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If she doesn't have Jerry, she ain't exactly getting out there in the dating pool and making new friends.

114
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
She's just being a fucking insane person in her house, building statues out of hoops and shit.

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And of course, there's just the practical fact that she got knocked up, and then had some kids,

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and that's going to fucking weigh you down.

117
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, that too.

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I was just before we recorded this, I was watching a video by a guy called The Matching Ties Network

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
called Harman and Jerry and Rick.

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He was basically creating the idea that Dan Harman writes a ton of himself into Rick and Jerry,

121
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and apparently in between seasons two and three of Rick and Morty,

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
he married his longtime girlfriend and got divorced in the span of about three months,

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and up until the start of season three, the way Beth and Jerry's marriage was always portrayed

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
was that they weren't just staying together for the kids.

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There was other reasons. There was this deeper connection between them.

126
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There was some destiny shit going on, a little bit.

127
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But then you start season three and they immediately get divorced,

128
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and so I have to wonder if this is also Dan Harman exploring his own divorce in this season.

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What an excellent point, and I think it probably is.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's interesting to see that change in mindset that maybe by the end of the season

131
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
we'll find out that they do need to get back together, who knows.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Maybe they'll just keep exploring being separate for seasons on end

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and we'll just have this broken home that we're following,

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
which honestly is kind of a great idea.

135
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
How many sitcoms have we seen about a dysfunctional but still together family?

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What if we just have a show about a family that's broken up

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and everyone's slowly getting jaded to crazy space adventures?

138
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We're at a point now where Jerry is dating an alien of his own accord.

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Was it just me or was that...

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I mean, I know that the Earth had been enslaved by aliens,

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but they're basically all gone and it's just human society again

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and we're pretty much ignoring that.

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But there's just an alien and nobody gives a fuck.

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is just common now. This is the life everyone's involved with.

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Did they go... When they ate with the alien, was that the same diner

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
that we went to not only in the last episode

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
when Rick had to kill the alien that wanted to die,

148
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but also the start of the season when they were just in a family diner?

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Is it the same diner?

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No, no, no, no. That was a different one.

151
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That was Chonies, Chauncees. That was definitely a different one.

152
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This place was, what do they say, Mexican something?

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No, this is like a Japanese place.

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No, okay, that was different because that place was like...

155
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It was like a taco place.

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Right, there was sushi here.

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, that's right.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You should know that. You're the biggest.

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There's a lot of restaurants in the fucking...

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
in Rick and Morty now that I think about it.

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's true.

162
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And you hate restaurant scenes. God damn it, this is the worst.

163
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Zero out of ten.

164
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is exposition, yes.

165
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But no, it's great.

166
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Jerry's subplot with the alien chick was fucking hilarious.

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It was pretty good.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's just such a Jerry...

169
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, what made it work for me was the fact that Jerry has telekinetic powers as a result of this.

170
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Which is fucking...

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That moment when they walk into his house and he just like...

172
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Not only is everything nice, but he has telekinetic powers.

173
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I was just like, whoa, hold on.

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I love that. I loved how they rolled with it.

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But I must admit, I thought there would be like...

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The other shoe would drop on that somewhere in the episode

177
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and just was never mentioned again.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Never came up again.

179
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I don't know, it wasn't that big a deal, but I did expect something.

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Whatever, who cares.

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That was great though.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why didn't he use it to help on the hunt?

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Why didn't he fight with psychic powers?

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Maybe he wasn't getting enough pus.

185
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He didn't have enough juice left, he wasn't getting enough.

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They were hunting too much.

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
After they feast, they hunt, and then they hunt to celebrate their hunts.

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This episode had so many fucking zingers in it, man.

189
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't even know where to begin, but there's a few that I can remember.

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'd have to watch the episode again and write them all down to get all the great ones.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But two of my favorites, at the beginning of the episode,

192
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
when Beth says something about the generation gap,

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and Summer's like, our generation gets traumatized for breakfast.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, that's the one.

195
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That was great. That was a dope summer line.

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, which is totally accurate.

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And then later on when they're chastising Jerry about how they say,

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
they're like, we chose mom, we made that very clear to you,

199
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
both at the breakup and in your weird Facebook post,

200
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
the comments of your long Facebook post or whatever.

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That was great.

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Because it creates, you can imagine a whole other scene

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that's left out of the show of them going on Facebook

204
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and seeing Jerry having typed this wall of text about the breakup

205
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
that no one cares about and them leaving angry responses.

206
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
This kind of shit happens in my family.

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Of course.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Someone gets upset and goes on a fucking Facebook tirade

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and everyone else blasts them in the comments of it.

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I've been through that particular drama, so it's too perfect.

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Blinds are like that, man.

212
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I know what you mean.

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The thing that was the funniest to me in this episode

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
was just how gross everyone was willing to be all the time.

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So first of all, there was just like the Jerry scene

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
where he wants them to know real explicitly

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
how much he's fucking this bitch.

218
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Is that relatable, did you?

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You gotta let everybody know how much you're fucking.

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Are you getting anything from that?

221
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay, anyway.

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But later on, the running joke of the dude in Fruppy Land,

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
just insisting upon explaining to everyone in extreme detail

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and displaying for them the fucking ritual of him impregnating

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
these fucking monsters and devouring the bodies.

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
His insistence upon explaining this to everyone

227
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
every fucking time, I laugh my ass off.

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That was the funniest thing this episode.

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What made that work for me so much is that like,

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
because Rick and Beth do that thing where they rapidly extrapolate

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that that's what's going on here.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
They immediately figure that out.

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, yeah, of course.

234
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
While I thought that line was funny because of just what they're saying,

235
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I was a little bit annoyed by the overly meta.

236
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
When this show does that thing where everyone's just too far ahead of the story,

237
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and I'm like, okay, they don't have to all be maximum nihilism 24-7.

238
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But then to then be explained over and over again made it way funnier.

239
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, it was fucking great.

240
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It was fucking great.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And he does it.

242
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He fucks it right in front of them.

243
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It has a baby and he eats it in front of them.

244
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Even Rick is like, dude, please stop.

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
No one, like, this is too much.

246
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't want to think about this happening.

247
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, it was great.

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
God, I fucking love it.

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I love that he just books right after that.

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He's like, all right, I'm done.

251
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That was fantastic.

252
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That was fantastic.

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, man.

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It was great that Rick, you know, again, like, he's a god.

255
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He just like, yeah, okay, I don't want to be here anymore,

256
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
so I'm leaving and then he does.

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And then Beth has to go and, you know, bumble fuck around

258
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and try to deal with the situation on her own.

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, it was great, man.

260
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It was great.

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Should we talk more about the Fruityland plots,

262
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
the whole, the things that went on there?

263
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah, it's an interesting, I love the,

264
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I guess it all really culminates in the moment

265
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
where Beth realizes that she is her father.

266
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yep.

267
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Because she, just as Rick will not take responsibility

268
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
for the fact that he made Beth this person,

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
she will not take responsibility for the fact

270
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
that she made Tommy this person.

271
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
True.

272
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
By pushing him into the honey.

273
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And all, all he wants is an apology

274
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and she would rather murder everyone

275
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
than give that apology.

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And yeah, and then she like realizes,

277
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
she kind of has an awakening moment of like,

278
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I need to stop lying to myself

279
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and admit I'm a fucking monster.

280
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah.

281
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Just like Rick, you know.

282
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Especially that coming right up to the scene

283
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
where she's like, no, I'm going to go prove

284
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
that I'm not a bad person, that I am a good person.

285
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And it's like, you just found out,

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
objectively not a good person.

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You're kind of a fucking monster.

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's great.

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's great.

290
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And I mean, they still rescue the dad

291
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
because they're like, you know,

292
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
we can do some good here.

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Like does the world really want Tommy back in it

294
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
at this point, considering what he is?

295
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No.

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They should have just left him there.

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Like fuck it.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Then again, would it be?

300
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They did just leave him there.

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They cloned him.

302
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I think she murdered him also.

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I mean, the guy's got to be dead, right?

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That was implied.

305
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I assume she killed the real Tommy

306
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and they cloned him into a new one.

307
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Of course.

308
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Of course.

309
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, that's fine.

310
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That plot line's resolved.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's all good.

312
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's all good.

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah.

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I also liked the, this was a very subtle detail

315
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
that I thought was really cool about Fruity Land.

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So like at one point, Rick's like talking about

317
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
like how, you know, how hard he worked to making,

318
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
how hard he worked to like make Fruity Land and stuff.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And like, you know, they use the magic chalk,

320
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
like chalk zone to like, you know, draw a thing

321
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and then walk in and make magic doorways and shit.

322
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I thought it was really cool that this is just one

323
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
of those subtle details.

324
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Like at one point he's just like,

325
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
ah, I collapsed a whole quasar to fucking

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and Beth just cuts him out like,

327
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
dad, I don't give a fuck about how you made it.

328
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Like just take me there.

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't give a fuck.

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And he's just like, ah, fucking bitch.

331
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And then like later on in the episode,

332
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
he's like, okay, you know, we left that guy's dead.

333
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Time to like pull the plug.

334
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And then he like, he makes a gesture as if he's going to like

335
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
snap the little piece of chalk thing that he's got.

336
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But then Beth stops him and I was just like,

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
hey, that's cool.

338
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Like, so that's, so basically we're learning that

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
it's a pocket dimension maybe contained within that thing.

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Or that's like some power source to it or something.

341
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know.

342
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I just thought that was a cool little detail.

343
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I liked it.

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Always in with the details in this show, man.

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yep.

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Lots of great, lots of great stuff.

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I love all the inventions that he gave Beth

348
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and how long they let that scene go on.

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

350
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Like he just lists this shit for so long

351
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and it was like each thing's funnier than the last.

352
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's one of those, it's one of those Andy Kaufman jokes

353
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
where they just keep going and the joke is that

354
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
it just keeps going and you need to get comfortable

355
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
with the fact that this is not stopping anytime soon.

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I think it, I think it worked really well

357
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
because I felt like it kept giving slightly different angles on it.

358
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Like it wasn't just Beth as a psycho.

359
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's like each item you can imagine it's particular use.

360
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This was a great way to like in, like in my mind,

361
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm crafting a flashback that is not actually being shown,

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
you know, and there's the stage play flashback,

363
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
which is also fucking hilarious.

364
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
They're just like literally describing what happened.

365
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Like in no uncertain terms.

366
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I think Rick's just criticizing the screenwriting.

367
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, that was great.

368
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That was great.

369
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I also really liked when Beth just walks back in,

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
you know, after covered in blood after killing everybody there

371
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and she walks in on Rick, you know, tune his guitar, do do, do do do

372
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and then later on he's like they do a musical montage

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
to the do do in my butt.

374
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh my God.

375
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The musical, that was the moment where the episode was like,

376
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
this is now one of my favorite of the show,

377
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
because we just have like, we have this really emotional dialogue

378
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and then the emotional montage is immediately do do in my butthole

379
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and I was like, done.

380
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
10 out of 10.

381
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Every daughter's a butthole in her dad's butt in one point in his life.

382
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, it was good shit, man.

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It was good shit.

384
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's kind of humor I can really resonate with.

385
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, that's my kind of humor, right?

386
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's what I come to Rick and Morty for.

387
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Everyone's always like, anyone who criticizes this show

388
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and they're like, ooh, it's just a guy burping

389
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and talking about nihilism, no.

390
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What makes Rick and Morty funny is the do do in my butt song.

391
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Agreed.

392
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That is like, the fact that they put that as the cherry on top

393
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
of the inner depth, you know,

394
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
that we get this beautiful episode with all this story

395
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
like fucking deep shit about the relationship of these characters

396
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and the big climactic sign off of it is the do do in my butthole song.

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's why I love this show.

398
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah.

399
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah, man.

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Which I barely heard the lyrics of because I was laughing over the entire time.

401
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I went back and listened to it again.

402
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah, it was fucking great.

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So let's talk about the ending.

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So after that scene that, you know,

405
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Beth's come to a realization that she's a fucking monster

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and Rick's just like, she's like, what should I do, Dad?

407
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You know, got no more excuses to hang around here.

408
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There's nothing to hold me here.

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What the fuck do I do?

410
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And Rick's like, fucking peace out, dog.

411
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Peace out.

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I will make you a clone.

413
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It will do everything that you did in your life.

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You got no attachments.

415
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You can be completely free.

416
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
No moral ramifications of any kind.

417
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What are you going to do?

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And then they don't answer it, but it's obvious.

419
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's obvious that she's gone.

420
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's okay.

421
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That was, yeah, it was a weird scene that they didn't show that because like,

422
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
it definitely feels super stilted when she comes back into the room.

423
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
She's acting like a clone.

424
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yep.

425
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Like she's acting.

426
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
She's acting a lot like the summer and Morty bots from episode two.

427
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Exactly.

428
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So I was thinking, okay, it's a clone.

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We're about to get the reveal, but then there is no reveal.

430
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And I don't know if that's just to trick us for now.

431
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Like, or just to leave the question unanswered.

432
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Like we won't really know unless we see Beth off somewhere else later.

433
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You know.

434
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I think that that is a almost guaranteed to happen.

435
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I just, okay, just like narratively as, as the narrative genius that I am,

436
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't see how they could get away with putting that in this episode

437
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and then not having to pay off like at some point in the future.

438
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I expected it to be at the end of the episode and like the after credits thing.

439
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's the thing.

440
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
If that's what they did this, I don't think there's ever been a time in this show

441
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
where they set up something like that, that didn't pay off within the episode.

442
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You know, I guess you could argue that.

443
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Evil Morty thing, but like that was a, that was like a setup for something later.

444
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So yeah, we all knew that.

445
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That was like, that was like an ending like clincher thing though.

446
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And like we never knew like what this, like what was going to be the relevance of that

447
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
until much later.

448
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This one, it just feels like, like the way that they ended the episode is clearly meant

449
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
to suggest, hey, she didn't clone herself, but then you have that or did she in your mind

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and like, I don't know, maybe it pays off next episode.

451
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If it doesn't pay off by the end of the season, I'm going to get real skeptical.

452
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But if they suddenly in season like four brought in this other Beth,

453
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
it would be a fucking pretty big sledgehammer to the face.

454
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I will say that.

455
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You know, I think it would be like, oh, you motherfuckers, you held off for that long.

456
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You know, my genre savvy-ness just to me, it almost gives me no way to believe

457
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
that they are, that she didn't leave.

458
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Knowing the show and knowing how these characters operate, I cannot imagine a world in which

459
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
they wrote it that summer or that Beth indeed stayed.

460
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And maybe that's how they're going to fuck guys like me over who think that we know everything

461
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
about the show.

462
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Maybe it'll happen because this show, I mean, there's no way that they just go with the

463
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
obvious thing on its face.

464
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Like there's that kind of show.

465
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And then there's a more complex show that would do something on top of it.

466
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And then there's like double triple layers on top of that where they could interweave

467
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
plots and double back on your expectations and totally surprise you out of nowhere.

468
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And Rick and Morty sometimes transcends to that level.

469
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And the biggest way they could defy all expectations is to indeed have Beth not leave after setting

470
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
up that whole scene.

471
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So we're just going to have to find out.

472
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I guess we've got nothing we can do.

473
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah.

474
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We'll see.

475
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And we will not be able to save 100% sure until the show is over.

476
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That's true.

477
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Even then.

478
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Even then.

479
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah.

480
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Even then it's up for debate.

481
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah.

482
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah.

483
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Well, I guess that's all I have to say about this episode.

484
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The ending gag was hilarious.

485
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It was.

486
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The fact that Rick went and fucked Jerry's girlfriend.

487
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh, that was the best part of it.

488
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
That was the best part.

489
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And yeah, the meta about like nobody uses answering machines before.

490
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You can keep it, whatever.

491
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Got to chuckle out of me.

492
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But I did have one final point I wanted to make about this episode.

493
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And it was just that.

494
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So you were quite positive about all this Beth development happening.

495
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I for one, as a portion of that.

496
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Okay.

497
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I felt a little bit deflated by this happening.

498
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And it's just because.

499
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Okay.

500
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So in this episode, we have Beth finally realizing things, all these things about Rick and herself

501
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
to be fair that we didn't know.

502
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But everything about Rick, we have all known since episode one.

503
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
There is nothing new on like the realization of this whole Rick situation.

504
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So to me, it's a little bit of a mixed bag only because this is something that had to happen

505
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
inevitably in order to make this character at all interesting, but because it took so long

506
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and it's been so much dead weight basically having this character along doing nothing for so long.

507
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Like it's happening now.

508
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's like, okay, great.

509
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But it's just like, okay, finally, finally, it's out of the way.

510
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's like a bowel movement.

511
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You know, it's finally gone.

512
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's out of the way.

513
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But man, that shit stinks.

514
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And but I'm glad it's beyond this.

515
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't know.

516
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I don't want to shed it too much.

517
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's just, I wish this had happened sometime sooner or that Beth had just been more interesting

518
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
leading up to this point in some way.

519
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah.

520
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But she really hadn't been.

521
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Honestly, I think if you went back, she was most interesting in season one.

522
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And definitely least interesting in season three.

523
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So like, I think the problem has really been with this season not finding anything to do with her

524
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
because it was so much more interested in exploring Jerry's side of the breakup up until this point

525
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and how the kids were dealing with it and just exploring Rick's being Rick, you know,

526
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
or doing weird stuff.

527
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I kind of feel like why wasn't this episode just earlier in the season in a way,

528
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
but maybe it would have felt like too many like relationship episodes in a row.

529
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I don't know.

530
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But like it definitely feels like maybe it would be like maybe Beth's character won't

531
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
be as bad going back through the season now that we know this about her.

532
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah.

533
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Like you can kind of put together a little bit more why like she's acting this way.

534
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Because I think I think they probably had this in mind from the start of season three.

535
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like the way she's been acting this season is clearly indicative of this character.

536
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
They're painting in this episode.

537
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I don't know how true I would say that is in the other seasons.

538
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah, I'm with you on that.

539
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But like it'd be worth going back for a look.

540
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But like, yeah, I see where you're coming from.

541
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I do think it's unfortunate that it's taken this long for Beth to have a moment where like,

542
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
oh man, she might be cool now or I'm a lot more invested in her than I was before, you know.

543
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I certainly feel that having this episode end.

544
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But additionally, I do want to say there's a lot of hype here for Beth going out

545
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and like becoming her own woman and, you know, doing stuff.

546
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But like Beth's not that smart.

547
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I feel like there's a little bit of an exaggerated sense of like how cool things are going to be

548
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
with Beth now that she's out there.

549
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I feel like she's just going to go like she's she's no Rick.

550
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
She is no Rick.

551
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You know, she's not like a God genius or anything in the other alternate world.

552
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
She just became like a fucking famous horse surgeon.

553
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You know, what's been holding her back there?

554
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I don't know.

555
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I mean, Rick has implied that she could have been a super genius.

556
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But I don't know.

557
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I don't know what she's going to do.

558
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I mean, we've already seen Morty and Summer just by proximity to Rick gaining a lot of his like abilities.

559
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You know, like they wouldn't survive very long by themselves, but they do have a lot more skills

560
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
than a normal person would.

561
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You're not wrong about that.

562
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You're not wrong about that.

563
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah.

564
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So, you know what?

565
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'll withhold judgment on that.

566
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Maybe they could do something interesting with her.

567
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So, yeah, go to it, writers.

568
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Make her interesting.

569
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And I'll tell you the first thing they got to do is not have her stayed here.

570
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
She needs to have left.

571
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
She needs to have left.

572
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Go be an adventurer.

573
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Go do something cool.

574
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That's what I hope is revealed.

575
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And I think it will be this season.

576
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That's all I got.

577
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Alrighty.

578
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That's a fuck, a fuck, a fuck, fuck.

579
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Bye, everybody.
