00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good evening everybody and welcome to the first episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
where I train my ability to complain. I am Tom Oliver and today I'm going to be drinking

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,280
Red Bull because I'm at work and that's the best wine I can have here. The Red Bull was

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,160
donated by myself or technically by the wonderful taxpayers of Massachusetts because I got it

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,240
with my EBT card because I am that poor. If you would like to donate to the Wine Fund,

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,720
the link is in the description to my PayPal and by all means request a specific wine in

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,000
the text field and I'll do my best to track that wine down and drink during an episode

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,700
of the Wine Chamber and of course I will mention you in the show notes. So today we are going

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,980
to be talking about Art vs Critique and I guess this is a bit of a follow up to the recent

10
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,820
as of this recording Procrastinator's podcast episode I don't fucking care because it's

11
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,860
late, it's currently 12.37am and I'm only half an hour into my shift at work. I've got

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,180
a long night ahead of me and this is how I've decided to pass the time is to do the first

13
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,540
recorded but probably not the first aired episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber. So

14
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,340
we're going to talk about Art vs Critique and a couple other kind of retorts and rebuttals

15
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,540
and points talking about the latest episode of the Procrastinator's podcast. I will link

16
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,700
it in the description if you have not watched it. I suggest you watch first but you don't

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,980
have to but of course if you're watching this you probably already have seen it so for like

18
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,660
you know most people it's fucking fine. I wanted to start with my definition of Art because

19
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,340
the podcast kind of was centered around art mediums that we don't respect or art mediums

20
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,820
we think are lesser like the tierless or hierarchy of artistic mediums and the conversation kind

21
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,140
of had its ups and downs and there were points that everyone was making that I was kind of

22
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,940
agreeing and disagreeing with so I'm going to try and kind of go into that a little bit

23
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,180
but first I just want to kind of lay the foundation with my definition of Art and I kind of have

24
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,640
two definitions sort of there's like the literal definition of Art and then my personal definition

25
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,160
of Art and I will try to explain what that means as well. So in terms of if you were

26
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,960
going to like say like Tom what is Art like if that's your question I would use Scott

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,400
McLeod's definition of Art ever since I stumbled upon it I think it's well I may not like personally

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:45,040
sit down and describe everything within its context to my personal beliefs of what Art

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,280
is I think like when soup comes to nuts I can't disagree with it so I'm going to say

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,640
that like literally everything for the falls and sides is definition of Art and his definition

31
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:05,040
of Art is anything that isn't done for survival or procreation counts as Art and that's a

32
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,680
super fucking wide huge gamut but I think if anything YouTube and just the internet

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,720
in general and things that have become monetizable and become art forms I think the definition

34
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,000
really holds true that things that you know even like 20 years ago that we probably never

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,840
would have considered artistic or a pursuit that had artistic merit have been proven wrong

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,600
even if I don't personally agree that some of these things I would consider as artistic

37
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,560
I think are still art so there was a great it's in I think it's in understanding comics

38
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,280
the book that Scott McLeod drew because like understanding comics and making comics and

39
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,200
reinventing comics or trilogy of books that he made that are comic books that deconstruct

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,680
comics as a medium they're really good even if you don't read comics or don't care about

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,600
comics too much I was just kind of thumbing through them anyway because they're really

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,160
interesting but at one point he has this kind of these panels that describe what he believes

43
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,200
Art to be and it's his caveman running around and he's saying the caveman has like three

44
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,720
main goals is is procreation finding a woman because it's a guy a woman to procreate and

45
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,240
have a child with because that's like kind of programmed into his primitive brain seek shelter

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,760
from the elements and acquire food and drink to sustain his body those are the three things

47
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:29,680
that like instinctually drive all living creatures and his ability his desire to survive and he's

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,640
being chased by a saber-tooth tiger or something to that effect and he's running and running he's

49
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,960
like you know he's trying to survive this encounter so he he runs to the edge of a cliff

50
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,240
and then he jumps up on like a tree branch that's overhanging the cliff that the tiger

51
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,280
leaps at him and falls off the cliff and it's like this was an entirely an exercise in this

52
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,520
man's desire to survive there's no art in here so what does he do next does he find more food

53
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,680
does he seek more shelters you find trying to court a woman again but instead he kind of like

54
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,200
does sticks his tongue out at the dead corpse it's off off uh i guess off camera but not really

55
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,640
camera and then it's just the next panel just says art something as simple as that it had no

56
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:18,240
practical application in this person's life uh but it was a self-expression uh devoid of necessity

57
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,040
that is art so i would say as a baseline kind of like anything that isn't done under survival

58
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,000
can technically be considered art so even if i don't personally deem it worthy of artistic

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,280
consideration by my own personal standards i would say that that is a true enough kind of

60
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,280
like factual objective definition of art now in my personal opinion which i consider art

61
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,400
you know that's much more nebulous it's kind of much on a kind of uh

62
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,360
case by case basis like you present me with something and like do i find it worthy of my

63
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,800
own personal artistic consideration um it's more nebulous i guess to really define now that i'm

64
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,080
trying to actually sit down and like kind of spin it into a sentence or two i don't think i can uh

65
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,720
it really is just there there are definitely certain things it's tough because like to go back

66
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
into the main idea of what the podcast was talking about like what is art and what are my tears i

67
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,160
definitely have a personal tier list of things that i respect more in terms of their artistic

68
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,560
merits versus other things however something that was done consistently on the podcast that i don't

69
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,440
know if i really understand uh and this is a podcast that i really wish i was in on but i was

70
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,800
at work so i couldn't really do it um is that there there were these tier lists are being

71
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,280
mentioned by some people but i don't know if they were like trying to present them as objective

72
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,640
fact or if this was just personal opinion being confused with it because ben was saying some stuff

73
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,560
um i think hippo made mentioned a couple things um

74
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,600
but those those are personal opinions like i i could i could give you a list a tier list of like

75
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,600
things that i appreciate more than anything i think animation is probably at the top uh

76
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,280
then then it'd probably be books then comic books then video games and and and things like like uh

77
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,600
modern art and and abstract art and and uh you know like analysis and things would be at the

78
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,840
bottom in terms of things that have artistic merit but but that's just my that's not a tier

79
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,720
it's not like an objective tier list that's not something like these are worthy this is just my

80
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,560
interpretation my appreciation of these mediums in terms of ascribing them personal artistic

81
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,600
uh values objectively it doesn't mean anything and that's i guess that's kind of like the problem

82
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,000
right because like where does subjectivity end and objectivity begin or does it ever begin or end

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,440
i need to actually have some of my wine my quote unquote red bull wine

84
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,120
here we go so

85
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,560
where does one begin and another end and another thing that um that jesse said that i agree with

86
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,440
very much and i would have i was itching to bring up sitting there listening to podcast until he

87
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:19,040
brought it up was that um pieces of work are not necessarily confined to the slot that they reside

88
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:25,360
in and what i mean by that is like let's say i think personally that i feel that animation is a

89
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:34,480
more powerful and more artistically uh impressive to me medium than uh video games undertale is

90
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,400
still way more impressive artistically than a lot of animation i've seen you know like you're

91
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,680
they're not nothing is is bound by its tier list it's not like every the worst animation is still

92
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,240
more artistically valuable to me than the best video game there's definitely some overlap there

93
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,360
and that's why i think that the tiering doesn't really mean much um it just kind of says to me

94
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,760
that like you know if you mentioned the medium off hand like i have a certain amount of respect for

95
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,080
it just from my personal experience um as someone who's written books as someone who's attempted

96
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,800
animations as someone who's attempted and failed miserably at making games and as somebody who's

97
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,200
done illustration and podcasting i'm like i'm dabbled in a bunch of different things there's

98
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,120
subtle nuances to each medium that need to be understood and appreciated in order to do them

99
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,520
effectively and i'm not even going to begin to pretend that i'm a master at any of the fields

100
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,960
i've ever attempted to do uh even this podcast i'm probably doing a mediocre job at best but

101
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,560
there's there's mastery in every field even in things that i particularly revile or not even

102
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,200
reviles too hard word things that i don't find much particular personal interest in things like

103
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,760
abstract art you know like the jackson pollocks and the cubism and and shit like that that is

104
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,400
fine boring and uninteresting and vapid personally uh aren't some boring or vapid to other people

105
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,520
and aren't boring and vapid objectively at least i don't think so like what does the objective uh

106
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,320
value of art really mean and like going back to a specific example from the podcast itself with

107
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:13,840
pornography is a lot of porn empty and baseless well sure like it's kind of manufactured to be

108
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,200
low hanging fruit because it's appealing it's art that's made for the primitive mind instead of the

109
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,960
intellectual mind and that sounds really like fucking pompous when i say it out loud but it's

110
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:36,000
true right like like sexual desire isn't really a refined uh intelligent aspect of humanity it's

111
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,920
very like going back to the caveman example of how i defined art it's something that's been there

112
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,560
since the inception of mankind and to appeal to that you require very little you know because

113
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,520
it's not a very complicated emotion uh you want to fuck somebody so to make art that that stimulates

114
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,400
that part of the mind doesn't really require a lot of intellectual depth a lot of creative

115
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,920
endeavor you know like you you see something someone hot you want to have sex with them you

116
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,920
know it's kind of like that initial and emotional kind of visceral reaction so pornography to be

117
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,080
an effective form of art doesn't really need to be all of that uh crazy complexity like like it's

118
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:21,200
more complicated to to stimulate your intellectual desire or intellectual appreciation of like a

119
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,160
love story having two characters fall in love with each other and i'm sympathizing with their kind

120
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,640
of emotional play that's a much more complicated thing to do than to stimulate the primitive

121
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,320
mind of like i have an erection and i want to fuck something i can jerk off to this

122
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,360
it's it's a simpler desire so pornography i guess as a result is a much simpler art form

123
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,280
um is it still art for my technical definition yes uh from my personal definition i think it's

124
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,320
probably lower rung if i was going to rank it in terms of things i appreciate artistically but i'm

125
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,640
never going to deny that it's not art there is pornography in any medium is still uh a sub

126
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,280
section of the medium itself so like if someone's drawing like a pornographic image it's still a

127
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,960
drawing and has all of the artistic merits of drawing as a medium same with as a film same

128
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,000
with as a comic book same with any of that stuff like it's all using the same techniques that if

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,520
you replace those drawings of fucking with drawings of anything else would still be an art form so

130
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:30,800
well the the so it's not really the structure of pornography that makes it less desirable

131
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,560
uh or less valid as an art form i think it's the goal that turns a lot of people off ironically by

132
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,680
just existing to turn them on um because it doesn't aspire to much more than that right like you

133
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,960
know the typical plot of a porn the the the stereotypical you know uh pizza delivery guy

134
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,520
comes i can't before the pizza can i pay with something else like you know that's about as

135
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,280
complicated as porn plots tend to get but then again just to make a good example with alan

136
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,480
war's lost girls taking pornography to a whole other level that was done intentionally so it's

137
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:13,200
like how much of pornography being unexplored as an art form is because of culture because culture

138
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,920
really is still kind of on the fritz when it comes to to to porn and and human sexuality in

139
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,800
journal is still something that's very private i think probably with good reason for the most part

140
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,640
um i don't think we need to be super puritan about it but sex is a private thing uh you know

141
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:39,280
just by nature of what it is do i think there's more room in social uh commentary to to to address

142
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,720
it more to be more open about it of course um i think we've made large strides in the last like

143
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,600
even like 10 years of of kind of normalizing this talk and just understanding of sexuality

144
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,160
because it's a huge part of humanity and again it's very ingrained in the human mind so i think uh

145
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,120
artistically there's definitely more room for pornography to become to kind of like move beyond

146
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,760
its its stigma i don't think it needs to be as stigmatized as it is uh but i think like i said

147
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,000
because it's it's it's it's trying to stimulate a very primitive part of the human mind it doesn't

148
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,360
have to be very complicated in order to be effective uh so that's what i got on pornography i got a

149
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,320
whole notes what else was i going to talk about um oh i uh another thing i wanted to talk about

150
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,280
was analysis because analysis is kind of glazed over i got a lot to fucking say about analysis as

151
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,400
someone who did analysis for two years um like i mentioned earlier analysis is pretty low on my

152
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,200
rung of like things i have a lot of appreciation for i kind of get where ben was coming from where

153
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:51,680
he was saying that analysis can never uh surpass the work it was based on um i don't think surpassed

154
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,520
was probably the right word i think what ben was trying to say or at least what i was taking from

155
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,120
him because it was something that i kind of agree with is that analysis is always contingent upon

156
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,240
other art to exist it can't exist in a vacuum right you can't analyze nothing so in order

157
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,720
to analyze something something else has to pre predate it i guess was a word something something

158
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,360
needs to exist first in order to be analyzed um so it's always a reactive medium it always has

159
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,960
to be a reaction to something else and that inherently makes it a response and never an

160
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,320
initiation of creativity if that kind of makes sense um i don't know if that's exactly the best

161
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:39,440
way to to word it but there always it always has to come after something else and i think that's

162
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,360
what ben was trying to get at um the the the the red letter media thing he was kind of referencing

163
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,720
when saying star wars is a good example of uh the the analysis getting more kind of critical

164
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,040
recognition than the work itself uh though depending on the social circle you ran uh the

165
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,760
prequels are well loved by certain fanboys but something i wanted to bring up when i was listening

166
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,960
to that was the idea of analysis and cultural catharsis uh red letter media is a great example

167
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:18,320
of that how much of the the the reaction to uh that video was was catharsis right because there

168
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,920
was a long build there was a big gap between the phantom menace in 1999 and the red letter media

169
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,400
video which i think was like 2009 2010 something it was it wasn't very recent it was it was a couple

170
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,120
years ago but there was a huge at least i think a 10 year gap between phantom menace and the video

171
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,600
so there was 10 years of this like cultural buildup of like animosity toward this video like the

172
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,080
initially came out um i was like in fourth grade at the time so i loved it because i was a stupid

173
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,240
little kid but i'm assuming at the time there were adults who were kids watching the original

174
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,120
star wars watched it and felt betrayed by it felt that it was a letdown um obviously people feel

175
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,560
that way nowadays i'm assuming at the time there probably was a group of people who were too

176
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,200
so there was a decade of just like built up animosity towards this trilogy and how it let them

177
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:12,080
down and how it was just just a different approach to the franchise than the original movies so how

178
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,720
much of the appreciation for the star wars reviews and by extension analysis in general

179
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:28,960
is for the catharsis of having your your note your ideas um given a bigger outlet than just your

180
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,040
mind versus for the art itself um because as someone who did analysis and someone who's from

181
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,400
the bunch of people who do analysis and reviews and critique and stuff i can appreciate the red

182
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,640
letter media reviews on a technical level for what they're doing with the medium of analysis

183
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,400
even though i don't appreciate it as much as an art form but i'm sure a ton of people don't think

184
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,160
about that at all they're just like yeah they're sticking into these movies that i hate so i think

185
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,160
a lot of the love that eclipses the prequels probably comes from this just like jonesing for

186
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:05,520
the the fucking like verbal assault that they gave the prequels does that really count i guess

187
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:13,760
is my question maybe it does um but it seems like a lot of that comes from um the catharsis and the

188
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,800
feeling of oh i understand that and that's how i feel and and he's saying exactly what i want to

189
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,040
say and it kind of almost feels like uh you're appreciating it because you're seeing yourself

190
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,680
in it and therefore you're kind of like you're kind of pushing your ego into the piece because

191
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,040
it's saying something that you wanted to say and something you already believe versus your

192
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,120
appreciation for the piece itself um maybe another way of examining this point is talking

193
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,000
about um four panel comics that are prevalent on tumblr where they're like hashtags so relatable

194
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,160
you know when there's a character in like their pet and then life or some sort of life struggle

195
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,360
is personified and and shits on them or something and like all the reblogs like ha ha this is me

196
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,400
hashtag me and like people seem to there's like a huge backlash against those now especially

197
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,640
against owl turds comics on tumblr as of late just because they're so redundant and done over

198
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,840
and over again and they appeal to a very kind of base uh concept of like i'm going to point out

199
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,680
something in life that is common and affects a lot of people and you're going to look at it and

200
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,000
you're not going to really see the work itself you're going to project yourself into it like ha ha

201
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,360
this is me i like it because i see myself not because i appreciate the work and i feel like

202
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,560
analysis uh sometimes can do that as well where it's appreciated because of catharsis

203
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,920
and not because of what it is okay that went on a bit longer than i want i got five minutes left

204
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,240
to wrap this up before i gotta do my next round at work fuck um analysis and dependency uh critics

205
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:48,160
and laziness what am i even talking about with this bullet point um i don't remember

206
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,680
critics and laziness fuck i'm gonna have to cut this whole part out i don't even remember what

207
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,560
i was talking about these bullet points i wrote them like three hours ago fuck okay so i this is

208
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,320
like an hour and a half two hours later i'm cutting this in because i remember what i meant by critics

209
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,440
and laziness okay so this is probably gonna get me a ton of flak but i don't fucking care because

210
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:19,680
i think it's true and whatever i think critics too many critics fall back to criticism because

211
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:28,800
they're too lazy or feel they're too untalented to do the thing they're actually passionate about

212
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,600
that they criticize for example i think a lot of people who do video game reviews and shit on

213
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,600
probably really love video games and would make video games but you think it's too hard

214
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,720
or they're not talented or they just don't want to put in the effort to learn how to make games

215
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,360
because that's really difficult but they want to express their love for video games so instead

216
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,800
they talk about video games and i think because analysis is such a big thing and critique and

217
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,640
reviews and it's easy and you can make money doing it and it's become this big thing because of youtube

218
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:08,320
i think we're being deprived of a lot of people who make things because it's easier and more

219
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,120
rewarding short term to talk about things that other people have already made i think that's a

220
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,040
huge fucking problem and it's one of the reasons why i don't really do much reviews of media anymore

221
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,840
because i would rather spend the time that i spent making reviews making things

222
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:33,200
you know this is something that i guess this is kind of a personal tick that really

223
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,040
resonates with me is that when sometimes there are some people there are people who are legitimate

224
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:45,280
critics people who like actually want to be that and that's what they want and nothing else i think

225
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,760
digi is a great example just off the top man to somebody who actually legitimately likes

226
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:57,120
and wants to be an analyst i don't think if given the knowledge and the tool set to make anime he

227
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,680
would stop reviewing anime i think that's that that's his thing and that's what he wants to do but

228
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,320
there are a ton of people who aren't like that and for me personally that's what was kind of pissing

229
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,680
me off is that i'm talking about tv shows and i'm talking about movies and i'm talking about games

230
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,760
but i'm only doing it because i'm too lazy to get off my ass actually make the things i'm talking

231
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,760
about and that's what i was doing before i got into youtube was that i was putting my money

232
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,240
where my mouth was and where my passion was and trying to make the things i don't want to talk

233
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,200
about things that are cool i want to be talked about is one of the things that are cool that's

234
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,280
what i'm really interested in and i really hate how there are so many people who are doing analysis

235
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,200
because they're too lazy to put in the legwork to make the thing that they're actually passionate

236
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,960
about i think there are so many people out there who would be making movies who would be making games

237
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,640
who would be writing books who would be making tv shows who would be doing all these things but

238
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,960
it's just too hard so they don't and then they see people talking about the stuff on youtube like

239
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,520
oh that's easy i can just point a camera and talk about it and look the guy's a million subscribers

240
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,080
and makes a hundred thousand dollars i'm gonna do that and then they do that and we've lost another

241
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:18,080
creator to the simple easy returns of analysis and critique and i really hate me all you want

242
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,480
but i really think that because of youtube has made analysis and review and critique and commentary

243
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:33,040
way too big and has pulled people away from legitimate creation i think youtube is unfairly

244
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,560
it's almost too easy to make money with youtube and now too hard to make things doing things that

245
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:45,760
actually require effort it's like this reward effort is unbalanced right now you should make

246
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,000
more money quicker and and and more significantly when you do the hard work than the easy work but

247
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,160
that's not the way the system set up right now and i think that combined with like just lack of

248
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,280
confidence or lack of desire in people you know i actually want to make things and it's still

249
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,040
fucking hard and i still haven't done anything of any significance yet so i can't even imagine

250
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,280
someone who like doesn't really have that drive they're kind of sitting on the fence like it's

251
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:16,640
so fucking difficult but like the tantalizing prospect of being the next nostalgia critic a black

252
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,000
nerd or red led or media whatever just like like like just sitting there and talking about

253
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:31,440
shit and getting all these acolytes i just think if put in a vacuum and asked what would you want

254
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,640
to do if the effort and the money and the time was no object and you could just snap your fingers

255
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,560
and you would do one of these fields i think a lot of people who are involved in criticism would

256
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,680
say like like if it was no object of course i would make a movie instead of talk about movies

257
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,760
of course i would make a book instead of talking about books of course i would make a comic instead

258
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,200
of talking about comics and that's what's frustrating that's what i think so much analysis

259
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,600
comes from laziness too lazy to put in the time to be what you admire instead you're just kind of

260
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,160
talking about it that's what i meant that's just a huge problem with analysis and that's kind of

261
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,400
why for me personally i put it so low in terms of where i think it is artistically because i think

262
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:22,320
so many people do it for the wrong reasons and fuck that i want to talk about books because

263
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,960
munchie kind of tried to go on this fucking rampage about books i'm happy that jesse and ben

264
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,040
both shut him down because he's so fucking stupid saying that books are shit books are definitely

265
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:37,200
not shit um but this is kind of like i don't want to say a new revelation but something i was reminded

266
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,160
of by getting back into books in the last couple months um i used to read a lot in high school

267
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,600
and middle not even high school i used to read a lot in middle school and elementary school

268
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,760
by high school i was reading mostly comics because i think i had the same mentality that a lot of

269
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,120
people do and kind of maybe what munchie sounded like saying that like pictures are better than

270
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,080
words and that's kind of why i started gravitating towards comic books and manga away from uh

271
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:07,120
books when i was a little kid because i liked drawing i liked words but i also like pictures

272
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,440
and i liked pictures more so like this has words and pictures this has just words i'm going to go

273
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:19,280
with words and pictures um but reading again in the last like two or three years as i've slowly

274
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,680
started getting back into reading novels um there is a specific cadence and a specific tone and a

275
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,680
specific way of storytelling that books have that cannot be replicated in other mediums um

276
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:41,040
um books aren't just movies without a budget it's something that i think a lot of people don't

277
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:50,960
realize or don't fully appreciate is that a book is a very unique form of storytelling

278
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,720
because it allows a couple different things that i really appreciate the first is that you

279
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:05,840
can really get into a character's head in a way that you can't do in movies as much um because

280
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,280
movies have show don't tell uh books have show don't tell as well but you have to show by telling

281
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,920
which is kind of weird because all a book really is is telling it's it's like 300 pages of telling

282
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,280
but it's the way that you tell that makes it feel more like showing

283
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:27,200
it so you can get into a character's head and really understand their thought process and get

284
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,600
into their their their thoughts and their inner kind of workings as they go through situations

285
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,680
that you can't do uh in a way that isn't heavy-handed in film you can imply a lot of things

286
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,440
with cinematography uh to a character's inner plights and stuff but in terms of like a very

287
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,920
like direct line into a character's thought process books can do this more efficiently

288
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,840
because they're nothing but writing so you can like stop as you're describing something you can

289
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,640
describe the the emotions and the thought process going through character's head in between statements

290
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,760
because time flows a little bit differently right you're reading the book and and a book can have

291
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,120
like a page that goes through like you know five minutes of stuff or another page it goes to like

292
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:16,480
half a second as they think through uh a decision um you can't really do that with a movie because

293
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,120
a movie's running in real time consistently like time can flow differently but you as a passive

294
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,840
viewer are experiencing it in real physical time obviously because you're sitting watching the movie

295
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,320
so like if a character is sitting there uh think about something for a minute it's happening in a

296
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,880
minute of real time um and the movie's kind of happening in that time as well but if you're

297
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,280
reading a book um it it doesn't it it just it feels different um you're still experiencing it in

298
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:47,360
real time but the book allows for some reason allows that time to feel less uh disjointed i

299
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,400
guess um i guess also because like a book is right at your own pace it doesn't really have a limit of

300
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,240
like two hours approximately to really worry about it can kind of meander a bit more uh because page

301
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,240
counts are much less consistent than movie times uh but regardless you can get into character's head

302
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,520
just can examine situations and and really break things down more than you can in movies and another

303
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,400
thing that i really like is you can engage all of the senses more specifically than you can

304
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,720
in any other medium uh ironically because there's less sense there's less visual engagement like

305
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,760
describing things in books like visual medium is very difficult to do in books compared to any

306
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,400
other medium because there are no visuals like you have to sit there and describe things as opposed

307
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,760
to just showing it in any other medium and i would say that's books biggest weakness is that it can

308
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,480
also be considered a strength um from a certain perspective that like you can envision the world

309
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,520
however you want it kind of stimulates your imagination a bit more and i'd say that's a

310
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,880
useful thing but in terms of like like uh objective like strength versus weaknesses in terms of like

311
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,360
me as an author trying to tell you what something looks like by me having to describe it with words

312
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,880
i can never be as accurate as it would be if i could just show you a picture of what it was

313
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,760
so that's a weakness of books but on the flip side every other sense can be stimulated uh second hand

314
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,720
just as eloquently whereas something visually has to kind of go out of its way to kind of

315
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:18,000
tell you about it so for example if i was going to sit here and describe the room i'm in i could

316
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,120
describe how it looked like uh the room had a very ominous cadence because i'm sitting in an

317
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,040
abandoned building with nothing else in here one lighted room looking outwards through two windows

318
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,000
into a vast sea of blackness sparsely lit by a small light scattered throughout the large room

319
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,520
the the ticking of the clock kind of punctuates every minute of my time being wasted in here

320
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,000
not being able to do the things i actually want to do the smell of the air smells of oil and dust

321
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,400
and makes me cough it's so i can jump between visual stimuli and and like you know how something

322
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,160
smells and how something feels and then how i think i can do that all in the same kind of rhythm

323
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,640
without ever breaking the flow of how a book works whereas if a film wants to describe how

324
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,440
something smells a character usually has to say oh man it stinks you know and and very clearly like

325
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,880
kind of stop whatever else is going on and say this is what this send this this uh this sense

326
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,200
is being stimulated in this world because all you can do is see it um but if i showed you a picture

327
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,120
of the of the room that i'm sitting in i can much more clearly give you the visual information than

328
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,040
me describing it because every one of you listening to this saw a different version of the room and

329
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,600
none of them were exactly the same as the one i'm actually sitting in whereas if i gave you a picture

330
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,760
everyone's perception would be the same so books have strengths and weaknesses but the point i'm

331
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,960
trying to make here is that books are the are in work of art or a medium of art that is unique

332
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,800
they do things that know where the medium can and they're not just like shittier versions of books

333
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,160
or comics um that's all i got for this episode i was going to make some other points but i'm out

334
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,520
of time already late for my next round so this has been the hyperbolic wine chamber i've been

335
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,400
drinking not wine but if you want to give me wine for the next one link is in the paypal tell me

336
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:07,040
what you want me to drink and i'll go drink it if you have suggestions for the podcast let me know

337
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:14,400
till next time i'm tom oliver and i'll be whining forever because i hate my life i don't know how to

338
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,800
end these yet that's that's all i got
