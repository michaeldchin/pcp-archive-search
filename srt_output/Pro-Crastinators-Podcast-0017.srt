Hello, Ashen One, and welcome to the latest Pro Crastinators Podcast. On this episode we'll

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,400
be talking about Dark Souls 3. There will be massive spoilers for the entire game. If

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,520
you give a shit about bullshit like that, don't watch this video. I mean, really, you

4
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,480
won't understand half of what we're saying if you haven't played the game. And it's

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,440
a really fucking good game. We all thought it was a 10 out of 10. So just play it, and

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,640
enjoy the podcast.

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:58,280
Hello everybody, and welcome to the Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am your host, Digibro, to talk about

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:10,080
Dark Souls 3. I've got with me Jesse Endless Jess. Say hello, Jesse. Hello. How's it going?

9
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
And I've got the best guy ever as well. Hey guys, what's going on? Ready to get

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,400
swole in the dark? We decided we're trying to make this podcast

11
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,160
Let me cut and break in for a sec, because there's a lot of talking over people going

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,960
on. We want to avoid that as much as possible from here on out. So maybe less people might

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,240
be better. By the way, happy Mother's Day to all the

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,200
MILFs in our audience. I know there's a lot of you. Happy Mother's Day that we're recording

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,520
this and this podcast won't come out for a week and a half. That's true. If there's

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,080
one thing I want to do more of in all my online pursuits, it's attract real women into having

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,920
real sex with me. So now's my quick plug for that. So MILFs, shout out to you today.

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,880
You're the only one here who hasn't done it. You fucking jump.

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,560
Had sex via... that's not due to online stuff. That's true. One day. You could be the first

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,440
ladies, get in line.

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,320
Alright, so we're talking about Dark Souls 3 today. I think we all really like this game

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
a lot.

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,920
Sure do. And that's why we're doing this. It's like the coolest game ever. It's fucking

24
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
rad.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,800
I haven't played since Dark Souls 1 probably.

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,280
But it's still a 10 out of 10.

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,040
Jesse, I'm curious about your issues with it because you have been the most crazy of

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,200
this game from the beginning. I've never heard you complain about it really. So what is your...

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,680
I guess my main complaint, none of my complaints are huge complaints.

30
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,320
But I like the fact that in Dark Souls 1 and 2, as soon as you start the game, there's

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,240
like 3 or 4 different directions you can go. And this game doesn't branch off until...

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,200
Well let me refute that right off, because in Dark Souls 2 that's not the case. That's

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
only true in Dark Souls 1.

34
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
What the fuck are you talking about you stupid idiot? Yes it is.

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
No it's not. You can't go down the well. You can go one way.

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
You don't know anything about Dark Souls 2. You Gebronies always run your mouths about

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,480
Dark Souls 2. I'm already mad. It's been 5 minutes. You always run your mouths about

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Dark Souls 2.

39
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
There are two ways.

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,960
You don't know a goddamn thing about it. You're not a fucking Dark Souls 2 master like me.

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
That's true.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,760
So shut your damn mouth and know your damn role.

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,680
Okay well maybe that's true. I can definitely agree with you with one. Dark Souls 3 is the

44
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,960
most linear of them all. That is true. I looked at a big map that shows like a flowchart

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,000
of the ways you can go. There aren't that many optional areas, though there weren't

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,640
really that many of the others. And the chart goes pretty straightforwardly.

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,880
I would definitely say the first time I played through it I was struck by how linear it felt.

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,120
It's really not. I mean when you're in the Crucifixion Woods you can go either fight

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,440
the Abyss Watchers or go to the Cathedral of the Deep.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
That's right.

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,960
There's always spoilers for everything in this podcast.

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Oh yeah.

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Gonna spoil it all.

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
No real sense in making podcasts.

55
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,120
That's good because the lore is great and there are some great, I bet there's some stuff

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,320
you guys don't even know. If you haven't done all the threads, all the quest threads and

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,040
I can't wait to talk about them because they're awesome.

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,280
I would say that like when I started up my New Game Plus the very first thing I did was

59
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,440
in the first area go kill the old lady who gives you the cup and then it makes you fight

60
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,760
the dancer as soon as you kill her. So then I fought the dancer and I went up through

61
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,320
the castle and did the castle stuff before anything else in the game.

62
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,240
So that was definitely cool because it made it so, I couldn't imagine trying to do that

63
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,840
on a brand new game unless you were like extremely pro tier and you really wanted the challenge.

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,360
Yeah, it's preventative in the sense that you're severely underleveled doing it on

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,760
a non-New Game Plus and it doesn't want you to do it really but you can do it if you're

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
good enough.

67
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,720
But it was cool to do on New Game Plus because it was right away, whereas the whole game

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,760
I would say this game is kind of easy compared to the other Dark Souls games especially on

69
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,440
New Game Plus where you were like, I don't know, I was super overpowered for like all

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,280
of this game and when I started up New Game Plus I immediately went and fought like all

71
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,200
the hardest bosses at the beginning. You know, like I fought the dancer, I fought the dragon,

72
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,240
the blind dragon Osiros, I fought the living armor and you know, killed all of them.

73
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,720
Well you said you did it right at the beginning but you can't even get there until like most

74
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
of the way through the game.

75
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,520
Like Osiros is like buried way down and fucking, I don't know, somewhere, I don't know, it's

76
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,800
going to take you like five, six hours to get there even if you're making a fucking

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
B-line.

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
What do you mean? I'll talk about from New Game Plus.

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,840
Yeah, you can't just walk straight there, you gotta fucking unlock the paths and shit.

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,000
But the only thing you have to do is you start off in the castle area on the wall, the high

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,720
wall of Lothric, you run in, you kill the old lady and that makes the dancer spawn and

82
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,120
then once you kill the dancer you can just run.

83
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Oh shit, I forgot it was down that path, yeah you're right.

84
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
I was wrong.

85
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,000
So you can just run in there and kill Osiros and I even went to the burned out version

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,680
of the shrine, a Firelink shrine.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,480
I did all that shit like right at the beginning of New Game Plus, which was cool because those

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,760
bosses all drop a fuck ton of souls and when you start New Game Plus your biggest problem

89
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,320
is that it takes a lot of souls to level you so by fighting all the hardest bosses first

90
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,960
I had like a shit ton of souls.

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,240
The only thing you can't do is you can't go into the, like you can't get into the grand

92
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,480
archives until you have all of the other bosses killed.

93
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,400
So you can't go fight the brothers and all that shit until you've killed all the bosses.

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,680
So it did feel like once I was on New Game Plus I did get to play it in a significantly

95
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,960
different enough way that it was like yeah cool it's not exactly the same but now that

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,480
I've done a few more new game runs it really is like man this is a pretty linear game.

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,280
Your choices are you either do Cathedral of the Deep or you do the Abyss Watchers first.

98
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:42,360
But let's set this in the context of the Soulsborne series because before this was Bloodborne,

99
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,600
before that was Dark Souls 2 and before that was Dark Souls 1.

100
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,520
So like most people are playing this game coming off of playing Bloodborne and so that's

101
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,760
kind of the way that I was comparing things and I gotta say I've played Dark Souls 1 and

102
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,920
2 and Bloodborne recently and Dark Souls 3 definitely feels more like Bloodborne just

103
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,240
in the sense of the quickness of your movements and the way your character moves and all of

104
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
that is really good.

105
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,080
It is different so I could see someone not liking it.

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,480
It feels a little bit less deliberate but I definitely like it and it's kind of got

107
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:21,040
the faster pace of Bloodborne with the vast weapon variety of the Dark Souls series and

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,840
they've incorporated this new ability with the L2 what are they called like Focus Attacks

109
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,960
which add a whole bunch of extra shit.

110
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Man I just got this sword.

111
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,320
I didn't even know this was the thing this is how great this game is.

112
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,920
I just beat the game again on New Game Plus.

113
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,840
I walk up to Ludelith who can like fuse souls and like it just so happened I didn't even

114
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,000
know this was a thing.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,800
You have the option of fusing if you've made both of the Princess Swords from the Princess

116
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,440
and the Castle he'll fuse them into one super sword that can do both of their special attacks

117
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
with the L2 commands.

118
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,160
I did not know that there was a guy who can fuse swords I've never heard of it.

119
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,880
That's the thing he can only do it with this one weapon and I just happened to stumble upon

120
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
it.

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Wait who does this?

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Who fuses the swords?

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,920
Ludelith like the guy who fuses and who turns souls into weapons he just fuses it was the

124
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
coolest thing ever.

125
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,320
I'm just saying like there's all this shit there's it's it's got the touch still you

126
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,720
know it's got it all.

127
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,440
I don't I anyway like I just wanted to ask you guys how you felt about like the controls

128
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,920
in comparison to you know the other games because I really like the way it's moving

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,720
even though this is like probably the last souls they're making for a long time which

130
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
makes me very sad.

131
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,120
Makes me angry they should be a new souls game every year for the rest of my game.

132
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,080
I would have absolutely no problem with them churning out a game of this nature every single

133
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,920
year I want that these are great there's no problem and yet they decide to end it.

134
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,200
Well they said that they're ending the souls franchise that they're working on a new IP

135
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,640
I mean that could be another bloodborne for all we know like another game that's yeah

136
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,480
the same kind of mechanics but different you know I wouldn't mind getting like like personally

137
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm okay with like souls itself being over because I felt like this game was the ultimate

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,440
one you know like if they wanted to because like what was cool about bloodborne was that

139
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,760
it was the same kind of game but it had such different mechanics to it that it was like

140
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,680
you know you could play it for different reasons like I think with with the previous games

141
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,920
each one was kind of similar enough that you would just play whichever one was your favorite

142
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,200
you know but where like bloodborne is different enough that you might play that one for just

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,240
because you want a different experience and I think it would be cool if we got some more

144
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,120
games like that maybe something even more in the direction of like a platinum game style

145
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,200
thing with like more action and like fast-paced stuff or maybe something even more fucking

146
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,960
deep and complex you know but I definitely think that like from soft is moving in the

147
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:56,160
way of maybe just understanding controls better like I don't I wonder how much the like demons

148
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,720
souls was clunky because that made it easier to make a deep combat system you know yeah

149
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,240
I mean there's there's always trade-offs with stuff like that like like the weapon or no

150
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,760
is it like the item weight limits that was in demon souls one like nobody likes that

151
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,800
but like it does add an additional layer of depth to things yeah it's just you know I'll

152
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,560
say that I think so if I were to summarize what I think like Dark Souls 3 did overall

153
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,280
like compared to the other games it's that it really streamlines everything and yeah but

154
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,120
while I think like bloodborne streamlined it but then also was like really different where

155
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,200
it was more of this like fast-paced you know aggressive type of game but with Dark Souls 3

156
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,760
it's like they made the the fact that there's bonfires like everywhere you never have to

157
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,360
like run all the way back to a boss they took out exceedingly generous with the bonfires a

158
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,640
little bit more than I thought was appropriate or necessary right but I really felt like this

159
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,360
game was meant for the long term because like I think with with demon souls that game was

160
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,600
super fucking memorable like everything about it was the most memorable thing ever because you

161
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,800
would go through it a hundred fucking times like if you died you had to play the whole level again

162
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,200
yeah even you know even if you died to the boss you had to play all the way back to the

163
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,560
boss every single time and every level was so distinct that that it kind of got away with

164
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,640
that because it was like such a you know engrossing game but I think that once Dark Souls 1 came out

165
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,640
and you had the shortcuts and it was easier to get back to bosses and it felt more like well

166
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,760
I mean there were shortcuts and demon souls too right but I mean like yeah I mean that's

167
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,240
definitely true but I think with Dark Souls it was just generally you didn't have to run

168
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,480
back quite as much that's true that's true and I think that Dark Souls also with the flask system

169
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,440
like with demon souls if you died a whole bunch of times to the same boss you had to then go fucking

170
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,560
spend a year grinding grass again you know yeah so they introduced this flask system so that no

171
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,800
matter how many times you died you always started off on the same foot you know you never had to

172
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,960
like completely restart the flask system is genius it's the it's the best it's the best so I think

173
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,200
that was already sort of an effort to streamline it but even in Dark Souls there's a lot of moments

174
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,760
where there's there's not a bonfire for a long time they had hidden bonfires like really

175
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,000
dickishly hidden bonfires you know like the one in the fucking forest like if you didn't hit that

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,240
illusory wall yeah find that bonfire I beat the game twice before I figured out how to get to the

177
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,000
bottom of the forest yeah right it took me a long time to figure that you know the one in the right

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,120
before the area where the the giant is throwing bombs in the top of the snake fortress sends

179
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,640
fortress there's one way up top there and if you don't find that one you have to go through the

180
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,680
whole fucking trap filled fortress yeah it's just it's fun but I always would I would always see

181
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,520
like items down there oh yeah yeah like I fucking went through the game twice going like how the

182
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,360
fuck where is it how do I get there and finally where exactly are you talking about the uh the

183
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,920
bottom layer of the uh of the forest place that you have to get through like where the hydra is

184
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,080
you have to like go through like a secret tree wall or some shit I don't remember like uh near

185
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,880
the gateway to uh I don't know where there's like a where there's the living tree I think I know what

186
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,160
he's talking about yeah anyways it's a pile of shit it's the worst game ever they're all yeah

187
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,400
yeah that's right but yeah like that's the thing like that game it had stuff like that and I think

188
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,840
that was great I think it made it a really memorable and cool game that you had this like harsh experience

189
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,480
but you never get that again when you play it again you know you once you've beaten dark souls

190
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,280
and once you know all the secrets you know them forever and then all those things that are kind

191
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,640
of a pain in the ass become a real pain in the ass because like you know the first time you're

192
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,120
playing everything's equally hard and it's it's never like a matter of well I had to run back a

193
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,720
thousand times here I just raped I'm playing it right now and I just raped the dancer she's fucking

194
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,200
dead she was no match for my magic for my dark powers of sorcery from the another world the

195
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,760
boba duke spook I kill her with the wizard safe take her yeah by the way I meant to mention this

196
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,080
earlier but you should be following endless jessie's channel the blue glow where he's been playing

197
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,440
dark souls 3 and my channel digi bros where we've been playing dark souls 3 uh I would say jessie's

198
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:21,080
is more memorable though because his characters are quite a sight they're rich and yeah well that

199
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,440
leaves me as deep as real dark souls character yeah the uh the uh the blue glow lore is becoming

200
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:34,360
quite masterful the time is convoluted on uh the endless that's true that's very true that leads me

201
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,640
to my other much larger complaint that I didn't even realize was wait wait wait can I finish the

202
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,160
point I was making real quick because I actually forgot to wrap it up just that that like so you

203
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,760
know when I for me when I played through dark souls one because I played through all these

204
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,840
pretty recently the hardest part for me the most frustrating was an Orlando because there's that huge

205
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,720
run back to the bot like from whichever bonfire you pick like you always have to run this massive

206
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,360
distance and I thought it was such a pain in the ass to have to do that and so like with dark souls

207
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,040
3 I really think they were thinking about it in like long term like it's not as memorable the first

208
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,680
time through like in dark souls where you really struggled and you really had to run all the way

209
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:21,080
back because they put bonfires everywhere but I think that in repeated playthroughs this game

210
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,800
will be the least frustrating and the easiest to come back to and I think that might be what they

211
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,600
were going for because at this point it's like we already have the old games you know if you

212
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,240
you've already had that experience of the the epic frustrating intense game and anyone who

213
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,720
anyone who doesn't hasn't played the old ones isn't going to be that like like if they make a new

214
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,760
game and it's more accessible than like any of the people who couldn't make it through dark souls

215
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,840
one this is the one they're gonna play anyway okay I mean I guess you could maybe interpret it that

216
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,400
way but then I see bonfires like like when you kill the uh the what is it like the dragon slayer

217
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,800
armor and then you run up the hill and there's another bonfire right there it's just like that's

218
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,600
just stupid why did you put that well it's stupid but at the same time the dragon slayer

219
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,480
bonfire is the one that's the fastest way back to the brothers once you open up that shortcut

220
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,000
so no that's fine I mean you leave the dragon slayer one and you just don't put that other

221
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,920
one there in front of that building you you yeah I mean they can they can handle the extra two

222
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:23,000
second walk just I don't know I definitely think it looked goofy and like really at that moment

223
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,800
you know um yeah but I I think I think honestly they could have just moved that dragon slayer

224
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,160
bonfire to the other end of the bridge and that would have been like because it's as it stands

225
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,000
it's only so much more convenient because you still have to run across the whole fucking bridge

226
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,560
to get to the elevator that goes to the brothers so like no matter what you've got a fairly long run

227
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,880
so I was like why did you even put these two bonfires so close together if uh if it wasn't

228
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,080
going to be that much more convenient that's very true I suggest what was your next complaint you

229
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,720
wanted to bring oh yeah okay I didn't even realize that I had this complaint because it's like a

230
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,400
class specific complaint and I'm not the only one people are flipping out about this like Dark Souls

231
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:09,320
fans is it about the magic no it's uh because the first time you know I made my guy I usually go

232
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,040
for like a dex kind of build I had my fucking dancer swords it was cool as shit I was like all

233
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,240
right then the next one I did my fucking boba duke spook and I'm like yeah I did a little play

234
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,040
field like look at me I'm so cool I'm the fucking evil guy that's gonna suck my dick and that was

235
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,640
cool so then I'm so then I made a third character and I'm like okay who will be my next wacky dark

236
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,320
souls character to enter the blue glow and change people's lives for the better so I decided to make

237
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,600
a tank character and I'm gonna make him I'm gonna make him like the most defensive uh yes like high

238
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,640
vitality impossible to knock down fucking tank guy big fat fucking fat armor I named him tank

239
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,000
mcspank he's the coolest character ever and I wanted to unleash him upon the world but then I started

240
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,440
playing and I started realizing there's no fucking poise in this game poise doesn't do a goddamn thing

241
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,760
in this game and then I started looking it up and I realized it's not I'm not making it up it's not in

242
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:09,880
my head it's true they fucking they totally nerfed poise so like would you just describe what that

243
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:16,520
means in case they don't know yeah okay so poise is the stat like in dark souls one if you if you

244
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,600
get hit your character gets knocked back it'll like interrupt your attacks and shit but if you have

245
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,080
like high enough poise then nothing can like stop you so if you're in the the middle of an attack

246
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,200
getting hit by a sword won't stop you you can like walk through enemies like hits and like

247
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,520
just brush it off and keep walking that's what the poise is for and uh dark souls three it has a poise

248
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:43,000
stat but the poise stat does nothing it to the point where like it has to be a mistake it has to be

249
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,360
like a glitch people are assuming but because now I've been told that the poise also wasn't a thing

250
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,440
in dark souls two I can't verify that because I don't remember making a strength build in that

251
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,040
game okay but it doesn't matter if it were people wouldn't just be complaining about it now well

252
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,720
that's the thing because I I brought this up to my brother shade who's like an expert on all the

253
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,080
games and he was like oh yeah poise wasn't a thing in dark souls two and I was like oh well I don't

254
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,480
know if Jesse knows that because I've only heard it from you but I don't really read souls communities

255
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,080
or yeah well like I never would have noticed it except until like for the first time I made like

256
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:26,040
a tank kind of character right well that's shit like it like it just it just seems like a mistake

257
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,680
because they have stuff like the wolf ring which increases poise yeah it literally does nothing

258
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,760
because the poise stat is worthless and people discovered it'll get patched yeah a lot of people

259
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,880
there's people who like discovered like they went into the code of it and they like change

260
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,920
something around and they were able to activate poise by going into the code of the game but

261
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,920
then they got like soft banned from from software as though like they don't want people to have

262
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,760
poise well those people probably played online with that poise that you know they were probably

263
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,560
because if if other people don't have it then it's unfair but it just seems like weird and fishy like

264
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,280
you'd think by now there'd be like a statement on it where they'd say either like yeah we took it

265
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,280
off because of these reasons or yeah we made a mistake and we'll fix it I mean I assume it's

266
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,120
the same in the Japanese version which has been out for what six months you know four or three

267
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,280
months something it's a while well that's shit I also complain about magic because I haven't actually

268
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,680
done this myself because I I don't play as a pussy ass magic user but I hear magic is just

269
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:36,920
totally totally garbage I you know I haven't I haven't done much pvp but I just heard that

270
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,840
it's totally unviable I'll put you into 69 of torment

271
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,600
yeah yeah I don't know oh by the way though I was just messing around for the first time

272
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,200
just a few minutes ago using the spell what was it uh what is it it's the one where you turn into

273
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,600
like the background fucking camouflage or whatever it is it is the most fun I've ever had in a video

274
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,040
game I just I follow behind an enemy I'm in Irithyll right behind the giant like sword dancer ladies

275
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,920
I follow like an inch behind them as a statue and then when they turn around I just stop moving

276
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,520
and they bump into me and move around and I do this for like 10 minutes it's the most fun I've

277
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,120
ever had in a video game they don't know what the fuck's going on it's great stupid ass hollows

278
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,200
that's what I'm saying it is a spell oh yeah well there's also like the item the the white the white

279
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,080
branches do that too oh really oh I didn't know that that's cool yeah um yeah man I I got it so to

280
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,560
talk about builds because my my experience with this game was kind of funny because like you know

281
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,920
I've got my my friend Donsan who played this into Japanese version and he breezed through it played

282
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,480
it three times but by the time the English version came out and uh he was saying that he thought it

283
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,280
was kind of easy and then me and my brother Shade played it and we both beat it in 18 hours of

284
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,800
peace and we both thought it was really easy compared to the other games and like I talked about this

285
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,200
on Twitter and then people were like what are you talking about this game is no easier than the

286
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,440
others it's just as hard and I was like look if I replayed Bloodborne I would have a harder time

287
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,280
than I did playing this game for the first time okay well first of all I'm not sure you should

288
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,360
compare it on a direct thing with Bloodborne because that is a different sort of game but I

289
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,640
think right we just played Dark Souls 1 not too long ago and I find it a very similar experience

290
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,200
the the pace is a little bit faster in this but I don't I don't know that seems like this

291
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,520
this felt like the the shortest and easiest of the games to me where I there's nothing that

292
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,600
there was nothing that gave I never died more than three times on the same thing until like the final

293
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,520
bosses like the the brothers and Osiris were like the only things that killed me more than three times

294
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,240
and uh and in each one was like five so it was just like but I don't know I don't know how much of

295
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,400
that was my build because once I was talking about it online everyone was telling me like

296
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,720
they had a much harder time with it or they took a lot longer than I did well did you did you get

297
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,120
all the secrets and stuff and I was like yeah I got there's like a venture I the 18 hours was

298
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,040
before I did all the secret levels once I did them all like I went back and did them it was like

299
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:16,680
closer to 21 hours but I still felt like I just kind of steamrolled most of the game you know and

300
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,800
then I figured out did you go into the the catacombs of the fucking underground lava place because

301
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,680
that was that once fucking nightmare that's gonna be like five hours to clear out well maybe not

302
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,720
that long but a while after I was already pretty strong I mean we just did it on digi bros and on

303
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,520
like a new game and we we like went there right in the catacombs we just went straight to that level

304
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,440
and Victor cleared it in the span of three episodes you know so I don't know I but then again the thing

305
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,000
is that all of us we later realized played our first run of the game with strength builds we

306
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,080
all played putting everything into vigor and strength and and like a little bit of endurance

307
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,880
and and like vitality I mean that's that's easy mode that's easy mode for sure right well that's

308
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,560
the thing like I don't know like to what extent that is like literally easy mode but you know we

309
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:13,320
all played like naked do all the roles and just have a giant sword and that's your like your method

310
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,920
you know like giant sword plus 10 kill everything in one hit run through you know and it definitely

311
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,960
felt easier that way and then once I did try to play like a different type of character that

312
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,120
wasn't all strength then I immediately was like a lot more frustrated like okay this is a lot harder

313
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,760
playing anything other than strength so I do think that maybe the build is like because I think in

314
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,920
every Dark Souls game every Souls game like you can there is built in like difficulty settings

315
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,280
you know like the way you play changes the difficulty of the game and I think that might

316
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,960
be more true in this game than it's ever been before where strength build really is like an easier

317
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,240
difficulty setting of the game than I mean but why would that be there's there's just the one answer

318
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,880
that like I mean the more the tougher you are like a big health bar what it translates to is

319
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,760
you're able to make more mistakes and that's pretty much it because like if you're a ranger it like I've

320
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,920
heard a lot of people have actually played like with a bow in this game that like using the short bow

321
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,200
is is totally a viable way to play and like you can just cheese almost every boss just by staying

322
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,080
far away and just backing up continuously and firing arrows so like I don't know there's uh

323
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,480
there's lots of ways to cheese things and buffing your health as far as it'll go rate making yourself

324
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,120
strong and then just giving yourself the ability to you know make mistakes I guess it's just that it's

325
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,160
so easy to do in this game because in the other games I always grind it at the start like in Dark

326
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,320
Souls uh or rather in uh in Bloodborne because that was the first one I played all the way through

327
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:47,320
I spent like five hours just grinding souls and and vials so that I would never run out of vials

328
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,280
like right at the start of the game before I made any progress and then like in all the other games

329
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,360
I would always have parts where I had to grind for souls or grind for tight tight night and

330
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,800
shit and then in this game like by the time because you start off with a boss fight like right at

331
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,360
the beginning and by the time you get to Firelink Shrine you can immediately level up five or six

332
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,120
times and then in the second level you find a guy who gives you five free level ups you know

333
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,680
and so but at a dark cost yeah but that dark cost doesn't have any really negative effects

334
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,880
oh it can't use your worst effect it makes you ugly that's yeah yeah yeah but it doesn't have

335
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,920
any like it's a lore effect mostly like in in in the previous games like like take Demon Souls

336
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,440
like if you were well me in this game you know you can ember yourself and it gives you a longer

337
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,920
life bar but like in Demon Souls the only way you could become human was to kill a boss you know

338
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:47,480
so you more likely spent the entire game as as a hollow with half a health bar you know well like

339
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,760
three quarters because you'll use the cling ring probably right but yeah you still are always going

340
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,160
to have a reduced health bar because it's such a huge risk to be human because if you die as a human

341
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,640
then your world tendency gets darker and the whole game gets harder yeah so like for me I would beat

342
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,000
a boss and then I would immediately kill myself in the nexus so that I wouldn't um you know darken

343
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,200
my world tendency uh because I didn't want the game to get that much harder so like I don't feel

344
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,160
like there's any real trade-off for hollowing in this game like you you gain five level ups and

345
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,520
there's really nothing to stop you all right I mean that is true the the effects of the hollowing

346
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,680
are are purely aesthetic and like ending relative that just fucks with like the the path you can

347
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:34,680
take but I don't know I the game's like trading the normal hollow it's doing it's it's doing a new

348
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,880
direction hollows are out embering is in lords of cinders are what the cool kids are doing now

349
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,480
and I think it's cool and I just did the uh the the dark ending the usur your usurpation of the fire

350
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,320
ending and I thought it was fucking tight some of the coolest shit happens along that line I have

351
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,360
not seen that ending yet you haven't seen oh dude it's the coolest I think was angry I've been I've

352
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,360
been saving it for baba duke spook because it seems like something he would do and I haven't

353
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,720
thought his storyline was over yeah well his let's play storyline is over but

354
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,160
me playing the game is never over dude you gotta gotta get him his betrothed you know that was just

355
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:17,320
the end of his seventh life who knows how many he has yeah I don't know he's like the doctor he

356
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,080
regenerates but he's always the same guy I want to shout out real quick um my favorite boss my

357
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:30,040
favorite thing in all the dark souls games thus far has been um maiden astrea that boss fight is

358
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:36,040
the coolest thing that ever happened and it really is the best thing in any of the things but uh

359
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,000
there's one in this game that comes close it's not as good but I love it dearly and it affected me

360
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,120
greatly in my in my playthrough so uh I played the entire my entire new game plus cosplaying as an

361
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,440
undead legion member and I was I was making the gesture at everyone I met I was fucking wearing the

362
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,680
armor the whole time I used uh the the the wolf greatsword the undead legion is the coolest thing

363
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,720
that's ever happened uh since maiden astrea and I'll tell you why it's because these motherfuckers

364
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,320
like the when I heard the fucking I forget who said um that that guy me at the beginning

365
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,480
who's like the uh the crestfallen warrior of this game is a is a uh what's the word uh

366
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,160
deserter of the undead legion he's wearing the armor and shit and he he tells you like it's a

367
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,560
it's a bunch of dudes they're all really strong they have this they've consumed wolf blood to allow

368
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,360
them to to to do these inhuman fighting techniques that a normal person can't do with these giant

369
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,960
greatswords and they don't use shields because those are for pussies and um they he in his own

370
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,200
words they will bury a fucking kingdom at the first sign of the abyss spreading into it is that

371
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,240
not the coolest thing these people have no tolerance for your fucking darkness and they

372
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,040
will do whatever it takes to crush it and then when you you go go into the boss fight and all

373
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,520
these motherfuckers are going absolutely berserk they're fucking murdering each other they just keep

374
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,280
picking themselves back up because they're undead they go kill each other and then they fall down

375
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,920
I don't know why they're doing that I I think they were like fucked up by uh Aldrich or something

376
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,640
but but it was the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life it was the best boss fight

377
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,880
since main Australia they are the cutest I love them I want to be one they're my best friends

378
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,680
undead legion for life I love them so much I definitely thought the moment when they started

379
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,040
fighting each other I was like holy fucking shit it was the most creative thing I've seen in forever

380
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,800
I was a little disappointed when I found out that that some of them are specifically on your side

381
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,200
like the ones that have red eyes are fighting with you and the other ones are fighting against

382
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,000
now hang on I I looked into that that is not true because I many a time fighting those guys

383
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,040
die antagonize them and every single one including the red eyes will gang up on you they uh the red

384
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,040
eyes are that's what I I had thought that they were just fighting each other but that they would

385
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,480
turn on you I mean uh my brother told me otherwise maybe it's a new game plus thing because I'll

386
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,760
tell you those red eyes attacked me many times so that's that is not that's cool because that's

387
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,000
what I wanted it to be was just that they were like they were fighting each other but just out of

388
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,280
fucking like those guys are just going crazy in there they're just going fucking berserk it's

389
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:14,040
the coolest thing ever god that's the best I don't know like uh and and the uh the nameless king

390
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,480
shout out shout out that guy as the most spectacular boss I haven't seen the nameless

391
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,160
king yet actually oh he's he's a toughy he's a toughy yeah because on my on my uh first game

392
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:30,040
is like I because I did the thing where in this game it lets you if you beat the game you can go

393
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,760
you can still keep playing so I went back and I wanted to bring that up because actually just

394
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,800
now just a few minutes ago I I got my ending and I did that and the first time I instantly

395
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,600
reset because I fucked up I didn't want to but I did so this time uh I want to talk about the

396
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,120
lore implications or if this is just non-diagetic gameplay or something because I did that I I did

397
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,440
the usurpation of the fire thing so I think you like steal it or something and I walked back just

398
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,120
to see what's going on and the uh the the kill of the first flame like the the sword the the

399
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,800
bonfire there like there's no fire there it's like gone out and so I go back to fire link uh and I

400
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:13,800
see that Ludlith is dead he was alive before now he's dead and nothing else has changed so it's

401
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,760
making me wonder if this is like canon or or what happens if you do a different ending Ludlith is

402
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,680
Ludlith is always dead if you go back after okay so just because he died when when they activated

403
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,120
did you do a new you know continue after you uh if with a different ending you know what I'm

404
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,600
saying did you guys do that I haven't done a second I have not done a second continuation after

405
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,000
I don't know what the fuck I like it feels if I don't I I want to I want to bring this up because

406
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,560
this feels like something that is actually like wrong like this shouldn't be happening but they're

407
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,600
doing it just to let you play around in the world and like I like that I always liked how harsh that

408
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,760
the other games were like if you go fight the final boss you better be ready for new game plus

409
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,480
like it was well that's a thing though I said there was never there was never a warning for it

410
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,240
yeah and I think that like I I understand like doing it that way because you know thematically it

411
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,400
makes sense it's a brutal game you know but like I do think that there was something to be said for

412
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,240
like like for instance I I still haven't played the DLC in Dark Souls one because I straight up forgot

413
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,600
like I went to the final boss beat him and then remembered like during the final cut scene that

414
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,640
I had not done the DLC and I was like fuck I completely fucked up and there's no way I could

415
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,520
just like you know I'd have to play through the whole fucking game because you have to get all

416
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,800
the way to Duke's archives to even get into the DLC you know um and then Bloodborne kind of does

417
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,560
the same thing if you if you beat the final boss then you got to play all the way back through so

418
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,440
like for instance when uh Game Grumps were were doing the DLC like they came back to the game

419
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,680
they had to play all the way up to that point in new game plus just to be able to to do it on the

420
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:54,040
show it's like I I like that I can just have one character who I can just leave there if I want to

421
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,680
you know like that I can go back and do everything possible before I go to new game plus and have

422
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,320
all the items I want and be like completely prepared and you know have done everything and

423
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,680
and if I wanted to have like let's say you just wanted to have a character who you leave in that

424
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:14,120
state like so that you can just dick around in the end game you know like just have a guy who's

425
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,600
always perpetually at the end of the game no no don't like it I don't want it don't want it

426
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,720
because what that they're just they're catering it to uh to to the casual audience and I don't

427
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,640
like it I think you should have to play I don't think that caters the casual audiences

428
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:32,840
they're sacrificing narrative coherence for for you know convenience and I don't think that's

429
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:38,760
the trade-off I want well I don't think I have to suspend my disbelief at all to understand that I am

430
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,160
already done with the game and this is like a standard feature in most video games but Dark Souls

431
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,720
isn't a standard game it's better than a standard game and it should be held to that standard

432
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,200
like I said this earlier that I think that the goal of this game and I think this is true of a

433
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,600
lot of things in this game that I think the goal of it is to be playable long term in a way that

434
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,800
the other games aren't as much where I really think that with the other souls games they put a

435
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,680
lot of value on the first experience and a lot of value on like you know the learning experience

436
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,080
you'd have with it and like that like that's why there's so many traps and things like that but

437
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,640
none of that stuff matters as much on your second and third and fifth and eighth playthrough

438
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,280
because once you know it you can just easily avoid all the traps okay but here's the thing here's the

439
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,480
thing if you just if you just look into it ahead of time you'll know that fighting the final boss

440
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,040
triggers the end so you shouldn't be looking into it ahead of time if you're on but you should just

441
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,440
play the game experience what happens and then you'll know it's a game that's meant to be played

442
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,360
multiple times I think it's a reasonable trade-off I rather it's not one you shouldn't do that you

443
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,640
should make it I think I would much like I don't know that I would have gone well okay like because

444
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,480
I am so into this game I would have done it but like it would have been so much more disheartening

445
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,120
to find out about the Nameless King after I had already reset my game and I probably wouldn't have

446
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,200
run back and done it immediately but you see the thing you're protesting against is the very thing

447
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,560
that makes the game unique it's unwillingness but I don't bend before the whims of the masses

448
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,520
who want convenience overall with the other games and we don't need it again that's that's

449
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,440
that's stupid this game isn't just those games but why why does every why does every single one

450
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,920
have to be equally a pain in the ass why do they have to be equally narratively coherent because

451
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,960
they're stories because they're fucking art I don't want them to just I don't I don't I think

452
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,880
the trade-off is worth it I don't think okay I mean what you're talking about is a trade-off

453
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,280
and if you think it's worth it then fair but I don't I don't there are some who would argue that

454
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Dark Souls has never been narratively coherent how do you love them apples okay let me tell you

455
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,480
right now why is it that when you kill an enemy you get their soul and when you die to them

456
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,440
why don't they get your soul in its game over forever why is that does anyone know who gives a

457
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,280
fuck that's a real question I'm just I'm helping your point god damn it but you're a I don't know

458
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,040
you're uh because you're a special guy you're not special though you're not special at all

459
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,880
everyone else who dies you get their soul instantly like when you kill the crestfallen warrior

460
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,080
you get his soul how come he doesn't get your soul when he kills you but how do you know he doesn't

461
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,480
get your soul that's what I mean start playing immediately never been narratively coherent

462
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,480
because if they're all in dead they should all be coming back like you but instead you get their

463
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,120
souls for some reason that's always been a concession for gameplay sake that doesn't make sense

464
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,320
in terms of the story so it's not like there's no well if that that thing seems so glaring to me

465
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,400
that I think that there's something I'm missing and there's a reason why I just don't understand

466
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,120
why that's happening you can't just say it's so perfect that if it doesn't make sense the problem

467
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,320
must be with me I'm not I'm not saying that it must be with me I'm saying I'm suspicious that it is

468
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,600
with me but I agree it makes me uh yeah okay it's not perfect it's not perfect I still don't

469
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,600
completely understand the complaint and I have no idea dude just just think about it when you

470
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,520
kill the crestfallen you're saying that yeah being able to play after you beat it you're talking about

471
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,480
npc god damn it there's only three of us you shouldn't be interrupting me I won't stand for

472
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,120
this go on go on I was just having the realization of what you were saying I wasn't cutting you off I

473
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,720
was just saying oh you mean npcs not enemies I thought you meant enemies yeah I'm gonna I mean

474
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,520
like when you just if you just attack the crestfallen warrior before he goes hollow

475
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,640
when he dies you get his souls and he doesn't come back why is that he isn't undead he should

476
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,320
be coming back right because he's gone full hollow well that's what I mean is that you just attack

477
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,080
him okay I've always been a precedent for these narrative concessions in for the gameplay

478
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,800
now wait I want to be super clear did you that that is not correct he was not fully hollow

479
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,200
he was just some dude hanging out well like when you attack him right there or forget him

480
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,520
they're like law trek or any other npc you meet like the blacksmith he's got a purpose when you

481
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:47,000
kill him he doesn't come back you know I just kind of always thought the implication was that everyone's

482
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,160
kind of at the end of their rope in the souls games because if you don't kill them they will

483
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:57,720
eventually die of their own accord and if you do kill them it's like you fucking ended it but

484
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:04,440
it's also possible that because time is convoluted in Lordran that that you're really just ending

485
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,160
I've always hated that fucking excuse that you can you can literally throw that at any problem in

486
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,440
the game and it'll just go away yeah well that's probably why they wrote it in there it's a really

487
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,400
convenient it probably is it was the only way to make sense of the idea that warriors are constantly

488
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,920
showing up in in your game and and disappearing you know okay but like Logan right Logan's on

489
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:31,080
a quest you meet Logan and then you kill him why doesn't he come back why is he's an undead

490
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,800
why did that happen he's got a purpose doesn't make sense doesn't make sense I guess you could

491
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,640
call it a narrative concession well let's think about the we've acknowledged that this is the worst

492
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,120
game ever okay go on let's talk about the real problem with this game is yeah um it's been out

493
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,520
for like a month now where the fuck are all my lore videos what are those guys doing they're

494
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,720
coming a little bit they're coming I want to understand what I've seen I want to understand it

495
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,640
I think I've got a pretty good idea of what's happened in the game uh there's this guy the

496
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:06,840
pontiff he found Aldrich Aldrich was an asshole who liked to eat people he he made him into a god

497
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,520
he built a church around that guy something something lords of cinder something something

498
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,160
guys in the castle princes they were gay or something for each other it caused all kinds of

499
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,960
problems for people they had to they had to get the fuck out of there and that caused the end of

500
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,760
the world so I gotta I gotta ask you guys about something that I think a lot of people have had

501
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,840
as like they're possibly biggest complaint with this game okay that uh that I don't think I consider

502
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:39,000
a complaint personally but I'm curious about your thoughts is the like the sheer amount of stuff

503
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,240
that's taken from the first game ah that's um okay I mean I can see why you might think that

504
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,720
that could be a problem and honestly sometimes you know maybe maybe a little bit thick maybe laid

505
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,320
on a little bit thick but overall I do not hate the idea that this is like it's like a grand return

506
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,800
you know it feels earned the things that were like the visit to anor Londo it's like it's not like

507
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,840
anyone who says like oh they just copy paste at anor Londo that is so fucking lazy like no there

508
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,440
was there was serious craft put into this like reimagining of anor Londo and it's great and like

509
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,840
like when you when you see the giant blacksmith and you bring and you see him dead and you grab

510
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,320
his soul and you bring it to Andre and Andre is like oh I'm so sad that guy that was my brother

511
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,360
that was the most feels moment in the whole fucking game dude that was intense feels it was great it was

512
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:30,040
great because like you played you know they've got to respect for each other man it's that yeah see

513
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,360
that's the kind of like there's there's love in this shit it's not it's not lazy at all so you

514
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:40,600
know I'm uh sometimes a little thick overall definitely in favor of it I think it works

515
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,920
wait what's going on I spaced out for like 20 god damn it Jesse how do you feel about the

516
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,720
how do you feel about the references to Dark Souls one in this game I love it needs to be more of

517
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:57,080
them there I love everything I love fan service I want it in my face all the time yeah so like you

518
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:03,240
know I was rewatching um Matthew Matosis's video on Dark Souls two from way back because uh I don't

519
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,280
think he hates that game enough he doesn't hate it as much as I do the pure the pure unadulterated

520
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,320
hatred that I have but uh you know he he complained a little bit about the references to Dark Souls

521
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,720
one in that game and I thought it was interesting because I think that the reason that the references

522
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,320
to Dark Souls one can be annoying in that game is because they feel like they're there just to

523
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,560
make references to Dark Souls one even though the story of Dark Souls two feels like it could have

524
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,480
been a totally unrelated yeah the issue is that they tell you it has been so long and everything

525
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,400
has been forgotten from an age oh by the way would you like to join the Sunbroke covenant

526
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,200
like it's like come on guys come on and the Lords of Cinder or the or the souls of the four bosses

527
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,200
of the first game or in the bosses of the second game or something like that yeah it doesn't it

528
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,760
just doesn't seem like there was a reason to do that that's right with Dark Souls three this game

529
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,800
like everything about the story is a sequel to Dark Souls one like it's everything is relevant

530
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,720
because the whole point of it is that it's like a bunch of twins like you're fighting like it's

531
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,040
basically just raising the stakes to the next level in the first game you had to fight all these

532
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,160
bosses just to get to one Lord of Cinder now you got to fight fucking five of them you know like

533
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:21,960
and and you're no longer just in undead so from Vadi's latest video he kind of implied that like

534
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:29,000
something that Miyazaki said implied that you the the ashen warriors that you are in this game

535
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,400
are like basically comprised of ashes of people who failed to link the fire in before like so

536
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,840
basically rather than being a chosen undead you're like the remnants of chosen undead who

537
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,680
failed well if you if you think about it literally everyone who is an undead who did not link the

538
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:55,720
flame which is most people would fall under that description so that is accurate right I just to me

539
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,200
I always had the impression that that you're you like everything in this game is more powerful

540
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,960
than Dark Souls one you're not just an undead you're this next level type of undead this like

541
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:12,360
right this one who who who can ember himself and become even more powerful like you said uh yeah

542
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,920
like you're dealing with you know many Lords of Cinder instead of one and I feel that the you know

543
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,280
your power is sort of reflective of that you're an elevated individual and I had this because

544
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,400
if you've seen my video about like the it is confusing though it is confusing that is true

545
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,240
it's definitely confusing and like when the game was first coming out I thought for sure the main

546
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,880
character was going to be someone who had linked the fire before like you also were a Lord of

547
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,200
Cinder because it would call back to the fact that you've probably beaten the first game you know

548
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:46,040
but um but you know I think that in each game the the idea of your character kind of matches the

549
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,760
mechanics and Bloodborne you're a hunter and therefore you're very aggressive and you're

550
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,640
rewarded for attacking enemies head on and you're you're meant to feel more powerful whereas in

551
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,360
Dark Souls one you're more clunky and slow because you're just another fuck off undead like everybody

552
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,240
else yeah and in this game you feel a little faster you feel a little stronger because you're

553
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,680
not just any undead you're in you're this new thing the unkindled you're like a different

554
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,320
type of guy and you're you're a little stronger and better and the kind of person who could take

555
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:21,000
down five fucking Lords of Cinder you know I guess I mean you fight fucking giant scaleless

556
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,720
seeth the god of dragons in the last and I mean you do okay and you're just some undead

557
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,960
I don't know I guess I see your point though yeah it's well I mean I'm not saying that you're

558
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,640
you're like super weak like the point is that you rise up above all the other undead but like the

559
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,280
mechanics of that game are that you have like when you start off you're pretty normal and weak

560
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,000
you don't really have like the speed and prowess that you have in Bloodborne where you can fucking

561
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,280
sidestep and juke and shit like you're you know you're doing fat heavy rolls and falling all over

562
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,040
yourself unless you're naked so and like in this game it's more like the armor is more like Bloodborne

563
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:01,480
people call it fashion souls where yep the you know the stats of the armor don't really matter all

564
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,760
that matter is that you wear it yeah that's right yeah um I don't know I think it's somewhere in that

565
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,400
middle middle ground I think that's communicated well in who you are and just the idea that you

566
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,560
have to go kill five people who are all on the level of Gwyn is really cool to me you know though

567
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:24,040
I mean just just to play devil's advocate wasn't Gwyn like kind of fucked up and like not at full

568
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,840
power because he had linked the fire so isn't he like weaker than he should have been I mean you

569
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,560
know I mean technically all these guys would be I guess because they've all linked the fire but

570
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,600
yeah I don't know I mean I don't know the guy the crestfallen warrior guy implies that you're not

571
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,880
fit to lick the boots of these people they are as gods they are the best guys yeah but I always

572
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,640
kind of thought that was because like I mean when you play through the games the way that you get

573
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:53,560
stronger is like they perform a ritual on you using souls that you collect and that like just feeds

574
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,640
into you and like your power level rises basically and you know that's that's what I always got out

575
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,040
of it that is like your job is to go out there collect souls use them to get strong and that's

576
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,960
like when you are at the end like if if somebody killed you and like stuck took your soul at the

577
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,400
end it would be worth like a billion souls because like you fucking right you know yeah that's an

578
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:21,880
interesting thought um video games I like them yeah they're pretty cool but yeah yeah I like all

579
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,120
the references to dark souls one I like how the references to dark souls two are kind of subtle

580
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:31,880
and hidden there's that giant tree outside which I like yeah there's there's that there's like the

581
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,280
the old lady who sells you stuff might be a reference to the old ladies from dark souls two

582
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,320
yeah but I love that I love that the way that that and I'll talk about this in a video if I finally

583
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,360
fucking do it but at the end of that hallway you see Andre and like immediately if you're if you've

584
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,480
played dark souls one you're like oh my fucking god it's Andre and it's literally him it's him yeah

585
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,720
and then the dark souls two ladies kind of tucked off to the side where you can't see her at first

586
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,160
and I I really think that's intentional I really think you feel that in the game you feel a little

587
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,320
bit of like the okay we can't like get rid of it completely but let's let's focus on the money

588
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,400
maker here you'll find like you'll find characters from dark souls two like you'll find some of their

589
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:15,080
armor sets and some of their bodies laying around you guys are so goddamn stupid like there's this

590
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,120
like like dark souls two was such a great shame that there's a conspiracy to erase it in dark

591
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,760
well I didn't say that they put your own ass on this you can think about it like this Jesse

592
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:30,440
me jacking yourselves off for your stupid illogical Jesse I never said anything like that I never

593
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,160
said for it just I never said they were trying to hide it I just said that it's not prominent

594
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,800
but it's all well of course the the nostalgia for the first game is going to be more prominent

595
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,520
it's the first fucking game and I can consider this though I'm being supposedly terrible and

596
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,520
unworthy dark souls two is look dark souls two is the worst game ever made and I'd rather kill

597
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:54,680
fucking idiot and I'd rather kill you I will shut my penis off and stab myself through my ear

598
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,080
into my brain and die just so I don't have to play dark souls you can you can think about it Jesse

599
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:05,160
as Miyazaki just didn't direct dark souls two so he's only interested in continuing his word

600
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,960
Ray is too good in the force why was Iron Man so mean when I feel like it's all the same

601
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:17,560
complaint it's all the same stupid shit Jesse you're you're you're like Aldrich eater of complaints

602
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:22,360
and you eat all the wines that people make and you use them to fuel you yeah dark souls two is a

603
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:28,680
terrible game you're an idiot liking it is the problem making the world worse Jesse you're

604
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:36,600
actually ruining all right all right without being an idiot why it's terrible I dare you

605
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:43,000
mind the controls suck the animation the level is every dark you're what the fuck I can't even

606
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,400
keep up with how much wrong you're spewing at me right now feel a little bit floaty uh they don't

607
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,120
feel as as as okay okay none of the animation is fucking garbage you're just saying stuff that's

608
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,440
fucking wrong you realize that you have to realize that you're just saying shit that isn't even true

609
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:02,600
how are you Jesse I can prove it onto you and I will once I start putting out those yeah once

610
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,880
I see you die a hundred times on the first level and blame the game for it like Aaron

611
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:11,800
fucking Hanson I'm sure you'll prove it to me how bad it is yeah I don't I don't hate it for the

612
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,760
fact that I die all the time I hate it because every mechanic is bad and the game they're the exact

613
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,160
fucking same as every other game in the series they're not they're nothing like that I don't

614
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:26,360
I don't really see where you're getting that uh there's like some some tuning differences that's

615
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,840
for sure I don't know whatever it's entirely different nothing is the same all of it does

616
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,240
nothing makes sense it's all retarded they changed everything for the worst and it's a broken shitty

617
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,800
game you're just saying these like grand like statements that don't have any specifics in them

618
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,440
you're just making you want me to spend this entire podcast talking about dark souls

619
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:49,800
dark souls are so much better than in dark souls one I enjoyed the controls are better let's see that

620
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,240
was fun dual wielding is how can you the fucking jumping is so much better jumping is such bullshit

621
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,400
in dark souls you jump like a you jump like one inch in dark souls by the way I want to drink

622
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,520
it possible this is people need to hear about this because in dark souls three is a big fucking

623
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,920
problem because the way you jump is you click the left stick and when you're ready improvement that

624
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:14,280
no it's not a problem it's an improvement it is a problem because when I'm using the left stick

625
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,320
to click I have to move it and I fucking move up my fucking movement every time I'm doing it fun fact

626
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:24,840
what fun fact I learned from victor in both the ps3 and pc versions you can change that very easily

627
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,160
in the menu I I know but I don't want to use a I tried it with a couple other buttons it wasn't

628
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:35,080
working out fucking I said it not on the first I'm baffled that you can prefer the circle jumping

629
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,960
over the clicking jump in I like the circle jumping is better it's true the first time it's

630
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,640
horrible it's impossible fucking roll by accident it's so easy to do it's no you just do it right

631
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,240
and you don't have a problem first time I tried when I started up dark souls three and I was trying

632
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:55,240
to get that first item that you have to jump for in the very tutorial level yeah I had to I took

633
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,640
10 tries on that I was gonna say it took me about because of the fucking stick jump and then as soon

634
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,320
as I changed it to circle jump I made it on the first try it was the easiest thing in the world

635
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,520
well like there you go all you got to do is be dashing and then hit the circle button yeah it's

636
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,000
totally fucked up and you fucking roll half the time it's never happened all right all right what

637
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,560
is blowing you guys's mind about just fucking clicking the thumbstick it's like that's my because

638
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,360
it changes the direction that you're moving the direction doesn't it's way easier and way more

639
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,600
accurate it's fucking every time I tried to make that jump because you have to break slightly to

640
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,320
the left to make that jump right and every single time when I clicked the stick my guy would change

641
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,720
direction a little and I just missed it's a very precise jump you're trying to make and even that

642
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,360
little bit of fucking up guys just suck at video games because you're totally wrong on this one

643
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,600
the clicking the thumbstick is a massive improvement that dark souls two made over dark souls one

644
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,720
and you don't want to admit it because you're just clinging to anything you can find to make dark

645
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,440
souls two a good game dark souls two is a fucking great game all right there's only there's look

646
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,840
there's a few changes from dark souls two that I think were great ideas that they did keep in dark

647
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,880
souls three uh fast climbing up ladders oh yeah that's a good one and fast falling down ladders

648
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,480
which is much better in this game because in dark souls two you could fucking hurt yourself from

649
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:14,120
fast falling which is law retarded um looking about if you fast fall down a ladder like two

650
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:19,880
two distance I don't fucking believe that at all I don't believe you I don't believe you I've never

651
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,840
seen that shit I've seen it before if you fall if you fast fall down a long enough ladder it

652
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,680
hurts you here we've got we've got jesse defending every little point and did you just make and

653
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,880
shit up to shit on no it's this this is fucking go look it up man like this is something I'm

654
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,880
complaining about day one that I don't fucking fall off ladders and shit like that's like a dark

655
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,440
souls bags of sand comment what does that mean it's fucking true though what does that fucking

656
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:49,640
hurt yourself by falling down ladders you're saying dumb shit fucking the okay fucking

657
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:55,640
lucatile is the best NPC ever lucatile is boring and I don't give a shit about her come on dude

658
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:01,160
she's come on I tried so hard to care about her like I cared about solar I tried and I got very

659
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,520
far but in the end it didn't fucking matter because she's boring and I don't she's she's

660
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,560
every NPC in dark enough about fucking dark souls two for no all right all right I will never have

671
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,360

fucking red hair a green ass god I want to just I want to marry him somehow I knew that this all

675
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,400
all this came down to just that she's a redhead you know she's just a rehash of the maiden black

676
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,320
she fucking she's the maiden black too they just tried to make her again only they put a green

677
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,160
cloak on her and I like the green cloak I actually I do I like the maiden green overall

678
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,160
but she's confused with the lore I don't even know what the fuck she is anyway enough about

679
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,480
Dark Souls 2 forget about I want to talk about Dark Souls 3 and the final boss because we were

680
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,720
talking about bosses before Dark Souls 3 sucks I disowned Dark Souls 3 I'm all about Dark Souls

681
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,040
2 now listen to me talk about Dark Souls 3 all right so the great that we were talking before

682
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:01,400
about references to Dark Souls 1 and all Dark Souls and that's why he's such a great boss I can wear

683
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:06,040
that fucking smelter demon armor and look like a member of Guar you can't do that shit and

684
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,280
demon sucks ass all right armor does not suck ass the armor is the most fucking armor in the

685
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,520
entire series I got my fucking you're literally showing off your fucking stomach because you

686
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,920
want to get fucked by all the boys in town all right let's move on I do I want to say no I do I

687
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,080
want King Vendor to come a fucking river in my abs that's what I want I want it all night

688
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:29,320
all right okay all right let's settle down because the what is he called the the Lord of

689
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,600
Cinder after it what's his name it's like the the the the soul of of cinder right that's it yes

690
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:40,680
okay the soul of cinder is the coolest final boss and the best final boss in any of the soul born

691
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:47,400
games in my humble opinion and that's cool for several reasons you should that's a fucking laugh

692
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,440
all right shut up jessie shut the fuck up you're not allowed to talk about dark souls 2 anymore

693
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,840
all right I don't even know how many of these opinions jessie has

694
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,920
is being just great nishonor there's no way he really thinks nishonor is better than the fucking

695
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,800
I'm getting me I'm getting fucking me yes all right it's just a prank bro

696
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,480
all right the soul of cinder is he's a two phase boss and the first phase

697
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,920
all right I'll just tell you what he is he's he is every person who's ever linked the fire before

698
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,680
as an amalgam so what that translates to and you see this in his moveset is he is every player

699
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,720
character up to this point of the game and he's Gwyn on top of it and when that when you get to

700
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:37,160
halfway through the fight and the Gwyn's the motif of Gwyn's theme comes in on top of the theme

701
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,240
that's already playing and he fucking lights a sword on fire and starts doing Gwyn moves

702
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:47,480
it's just it's the perfect it's the perfect fucking thing it's okay it's the it's the coolest thing

703
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,480
that I've ever seen or you've ever seen I know that for a fucking fact because you're

704
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,760
jessie bought a fucking figurine of this boss by the way you do where's your nishonor bobblehead

705
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,440
I don't fucking see one on your show they don't make one because the world is full of idiots like

706
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,200
you who don't appreciate Dark Souls 2 and all of its majesty and artistry that's why they don't

707
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,400
make one I'd buy a hundred nishondras I'd buy 50 000 nishondra toys if they made them but they

708
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:14,760
don't because they're all dummies and fuckboys all right anyway he's he's a great final boss he's

709
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:20,600
one of these like uh it's like fighting one of you sort of only he's like super player it's like

710
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:25,080
a rival fight sort of yeah that's right and those are always the best way to end uh a big fucking

711
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,600
because like they challenge the mechanics they they use the mechanics you've been fucking learning

712
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:34,840
to deal with he's the best it's awesome okay I definitely felt that like in terms of because

713
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,080
the first time I went to that boss fight like because I didn't quite comprehend what I was seeing

714
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,760
at first oh yeah so I went in there and I was just like oh it looks beautiful the red flowers and

715
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,760
shit oh it's the right well the the arena is awesome but my first thought was just kind of like who

716
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,480
the fuck is this guy right because like I would say up until this point Garmin has been the best

717
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,320
boss in the Soulsborne games because he's someone who you you knew who he was bloodborne sucks it's

718
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:03,240
a fucking three out of ten okay but Garmin Garmin was someone you saw through the whole game yeah

719
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,760
he's always in like a wheelchair he's just this old guy you know and then you get to the final battle

720
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:14,280
and he fucking gets up and he's the strongest fucking guy ever you know it's awesome and it's like

721
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,600
you know there's been hunter battles throughout the whole game but he's like the ultimate hardest

722
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:24,520
most fucking like destroys you and his arena is amazing like it's the coolest fucking arena ever

723
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:29,240
I definitely think it's the best arena yeah even then I yeah it's a it's a tough competition

724
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,480
because the imagery of the fucking house burning in the background is so fucking cool I mean it's

725
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:38,120
just the flowers man you can't beat and like they try to put the flowers for Soul Cinder and I mean

726
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,280
it's nice it's nice but yeah that's why when I first went into Soul Cinder I was like all right

727
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,600
this arena looks just like Garmin's arena yeah and I don't know who the fuck this guy is because

728
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:52,680
it's not an established character like it was in that but then once I did realize that oh my god

729
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,960
he's every player character he's everyone who's leaked the fire then I was like oh this fucking

730
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:02,680
red like Garmin is a guy that you've gotten to know over the course of Bloodborne but this guy

731
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:08,040
shut up Jesse I'm saying a fucking profound point broke the cycle with this magical crown which is

732
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,360
the best guy I was thinking about what I was gonna say and I'm gonna fucking say it shut up

733
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:17,000
but Dark Souls 2 guy was a chick wasn't it wasn't N'Shawn? yeah she's the queen whatever all right I

734
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,160
was going to say that Dark Souls 2 guy wasn't N'Shawn I'm talking about the player character

735
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,840
if you do the DLC you get the magic crowns you break the cycle you don't have to link the fire

736
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:31,400
I'm gonna fucking kill you Jesse shut the fuck up I'm trying to say something okay all right

737
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:36,840
because my big old dick my big old butt Garmin's someone that you got to know

738
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,280
listen buddy you got to know Jesse I'm gonna fucking kill you

739
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,800
Garmin's someone you get to know over the course of Bloodborne but the Soul of Cinder

740
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,560
it's the player that you've gotten to know over the course of the entire series since Demon Souls

741
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:00,760
and for that reason once you make that connection it is it is it is a transcendent moment it's the

742
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:06,840
best fucking thing it's the coolest and that's what I was trying to say I gotta say that great point

743
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:13,080
yeah it was a great point I love that there's references to Demon Souls in this as well

744
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,320
although I will say that the biggest one I'm kind of torn about because the biggest Demon

745
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:22,440
Souls reference is that you get the storm ruler to fight the giant oh man that was the coolest

746
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,080
thing okay but go I want to yeah go on well I'll say that there's a way to make that the coolest

747
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:32,600
fight in the game yeah there is yeah there is do the whole if you do the whole uh Zygward Zygward

748
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:39,000
is by far the best character in this game he is my bro I love him intensely god he's the coolest

749
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,840
guy ever but go on Jesse do you know about the ending of the Zygward uh uh run like a storyline

750
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:50,600
no you oh my god it's the best fucking thing ever he he will fight yorm the giant with you

751
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,520
because he has the other storm ruler because him and dude let me set the stage for this a little

752
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,040
bit all right because let me let me just back up a little bit because I beat the game for the first

753
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:03,080
time and when you go into the arena cool internet guys fighting yorm for me okay well that that's

754
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,080
cool but this is also a cool thing about it well I when I beat that when I fought yorm for the first

755
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:13,400
time on his on his throne he's got a uh what's it called the the storm king the fucking storm

756
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,160
ruler the storm ruler sword yeah and you pick it up and you figure out to use it and you fight him

757
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,160
with it and it makes him pretty easy which is a little unfortunate but it's still a really fun

758
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:28,040
fight uh but in the description of that item it says like yorm uh kept one of these weapons with him

759
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:33,400
and gave one to a trusted companion eons ago before he linked the flame or whatever and then

760
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:39,560
like as I'm playing through the second time and I'm getting every NPC storyline uh Zygmire uh like

761
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:44,600
you just right zygward I've always fucked that up zygward is just like you just do his

762
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,120
shit and he's talking about like a friend he made a promise to and then you know you go along

763
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,960
you help him with the stuff and then you finally see at the end when you get to yorm's fucking

764
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,760
cutscene if you've done everything with zygward and you walk it he walks in holding the storm ruler

765
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,320
so all these he made a promise to his brother to fucking murder his ass if he ever turned

766
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:06,120
traitor on everybody so he's here to fulfill like this sad promise with his best friend from a million

767
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,600
fucking years ago using this legendary sword and it's like the coolest thing that ever happened

768
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,280
and I don't know if you guys know what happens to him afterward but I'm pretty sure he immediately

769
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,920
like dies slash goes hollow afterward because he's fulfilled his purpose it's the saddest most and

770
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:25,320
because all along zygward was the best bro he gives you fucking booze he gives you booze and

771
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,720
he toasts with it and you just hang out and he fucking will take naps just for fun in the middle

772
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,880
of wherever oh my god I love zygward so much he's the coolest guy in the world I definitely think

773
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:38,920
that that's like if you do all that then that boss fight is fucking awesome it's insane but for me

774
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:45,640
it was just like I went in there and I tried to fight him like twice without noticing the thing on his

775
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:51,320
throat oh really he takes a million billion like he takes no damage yeah I'm a strength guy I have

776
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,480
like I'm barely chipping away at his health and at first I thought it's kind of cool because I could

777
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,280
like this is just a big epic protracted struggle that you're like fighting this guy forever and it's

778
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,920
such a you know such a huge hassle but then he also can kill you in like two hits so it's

779
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:09,720
like yeah well I'd have to be able to survive fucking 15 minutes of fighting to do this and

780
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,800
then I noticed the item and I pick it up and I'm like oh my fucking god it's the storm ruler right

781
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:20,360
coolest fucking boss fight when you have zygward walk in there and he fucking says like my old friend

782
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:26,280
I've come to fulfill my promise to you have at thee it was it was the best part of the whole game

783
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,360
by far by far without that it's a little disappointing when you go in with the storm

784
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:36,600
ruler and you just destroy it takes five flights to kill him five yeah and he will not hit you

785
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:41,720
because he staggers so hard after you use it that you could just like fucking you just click the button

786
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:47,720
a few times and he's dead yeah yeah it went from like the most epic protracted struggle in the game

787
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:53,320
to the easiest fuckboy ever I wish they had made him a little bit harder that's just an

788
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:57,640
issue of like tweaking if you take like some kind of defense measure against you when you've got

789
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:03,880
that sword like you he can't do shit to you it's like yeah embarrassing and it just sucks because

790
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:10,120
the storm ruler in because like my defense of all the the references to dark souls one is that I

791
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:15,000
think that they are equally cool in this game like if you played this game not knowing if you

792
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,640
played this game not knowing anything about dark souls one then like sigmar sigward coming up the

793
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:24,920
elevator would still be like whoa an npc was on that elevator you know that's awesome and and and

794
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,440
then he goes into battle with you like whoa he went into battle with me and like all and going to

795
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:34,920
anor lando would still be like whoa this thing was up here you know this epic looking castle but I

796
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:40,760
think with that particular one then the storm ruler and demon souls was like the the whole idea

797
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:45,640
of it was you were fighting this giant fucking manor ray in the sky and it was insanity and then

798
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:50,600
in this game it's like a piss easy boss fight and so I just thought that that was the one

799
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:57,560
reference that didn't live up to what the original was you know I wouldn't be that harsh but I do

800
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:02,440
think it could have been improved with some some hb tweaking or something but then if you have

801
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,880
zygmire with you then it's fucking cool zygmire zygmire yeah oh i love fucking zygmire so much

802
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:16,040
he's my favorite i love him the undead legion zygward and uh darkmoon captain yorshka are my

803
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:23,320
best but that's my wife my best friend and my my bro team that's me playing dark souls jesse do you

804
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,000
have some more uh stuff you love about this game you want to talk about since how about those oh no

805
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,800
he hates this game how about those dark areas and dark souls too you had to use the torch and

806
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,920
fucking you had to light your way those oh yeah oh yeah i love this is the one useful mechanic

807
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,720
jesse this is the one dark souls three podcast we're gonna do are you sure you want to spend the whole

808
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:47,080
time leaving about dark souls too like jesse do we know you love this game to talk about all the

809
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:53,240
things you love about this game and how cool it ain't no other pony troll it down like jesse jesse

810
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,400
jesse tell tell me about tell me about the purple phantoms jesse tell me about the purple

811
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,120
phantoms oh yeah the mad phantoms yeah those are pretty cool yeah why are they cool jesse

812
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,960
why are they cool i guess if you actually want to hear jesse talk about this game you'll just

813
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:12,040
have to go watch the blue glow um i'm just clearly not interested in discussing it here

814
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:19,400
he'll he'll come around no wait let's talk about the fucking all the cool bosses in dark souls three

815
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:26,920
they're so okay yeah fucking okay never mind uh who's who's a cool boss i like dancer is the

816
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:32,040
hottest babe of all time i want to look at her but i want to touch her butt i want to get up in that

817
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:37,480
butt the dancer has by far the best but in all of dark souls in all of the series without a doubt

818
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:42,440
it's interfacing the entire time it's amazing i can't even like i don't know who would i consider

819
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,320
the they're all fucking rad there's so many good bosses well the two brothers were super awesome

820
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:51,800
that was a great fight yeah uh the fucking the two gay boys yeah they're awesome i i i think that

821
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:57,160
fight is like like the coolest thing but that fight pissed me off so bad because it was the only

822
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:02,120
one i had like a real like a trouble on like i found that one pretty easy actually for whatever

823
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:08,760
reason the teleporting it's that that guy's literally tips fedora teleports behind you uh

824
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:15,640
fucking i don't know whatever oh nothing personal like once they fuse together and the kid would

825
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:19,800
fucking throw all the magic at you and then teleport away oh there's the best i loved it

826
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:25,960
bitch but i think aldrich like in terms of the attacks and like how fucking rad the arena is and

827
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,680
everything like aldrich you know i i actually want to that's actually the one boss that i found a

828
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:36,280
little bit disappointed because uh disappointed in i mean it's like okay they had a choice when

829
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:41,960
they were designing aldrich like okay we've got a giant like consuming evil monster thing what are

830
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,600
we are we gonna like go the route of like having you fight a giant sludge monster thing or are we

831
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:51,720
gonna have it like you know use the powers of the people you know because like it's puppeting

832
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:56,840
gwyndolin which is really cool and it's cool for gwyndolin even though like god did you read the

833
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,720
description of that soul because it's like he's been like being consumed for like thousands of

834
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:06,520
years still alive in eternal torment yeah it's fucking horrific but like it's a i found it a

835
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:11,000
little bit disappointing because like you don't really get to see and experience aldrich there

836
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,800
should have been a cutscene for that for that fight what's that yeah there was a there i think

837
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,920
there should have been a cutscene dude there really should have been a part two where you've

838
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,960
defeated like the puppet and then he like rises out from the deep this giant fucking mass that's

839
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:30,120
like aldrich anything but a a blob that puppeteers well i mean because like all the other cutscenes

840
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:34,120
you see him come out of that cutscenes but yeah when you just when you go to fight aldrich you

841
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:39,160
just go in there and there should have been like a look at me i ate this guy and now this guy is

842
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,640
my guy he's a wooden little wooden puppet boy i i don't really mind that there isn't an intro

843
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:49,560
i was just a little bit disappointed by aldrich's presentation because he is like he is like the

844
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:57,240
dude yeah yeah i agree with i agree with both of you because of the fact that when i fought that

845
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:01,400
battle i didn't actually realize it was the same guy like i did not realize you didn't know it was

846
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:07,640
gwendolyn or aldrich um either like i didn't process like it says aldrich but i didn't process

847
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:12,040
that it was the blob guy because like the whole game i was like when i'm gonna fight the blob guy

848
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:16,200
you know right um because there was so much hype like he's got the church built around him and the

849
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:22,200
pontiff like based a whole religion on him he's like the thing and then it's gwendolyn like okay

850
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,440
well i didn't have to catch that it was gwendolyn at first i just thought it was like i don't know i

851
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:31,080
didn't even realize that it was like a blob taken over someone i just thought it was a crazy snake

852
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:36,840
queen you know like i really just thought it was that so i was like oh i guess i'm fighting the queen

853
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,560
of anor lando yeah uh i mean the name is aldrich i mean all right that's on you for not getting

854
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,640
gwendolyn that everyone fucking knows that was gwendolyn that's on you but i didn't catch that at all

855
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:50,040
but then like once it was explained to me i understood the evil snake queen totally different

856
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:55,160
just like my favorite boss of all mitha the baneful queen from dark souls too when you oh i love

857
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,800
getting poisoned all the time that's you dumb idiot you're supposed to burn the windmill with

858
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:04,600
that there's no indication that you can burn that no wonder you hate it i knew it was just because

859
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,160
you suck at the game you don't know nothing literally no way to know that was a trick i learned

860
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:14,360
you into a trap to prove that you don't know nothing why does it catch on fire and you prove

861
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:20,680
that you don't know nothing i win i've been playing chess for years and you walked right into it who

862
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,720
who'd have thought that i would have had the worst fucking time imaginable on this podcast

863
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:29,000
when i was gonna talk about one of my favorite games you know who would have thought who'd have

864
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,440
but here we are i know i knew i ever since i announced like ever since i proposed this idea

865
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:39,160
i knew that me and jessie were gonna argue about dark souls too like i knew it was coming

866
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:45,800
because even though sometimes jessie will accept that dark souls two is a flawed game now it's not

867
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:51,080
one of those times well it's just if you say it too many times that eventually it flips that switch

868
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:56,360
where he goes into defensive mode about it because he still ultimately likes the game whereas i

869
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:01,720
hate it yeah i have i have a i have a whiny criticism threshold and if you fucking cross it

870
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,600
well that that happens but i don't i don't consider my dark souls two complaints i don't

871
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,640
consider whiny because for me this is a deep passionate hatred this is not like someone who

872
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,880
watches a movie and come home in the first day that after the movie's out they write a fucking

873
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,840
bitchy pedantic review about it no this has been festering and stewing in me it's it's a part of

874
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,600
my life in my being get it there's nothing fucking wrong with it there there's some things wrong

875
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,480
with it there's some things wrong but okay let's move on to more dark souls cancer that has eaten

876
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:36,920
away at me for years you know what's really cool you're like you're like garfield with the mailman

877
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,480
i don't understand why you fucking want torturing every day i don't get what you get out of it

878
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:49,160
hey you know what's cool the deacons of the deep boss fight i like that boss fight i enjoyed it i

879
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:55,320
thought i i love the concept of that boss i think it's way too easy it's a little easy um because

880
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:01,240
the thing is that the the idea of it is that you only hurt the boss if you kill one of them who has

881
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:06,760
the the red shit well and you can just hit him but yeah well no it just hitting him doesn't hurt

882
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:12,120
the the boss meter it's only when you kill it that it that it that it deals damage that's so which is

883
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,800
which is a great idea because that would mean that if you can't kill them fast enough because

884
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,200
they'll transfer before you finish hurting them i have never had that problem i think every single

885
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:25,160
time i hit one of them that's the issue killed him like yeah like because i you know when i played

886
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:29,960
the first time you know or every time i've played strength and like i would kill them in two hits

887
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:34,600
but there was like one time that i hit one and then i missed what the second hit and then i didn't

888
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:40,040
get my like my endurance was out and then he transferred guys and so now his health bar was

889
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:43,880
released like you know it didn't do any damage to the boss itself so i had to go fight the next guy

890
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:48,360
so if they had made it so each one had more health so that it was like a real like you really

891
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:53,480
had to time your attacks to make sure you killed them or else you didn't do any damage i think that

892
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:57,480
would have made it a really challenging fun if you were like a mage trying to do long range

893
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:01,560
shit that would be a fucking nightmare to like hit the right one i think it was just a balancing

894
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:06,760
issue like yeah i think it was a matter of like they couldn't find a way to make it work for everyone

895
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:11,800
so they just kind of made it easy you know and i think that that that took some of the

896
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:16,440
but some of the quality from it thematically the boss fight is awesome it's the coolest it's

897
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:20,920
just it's just all these fucking eldritch guys working in the church they're just under the

898
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:25,560
pontiff they're just all like they're just there they're like oh here's the dude guess we better

899
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:30,280
deal with this now i don't know if that like like the pope guy there is like a special one

900
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:36,360
i guess he is but i will say though that regardless of that boss cathedral of the deep was that and

901
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:42,600
iris are the two coolest fucking levels ever like that was the moment because when i was playing

902
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,640
this game it was like at first the first couple levels i was just kind of like yeah all right this

903
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:53,880
is you know it's souls it's cool i'm killing guys this is fun like i like how in the first level

904
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:58,840
on the on the wall like you can just avoid a lot of the big enemies like the really tough ones you

905
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,920
can kind of solid snake around them or you can fight them if you want like the challenge you know

906
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:08,600
but like you know you get to the undead settlement and i i think that's probably like

907
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,960
my least favorite area the first time but now that i'm starting to like see all the lore that's there

908
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:19,560
i'm really interested in it like i want to know why they all are all like tree people because like

909
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:24,200
you gradually realize like everyone has like tree parts on them and stuff something to do with the

910
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:30,120
world just going to shit turn people into trees who knows then there's the giant tree boss who like

911
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,680
if you kill him then you can't join the mound makers so yeah it's clearly like i think everyone in

912
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:39,240
that town is part of this like tree covenant or something but uh yeah i don't know it's really

913
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,400
interesting but i i don't know much about it but you know you these lore videos guys yeah i need

914
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:47,720
him to but you were saying uh sorry i was just going to say that uh before you said that like

915
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:52,280
irithyll uh and and cathedral of the deep were like the moments you really liked it i think that

916
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:57,400
um that that moment where i forget when you beat the pontiff no not the pontiff whatever when you

917
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:02,040
beat someone and you walk out on that ledge and you see irithyll for the first time yeah that's

918
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:07,160
the equivalent of like the anor londo reveal from uh from dark souls one it's the and if you

919
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,880
want an example of seeing this go watch the blue glow i forget which episode it is but see see

920
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:19,160
endless jess marvel at the majesty of dark souls three after the best part about that is he was so

921
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:23,240
pissed off at the boss and he's literally going this is the worst fucking game ever then he comes

922
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:29,960
out and sees that he goes like like i'm crying that old bait switch right but um yeah for me it

923
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:35,720
was like you know i got to the crucifixion but it's harder to be sean my favorite song of all time

924
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,720
when i got to the crucifixion woods that was when i was first like all right i'm into it because

925
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:46,440
like the way that the water looks there and everything is just fucking beautiful i love the

926
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:51,400
swamp i love the entire swamp and then like because i i did the swamp first i beat the abyss

927
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,960
watchers i beat the catacombs and then i got to i saw irithyll and i was like that looks fucking

928
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,200
incredible but i couldn't get in because i didn't have the doll yeah so i go back to the cathedral

929
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:04,680
of the deep like i find it and i'm like what the fuck this the fucking graveyard with all the

930
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:09,000
skeleton people who just keep responding forever yeah and you're just like oh man this is fucking

931
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,760
cool it's like the spooky scary skeletons place and like i i love this is like this is the thing

932
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:19,720
that makes this game compete with bloodborne for being my favorite of the series because like

933
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:24,600
on the one hand dude i'm really into gothic horror and like and or gothic architecture

934
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,640
and stuff and like and lovecraftian stuff like those are my that's like my aesthetic man like

935
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:33,960
bloodborne feels like it was made for me but my biggest problem with that game is that almost

936
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:40,440
all of it's at night and so every level just feels like the same dark oppressive atmosphere

937
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:45,320
and it doesn't like it takes so long before you get to a level that like really feels different

938
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,960
and really pops out that is true that is true you know like like like i would say nightmare

939
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,720
frontier because that's like the first level that's like totally daylight and looks really

940
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:59,160
different and you're like oh all right and then in this game almost all of it's during the daytime

941
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:07,480
like the only really dark areas are like the catacombs and uh and the place the the jail and

942
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:12,200
the place below the jail you know where you fight your the the prison the fucking yeah the dungeon

943
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:16,680
thing whatever yeah yeah like even irithel even though it's set at night it's so beautiful and

944
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,800
like shining out in out of the darkness it's it's amazing it's it's a marvel it's a marvel of level

945
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,840
yeah i don't actually think it's like the most brilliantly designed level in in a like a flow

946
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:31,480
progression the level design it looks amazing i think the level design is obviously based on

947
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:36,440
andorlondo where it's supposed to be this huge skill check all like it's all big enemies now

948
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:40,680
they're all a lot harder you're fighting them in like smaller like it's just like you you fight a

949
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:45,960
bunch of groups of big enemies and like but they're even cooler because like in andorlondo it's

950
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,400
just like giant knight statues that you had to fight a lot of and this is like these these

951
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,800
fucking crazy dancer people you get the sense that there's like a culture to irithel yeah you're

952
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:58,840
getting like because all the all the the fucking boreal guys with their icy swords and their fucking

953
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,400
spin moves all the time it's it's really there's a real when you meet one of those guys you know

954
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:08,120
it's one of these dudes it's great yeah i really feel like there's a culture here that i i'm not

955
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:13,320
really sure i've seen in another like civilization uh before you know for this and the way that when

956
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:17,640
you're walking through town every there's like the ghosts like people who i don't even know what the

957
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:22,760
fuck those are but i love them they're the coolest thing ever uh everything about irithel makes my

958
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:28,360
dick rock hard and then when you go down into like the when you just go under it like you go down

959
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:33,880
into the the sewer like area and you're just in this huge open lake and it's like because the whole

960
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,720
level up to that point is fairly linear it's like guiding you through a bunch of like tough and

961
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:43,320
counters but then you go down and you're like exploring this whole other side of these disgusting

962
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:48,920
fucking hideous mosquito monsters down there jesus christ and then you emerge back into the thing

963
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:54,520
and who's who's sitting there with some hot estus stew waiting for you seagward seagward is my

964
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:59,560
fucking nigga jesus christ is the coolest guy ever did you did you know that every time in that

965
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:05,720
game that you find a pot of estus stew or whatever z word made it i did not know you can thank him for

966
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:10,040
that shit yep god he's the coolest guy in the world i love him by the way another awesome thing

967
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:15,240
i love about this game that i've appreciating more on like my uh as i play it again is the way that

968
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:20,920
the whole world like the way that you play through the game mo most of the time like there's this even

969
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:26,040
one area called the path of sacrifice like the whole world is structured in sort of a funnel

970
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:30,680
where people and you see this in like the the undead settlement like the whole world is sort of

971
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:36,520
built in this operation of like funneling food and funneling like good like stuff for

972
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:41,560
eldritch to consume all the way back to anor landa when i realized that nice notice like the guys in

973
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,640
cages like that's what they're doing like the the missionaries they're recruiting people like

974
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:50,520
those big fat bitches what they're doing is they're out recruiting people to come be uh eldritch

975
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:57,160
worshipers it's all fucking awesome it's the coolest thing ever man i love it i'm taking now

976
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:02,440
that i've played like all these games i'm taking much more notice of the lore like of the things

977
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,600
i'm doing as i'm playing through the games which up to this point i hadn't really invested in blood

978
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:12,440
warren i started to do that dark souls 3 with yeah the constant like hope of like looking out for

979
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:17,960
like lore stuff like totally i hope i see something cool and i can connect the dots but i'm too dumb

980
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:24,200
for that i need some more fucking lore videos to do it for me i'm a busy man i agree that like i

981
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:29,080
thought i was keeping up with it more so than the other like i definitely understood more than

982
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:33,560
i've understood before but then like once people started making lore videos and i was like well

983
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,840
i didn't get any of that so i want to know everything there is to know about like why is the undead

984
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:43,800
legion fighting itself something went wrong somewhere is it eldritch i want to know i want to

985
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:50,200
know real bad i need people to tell me i yeah i i got to say here's some some pedantic complaints

986
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:58,920
i have okay all right one uh why do npcs teleport to the the place after you like save them

987
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:03,960
like because there's that moment when you homeward bone i'm gonna say well there's that moment when

988
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,840
you save gray rat from a cell yeah and you like talk to him and then he's like i'm gonna join your

989
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:14,360
team and then he just like poosh away and i'm like well if he could do that why was he sitting in a

990
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:19,400
cell okay i'm i'm gonna tell you right now what it is there because there seem to be some implication

991
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:24,680
that like there's there's some magic going on when you take people into your service as an

992
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:30,360
unkindled there's something magical going on with that i'm just i'm completely gonna go crazy here

993
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:35,080
because it sounds like there's some weird connection between you and the uh the fire

994
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:40,600
fuck firekeeper lady or whatever i'm gonna say there's magic going on there because like uh

995
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:44,760
the that dude who you meet on the bridge who's like oh i've been looking for someone to serve

996
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,440
i've been looking for like a master a lord to send or whatever it's it's amazing to be in your

997
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:53,240
presence i'm just gonna say magic magic's involved you're a lord ascended i'm willing to accept

998
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:58,760
literally any explanation yeah it's just that like in demon souls people came back to the nexus but

999
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:03,080
it was always like you just kind of left it in all the games they just left the characters behind

1000
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:07,720
you know and then eventually they made it there and then this game they like actively right in

1001
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:11,640
front of your face teleport and i'm like what's the deal with that you know that's true yeah i've

1002
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:19,320
been wondering about that too and then uh but then my other one i this one's a little less pedantic

1003
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:25,160
i think it was just like an issue with the pacing of the game for me is that when you assuming that

1004
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:30,280
you haven't killed the dancer early in the game then like when you kill the last of the guys you

1005
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,920
need to kill it just teleports you into oh my god i cannot tell you how annoying that was and i'll

1006
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:41,960
tell you exactly why because uh you you usually end up killing um the the yorm the giant as the

1007
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:48,600
last one that's just how the game usually flows and if you've done uh z words storyline then like

1008
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:53,640
if you he says a couple words to you and then you get teleported away but i wanted to see what he

1009
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:59,080
fucking does after that fight because i've heard that like he does like he he like dies and i want

1010
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,720
to know if that's true yeah but i don't know and so like i have to play through the whole game again

1011
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:09,880
and go out of my way to not kill him last because of that issue like i i get it you get summoned by

1012
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,920
the bitch but it's still annoying and also you have to constantly recollect your souls from that

1013
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,840
previous boss like you know if you die to the dancer you have to make it back there and get

1014
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:24,360
those souls back and if you do die to the dancer on your first try you go back to the bonfire of the

1015
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:29,720
boss you killed you don't go back to the you know like you have to teleport you you'll you'll die to

1016
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:34,200
the dancer then you'll end up back in yorm the giant's fucking chamber and then you got to teleport

1017
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,040
to the fucking king play you know the kingdom yeah so that you can go fight the dancer again

1018
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:42,680
i'll be honest i feel like this is one of those things they did to like really force you to get

1019
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:47,400
it to like know what to do now like they didn't like they could have just put a message annoying

1020
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:52,440
i do i do too because the thing is like i was it was so jarring because i would never have thought

1021
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:57,960
that i was at the end of the path through the game you know like you kill yorm and there's like

1022
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:02,520
you've if you if if he is the last one you kill then you've you've explored the whole game

1023
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:07,160
and i never had that sense because i'm thinking well there's still one more guy left you know

1024
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:11,720
so yeah where am i gonna go to fight that guy and i'm thinking that i'm gonna continue on the path

1025
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:16,600
that i've been going on and then it's just like no you're back in the castle uh and then like it

1026
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,920
would be one thing if it teleported you there and there was a bonfire immediately and you really

1027
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,640
felt like okay i'm in the right place but instead it teleports you into a fight that if you lose

1028
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:31,640
you end up back in yorm's chamber and it's so weird and jarring to like have that epic moment

1029
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:36,360
of whoa i have to fight two bosses in a row and then like oh now i have to fucking teleport all

1030
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:42,760
the way up to the the other guys bonfire because it just deposited me back in a nonsensical location

1031
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:47,960
i i hear you on on all that stuff that's true i don't i don't quite agree uh that i that i dislike

1032
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:53,000
that you're sort of uh sent back to uh to the castle to continue because it's very much like

1033
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,760
boletaria which is really the last thing you do and you went back there in that right i wish that

1034
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:04,280
it gave you the the agency to do that yourself i that'd be it was because in in demon souls it

1035
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,760
told you how many levels there were in each place so like you you already knew that you were going

1036
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:14,200
to go back to boletaria eventually after you'd beaten everything else but like in this game when i

1037
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:19,160
beat yorm i didn't realize he was the last guy like because again i hadn't realized that eldritch

1038
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:24,040
was the blob thing and i think i was just doing the math wrong because like there's one guy because

1039
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:29,160
like ludlith is there and there's four others and am i one no okay and there's the prince is that two

1040
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:35,080
guys yeah it's right and and i'm thinking the i'm thinking that and the undead legion is one

1041
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:39,400
all right i was expecting all of them right there i was expecting the prince to be the final boss

1042
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:44,600
you know yeah like he's the one who's been built up the whole game so like i just kind of had this

1043
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,320
weird jarring feeling of when i was teleported back and i didn't like because i didn't know

1044
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:54,120
that it was just after you kill whoever's the last guy yeah i thought it was just i killed yorm

1045
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:59,480
and it teleported me back so when jessie was trying to jessie was trying to ask me how to get to uh

1046
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:03,000
the the last like where to go because he killed yorm before eldritch because he didn't know how

1047
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,320
to get to eldritch right so you know he's like where do i go now and i'm like oh did you fight

1048
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:12,120
the dancer and he's like what and like he said i can't even ask where to go without getting spoiled

1049
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:17,960
you know yeah that's the that's the yeah i'm with you on all that stuff for sure that that really

1050
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:24,600
annoyed me let's talk about uh piece of shit which is those fucking guys in the in the dragon

1051
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:29,560
place is the coolest fucking place ever it's yeah it's definitely red those fucking guys with the

1052
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:35,640
chain axes that go through walls hundreds of miles away what who the hell coded that part

1053
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,680
i want to find him and i want to kill his family that's like the greatest that is the greatest

1054
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:46,120
mar on an otherwise great game it's a fucking blight on the entire series those fucking found

1055
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:51,240
that place a little uh a little trying with my patience due to those guys that's that's oh i hate

1056
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:55,720
those fucking guys and there's like 50 of them in one spot yeah yeah i you know what i know what

1057
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:59,720
spot you're you're talking about because there's that one part where you try to go out to that

1058
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:05,400
roost on the end yeah of the place and there's like fucking 15 dudes there and yeah i could not

1059
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:09,160
fight my way through that like because there's no way to not aggro a bunch of them and their

1060
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:13,560
chains like if you go into that little building they'll just hit you from everywhere so like the

1061
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:18,600
only way i could get there is just to fucking run past them haul ass as best i could get that item and

1062
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:24,440
run back you know not only are they so long have such long range but that they go through walls

1063
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:29,320
like everybody prides the dark souls series i'm like it's hard but it always feels fair

1064
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:34,680
the enemies can't do anything that you can't do you know but i can't fucking go through a wall

1065
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:40,360
so well yeah i mean that it's it's a it's a moment of weakness in the story i would agree

1066
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:46,760
the whole game is bad it's because of that i will say that i i i love that eventually i found harder

1067
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:51,320
rooms because like one of the things i really loved in in all the other games is that there would be

1068
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:58,280
these these certain rooms that are like so amazingly hard but they're completely out of the way so

1069
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:03,880
like there's no reason really like uh in in dark souls one in the demon ruins when you like fall

1070
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:08,360
down that that area and there's like all the toxic and all the fucking things that eat you and

1071
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:13,800
shit and that's where like zeigmeyer's story ends like oh yeah right right yeah like that room

1072
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:18,120
is insanely hard there's no reason to go over there if you know about it unless you wanted

1073
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:22,600
whatever items were down there or you just wanted that challenge you know and i i think every game

1074
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,840
has moments like that like in the bloodborne dlc when you fucking run into that cave where there's

1075
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:31,320
the guy with the machine gun oh yeah like as a fucking nightmare there's like a fucking blood

1076
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:36,120
starf beast down there like a million other guys and it's like what the fuck like there's just

1077
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,600
certain rooms in each game there's a beast in there what the i must have spent yeah two hours

1078
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:45,880
in trying to defeat that cave that one cave that yeah and i love that there's those those little

1079
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:50,920
offshoot moments in each game yeah when i first played through dark souls 3 i didn't find any of

1080
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:56,520
those but then like once i made it to the nameless king place and like that area with all those guys

1081
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,280
is definitely one of them i'd say that one's a little too much of a pain in the ass because i

1082
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:04,040
just couldn't even figure out how to go about it but there's a there's one room where there's

1083
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:08,680
like an illusory wall where you can fight two of like the crocodile monster from the bridge

1084
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:12,360
like or something like that two two really big down in the uh yeah i know what you're talking

1085
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:17,160
about yeah to get it to get a certain item or weapon or whatever there's there's also yeah and

1086
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:23,400
then the one where you're like before you're in the giant where uh there's three of the hand monsters

1087
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:28,520
the fucking oh my god those fucking guys they're the worst they're like these horrific hand hippos

1088
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:33,480
oh my god no those things are the most disgusting fucked up monsters in any game and they flail

1089
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:39,640
around like they're fucking high on i don't know whatever yeah they're the worst fucked up they're

1090
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:44,040
the most annoying enemies in the game aside from the axe through wall there's only there's only four

1091
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,960
of them and like one you fight by itself and then there's three in that room down there three in the

1092
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,200
one room yeah yeah finding out about though that though is like really cool because i was like okay

1093
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:57,720
this game still has those optional big challenges i just i love that area that area forced me to

1094
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:02,840
figure out that the fastest way to get through slow roll like slow roll like mud and stuff is

1095
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:07,560
you equip a dagger you two hand it and you do the uh focus which is that dash and that it like

1096
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:12,440
forces you to come up with new strats and do shit it's great i love it i hate all the fucking mud

1097
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:17,160
pits they shouldn't be in the game they're just a completely unnecessary arbitrary fucking time

1098
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:23,240
waster oh it pisses me off so much i hate going in the mud it makes you just do do my shit equip

1099
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:28,200
a dagger two hand it use the focus move you'll just you'll just sound like too much work it's

1100
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:34,200
it's mad just thinking i don't know i it's funny because i i really loved the swamp area but like

1101
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,960
then when a like vadi kept putting out videos and he kept being like oh if you had to go through

1102
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:43,400
that fucking swamp and i'm like eh i i didn't i wasn't that bothered by it like the only parts

1103
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:47,320
you really have to go through the mud is if you want to get like a certain item the party yeah the

1104
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:52,360
area right before you gotta get the items how could you not get the items i gotta get them well i did

1105
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:56,840
get them all but like i don't know i never had a huge problem with it i mean you know that one

1106
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,920
spot where there's three of those giant like tree druid the other fuckers around a bunch of items

1107
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:05,880
that was like that was challenging but i did get through it right before the swamp where you're

1108
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:10,760
with the crabs and it's sort of it looks like it's like directly out of the fellowship of the

1109
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:16,920
ring at the end where Boramir dies it's like that it's literally that place that place is awesome

1110
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:21,480
but then it goes into the fucking swamp and you gotta walk through that slow ass muddy water you

1111
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:25,560
gotta fight those fucking werewolves who jump on your fucking head from 50 feet away you can't

1112
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:30,920
fucking die i hate those motherfuckers you gotta oh man those guys yeah it's like 50 000 basilists

1113
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:35,160
all coming around you at once gang rape and you turn into a stone there's those fucking tree guys

1114
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:39,720
there's so tall i want to take that part out of the game and i want to package you help and i want

1115
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:44,040
to put poop in that package and send that package back to me azaki and say this is my poop on your

1116
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:49,640
level which is also i think uh i think i possibly like the swamp because it was purple and i just

1117
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:55,400
think purple areas are the coolest purple um and i i do like how like there's a lot of there's a

1118
01:32:55,400 --> 01:33:00,920
ton of big enemies in this game that you have no reason to fight like the crabs unless you want

1119
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:07,000
their rings like there's just a ton of big enemies who just drop some really cool ring and like you

1120
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,800
know you could completely for like you don't have to fight a single crab in this game but if you

1121
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,960
almost all of them will drop something special they get agroed so you know you get you get into

1122
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:20,280
some yeah but you can easily escape like they're usually out of the way i have to fight them because

1123
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:25,560
i hate them yeah hey crabs are cool dog i'm a cancer i don't respect like crabs to live

1124
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:31,720
dude did you guys know have you guys seen this there was uh some shit on on v of uh you know those

1125
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:37,480
giant skeleton balls in like the dungeon that roll up and down those staircases uh the the lower one

1126
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:42,520
when it when you kill like the the hat guy that like if you kill a skeleton with a hat like they

1127
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:47,480
no longer survive hitting against walls for some reason did you say just now that crabs are a

1128
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:53,480
cancer that was a funny joke that's that's hilarious okay so when you do that nate said that he was

1129
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:58,440
a i'm i'm against well then it was my joke then i made a point all right good good job anyway the

1130
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:03,800
bottom ball when you do that when it smashes open uh there's a crab in there there's just a crab in

1131
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,960
that ball there's a crab in that yeah and like people were trying to undead bone shard in there

1132
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,960
but i did not know there's there's an undead bone shard in like the first ball but in the second

1133
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:17,320
ball there's just a live crab just hanging out and uh there were there were some people uh on on v

1134
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:23,640
doing threads about trying to guide that that uh crab back to like his his people in that like a fire

1135
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:28,920
dungeon you know you know like all the crabs in that like fireplace but for so like he gets stuck

1136
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:33,960
on the um on the on the entrance to the undead legion which leads out to like the swamp where the

1137
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:38,840
other crabs are there's a threshold that he will not cross so tragically little crabby man was never

1138
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,080
able to get home he couldn't do it it was they couldn't bring him down to the demon uh ruins

1139
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:49,320
they tried they tried that too yeah let's talk about all those super cool like sad last in the

1140
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:54,680
trilogy moments where like you'd find like the dead spider babe from the first game or you find

1141
01:34:54,680 --> 01:35:01,720
like the dead armor guy from the in uh in in lando the fucking dead giant giant oh man that was so

1142
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:07,000
cool dude fucking because of you jesse because of the blue glow when me and victor went back to

1143
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,560
andro lando in our playthrough like the first thing i did was go i'm coming home yes i'm coming home

1144
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:19,000
and like uh this the moment when you see the the giant and then you just made your character fall to

1145
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:25,000
his knees and i was like oh man that was beautiful taking that like we said this already but taking

1146
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,840
the ashes to andre of the giant was like the most cry porn moment ever like i was devastated that

1147
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:35,880
that was that was a that was a like an irreplaceable gaming moment how often how often do characters

1148
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:41,000
like not only acknowledge one another but in a positive way in these games you know and that

1149
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,680
yeah dude that is a great argument against spoilers can you fucking imagine if somebody

1150
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:52,040
had spoiled that fucking part for me i would have lost all faith in humanity i would have died

1151
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:57,160
an unhappy so i would have gone hollow if someone had spoiled that i'm just reliving that moment

1152
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:02,840
andre it's beautiful man it is beautiful and i'll say this i think that's um like another thing

1153
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:08,440
that would egg this game above possibly above bloodborne for me is the fact that bloodborne's

1154
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:14,680
npcs were totally weak and this game's npcs were fucking awesome i liked that one girl the uh the

1155
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:19,400
hunter killer girl in the crows outfit yeah i mean even she you know she's not that great

1156
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:24,840
she's cool it's just yeah like the because most of the npcs like there's two types there's either

1157
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,840
the hunters that you find around which are more like the adventurers from the other games yeah

1158
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:32,520
and those are those are kind of cool but then most of them are just like civilians who have

1159
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,520
nothing to do with what you're doing they're not like you they're just like people who are there

1160
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:40,840
and the only way you ever really interact with them is if you go back to odin chapel which

1161
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:45,880
you don't really do because it's you're you're constantly teleporting back to your fucking

1162
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:51,000
the dream you know why would you go back to odin chapel i went to a lot just to check in with those

1163
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,800
folks but that's just the way i most of them don't really do anything that interesting except for

1164
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:01,960
like uh most of them are the whore and the priest and their interaction yeah yeah um but like the

1165
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:06,840
old guy and the old lady don't really do anything interesting you know so it's kind of like it just

1166
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:11,080
felt like it was just more people going crazy and like everyone else was already going crazy

1167
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:15,640
like i love the part with the little girl and how uh she'll go looking for her parents and she's

1168
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:21,000
fucking gets eaten by a pig monster and it's horrific but i think uh i think what's cool

1169
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,800
about this game is that like in dark souls one everyone kind of had a mission but like all of

1170
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:32,520
them failed like you know yeah unless unless you're able to say that logan succeeded too hardcore

1171
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:37,640
right but like most of them actually you know who the coolest npc is in bloodborne is the guy with

1172
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:43,400
the fucking wheel legarious because he oh my god you are so right dude that is part of the best

1173
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:49,080
scene in that game of euphoria as he has smashed her to fucking pieces i was like yeah dude yeah

1174
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:53,560
he's the best character definitely that's by far the coolest npc quest line in that game but in this

1175
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,640
game i remember walking into that room it was fucking freaky because he puts yeah that's where

1176
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:02,360
that pyramid head fucking helmet out of nowhere he didn't wear that up till now i think that was

1177
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:07,080
on purpose holy shit that was spooky but okay go on but yeah in this game there's like a ton of

1178
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:12,680
characters who all have like very clear missions and some of them succeed like seaguard if you

1179
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:17,800
finish his quest line yeah he like does what he set out to do it's the best because that was the

1180
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:22,680
whole tragedy of seagmeyer was that he just like wanted to adventure but he was always getting

1181
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:27,640
you know stuck because he wasn't very good and then you know he goes crazy because he's so worthless

1182
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:32,840
when you see seagland over his dead body oh my god right and then in this game you've got

1183
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:38,680
fucking seagward and like not only does he fight like an early boss with you but then he'll fight

1184
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:43,640
a fucking major boss with you and then like finish his quest and he's like i've done what

1185
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:50,600
i set out to do that you fucking you know and then and there's a from what i understand the lady and

1186
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:56,760
i have no idea how to do her like quest line but the lady in white who meets you in uh oh dude i

1187
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,440
can tell you about her quest line because it's fucking awesome doesn't she fight the final boss

1188
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:05,080
with you if you like wait are you talking about the lady in white or the lady in black the lady in

1189
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:08,600
white doesn't fight the final boss dude let me tell you what happens with her one of her whole

1190
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:13,400
deal uh yeah the lady in black does i'll tell you about that but the lady in white her whole deal

1191
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:19,160
is i forget her name but she um is she was attempting to become a firekeeper which i guess

1192
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:23,880
is a thing that you can do uh but she wasn't good enough or something but wait are you talking about

1193
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,240
the the the blind one yeah the blind one i thought you meant i'm not talking about her

1194
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:31,960
i'm talking about the lady who just shows up in the shrine and like she's a member of like

1195
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:37,240
urea yeah wait no not urea she's in black that that's like a lady to kill me because i

1196
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:42,440
accidentally joined the wrong dude okay her name is serious her name is serious yeah okay

1197
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:49,080
her deal is just that uh she she's just a dark moon covenant dude uh trying to kill a certain dude

1198
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:54,120
and as you go along you'll find out that it's her grandfather who is that you know you know

1199
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:59,000
the guy who uh lets you into the mound makers covenants that creepy guy that's him and he's

1200
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,800
that's her granddad and uh like eventually if you you get summoned by her a bunch of times to

1201
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:09,000
like kill random dudes and the last one is that guy and when you kill him she's like all right

1202
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,040
i i i fulfilled my promise to you granddad so like there's some implications that he like much earlier

1203
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:19,080
in the game yeah but you know you want to give her some credit i don't know he invades you in in uh

1204
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:23,880
in there he invades you as a mad face well invading isn't like killing the real one you know

1205
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:27,960
like in this you like get summoned into his world or something and kill him there so uh

1206
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:33,080
and then like she and then after that she shows back up in fire link and is like oh man thank you

1207
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:37,320
dude uh i want to be your knight and she just swears loyal to you to you and then you can summon her

1208
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:42,440
for shit so does yuria fight the final boss with you yuria does fight the final boss with you if you

1209
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:47,240
do the like marriage quest line fully i don't know if you guys have done that but that's also

1210
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:53,960
fucking awesome i could i could tell you about it but i have not done it but i mean i don't care

1211
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:59,960
okay all right so i don't know if jesse uh wants to know jesse have you done that part yet i haven't

1212
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:06,120
beaten it i i mean babadook spook killed anri and it was very sad because she's the best girl ever

1213
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:11,080
you killed her in the ceremony yeah he stabbed her in the face oh yeah okay the ceremony is like

1214
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:15,000
the most important part of the whole thing after that you it's basically you just are getting the

1215
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,920
ending like you fulfilled the criteria you just got to get to the end there but okay since you

1216
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:24,920
already know i'll just tell the people so like there's this girl uh well when you meet um yol yol

1217
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:30,360
this guy who will give you those five free levels he gives you this like new like super dark sign

1218
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:34,760
or whatever that's like a pit of blackness that's like in addition to the normal dark sign on an

1219
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:40,280
undead that never goes away and yeah the babadook spooks got that shit and so like you don't have

1220
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:47,160
like enough of them so uh andri she has you do like this wedding ceremony so she like kidnaps andri

1221
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:52,120
does this creepy ritual where you stab her in the face and you like get three additional of these

1222
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:59,240
like dark emblems from them and then uh at the end you just have the ability to steal the fire from

1223
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:05,800
the uh from the fucking i can't remember what i was fucking saying you steal yeah you take the fire

1224
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:10,920
from the kill the first flame and you get like this ending where you've like stolen the power

1225
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:16,280
of the first flame or something i don't know some it's it's good you should go do it everybody

1226
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:21,320
your mind is falling apart trying to talk to me it's completely whatever just go play the game

1227
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:27,480
it's fun all right go do all the quest lines my full name is yule but hey since we're talking

1228
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:33,560
about this anyway and i was gonna say the fact that that blind lady was a failed uh fire keeper

1229
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:39,240
and if you buy all the spells from her if you like fulfill her purpose she then like i don't know how

1230
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:44,520
but she somehow like becomes a full-fledged fire keeper and can perform level ups on you

1231
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:50,920
like a fire keeper wait what dude yeah that's right that she becomes oh my god it's the coolest

1232
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:57,320
thing that ever happened she fulfills her fucking dream it's the greatest but only only if you buy

1233
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:01,160
all the good spells and don't give her any of the dark tomes and buy any of the dark spells you

1234
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:05,880
can't do that shit or she has like a tragic evil ending yeah she just becomes a fire keeper it's so

1235
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:11,400
cool it's like i never knew that that's amazing it's it's so right she's like in one of the dark

1236
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:16,760
towers hanging out with all the like corpses dude she she she's in the tower with all the dead

1237
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:21,720
uh fire keepers behind like the locked door and uh like she took down her hood and she she's all

1238
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:25,560
pretty now that she took off her stupid ass nun hood and she's just she can fucking level you

1239
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:31,080
up and she's just like i am so happy that i can fucking do this shit now oh man it's so endearing

1240
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:36,760
i love i i hate it fucking but until that game is on fleek in this no fucking doubt dude like

1241
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:41,640
you got yoria who's like lining you up with hot bitches to fuck you got this bitch who like

1242
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:46,200
loves you more than anything you got the fire keeper of course oh man it's it's over and you got the

1243
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:51,240
dark one of one of the cutest girl in the game the emerald herald who comes out at the end of the

1244
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:56,600
game to say hey funnily enough i was about to say i'll never love one as much as the doll but

1245
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:01,800
this game has a lot more the doll i got yeah i gotta say the uh the doll definitely uh for you

1246
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:06,840
you know the doll's fucking accent makes my dick rock hard like introducing the idea of reacting

1247
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:11,000
to your emotes with the doll has made her just transcended waifu you know there's never going

1248
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,880
to be a waifu like her probably for me it's just the the fucking accent dude and and the hair and

1249
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:20,680
just the fact that she's a doll and she has dark circles under her eyes are you cold she's my

1250
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:26,280
fetish good hunter are you cold i think she might be related to the fact that she and the fact that

1251
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:31,160
yeah probably you wake you become a squid and then she's like your mom she's like she doesn't

1252
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:35,800
mom she's so really she's like she's gonna be there for you dude even in fucking squid form

1253
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,640
what a what a great woman what a good woman and that's what and that's why bloodborne is the

1254
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:51,160
prequel to octodad you're a good girl you would be did you i gotta tell you i've been singing that

1255
01:44:51,160 --> 01:45:01,160
song from the sea hey speaking of squid men going back to the sea all that shit with aldrich

1256
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:05,720
had like they had a premonition that like the sea is going to be like the new age after the age of

1257
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:11,640
fire feels very bloodborne inspired cool stuff yeah there's there's i i thought it was interesting

1258
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:16,600
that like this game because it has references to demon souls but then like in terms of bloodborne

1259
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:22,040
it's like almost exclusively mechanic mechanical references like there's no overt

1260
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:29,080
other than the fact that aldrich's name is basic like if you read it aldrich's name in japanese

1261
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:36,520
it's it's spelled exactly like eldritch oh really ha may as well yeah he's pretty clearly a like

1262
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:42,360
in eldritch or he's a mode but i mean the arena the arena of the soul of cinder i feel like it's

1263
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:46,600
definitely an homage of sorts to gherman's arena or possibly they're just like okay that worked

1264
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:52,280
let's just do that again you know i think it could easily just be that yeah i would say i don't i

1265
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:55,560
don't think that having an eldritch thing is like a reference to bloodborne though because all the

1266
01:45:55,560 --> 01:46:00,120
games were lovecraftian from the beginning you fought fucking cthulhu's in the first game you

1267
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:05,000
sure did well they're i mean they're mind flayers which are a dnd thing but i mean yeah same shit

1268
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,120
well i mean it's just very like call of cthulhu esk like the way i always thought it was like

1269
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:15,560
somewhere between dnd and call of cthulhu was like the idea of of uh of demon souls have i

1270
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:21,240
mentioned how dope latria is in demon souls just going up up up getting carried like you fight the

1271
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:26,360
those fucking the clones that aren't real and then you get to the old monk and he's this creepy-ass

1272
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:30,920
dude with the robe and it just becomes some dude's hat oh my god it was fucking insane demon

1273
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:42,200
souls is one of the coolest games ever it is no doubt demon souls demon souls i like demon souls

1274
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:46,920
that's how it goes right but yeah i think overall though like when i played through dark souls 3 it

1275
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:51,640
was like that there was that first initial moment of like all right well that was kind of short

1276
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:55,720
and a little easy and i don't know if it was as memorable as like you know where demon souls every

1277
01:46:55,720 --> 01:47:00,440
level was so distinct and different and dark souls felt so new and fresh and like even when you play

1278
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:06,200
it today you can appreciate how new it felt at the time and how how big and open that world felt

1279
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:12,200
and and dark souls 3 definitely feels less open it definitely feels less unique and new but yeah

1280
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:17,240
it's again i think the replayability of it is so much stronger than any of the other games that like

1281
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:22,840
this is the one i'll keep playing forever you know this is the one that i mean i never in none of

1282
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:27,000
the other games that i pick it up like immediately and start playing again and then this one i was

1283
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,720
just like i don't want to leave i don't want to be done it's so satisfying to play like

1284
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:37,880
it's just so much fun and everything's cool and every location is there's there's no bad part

1285
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:43,400
like i would say in in dark souls like when you're replaying it and you get past and or lando and

1286
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:50,040
then you have to do like the fucking god damn uh what's it called the fireplace it's just like uh

1287
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:53,800
do i have to do it again all right everybody everybody all right maybe you guys can explain

1288
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:59,480
this to me i don't think you can everybody says that the game gets like drops off after an or lando

1289
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:03,320
i don't fucking buy that shit i love every part of that game i love the fireplace

1290
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:10,040
i mean i don't love the boss at the end it's not like the best boss ever but it's fun i enjoyed it

1291
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:14,440
all like every single part the problem with the part was awesome the problem with the whole uh

1292
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:18,440
with that what the fuck is it called what is the up to the demon ruins what's it called i can't

1293
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:24,280
easelith lost easelith lost islet yeah um like the problem with that area is that if you played

1294
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:30,120
that game when it first came out yeah then all those uh butts had like a dragon butts had like a

1295
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:34,280
giant aggro range and it was like the hardest level in the whole game because you were just

1296
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:38,920
constantly fighting these giant butts and it was like it was like yeah but that's the thing the way

1297
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:43,960
that they compensated for that was to give them no aggro range and make it just a fucking place you

1298
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:49,880
run through you know like it to me it just seems like it was really like like the time constraints

1299
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:54,360
killed it or something like they had an idea they built this level and then they didn't actually

1300
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:59,240
think up good enemy placements so they just threw a bunch of fucking dinosaur i don't know it's just

1301
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:04,120
the way that people say like oh the game just fucking tanks after an or lando i don't buy it i

1302
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:10,360
don't like by any stretch i just i think lost islet is a weaker level i think that maybe that

1303
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:14,920
that what's is the boss there is a pain in the ass um i love duke's archives i think that place

1304
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:21,320
yeah fucking really and design wise is amazing um the the tomb of the giants i'm not a big fan of

1305
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:26,120
but i have i know people who really like it oh i like the two of the giants and then there's the

1306
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:31,480
new lando which i just two of the giants is worth it just for when you finally get that lantern it's

1307
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:37,400
like oh my god thank you jesus it feels great it's punishment i had it before going in there

1308
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:41,080
i thought how'd you get it before i mean it's i don't know i had i had you can get like light

1309
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:45,880
spells and shit in other ways but like the game like gives you a definitely i had a land skull

1310
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:50,280
lantern went to there i don't know whatever maybe you did i don't fucking know um i don't know could

1311
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:53,480
because i did that i think i did it last i think that was the last place i went to so i might have

1312
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:58,360
got one but i mean well i don't know like the lantern that the game i mean i just think that

1313
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:03,080
there's there's definitely in that game there's a few moments that i'm like when i have to go back

1314
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:07,240
there i'm like oh god i have to do this level you know or i would think people would think that

1315
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:11,640
about like sen's fortress or something because it's such a ball buster yeah but that's like mandatory

1316
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:15,400
you know sen's fortress is a lot easier once you know what to do though like if you don't fall for

1317
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:21,800
the traps you can haul ass through that place but like i think uh i think even uh bloodborne like

1318
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:25,640
none of the levels were like a pain in the ass in that game but there was places that were like

1319
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:30,040
that just weren't that memorable that are like i don't really feel like like if i was playing

1320
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:34,040
through the game again i just want to rush through that area nothing felt like that in this game to me

1321
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:40,280
like every single place was so distinct maybe the catacombs but then once i figured out that

1322
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:44,360
you could skip like half the catacombs just by dropping down that first ledge when you walk in

1323
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:47,960
then it's not even that big of a pain you know i don't know what you're talking about but i believe

1324
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:53,320
you yeah well because you don't have to run like when the roly ball is there oh that yeah okay i

1325
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:56,680
know what you're talking about i know the exact right when you walk into the catacombs you could

1326
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:00,760
just drop down and skip that whole other part dude because those fucking skelemangs with their

1327
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:05,480
fucking tip fedora shuriken throwing teleporting around geez christ those are fucking annoying

1328
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:09,240
but yeah once i like once i knew that and i went through it like the easier way i was like okay this

1329
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:13,160
place isn't like that much of a pain and demon ruins as well like the first time i went to demon

1330
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:17,960
ruins it felt like a fucking labyrinth and i was like where the hell am i i love the demon ruins i

1331
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:22,040
thought that was so much fun because like i man that was actually one of my favorite moments in the

1332
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:27,000
game because i'm just going along you know that uh the the ballista is like shooting bolts at you

1333
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:30,520
and i'm just i didn't even know that existed i'm just walking along the ground

1334
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:35,400
one hits near me it breaks the ground and i fall into the demon ruins and i'm like holy

1335
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:40,040
shit i what the fuck yeah i just haven't seen that like i know that that happens to a lot of people

1336
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:43,480
but i've never seen it just happened to me and it was so awesome oh man it was rad what happened

1337
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:48,280
you went through the floor do yeah if if you're running around in the lake like there's a there's

1338
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:52,680
one spot where if the ballista shoots the ground there the ground just falls out from under you

1339
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:58,120
and you fall into the demon ruin i had like i knew about the lake but i had no idea that was there

1340
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:02,120
it was it blew my mind and then like down there there's so much cool shit like the the spider

1341
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:09,000
lady's down there and stuff oh it ruled what a fucking cool game 10 out of 10 yeah 10 out of 10

1342
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:16,520
10 out of 10 10 out of 10 possibly possibly my favorite game of all time it's it's in the running

1343
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:23,800
my top my top four are you know bloodborne dark souls three dark souls and demon souls so it's

1344
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:28,600
in the running with those you know with that top four you know hey maybe we should wrap up but before

1345
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:35,960
we do let's just say our our favorite build weapons i'm an undead legion boy for life with my broad

1346
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:42,840
sword and my shield of want it's the best i haven't fucked around with the weapons a whole lot yet

1347
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:49,880
but the one that i've been using ever since finishing the game was the uh the the the uh the one

1348
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:56,920
that the fucking i'll know is it the icey sword uses the no the lightning axe the giant stone axe

1349
01:52:56,920 --> 01:53:02,680
that dragon slayer axe or whatever yeah yeah that's the one i've been using that's a pussy fucker it's

1350
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:07,800
it's slightly it's slightly weaker than the weapon like the great i just had a great axe for most of

1351
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:11,960
the game and then like on new game plus i started using that one it's ever so slightly weaker but

1352
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:17,480
it does lightning damage which a lot of enemies are surprisingly weak too so like especially that

1353
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:23,160
made the osiris fight fucking awesome yeah dragon so i'm like oh yeah so i go in there and start

1354
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:27,960
spamming my weapon art on him and i was like fuck yeah fuck you osiris what the fuck is that guy's

1355
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:33,480
deal he's like gotta dude that is the do you realize that he you know that he is the king right

1356
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:39,560
he is king lothric he's he's king lothric what because if you there's certain item descriptions

1357
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:44,920
that say that king lothric at some point went insane and started trying to become a dragon oh

1358
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:50,280
he was studying ceaths like uh like all of his knowledge i missed all of that yeah that's that's

1359
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:55,640
why the brothers are in charge now the princes because the king fucking went down and went insane

1360
01:53:55,640 --> 01:54:01,560
and somehow i have no idea how transformed into a dragon i have no idea what the fuck osilot is

1361
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:06,440
yeah that's why he's a baby or like you can hear a cry so like it's maybe real what i don't know

1362
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:11,560
that is the most out of all the lore i want to know please anyone who makes lore videos please

1363
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:17,800
fucking explain osiris and osiris that is by far the most curious i am about anything in this game

1364
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:22,200
i want to know everything about him he's so fucking cool his voice is all the voice acting in this

1365

1380
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:59,560
pissed off because my fire katana did not look like a fire katana and so it did not match my

1381
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:04,840
icy sword so i was mad you just you gotta use some fucking uh some of that uh what is it you know uh

1387
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:36,360
and that's that's it that's all i got by the way one one quick thing about lore just people need

1388
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:41,880
to figure this shit out am i is the dancer like a princess of lothric that was like captured and

1389
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:47,160
turned by the pontiff into like a horrible abomination i heard that somewhere anyone know

1390
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:52,040
anything about this no i've never heard about this okay never mind we'll make a lore video about

1391
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:56,440
somebody i want to know about the dancer okay we need it all we need it all i think there was a
