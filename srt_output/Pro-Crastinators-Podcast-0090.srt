00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,400
Last month's episode was Game of Thrones.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,200
The books really are way better.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,600
Reading is boring and reading is for little babies.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,600
It's so much- okay.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,600
There's just so much superfluous shit.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
No, that's the good stuff. God damn it.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,200
No, no.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
He fucking let the thoughts get to him, man.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,400
He let the thoughts get to him in a proud mig-towel like Littlefinger.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,600
I just cannot buy that what the fuck happened to that guy.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,800
Is Arya Stark OP? Yes or fuck yes?

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, to watch her obliterate literally every religious person in the world was-

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That was the fucking-

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That was your apiest dream, wasn't it?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,400
The girl said, you know nothing, Jon Snow, and I want Jon to say, and now I know.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:00,400
That's Patreon.com slash The Pro Crastinators, making you squeal like a pig every single time.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,000
Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Inside the PCP Studio.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:27,400
We are delighted to welcome this evening all the members of the PCP who had 10 minutes to spare.

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,800
Stolen directly from the show we're ripping off, our guests will be answering 10 intimate questions.

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:42,600
We will be diving deep into the troubled pasts and unhinged psyche of our fair guests.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:52,200
And by the time we are through, you may find yourself cognizant of just what the fuck actually even is the deal.

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Let us begin with our first guest.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,400
As our first guest on the stage tonight, we welcome the runt of the litter, the baby junior,

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:17,400
the lowly creature on the lowest point on the totem pole, the creature with every feature that a human being can have,

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:28,400
the strongest baby in the world weightlifting championships, the master of spice and anger, and he's cool.

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Welcome, everyone. Munchy, where's Tiny Hats?

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:41,400
I was going to be the next in the line of the Greek gods succession. I'm haired to the throne of Zeus, and I was plucked up from the ground too early.

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,400
I wasn't able to complete my metamorphosis. I was growing inside the ground much like a potato, and I was plucked beforehand.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:59,400
So I'm not a god yet. I'm half mortal. My only weakness is that I'm completely and utterly successful to all sorts of marketing and advertising.

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:08,400
And if you even slightly suggest to me that I should buy something, I will do it. That's my only flaw. Otherwise, I'm completely immortal.

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Artist. Yes.

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Podcaster.

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Inventor of the arm. Retriever. Retriever of arms, indeed. Indeed. His career is as illustrious as his body mass is extensive.

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
He's known for all these things and more.

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,400
My waistline is almost as dense as the horizon for which my future, where my future rests upon.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:46,400
My future is so broad and dense, much like my gigantic fucking stomach that I will use to consume all of you meager, mean, minuscule before me.

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Like one fucking, like with one fell chomp. I shall obliterate you. I am here.

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Indeed. And let's get into that process immediately.

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Munchy, what is your favorite word?

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:11,400
My favorite, I should preface this, which I have extensive notes for all of these intense and rigorous military grade questions you have said before me.

43
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:20,400
I've read them all complete in utter sincerity and none of them possess any of my, you know, trademark tact or addiction.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,400
And all of them will be completely straight. There will be no jokes. In fact, I probably won't even be speaking for most of them.

45
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:37,400
I'll just be communicating like so vividly through my thoughts and actions. I'll be blinking in Morse code, so just please bear in mind that.

46
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,400
When you just hear, you know, that's me communicating at my highest level.

47
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Right.

48
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,400
All right. So my favorite word is my, I should say my favorite phrase to hear is either thank you or good job.

49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,400
But if you want to be a real stickler and force me into just one word, I like the word nautical for some reason.

50
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,400
I wish it was like a variant of awesome or cool instead of pertaining to like sea bass aesthetics.

51
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Like I want to just be like, dude, that's like nautical.

52
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Dude, pass me that fucking nautical pussy, dude.

53
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Yeah.

54
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Good. Yes.

55
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Thank you. What is your least favorite word?

56
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I don't know if I even have a least favorite word like, like, like context will mean anything.

57
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,400
So like any word, like even really like detestable words like, like quiche or like clitoris.

58
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,400
They have their uses in some context.

59
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Yes. Thank you.

60
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Yeah.

61
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
What turns you on, Munchy?

62
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,400
What an awful question. I'm against all forms of being turned on, especially spiritually.

63
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
No, it's open to interpretation. Yeah.

64
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Spiritually, creatively, emotionally.

65
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Your Kundalini Bear Bee is flaccid as my eternally, erectile defunct triple inch pinch,

66
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
or I'll turn your clit into fucking roadkill with my steamroller.

67
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Okay, but seriously.

68
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Okay.

69
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,400
There's no one way to get me in like the creative mood or whatever.

70
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Like anything from like coffee to like short deadlines will get me there.

71
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
You want my inspirational G-spot?

72
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,400
It's like blasting fucking like gay ass like weird earthbound music into my ears

73
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,400
and running for a real long time so I get all huffy and puffy.

74
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
That's what I'll do.

75
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Whenever I need to get in the creative mood,

76
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
I'll just like turn on like the earthbound soundtrack,

77
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
blast it so like my ears start hurrying after a while

78
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,400
and just run down my street as fast as I can.

79
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Yeah, great.

80
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
What turns you off?

81
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Any sort of like messy work environment or like clutter in my brain.

82
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
If I'm like particularly annoyed or frustrated,

83
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
it'll lead like psychic residue in my cranium,

84
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
make it hard to like focus on anything.

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
So I have to like have my room be cleaned, which is never.

86
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,400
And I have to not be like angry at the world, which is also never.

87
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Indeed.

88
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
What is your favorite curse word?

89
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm really into it as I'm sure everyone in the audience knows a racially charged slurs.

90
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Out of all the curse words, they undoubtedly carry the most weight.

91
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
And rightfully so because they're fucking barbaric.

92
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Indeed.

93
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
My favorite is the classic nigger.

94
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
I mean, it's definitely my most used.

95
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
I don't actually say it as much as I used to, I think,

96
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
despite that being the go-to flanderization of me.

97
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
It's kind of boring at this point.

98
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Like when not even an inbomb can elicit an eyebrow raised from your friend's circle,

99
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
you need to get, you know, you need to get some new material and probably better friends.

100
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Indeed.

101
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Indeed.

102
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
What sound or noise do you love?

103
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Have you ever played Lego Star Wars the complete saga for Xbox 360?

104
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Unfortunately, I have not, but I'm sure our illustrious audience has.

105
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
In that game, there are 10 collectible items in each level called mini kits.

107
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,400
And if you collect them all, you can build like a small Lego set

108
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
based off the level you just played in the overworld.

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I never gave a shit about 100% completing games until I heard the noise

110
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
that blasts through your fucking speakers when you pick up a mini kit.

111
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I don't even know if I can describe it.

112
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
It's simultaneously the most gratifying, orgasmic sound you'll ever hear

113
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,400
and probably the worst fucking god-awful goddamn like train crash of noise

114
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
you'll ever be fucking earrape with because the game is so loud on that sound effect

115
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
in particular as opposed to the rest of the game.

116
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
I'm going to try and demonstrate here.

117
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
PUSH-A-WING!

118
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
That's what happens whenever you get like a positive collection.

119
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
PUSH-A-WING!

120
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
That's the sound of a job well done.

121
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Yeah, it is. It is.

122
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Well, then what sound or noise do you hate?

123
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
I'm pretty much in love with every sound conceivable,

124
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,400
even like unsettling or comfortable noises like moaning or licking.

125
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
I can get down in if the context is right.

126
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,400
For instance, if the moaning is the moan of a sad African child that I'm working to death

127
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
in order to fund my blood diamond operations,

128
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
then I can really get behind that.

129
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
But in all of the context, I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass that by.

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
I don't know if there's anyone against, it's all context.

131
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Fair enough.

132
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
What profession, other than your own, would you like to attempt?

133
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,400
I fantasize about myself in various odd contradictory and like totally removed

134
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
from my actual skill set type job.

135
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
It's basically every day.

136
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
I like look out the window on the bus

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
and think about the things that I'll do when I open a restaurant

138
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,400
without actually having any knowledge or desire to cook above the popcorn level.

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I can't even really imagine doing anything other than drawing.

140
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Since like, Patreon has existed for as long as I could have eased,

141
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
feasibly actually started working.

142
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
That's how much of a baby I am.

143
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Since I'm surrounded by creatives in my life,

144
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I don't even really consider it an option to be like a construction worker or something.

145
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,400
And I'm too focused on drawing to actually have even like really dabbled in other mediums

146
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
that I see, to like see if I like them or anything.

147
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Like painting, I don't know.

148
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Maybe, like a little, maybe.

149
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I don't know.

150
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,400
All that being said, I've kind of wanted to be a teacher

151
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
in the way, way back in my head.

152
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Like one perished soul.

153
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
A while ago.

154
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Maybe a chef, if I learn how to fry an egg.

155
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Something like that.

156
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Teacher, chef, blood diamond operator.

157
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
All those sorts of things.

158
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Are right up my sleeve.

159
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Slave master slash driver.

160
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Auction, block, hawker.

161
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Have you ever seen Indiana Jones and the Tip of the Doon?

162
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Human trafficker.

163
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
That but for real.

164
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
That but in real life.

165
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Excellent.

166
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
What a rich tapestry we're weaving here.

167
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,400
What profession would you not like to do?

168
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Any job where I'm responsible for people's lives.

169
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Like being like a doctor or a lawyer.

170
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Like that would like put me in an early shallow grave.

171
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,400
My hands are too shaky and my brain is too empty

172
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
to be as noble as those dentist and airplane pallets out there.

173
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I fucking will salute them until the day I die.

174
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
And I do not have, I do not have the mental fortitude

175
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,400
in order to like pluck a teeth out.

176
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Hmm, I see.

177
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
With any tact.

178
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
And that is.

179
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Of course.

180
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
And lastly, Munchy, if heaven exists,

181
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
what would you like to hear God say

182
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,400
when you arrive at the pearly gates?

183
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Not that.

184
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,400
First of all, instant and incessant assurance

185
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
that I'm not in hell.

186
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Basically for the rest of my existence.

187
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Would you be in doubt about this?

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Yes.

189
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Why would you need assurance of this?

190
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Even if he says that I'm in heaven,

191
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I will never believe him.

192
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,400
No matter what happens, I will believe that I'm in hell.

193
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,400
It sounds like to me, you're creating your own hell

194
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
regardless of the circumstances by thinking that.

195
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
That's correct.

196
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Why doubt that you are in heaven

197
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
when God himself is assuring you of it?

198
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Who's to say that's not the devil?

199
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Who's to say that is God?

200
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Who's to say?

201
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
But if your day to day experience in heaven is like good,

202
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
why would you then think, oh no, what if I'm in hell?

203
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Like as long as you're having a good time,

204
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
what's there to doubt?

205
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Have you ever seen that one episode of the Twilight Zone

206
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
where the fucking gangster goes to heaven

207
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
and then he goes to the casino day in, day out

208
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
and he just keeps waiting at the casino to the point

209
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
where there's no stakes anymore

210
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
and he knows he's just gonna get win

211
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
and crush all the puts that he wants

212
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
so that life has no stakes anymore?

213
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
That's what I'm assuming heaven is.

214
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Okay, okay, I see.

215
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
That makes sense.

216
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
So if everything is just peachy and good,

217
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
I'm assuming that I will be in hell.

218
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
So I need God to tell me,

219
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
every single morning when I wake up

220
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
and every single night when I go to bed

221
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
I'll be in heaven, indeed, in heaven, just to make sure.

222
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
And then after that's all said and done,

223
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
maybe like a fatherly pat on the back

224
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
and like my room key to where I'll be in heaven.

225
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Also, preferably at some point we can reenact

226
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
the final battle from the Simpsons game

227
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
for Xbox 360 sometime as well.

228
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Where God plays DER with the Simpsons

229
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
and in each stage you have to destroy

230
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
a new video game system in order to damage God.

231
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
That's what I would want to do.

232
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Well, so it shall be.

233
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Well, thank you for sharing this with us, Munchy.

234
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
We know that you're a busy man,

235
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
so kindly get the fuck off my stage.

236
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
And now the PCP studio is proud to bring you

237
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
the heart and soul of this organization,

238
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
the editor at large,

239
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,400
the big hair, lion main guy.

240
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,400
He loves roller coasters when they're in tie.

241
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
They're in typhoons, as I recall.

242
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
And here he is.

243
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
He's the DeVoo, everybody.

244
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I am definitely not, however, an editor at large.

245
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
There's basically no one else but DG

246
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,400
and a few others who I would be willing to edit for.

247
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
You'd have to have really interesting videos

248
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
for the editing of them to be interesting enough

249
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
to be worth doing.

250
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,400
My apology will be etched on my tombstone.

251
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Now, let's move on to the questions here.

252
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Question number one.

253
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
DeVoo, what is your favorite word?

254
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Power.

255
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,400
It's because it's so hard to decide

256
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
what your favorite word is.

257
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
You can only look at external data,

258
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
external to yourself asking the question.

259
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,400
And the external data I collected was remembering

260
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,400
that just every time I got back from work

261
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
at a job I didn't want to do,

262
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,400
or got back up on the horse from some lack of inspiration,

263
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
or just anything where I'm finally in the zone again,

264
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
I can't help but yell to myself,

265
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
power, power, power, power, over and over again,

266
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
a bunch of times.

267
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I'm not exactly sure why,

268
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,400
but I would just sort of silently scream it to myself

269
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
a lot of times, the word power just a bunch of times.

270
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Don't really know the meaning of that,

271
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,400
but it must be my favorite word then.

272
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Fascinating.

273
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Question two.

274
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
What is your least favorite word?

275
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Bias.

276
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
It is used very obnoxiously,

277
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
very flippantly,

278
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
very pervasively,

279
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
not just in the reviewer sphere,

280
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
but all around.

281
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,400
And I guess when I press people to define it,

282
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
the definition works well enough,

283
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,400
but it's used in a way that makes it meaningless.

284
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
It's just like, you have an opinion

285
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
because you have an opinion,

286
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
or you're doing something with a certain slant

287
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
relative to some ideology or another,

288
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
because you do.

289
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
You know, it's always the way it's used.

290
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
It's always like, you have this opinion

291
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
because you have this opinion, therefore,

292
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
your opinion doesn't matter or isn't valid.

293
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
And it's really obnoxious,

294
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
and it obstructs a lot of conversation.

295
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Hmm.

296
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Davoo, you are by far the quickest responder

297
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
of all our illustrious guests,

298
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
yet thus far today.

299
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
I looked up the questions that you posted on an image,

300
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
and I just typed them all into a notepad ahead of time.

301
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
That explains everything.

302
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Let's move on.

303
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
What turns you on?

304
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Unmet needs in the world,

305
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
or to myself, right?

306
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I can't artistically inspire myself,

307
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
or even just physically inspire myself.

308
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,400
If I can't see it working towards

309
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
a grand goal of something that will really matter

310
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
and make a difference,

311
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
and by difference, I don't mean people

312
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
dying of cancer or some shit, who cares about that,

313
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
but a certain type of video game

314
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
or a certain type of video that doesn't exist

315
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
and needs to exist,

316
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
and that's the thing.

317
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
I think a lot of artistically-minded people

318
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
spend a lot of their time doing two things,

319
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
but never at the same time.

320
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
A lot of the time they spend their time

321
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
getting mad about all the art that doesn't exist,

322
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
that they wish could exist.

323
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
If only there could be an action story

324
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
to this trope that all of them have

325
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
that I'm really sick of, right?

326
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Do that all the fucking time.

327
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Another thing artistic people do

328
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
is they spend their time looking at a blank canvas

329
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
and going, I just don't have any ideas.

330
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
If you just combine those two hobbies,

331
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
those two pastimes,

332
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
then you just make a thing

333
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
that is the thing that you want to exist.

334
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Why can't there just be a video game that does this?

335
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
We'll make that video game.

336
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Unmet needs, that's what gets me the most hyped

337
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
to make things or be inspired.

338
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
What turns you off?

339
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Having to do boring things for people.

340
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Like, hey, can you go

341
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
drive to this place

342
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
to do this thing, to get a thing

343
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
and then take it over here?

344
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Because it always takes longer than you want

345
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
or you expect or you're told.

346
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
There's always something that requires you

347
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
to just stand there for 30 minutes

348
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
waiting for it to happen.

349
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Usually it's just, once you let

350
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
that bathtub drain of

351
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
your productive day get unplugged,

352
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
it's gonna mostly drain out

353
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
before you can cap that shit back on.

354
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
The thing about doing things

355
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
is that it always takes three times longer

356
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
than it advertises.

357
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
It's like a 30 minute drive.

358
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Well, that means 30 minutes of getting ready

359
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
and 30 minutes of chilling out after you get back

360
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
to recover your senses.

361
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Everything takes exactly three times longer

362
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
than you expect.

363
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Oh, a week long trip.

364
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
That's a week of you getting nothing done preparing for the trip

365
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
and then a week of you getting nothing done recovering from the trip.

366
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
It's a good rule of thumb.

367
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
What is your favorite curse word?

368
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Face.

369
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
I'm sorry, face?

370
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Yeah, because people always talk about

371
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
like the sort of, what would you call it,

372
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
the primers of

373
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
of swears, right?

374
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Like what is the cracking of the whip?

375
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
But we don't put as much emphasis on

376
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
what you call it, the conjunctions of swears

377
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
and face is like a fantastic conjunction

378
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
or whatever you call it.

379
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
So as opposed to emphasizing the fuck in the fuck face,

380
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
you just emphasize the face.

381
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Fuck face, shit face, bitch face,

382
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
cunt face, right?

383
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
It's like face kind of gets in on

384
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
gets in on all that. And I love using face just

385
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
just raw, like fuck it.

386
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Your face, me and my brother like to say

387
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
you face case, you know,

388
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
it's just fun to say face.

389
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
It's just very fun to say.

390
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Interesting.

391
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
What sound or noise

392
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
do you love?

393
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
I broke this into two categories.

394
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
The broad favorite sound

395
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
is rain, you know, very generic one.

396
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
My very specific one, my favorite

397
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
video game sound effect

398
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
is the laughter sound effect

399
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
of a guest in roller coaster tycoon.

400
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
They have this very chipmunk-esque

401
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
chirp and it's really pleasant.

402
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
It really just warms my soul.

403
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
How was that sound effect

404
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
carried over to the later roller coaster

405
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
tycoons? Did it get lost in translation?

406
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Oh, well, yeah, the second game still has it.

407
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
The third game, I don't remember, probably something

408
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
stupid, like, you know,

409
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
I don't know about the fourth game

410
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
I never really watched any footage of that or played it.

411
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Would you say, well, actually, I'll just

412
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
leave it up to you. What sound or noise do you hate?

413
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Okay, so the broad one

414
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
that I hate the most is the radio.

415
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
The way that the radio sounds

416
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
be it AM or FM, FM's

417
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
a little bit better, I think. No, it's kind of

418
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
worse. Like, it's more pleasant

419
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
to the ears, but it's more nauseating to my

420
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
stomach. Everything about the radio

421
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
It falls more into the sound Uncanny

422
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Valley, perhaps? Yeah, something like

423
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
that. Like, the way it's mixed, the way

424
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
that, like, car speakers emit it

425
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
especially when it's in a car.

426
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
It's bad enough that in a car I'm already getting

427
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
a little bit motion sick because I'm kind of prone to that.

428
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
But, like, the radio just stirs the pot,

429
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
literally, the pot of my stomach

430
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
and the way that music

431
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
sounds on it bothers me, but especially

432
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
the way that all radio talk people, be they

433
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
DJs in between songs or talk show hosts

434
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
they sicken me

435
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
unless they have a very distinct charismatic

436
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
voice and they can power through it. But if they're just

437
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
the generic, like, and now we're going to be

438
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
talking over here. Oh, yes, and I'm the woman talking

439
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
over here. We're going to be, like, talking about stuff

440
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
and then mildly chuckling at one another. That's right,

441
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
we are. I want to die. I want to puke

442
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
every single time. I don't know what it is. Something

443
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
about the microphones they use at the studio, the way

444
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
the speakers set up, the way that they are trained to speak

445
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
it kills me. And

446
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
my least favorite, very specific sound

447
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
effect is the

448
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
sort of stinger sound effect

449
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
that escapistmagazines.com

450
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
uses. I don't know if they still use it, I think

451
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
they do, on all their shows.

452
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
It's, like,

453
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
HA!

454
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
And do you know what I'm talking about?

455
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
I mean, it's weird, because I almost have a weird

456
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Stockholm syndrome

457
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
for it, because when I hear it, I immediately,

458
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
my mind swells with

459
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
You think you're about to watch a Zero Punctuation?

460
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah, yeah, my mind swells with a Zero Punctuation sound

461
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
effect, with the extra credit theme song,

462
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
with the movie boss theme song.

463
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
See, I've never heard that outside the context of a Zero Punctuation

464
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
board, you need to realize. And with Jim position.

465
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
So many fucking

466
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
openings, I think of when I hear it,

467
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
but I still hate it. It's really fucking obnoxious.

468
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
It's, the

469
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
swishing of

470
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
the pen, the swishing of the pen

471
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
has sort of like this

472
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
anti-ASMR effect for me.

473
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
For people into ASMR, a lot of them are aware of, like,

474
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
it can be ASMR in a bad way that pisses

475
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
you off, and it sort of, like, rolls

476
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
you into this obnoxiousated

477
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
state. But then it, like,

478
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
punishes you with this obnoxious fucking

479
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
scream, and I don't know why they thought

480
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
that was, like, good marketing. It's, like, to be as earwormy

481
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
as possible. I don't, I don't, I don't get it.

482
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Like, if they're trying to, like, gain more,

483
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
you know, viewers and shit, maybe they should, like,

484
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
introduce better content more

485
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
than, like, every other decade.

486
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
A question for the ages.

487
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
What profession, other than

488
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
your own, would you like to attempt?

489
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
The one

490
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I most am frustrated with myself

491
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
for not being, but no I never could be

492
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
just because it would take too much

493
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
time, is data

494
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
slash fact researcher.

495
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
The problem with all opinions,

496
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
be they political or anything

497
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
about history or anything at all,

498
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
there's always this issue of, well,

499
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
fact X, Y, and Z says this,

500
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
so clearly it's proven. Then someone else goes,

501
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
yeah, well, here's facts A, B, and C

502
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
completely contradicting it. And it's, like, well,

503
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
shit. I don't, I'm stuck.

504
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Now I can't, I can't believe anything, right?

505
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
But I know that if you

506
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
research something enough, eventually

507
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
the cracks in genuine

508
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
misinformation show

509
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
and you can tell when something

510
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
is legit or not, right? Like, you know, you can never

511
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
confirm everything, but

512
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
no one's gonna fucking, like, tell me some

513
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
video game history fact and convince me

514
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
otherwise. Like, I've seen the same information

515
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
like, echoed by

516
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
enough sources that you can,

517
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
like, a genuine sense of truth

518
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
can emerge from within. But

519
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
unless you spend all your time

520
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
learning avenues of information

521
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
you can't get that intuitive sense of true

522
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
fact. And so I'm constantly

523
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
fucking stuck. And

524
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I just wish that people could always,

525
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
I just want to, like, go and, like, see things that people

526
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
are arguing about on social media, but no one's

527
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
ever, like, taking the time to research and then,

528
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
like, research it. Like, like, actually

529
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
look at all the data and, like, like, come up

530
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
with my findings.

531
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
So you want to sort of forge your own

532
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
career path here, interrupting people's

533
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
social media interaction to let them know where

534
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
the facts lie. Which I think is a valuable

535
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
service. Yeah, my favorite one to be would be

536
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
who is being, which

537
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
political opinion is being more

538
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
unreasonable to the president they don't

539
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
like? Because the thing that everyone always gets caught up

540
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
on is, uh, people are

541
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
being mean to the president for this

542
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
reason and that reason, to which people are, like, well

543
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
people are unreasonable to the previous

544
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
president for the exact same reasons.

545
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
It's like, okay, are we all,

546
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
like, basically I just want to, my favorite one

547
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
for me, the golden, the golden goose

548
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
of facts, would be to see if I could

549
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
mathematically calculate if one political side

550
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
is more unreasonable than the other.

551
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Mathematically proven. That would be fucking

552
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
satisfying.

553
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Well,

554
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
another question for another time. But what

555
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
profession would you not like to do?

556
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
So I thought about, I mean,

557
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
almost any job would be, you know, mind

558
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
bendingly boring for me and I just commit suicide

559
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
so I wouldn't actually ever do the job, right?

560
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
So I'm only, like, counting jobs I actually

561
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
would end up doing and not leaving

562
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
and that would be, and it's sort of, like,

563
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
a very subtle, it's almost the same

564
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
as the profession I just said, actually,

565
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
but subtly different.

566
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
It's being professionally right

567
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
where

568
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
sort of people for whom... I don't understand.

569
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
It's people for whom their job

570
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
is to be correct

571
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
on, like, the things that they're talking about.

572
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Like, perhaps like a, uh, like a, what's the word?

573
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
A witness? What do they call them? A specialty

574
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
witness or whatever? No, no, it's like, you know,

575
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
it's hookin' YouTube political pundits.

576
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
You know what I mean? Like, the people

577
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
who have these very specific ideologies

578
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
and do a lot of research and education and all,

579
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
but, you know, like, the point of their channel

580
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
is that they constantly, like, hammer in

581
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
their ideology over and over and over again

582
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
and their job

583
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
is to be correct and

584
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
right. And it's especially... Perhaps, like,

585
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
a less biased Stefan Malinu

586
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
sort of thing? Yeah.

587
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Well, it's like, well, that's the thing, right?

588
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Not to attach you to his name.

589
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Well, well, the problem

591
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
is that I think once your job is to

592
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
be right, then you've already, like, fucked

593
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
everything up, I think. Like, basically

594
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
your job, what you wake

595
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
up in the morning for is to be

596
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
correct about the issue.

597
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
And now, like, you've sort of, no matter

598
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
how self-aware you are, you've sort of

599
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
inserted yourself into this

600
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
this fallible, this highly fallible

601
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
state where you're just going to become

602
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
a demagogue. Like, you can't

603
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
control it. Doesn't matter how smart and slick

604
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
you are, once the purpose of your waking

605
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
up out of bed in the morning is to, like,

606
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
promote this idea and to re... I feel

607
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
like you'll probably get sucked

608
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
into this more easily if you are more

609
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
logically accurate. It just

610
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
fucks everyone up, because I see so many smart

611
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
people, like,

612
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
try to be pundits for certain

613
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
ideas, and they're just always

614
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
fucking stupid, too.

615
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
For no reason, other than the fact that they have

616
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
to, like, explain how right they are every

617
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
day. I don't get it. It's terrible.

618
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I hate it. Sucks.

619
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Complex shit.

620
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
And now, finally,

621
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
DaVoo, if heaven exists,

622
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
what would you like to hear God say

623
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
when you arrive at the pearly

624
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
gates? That outside

625
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
of the boundaries of heaven is just sort of, like,

626
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
an infinite plane, like, maybe mountains

627
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
and hills and stuff, but, like, you know, lots of just grass

628
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
and, uh, you know, you can

629
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
do whatever you want, like, you're still immortal

630
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
and you won't get sick, but you don't get any

631
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
heaven benefits, but you don't have to follow any

632
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
heaven rules, so the whole

633
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
crippling fear of the very notion of

634
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
heaven being a place where you worship God,

635
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
i.e. be at church forever?

636
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Yeah, you don't actually have to do that. You can just kind of, like,

637
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
fuck off. You don't get, you don't get

638
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
God care, I guess. You don't, you don't get

639
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
fucking Jesus books, but, um,

640
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
you don't get any, like,

641
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
faith stamps, right? But,

642
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
yeah, you can just go off and, like, just do

643
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
whatever you want, like, you can fuck till

644
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
the sun comes down, right? Basically, you're, you're getting

645
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
a pitch for your ideal heaven

646
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
when you, when you talk to God, or he's

647
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
explaining to you what heaven's going to, so

648
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
how, do you need to eat in this

649
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
heaven? Do you need to sustain yourself, or is this

650
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Man, I don't know, but maybe

651
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
I don't know. Is it basically just, like,

652
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
more life? Well, what I'm thinking

653
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
maybe is that, like, your cellular

654
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
structure is infinite, right? It's, like,

655
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
perpetually restored by your soul,

656
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
but maybe your soul

657
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
withers away over the course of, like, what would be

658
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
the equivalent of millions of years unless you go to

659
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
heaven, maybe, right? So maybe

660
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
that's how he fucking gets you, right? Like, maybe

661
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
he makes you sign contracts, like, you gotta be in heaven

662
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
for, like, this amount of time. Do you mean, like, by not going to

663
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
heaven, by not going to heaven, so you either

664
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
go to hell, or you remain as a ghost

665
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
on, on earth? I'm just thinking, like, maybe

666
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
the outskirts of heaven is a place where you can go

667
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
hollow, essentially, right? Cause, like, your soul

668
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
you started making me think about what would be

669
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
the, the finite resource of this. I think your

670
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
soul would eventually wither away, right?

671
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
And so, like, in heaven, your soul

672
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
can be restored a bunch of times, or, you know, infinitely.

673
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
So, that would be, like, the

674
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
push and pull, right? So...

675
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
You gotta rest in heaven's bonfire every once in a while

676
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
to refill your soul flask, okay?

677
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
So, yeah, I'm not expecting this to be perfect,

678
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
but, uh, I just, that's,

679
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
I just don't, I've never, I've

680
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
never fucking been convinced

681
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
that heaven would be a good place to live!

682
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Like, all the materials that it's made out of

683
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
don't look comfortable. Would you like

684
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
to walk around on fucking shiny-ass

685
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
roads all the time? It probably, like, gets stuck to

686
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
your fucking feet, creating little, like, puddles of sweat

687
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
every fucking day.

688
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
I don't know. I guess when

689
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
I was disgusted, it was always just, like, it'll be

690
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
whatever would be perfect for you. It was kind

691
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
of how I was explained to it when I was

692
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
growing up. It's too vague. It's too fucking

693
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
vague. And the idea is that you worship God

694
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
all day forever. What the fuck?

695
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Like, who the hell makes

696
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
this alternate species just to worship you?

697
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Like... A sycophant.

698
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Yeah.

699
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Well, I'm glad we

700
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
tackled that. D'Vu,

701
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
thank you. Yes.

702
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Please go and rejoin the collective

703
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
and get the fuck off my stage.

704
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
This has been the PCP Studio. Goodbye.

705
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
See ya.

706
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

707
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
please welcome to the stage

708
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
the one, the only,

709
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Green Ranger, Godzilla,

710
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Tablet Boy

711
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
himself, God

712
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
King, Lord

713
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
of

714
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
poverty.

715
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Tom Oliver.

716
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
I don't know if I'm the God King. I feel like

717
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Ben Saint was the ruling

718
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
poverty man. I'm just

719
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
an astute

720
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
student

721
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
in his mastery.

722
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
I've yet to eat out of the trash, but I'm working

723
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
way up there, you know? I see you too

724
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
as sort of the heads of your two opposing

725
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
parties on the war for extreme

726
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
poverty domination.

727
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
It's a war I wage under duress,

728
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
believe me.

729
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Perfect.

730
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Okay, let's

731
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
get serious now. This is a serious artistic

732
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
time. Mr.

733
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Oliver, what is your

734
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
favorite word?

735
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Fuck

736
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
is absolutely my favorite word. It's so

737
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
flexible. It can be, it's a great,

738
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
the great thing about fuck is that it can

739
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
be used to enhance everything else.

740
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Anything, any word

741
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
that I already like can be made better

742
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
when you introduce a fuck, you know?

743
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Like, I like,

744
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I don't even know. Any word you can think

745
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
of. It's fucking better

746
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
when you use a fucking

747
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
prefix to it. It's great.

748
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
I couldn't agree more.

749
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
But this is not about me. This is about you.

750
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
You're the artist here. I am the industry

751
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
shill. Question two.

752
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
What is your least favorite word?

753
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
I

754
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
got

755
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
two options.

756
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
I got two options.

757
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
I'm going to lay

758
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
them both out.

759
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
I don't like moist.

760
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
I know it's a very commonly thing.

761
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
It sounds weird. It definitely feels weird.

762
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
And n-bombs, I don't like

763
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
just because it's so phonetically pleasing

764
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
to say, but it's socially unacceptable.

765
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
So it constantly tempts me.

766
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Those are my two choices there.

767
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Oh, yeah. Oh, big time.

768
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Big time.

769
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Next question.

770
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
What turns you on?

771
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
And it adds creatively,

772
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
spiritually, or emotionally, but again, fuck that.

773
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
That's boring. No, it's all about

774
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
the sensual

775
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
shit, right?

776
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
I'm all about

777
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
those sick

778
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
curves, bro.

779
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Those hard, those like...

780
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
He likes them thick.

781
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

782
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Well, it's more like

783
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
everything in moderation as Aristotle

784
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
so

785
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
it stutely pointed out all those years ago

786
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
which he was totally talking about the ladies when he made that statement.

787
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Everything in moderation.

788
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
You've got to find that golden mean, my friends.

789
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
That's where perfection lies.

790
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Duly noted.

791
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
What turns you off?

792
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Hmm.

793
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Just...

794
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I don't want to say

795
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
overconfidence, because

796
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
that's pretty nice, but confidence that isn't backed up

797
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
by

798
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
actual ability.

799
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
If you're just blowing smoke

800
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
up my ass, or just like...

801
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
That's a turn off.

802
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Also, being morbidly obese.

803
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Huge turn off. Can't stand it.

804
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
I'm sorry. How offensive of you.

805
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
You know, I got to be honest.

806
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
This is all about

807
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
being true to yourself

808
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
and that's what real art is.

809
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
It's all about injecting as much of your soul into it.

810
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
So I got to be real with you, man.

811
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Injecting as much of your hateful bigotry

812
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
as possible. Exactly.

813
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Get to a gym, god damn it.

814
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Do as I say, not as I do, because I sit on my ass too.

815
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
What sound... Oh, excuse me.

816
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
I was skipping one here. What is your favorite curse word?

817
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I think we might know the answer to this one.

818
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
I can't say fuck, because I just did.

819
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
That's my favorite word overall.

820
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Oh, you can double up. Are you sure?

821
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
I guess... Yeah, fuck.

822
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Fuck's just... It's too good.

823
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
It's too perfect.

824
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
It just feels great

825
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
and it's so versatile.

826
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
It's just...

827
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
It's fucking perfect.

828
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
You see, perfect, if you just say perfect,

829
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
it's like...

830
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
It's nice, but it's fucking perfect.

831
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
It's got that nice

832
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
phonetic rhythm to it.

833
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
It plays off of everything so well.

834
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
It's great. It's the best thing in the world.

835
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
It's got just the right amount of, like,

836
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
no actual meaning

837
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
for it to be used in all situations.

838
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
It means everything.

839
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
It's just everything and nothing at the same time.

840
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
It's the closest thing to god we've ever gotten.

841
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Indeed. Indeed.

842
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
What sound or

843
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
noise do you love?

844
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
The PlayStation 1 boot up is, like,

845
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
the best sound

846
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
of all time.

847
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
It almost... It gets me hard.

848
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
99% of the time

849
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
it's the best thing.

850
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
That should be...

851
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
They never should have gotten rid of it.

852
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
If I could, like, make every console boot up

853
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
and do that at my computer, I would

854
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
because it's the best.

855
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
What sound or noise do you hate?

856
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
The screeching

857
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
and crying of babies and toddlers.

858
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
The worst.

859
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
The worst sound in the world. Absolutely.

860
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Every time I hear that, I had to grow up with the younger sister

861
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
so I heard it constantly

862
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
and it's deeply embedded in my

863
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
DNA now that that sound

864
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
makes me want to commit murder.

865
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
I think school shooters, they go

866
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
to just have less of that sound

867
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
in the world. That's why they do it.

868
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
I feel for them.

869
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Hashtag we stand with the Columbine

870
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
shooters. For sure. He knew it was up.

871
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
They handled the other ones.

872
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Yes.

873
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
What profession other than your own

874
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
would you like to attempt?

875
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
I would love to

876
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
be a musician more.

877
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
I'd love to learn how to do the musics.

878
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
I feel like that's the one talent

879
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
and skill and ability that I'd like

880
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
to spend time grinding out.

881
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
It feels like such a gargantuan mountain

882
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
decline with all this other stuff. I have no idea

883
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
when I'm ever going to be able to get around to it.

884
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
That would complete my skill repertoire

885
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
and make me a god.

886
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Indeed.

887
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
What profession would you not like to do?

888
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
I would

889
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
hate anything. Anything involving being

890
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
stuck in a cubicle all day.

891
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
I feel like you might be able to

892
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
understand my pains in that one.

893
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Indeed.

894
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
You're in a prison.

895
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
It's worse than being in prison because

896
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
in prison you're locked in, you can't get out.

897
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
A cubicle is like a prison but the door

898
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
is right there and you know you can't

899
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
leave through it even if you wanted to.

900
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
It's awful.

901
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
You're imprisoning yourself of your own

902
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
volition as opposed to being in jail

903
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
where you can't get out even if you wanted to.

904
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Hmm.

905
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
It's a prison of the mind if you will.

906
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Indeed.

907
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Lastly, if heaven exists,

908
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
what would you like to hear God say

909
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
when you arrive at the pearly gates?

910
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Here's your 72 virgins.

911
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Which I'm sure you expect

912
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
to hear when you get it.

913
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Absolutely. That goes back to the school

914
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
shooting and everything.

915
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
I'm planning it out. It's going to be great guys.

916
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
18 big plans.

917
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
It's going to go out with a bang in 2018 everybody.

918
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
For sure.

919
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Hashtag plans for 2018. Here we go.

920
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Well, this has been

921
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
an honor to discuss these things

922
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
with the one and only Green Ranger himself.

923
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Thank you for being here Mr. Oliver.

924
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Please get the fuck off my stage.

925
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Okay, bye.

926
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
And now ladies and gentlemen, as a special treat

927
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
in her first live appearance

928
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
of all time, we have

929
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
the one, the only,

930
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
the beast from the east.

931
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
The purple creature

932
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
with no facial feature.

933
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
It is lethal aurora mage.

934
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
That's one good intro.

935
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Right.

936
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Off the top of my fucking head.

937
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
I nailed it. Okay, I'm sorry, but this is serious.

938
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
No, you did well.

939
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Round of applause.

940
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Thank you. Oh, and I almost forgot to go

941
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
of your credentials. Animator.

942
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
YouTube memesmen extraordinaire.

943
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Purple aficionado of all

944
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
which we have in common, which we have in common.

945
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
A reverence for the color purple.

946
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
It bonds us stronger than any blood ties.

947
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Indeed, indeed.

948
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Now, let's get down

949
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
to these questions that people

950
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
want to know.

951
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Mage, what is your favorite

952
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
word?

953
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
My favorite word.

954
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
And this is particularly interesting since

955
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
you're not a native English speaker.

956
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
So perhaps it'd be a whole different language.

957
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
No, I speak

958
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
more English than I do my native language.

959
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
So,

960
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
English is preferred.

961
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
I haven't really thought about it to be quite

962
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
honest.

963
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
That's the nature of the hot seat that you're in

964
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
at this very moment. Oh, no, no.

965
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
I'm going to spend 10 minutes contemplating

966
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
the reality.

967
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
What word do I say a lot?

968
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Oh, fuck.

969
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
I should ask my boyfriend.

970
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
What your favorite word is?

971
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
No.

972
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
What's my favorite word?

973
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
What's the word I use the most?

974
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Because I swear, no, no, because I'm

975
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
put on the spot if I forgot what I

976
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
feel. Well, you can define favorite

977
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
in any terms that you see fit.

978
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
A word that sounds good to you,

979
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
a word that you use most commonly,

980
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
a word that you just enjoy. What if it's not actually

981
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
a word?

982
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
I'm willing to accept that.

983
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
I think the people are, the people will judge.

984
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I think I might have explained it at some point.

985
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
I don't know where.

986
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Snuck-a-snuck

987
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
which is a stupid

988
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
mispronunciation of the word snake

989
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
from this one

990
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
video about Pokémon were

991
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
real or something like that and they had a snake

992
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
but they called it Snuck-a-snuck.

993
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
But that's what I ended up calling

994
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
my cat and now we call the cat

995
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Snuck-a-snuck. And it's really fun to

996
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
say. Am I saying this word?

997
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Snuck-a-snuck.

998
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Snuck-a-snuck, like there's a hue

999
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
after the SNN.

1000
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Snuck-a-snuck.

1001
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Yeah.

1002
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Okay.

1003
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Well, fascinating.

1004
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
See, that's great.

1005
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
That's good stuff.

1006
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Okay.

1007
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Next question.

1008
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
What is your least favorite word?

1009
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,400
I don't even want to pronounce it.

1010
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Oh, come on.

1011
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Because I hate it so much.

1012
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Please.

1013
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
People...

1014
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
No, people are going to harass me with this word.

1015
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
If you want to spell it, I'll happily say it.

1016
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Okay, fine.

1017
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,400
But people are still going to harass me, but at least I'll get to not say it.

1018
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,400
And then I'll private it to you because out of context it's going to be really weird in

1019
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
the chat.

1020
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Okay.

1021
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Okay.

1022
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Sure.

1023
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Actually, it's going to be really funny in the private chat as well.

1024
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Okay, let's see.

1025
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
It is the word...

1026
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:14,400
Oh, this has become my favorite word.

1027
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Okay.

1028
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
The word, everyone.

1029
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Ladies and gentlemen, Maja's least favorite word is Cummys.

1030
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Cummys, ladies and gentlemen.

1031
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Oh, you know, I can relate to you.

1032
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,040
I'm kind of coming around on Cummys.

1033
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,400
I'm starting to actually like Cummys.

1034
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Well, we'll see.

1035
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
The degeneracy is sinking in.

1036
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Okay, I'm sorry.

1037
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Serious face.

1038
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
This is the PCP studio.

1039
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,400
This is a very serious thing we're doing right now.

1040
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Okay.

1041
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Thank you.

1042
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Next question.

1043
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
What turns you on?

1044
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,400
And feel free to interpret that however you like.

1045
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Good art.

1046
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Good art.

1047
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Like good line art, good colors, good position, facial expressions, good key.

1048
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Any specific examples you can think of?

1049
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,400
I'd have to like find a link of stuff, but that's going to take a while.

1050
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,400
I don't really want to bother, but it's just like it's just really good art.

1051
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,400
It's the best thing.

1052
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,400
What turns you off?

1053
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Stupid drama, I guess.

1054
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Yeah.

1055
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Simple.

1056
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Fair enough.

1057
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,400
It's just like people just searching or making drama when there doesn't need to be any drama.

1058
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Sometimes it's just like something that could be very easily resolved, but then they make

1059
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,400
the whole giant deal out of it and it just becomes everyone's problem.

1060
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,400
It's so tiring and draining and I just, I don't want any of that.

1061
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,400
I think we could all relate to that.

1062
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,400
What is your favorite curse word?

1063
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,400
What's my favorite curse word?

1064
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,400
I don't curse too much.

1065
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I've been cursing a lot more in recent years because I feel like becoming jaded.

1066
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,400
I've noticed that.

1067
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I do say fuck.

1068
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I think that's the only swear word I really say.

1069
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Sometimes I say shit, I guess.

1070
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Is it sure it's a swear word?

1071
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Absolutely, absolutely.

1072
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Not my favorite, not my favorite one, though.

1073
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Well, let's just say fuck due to lack of memory of everybody thinking about the swear words I use.

1074
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Fair enough.

1075
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,400
What sound or noise do you love?

1076
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
My cat kneeling.

1077
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
I just, I love it so much.

1078
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
He's so cute.

1079
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,400
He's currently on my lap and he's purring and snagging me and that's adorable and the best thing.

1080
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Unsurprising, an unexpected answer.

1081
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,400
What sound or noise do you hate?

1082
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,400
Both the sound and the sensation.

1083
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:22,400
I tend to grow my cat just left me.

1084
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:31,400
I grow out of my nails a bit long so when they ever scrape some surface like a wall or something

1085
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:38,400
the sound and the sensation just gets really under my skin.

1086
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,400
It's like the nails on the chalkboard sort of thing, you know?

1087
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Yeah, that's what comes to mind when you said that, yeah.

1088
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,400
What profession, other than your own, would you like to attempt?

1089
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I don't have a profession, though.

1090
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Well, such as it is, such as it is an online content creator, I suppose.

1091
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Yeah, I guess maybe.

1092
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
What else intrigues you or interests you in this world?

1093
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:09,400
I don't think I really have what it takes to be one, but I think it would be really fun if I could be like an artist for games and stuff.

1094
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,400
It's always been on my wish list of things to do.

1095
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:20,400
I've always wanted to make a game where you have to design cute monsters or characters or something like that.

1096
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
It seems like a fun thing to do.

1097
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:31,400
My art style doesn't really go well unless with mobile games or something simple like that, but yeah.

1098
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,400
What profession would you not like to do?

1099
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,400
Just like 99% of all professions.

1100
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:46,400
Fair. Anything in particular that seems super odious to you or do you just hate the cubicle idea in general?

1101
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,400
I don't hate the cubicle idea. It's kind of intriguing in a way.

1102
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Because it's just something so different from my current lifestyle.

1103
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:04,400
It's something I've thought about. Like, what would my life be if I actually worked in a cubicle and my cat is making noise. Shoot.

1104
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:12,400
Indeed. Get off of the PCP Studio stage, Mr. Pussy. This is not for you.

1105
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Now, final question.

1106
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,400
If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?

1107
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,400
You did well.

1108
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Hmm. Indeed. Indeed.

1109
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:34,400
I mean, isn't that what everyone wants to hear? You did good.

1110
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,400
Everyone has their own answer to that question. And to hear more, keep listening to the other questions.

1111
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,400
Not necessarily from God, but just like it's a good thing to hear sometimes.

1112
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
Understandable.

1113
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Well, thank you for joining us. Lethal Aurora Mage, now die off the stage.

1114
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
I will do. Goodbye.

1115
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
Goodbye.

1116
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Welcome to the stage in the PCP Studio.

1117
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:15,400
We have the illustrious, mud-dwelling, famous, small Hagrid being God King Hippocrite.

1118
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Oh, it's me. It's me. I'm Hippo.

1119
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,400
There it is.

1120
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:29,400
That's what you sound like. Thank you for joining us. You're taking time out of your very busy schedule to join us, and we appreciate it.

1121
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Thank you for being here.

1122
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
Yes. I changed my voice. I'm the other guy now.

1123
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Oh, you're the other guy. Okay, well, that's good.

1124
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
I'm both your guys.

1125
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,400
Oh, yeah, I'm here as well.

1126
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:44,400
Oh, good. We have the whole team. It's like you and your stand. Dude, is that a JoJo reference? Oh, my God.

1127
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
No, it's a yo-yo reference.

1128
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,400
Whoa, sick.

1129
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,400
This is the 90s.

1130
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,400
I would show you my yo-yo skills, but it's hard to pick up on the microphone.

1131
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Okay, right. Questions. Here we go. These are the 10 memes questions. Okay, what am I doing? Okay, here we go.

1132
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,400
Question one. What is your favorite word?

1133
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Oh, there's so many to choose from.

1134
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:19,400
I used to have like a series of favorite words, but I think I copied them from somewhere. Plinth was a good one.

1135
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,400
Oh, plinth.

1136
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
What does plinth mean again?

1137
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,400
It's like a raised platform that you put a thing on, an important thing.

1138
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:33,400
Okay. Like the pussy. You put it on a pedestal, a.k.a. a plinth. That's what we do.

1139
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,400
Yeah, you put the pussy on a plinth.

1140
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,400
That doesn't sound as good, but I like it.

1141
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,400
I'm really bad with my knowledge and brain.

1142
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,400
Hey, that's okay. Plinth. Let's go with plinth.

1143
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Plinth is all right, yeah.

1144
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,400
I don't know how long each question is supposed to be, so please hurry me along if we're too...

1145
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
Sure, sure.

1146
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,400
What is your least favorite word?

1147
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,400
There's so many words to choose from.

1148
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
Oh, I just have a list of words.

1149
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
Here we go again.

1150
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
Plinth. No.

1151
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Plinth and plinth, two diametrically opposed words, arch nemesis.

1152
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,400
I hate plinth because it's not a real word, and it just makes me upset.

1153
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,400
It's a terrible word, yeah. It's not even real.

1154
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
Okay, I guess we're going with plinth.

1155
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Okay, there it is.

1156
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,400
No, no. I thought I was out of time. Oh, geez, I'm sweating.

1157
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,400
Oh, no, no, it's okay. Don't worry, man.

1158
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
Oh, no, I got it.

1159
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,400
Cat.

1160
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,400
No, I like cats. That's incorrect.

1161
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Oh, no. That's racist against...

1162
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Delete that one. Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

1163
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
No, we're going with that. That's canon.

1164
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Okay, moving on to the next question.

1165
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,400
What turns you on?

1166
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,400
Also, it adds creatively, spiritually, or emotionally, but fuck that.

1167
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
What turns you on?

1168
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,400
Naked ladies.

1169
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Yes.

1170
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:12,400
Well, what turns me on is a big pile of mud and sticks.

1171
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,400
I like jumping in because the sticks make it crunchy,

1172
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,400
but the mud is smooth and it's like really nice.

1173
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,400
That's what hippo thinks. I don't know about that.

1174
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,400
I can't really relate.

1175
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
Pretty good.

1176
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
What turns you off?

1177
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,400
Somebody punching me really hard and knocking me out.

1178
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
You know what I mean? You know what I mean?

1179
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
Oh, I know what you mean.

1180
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,400
Lights out, you know?

1181
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Okay, right.

1182
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
Right, okay.

1183
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
Next question.

1184
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,400
What is your favorite curse word?

1185
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,400
I like cunt, but it's always like...

1186
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,400
I don't know whether to say the T enough.

1187
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,400
You can say cunt, or you can say cunt.

1188
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,400
It's more of a mouthful.

1189
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,400
I'm not sure whether I like it, but it's very effective when you use it.

1190
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,400
I guess fuck, because you fucking say fuck all the fucking time.

1191
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,400
It's a very versatile swear.

1192
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,400
What sound or noise do you love?

1193
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Sound or noise.

1194
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:50,400
I like the clanging of two pieces of wood together.

1195
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,400
There's this one song by Elbow where the drummer is like drumming,

1196
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,400
but he also has this bit where he just gets two blocks of wood and I saw him do it live.

1197
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,400
That's why I know what it is.

1198
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,400
I can't do it because I don't have two blocks of wood,

1199
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,400
but it's like a very sharp, harsh, echoing...

1200
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,400
It doesn't sound like that at all, but it's like...

1201
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,400
It's not that. It's more deep than that.

1202
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:28,400
That's what I like. It's like a meaty wood, but really short slice of a sound bite.

1203
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,400
If you look at the waveform, you could cut your eyelashes with that waveform if you printed it out.

1204
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,400
What sound or noise do you hate?

1205
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,400
Sex noises. They're so bad I mute every porn.

1206
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:50,400
Every porn is not... That's why I read Hentai because there's no sound.

1207
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,400
There's squishy gross noises. Get out of here.

1208
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,400
Also ASMR, which is exactly the same as sex noises, but with a guy's mouth.

1209
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
I don't like that.

1210
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,400
You can do it with women. There's women out there.

1211
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,400
You can have sex with women?

1212
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
So I've been told. I wouldn't know.

1213
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
Okay, next question.

1214
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Profession other than my own.

1215
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,400
I don't even know if I have one yet of my own.

1216
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,400
Well, you know.

1217
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:36,400
I think if I could decide to do a different thing, and I can, but if I'd completely stop being a YouTuber...

1218
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,400
Yeah, just go crazy. Whatever seems amazing.

1219
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,400
And I would like to be a rock star.

1220
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:49,400
I would like to be a musician going around the land and saying, yeah, baby, look at that weed.

1221
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,400
Look at my guitar.

1222
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,400
And then the people would be like, oh man, you're cool.

1223
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,400
And I would be like, I know, like Han Solo does.

1224
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,400
Yeah, yeah. You could be the next prince.

1225
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,400
That's what you should be. Only a hippo.

1226
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,400
Moving on.

1227
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,400
What profession would you not like to do?

1228
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Well, the artist formerly known as Hippocrates. That would make sense.

1229
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Ooh, yes.

1230
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,400
Because I used to be Hippocrates. All right. What was that question?

1231
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,400
The artist formerly known as a Brony Curious, aka Hippocrates.

1232
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,400
Yes.

1233
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,400
So what profession would you not like to do?

1234
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,400
I don't know. Stacking shelves in a shit show.

1235
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
Store.

1236
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,400
In a fake dog shit store.

1237
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
Stacking them shelves.

1238
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,400
No, shoveling shit in a parakeet enclosure.

1239
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,400
But only there.

1240
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,400
Like, I don't mind shoveling elephant shit, because at least it's like a funny elephant guy.

1241
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,400
But with parakeets, they just like, you know, they're screaming.

1242
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,400
They're bird screaming. You just got to be there, clean up their shit.

1243
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,400
Fuck zoos, man.

1244
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Yeah.

1245
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,400
Oh, I don't know. I kind of like zoos.

1246
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,400
Fuck you. Get out. Get out of here, hippo. You're gay.

1247
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
And also, I'm going to punch you.

1248
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Oh, no, I don't like being punched. I'm getting at it.

1249
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,400
Oh, dear.

1250
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,400
Now he's ran away. Now he won't come back up in conversation again. He's gone.

1251
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,400
Okay. Well, thank God for that.

1252
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,400
But we're on to our last question, which is, if heaven exists,

1253
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:24,400
what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?

1254
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:31,400
Yay. Fuck off.

1255
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,400
That would make it all worth it. That would make being an atheist worth it

1256
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,400
if he was like a cool guy that just told me to fuck off and be like,

1257
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:44,400
you know what? I get it. I like you. I accept hell.

1258
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,400
It's all fair game, because you're so rad. So sick.

1259
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Yeah.

1260
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,400
Yeah. Okay. All right.

1261
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,400
Well, that's the end of our questions.

1262
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,400
We may have clipped the mic there, but yes.

1263
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,400
We prefer that here on PCP Studio.

1264
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Thank you very much for clipping that mic.

1265
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Thanks for joining us and get the fuck off my stage.

1266
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Oh, okay. Thank you. I have a book out. It's called

1267
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Go Fuck Me in the Butthole, Please by Hippocrite.

1268
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,400
And Stores Now. That's why I appeared on the show

1269
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,400
looking my book up my ass. There you go.

1270
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
All right. Goodbye.

1271
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,400
Goodbye.

1272
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,400
And now, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage,

1273
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,400
everyone's favorite digital creature, Digibro.

1274
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,400
Welcome.

1275
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,400
Hey, what's going on, everybody? It's me, Digibro.

1276
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:50,400
Digibro, Conrad, entrepreneur, YouTuber, hero,

1277
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,400
spiritual leader of a generation.

1278
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,400
I feel like a Jedi master.

1279
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,400
Welcome.

1280
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,400
Indeed. They always give some bullshit intro.

1281
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,400
All right. Here we go. Let's get to these questions already.

1282
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,400
That's what we're here for, everybody.

1283
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,400
All right. Number one, what is your favorite word?

1284
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,400
Oh, fuck. It's labyrinth, probably.

1285
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:20,400
I'm a particularly fond of words that are big and complex sounding,

1286
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,400
but they sound like architectural, you know?

1287
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,400
That works.

1288
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Either in that it's describing architecture like a panopticon

1289
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,400
or a labyrinth, which are both words I love.

1290
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,400
Or that the word itself sounds like a structure like tetragrammaton.

1291
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,400
Those all sound excellent.

1292
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,400
And there happens to be a manga called Tetragrammaton Labyrinth.

1293
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Oh, fuck.

1294
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,400
And it's really, really bad, but I own the first volume of it,

1295
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
and I have never sold it because it's like a meme,

1296
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,400
because it's like two of my favorite words.

1297
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,400
And that was my Skype name back in the day. You remember that?

1298
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Whoa. Yeah, my Skype name was...

1299
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,400
I mean, maybe.

1300
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,400
Like the actual typed version that you had to type in to find me

1301
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,400
was tetragrammaton.labyrinth.

1302
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,400
Goddamn.

1303
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
All of you had that in your Skype.

1304
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,400
Deep lore.

1305
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,400
All right, that's cool. Maybe I never noticed.

1306
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
All right, here we go.

1307
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Question two.

1308
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,400
Oh, fuck. I'm recording it as a wrong audio source.

1309
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
Oh, no.

1310
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Now we've got the right one.

1311
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Okay, cool. All right.

1312
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
Question number two.

1313
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,400
What is your least favorite word?

1314
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,400
Oh, I don't know. Least favorite word?

1315
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,400
Like really any name of any insect,

1316
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,400
because hearing it just makes me think about that insect.

1317
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,400
And I hate insects.

1318
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,400
Or I guess animals in general.

1319
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,400
Let's go with dog.

1320
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,400
Sick of hearing about fucking dogs.

1321
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,400
Fair enough.

1322
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,400
All right, here we go.

1323
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,400
What turns you on creatively, spiritually, or emotionally?

1324
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,400
I mean, James Lipton always just says what turns you on,

1325
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,400
but he'd add this bullshit here.

1326
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,400
Titties.

1327
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,400
Titties.

1328
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,400
In all of those ways described though.

1329
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,400
Like absolutely all of those ways.

1330
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,400
All right, good.

1331
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,400
What turns you off?

1332
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,400
Dick.

1333
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,400
That's a lie.

1334
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,400
That's a lie.

1335
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
What turns me off?

1336
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,400
Shit, actually.

1337
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,400
Like shit turns me off.

1338
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,400
Not into, not into scat.

1339
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,400
What is your favorite curse word?

1340
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,400
Fuck.

1341
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,400
Because it's just, it's so, it's, first of all, has the highest impact.

1342
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,400
Second of all, it's the most like malleable.

1343
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,400
And it's got a long history, you know?

1344
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,400
Like I know a lot of people like cuck,

1345
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,400
because it has a lot of the same powers as fuck,

1346
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,400
but it's like kind of new, and it's a little tied up in politics,

1347
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,400
so it doesn't really have the broad reach,

1348
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,400
where like fuck is like the standard classic.

1349
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,400
It will always be like the bad word.

1350
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,400
Like the go to cool guy bad word.

1351
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,400
You know, I think cunt can rise up,

1352
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,400
but I don't think it's as versatile as fuck is, so.

1353
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,400
Fair.

1354
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,400
What sound or noise do you love?

1355
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,400
Do I love?

1356
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
Do you love?

1357
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,400
What sound or noise do you love?

1358
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,400
I love my wife's voice.

1359
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,400
There you go.

1360
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,400
Your wife's voice?

1361
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,400
Sure, okay.

1362
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,400
What sound or noise do you hate?

1363
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,400
This fucking computer fan that I can hear going apeshit,

1364
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,400
because we're trying to render video at the same time.

1365
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,400
Silence.

1366
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
Did we get disconnected?

1367
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,400
Oh, we must have, because I was answering.

1368
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Oh, sorry, I couldn't hear that at all.

1369
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,400
Yeah.

1370
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,400
I mean, if that's good, we'll just cut it in or whatever.

1371
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Yeah.

1372
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,400
It should be good.

1373
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,400
Okay.

1374
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,400
I did not hear that at all, but good, yes, understood.

1375
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,400
Great answer.

1376
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,400
Okay.

1377
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,400
What profession other than your own would you like to attempt?

1378
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,400
I really want to be a porn manga artist.

1379
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,400
Like more than anything else,

1380
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,400
if there's one career I could choose for myself,

1381
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,400
it would be to draw a porn manga,

1382
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,400
to come up with more ideas for it than anything else in the world,

1383
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,400
and I have such specific tastes and aesthetic sensibilities for it

1384
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,400
that I think I would make something really unique,

1385
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,400
but it would take years of drawing practice for me to be good enough to do it.

1386
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,400
That's kind of the path that Masamune Shiro took,

1387
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
and everyone constantly gives him shit for it.

1388
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Yeah.

1389
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
Constantly.

1390
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,400
The problem with Masamune Shiro is that he doesn't actually draw a porn manga.

1391
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,400
He just draws weird pin-up art that nobody can get into.

1392
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,400
If he was actually drawing great porn,

1393
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,400
people would have no problem with it,

1394
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,400
but nobody likes Masamune Shiro's porn.

1395
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,400
I feel like they talked down to him unfairly.

1396
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,400
He's earned his place.

1397
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,400
No matter.

1398
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
It's not about me.

1399
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,400
Let's see, what profession would you not like to do?

1400
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,400
I'm sure that's a broad answer there.

1401
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,400
Anything that requires me to wear normal pants.

1402
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,400
Fair enough.

1403
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
And last question.

1404
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:29,400
If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?

1405
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,400
All your friends are here.

1406
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,400
Good.

1407
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,400
Good.

1408
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,400
Well, that's it.

1409
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,400
Thanks for answering our questions,

1410
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,400
and we'll move on to our next cuck.

1411
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,400
Yeah.

1412
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,400
All right.

1413
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,400
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage

1414
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:05,400
the Mr. Ben Homeless Oculus Rift Trash Drawing Art Saint.

1415
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,400
It's my pleasure, Mr. Guy.

1416
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,400
Yes, thank you.

1417
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,400
Pleasure to be here, as always.

1418
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,400
It's truly an honor to have a man dredge himself up from the muck

1419
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,400
to be on our stage as you've done here today.

1420
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,400
Yeah, Doug.

1421
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,400
Well, let's get right down to it.

1422
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,400
Question one, what is your favorite word?

1423
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,400
Ooh, oh no, oh no, no.

1424
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,400
Are you asking everyone the same questions, by the way?

1425
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,400
These are all the same questions.

1426
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,400
It's a standard set.

1427
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,400
My favorite word.

1428
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,400
God, I feel like there's so many good ones that I'm blanking,

1429
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:53,400
but I'm, uh, how about, um, how about, I really like, oh no.

1430
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,400
Oh God, this is the hardest question I've ever been asked.

1431
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,400
What a brain buster.

1432
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,400
What a dick tickler.

1433
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,400
Effervescent is a pretty good one.

1434
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,400
I love evanescence.

1435
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,400
Bring me to life.

1436
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,400
Hashtag bring me to life.

1437
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,400
I really like wither and wence.

1438
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,400
I think we should bring them back.

1439
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,400
Oh wait, no, the best word.

1440
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:21,400
The best word of all, troper, as in this troper's opinion.

1441
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,400
I'm bringing that one back for sure.

1442
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,400
Oh, that's a good one.

1443
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,400
I'm going with troper.

1444
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,400
I'm going with troper, Nate.

1445
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,400
What a trooper, bringing back troper, right.

1446
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,400
Next.

1447
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,400
What is your least favorite word?

1448
01:03:36,400 --> 01:04:05,400
My least favorite word is step, but only in the context of when someone says to step foot somewhere rather than to set foot somewhere which is the proper expression.

1449
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,400
Okay, good.

1450
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,400
Take note, viewers of this crime.

1451
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,400
Next.

1452
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,400
Protect yourselves.

1453
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,400
Indeed, indeed.

1454
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,400
Overprotection is better.

1455
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,400
No, prevention is the best cure.

1456
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Truly, truly.

1457
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,400
What turns you on?

1458
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,400
Evanescence.

1459
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,400
Bring me to life.

1460
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,400
Hashtag bring my dick to life.

1461
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,400
Um, sex.

1462
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:49,400
And sexy attributes of a person.

1463
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,400
Alright, what turns you off?

1464
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,400
Did everyone else have as hard a time with these?

1465
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,400
Do you by far had the most trouble thus far?

1466
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:18,400
Okay, cool, cool.

1467
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,400
What turns you off?

1468
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:28,400
What turns me off is, I don't know, bad vibes.

1469
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Bad vibes.

1470
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,400
Just unpleasant attitudes.

1471
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,400
Disagreeableness, perhaps.

1472
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:45,400
What is your favorite curse word?

1473
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:56,400
Probably something like, something like a heck.

1474
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,400
Okay.

1475
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,400
Or something like, something British, like wanker.

1476
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,400
Or maybe something like trollop.

1477
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:11,400
Like calling some promiscuous lady of the night a trollop is a pretty good one.

1478
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,400
Okay.

1479
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,400
What sound or noise do you love?

1480
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,400
Rain.

1481
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,400
Classic.

1482
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,400
Yeah.

1483
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:33,400
What sound or noise do you hate?

1484
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:38,400
I hate the sound of indecisive interviewees, truly odious.

1485
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,400
Why don't you fucking try it, you piece of shit.

1486
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,400
Oh, I will.

1487
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,400
We'll see how you do.

1488
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,400
I would probably struggle.

1489
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,400
You already know the questions, you fucking cheater.

1490
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,400
It's true.

1491
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,400
It's true.

1492
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,400
Power tools.

1493
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,400
All of them?

1494
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,400
Yeah, just the sound of industriousness, generally.

1495
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,400
The sound of things getting done.

1496
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,400
The sound of people trying their best, really, you know, replying themselves.

1497
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,400
He just wants to escape to his oculus or a fantasy world where nothing is accomplished.

1498
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,400
Correct.

1499
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,400
Okay.

1500
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:18,400
What profession, other than your own, would you like to attempt?

1501
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:35,400
Other than my own, maybe a writer or a journalist of some kind could be fun, I guess.

1502
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,400
I'm surprised by that.

1503
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
That's interesting.

1504
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:44,400
Well, I don't know, just something about, probably not like an investigative reporter

1505
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,400
or anything.

1506
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,400
What would you like to write about?

1507
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:53,400
A columnist, I don't know, something that involves just writing my opinions, putting my opinions

1508
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,400
out there, you know.

1509
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,400
But it's got to be something creative.

1510
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:03,400
It's got to be something that involves my own personal spin on things.

1511
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,400
That's interesting.

1512
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,400
It's interesting because you kind of, right now, with your work, you're sort of creating

1513
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:16,400
fictional worlds where you could sort of comment through those on, you know, all art is sort

1514
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,400
of a demonstration of one's values and whatnot.

1515
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,400
Right.

1516
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,400
But this would be more of a direct commentary avenue, probably, on these things.

1517
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,400
Yeah, I mean, ideally, I'd want to be making something, making fiction of some kind.

1518
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:35,400
But if I, I guess, yeah, I guess if I wasn't doing that, then I guess I would want to be

1519
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:43,400
commenting on the real world or, yeah, or, I don't know, maybe like a literary critic

1520
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,400
or something, something where I got a comment on stuff and put my opinions out there.

1521
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,400
Ben so desperately wants to be a YouTube critic.

1522
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,400
I know, I know.

1523
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,400
That's his highest aspiration.

1524
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,400
One day.

1525
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,400
If only you had the talent or the charisma or who knows things.

1526
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,400
One day I'll make the leap, once I'm ready.

1527
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,400
You know, once I've warmed up myself a little bit.

1528
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,400
He's tried being a poketuber.

1529
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,400
It has not penned out.

1530
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,400
It's time to try new things.

1531
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,400
It's time to move on.

1532
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,400
After I've warmed up with all this, with all this drawing bullshit.

1533
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,400
Indeed.

1534
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,400
Going into the real shit.

1535
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,400
Yeah.

1536
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,400
What profession would you not like to do?

1537
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,400
God, like any of them.

1538
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,400
So many.

1539
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,400
Yeah.

1540
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,400
That's a pretty broad question.

1541
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,400
Is there any in particular that seems super odious?

1542
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:29,400
Or is it just the office atmosphere, perhaps?

1543
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,400
Yeah, just the office atmosphere.

1544
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:40,400
Just anything that involves show up at a place and spend most of your time there.

1545
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,400
Yeah.

1546
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,400
Yeah.

1547
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,400
It's bad.

1548
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:50,400
Or, I mean, I would say manual labor.

1549
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,400
Not because I think it would be worse than that.

1550
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,400
I just think I would be really bad at it.

1551
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,400
Sure.

1552
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,400
Which would put a damper on things.

1553
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,400
Yeah.

1554
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,400
Alright.

1555
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,400
And our final question.

1556
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:12,400
If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?

1557
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,400
I would like to hear.

1558
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,400
Damn, Ben, you really knocked them dead.

1559
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,400
They'll be talking about you forever.

1560
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,400
And we're glad to have you.

1561
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,400
We're all excited to meet you and we've got a lot to talk about.

1562
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:36,400
So both confirmation that you have, in fact, made good use of your life.

1563
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,400
Yeah.

1564
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,400
And that things the party will continue forever up here.

1565
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,400
Yes.

1566
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,400
Where we praise what you've done.

1567
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,400
Oh my God, yes.

1568
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,400
Perfect.

1569
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,400
That's the dream.

1570
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,400
That's the dream.

1571
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,400
Well, thank you.

1572
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,400
Thank you for answering these questions.

1573
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:56,400
We appreciate you leaching, you know, life force from us by being on our stage.

1574
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,400
Yeah.

1575
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,400
Kindly.

1576
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,400
Get the fuck off my stage.

1577
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,400
I will be, my lawyers will be in touch.

1578
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,400
And so watch yourselves.

1579
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,400
Thank you.

1580
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,400
Watch yourself.

1581
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,400
Goodbye.

1582
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,400
Goodbye.

1583
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:15,400
And now, ladies and gentlemen, to welcome our final guest of the evening.

1584
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,400
Tonight on Inside the PCP Studio.

1585
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,400
Please welcome to the stage.

1586
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,400
Mr. Nate Bestman.

1587
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,400
Best guy ever.

1588
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,400
Yes.

1589
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,400
Hello.

1590
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,400
It is me.

1591
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,400
I am the best guy ever.

1592
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,400
A pleasure to be here.

1593
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,400
Rad Dude.

1594
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,400
Rude Dude.

1595
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,400
Philosopher God King.

1596
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,400
PCP Puppet Master.

1597
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,400
As long in the dong as he is dank in the schlong.

1598
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,400
Thank you for joining us, Mr. Bestman.

1599
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,400
And let's get right down to it.

1600
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,400
What is your favorite word?

1601
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:01,400
My favorite word I have known for centuries, decades.

1602
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,400
It is the word sass.

1603
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,400
It is the word sass, everyone, because if you think about it.

1604
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:15,400
Sass has the highest ratio of the letter s to its length of any word in the world.

1605
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,400
That is my actual reasoning.

1606
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,400
It sounds the best to say.

1607
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,400
It is mathematically precise, 75% s.

1608
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,400
That's unbeatable.

1609
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:30,400
Therefore, it is my favorite word, get fucked.

1610
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,400
Superlative.

1611
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,400
What is your least favorite word?

1612
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,400
My least favorite word.

1613
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,400
Oh God, I don't know.

1614
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:47,400
Maybe something like...

1615
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,400
Something like...

1616
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,400
Oh God, I don't fucking know.

1617
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,400
Shit.

1618
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,400
Crusty?

1619
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,400
Crusty is a shitty word.

1620
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,400
Yeah, that brings a lot of negative stuff to mind.

1621
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,400
I think yeah, crusty.

1622
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,400
Crusty is up there.

1623
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,400
Yeah, that will do.

1624
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,400
Unbelievable.

1625
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:12,400
Mr. Bestman, what turns you on?

1626
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:20,400
Well, as you recall from the fetish cast, I love me a nice pair of glasses.

1627
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,400
I truly do, I truly do.

1628
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:30,400
Other than that, what gets my engine revving is seeing people self-actualize.

1629
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:36,400
Watching people achieve their dreams through their own initiative.

1630
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,400
In a sense, this is probably a narcissistic thing.

1631
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:46,400
It's not narcissistic, really, but I like it when I do that.

1632
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,400
And I also like it when other people do that.

1633
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:53,400
Hey, to give myself credit, I think that I did it because I admired it

1634
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,400
and other people so much that eventually I was like, yeah, I want to do that too.

1635
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,400
And so here I am, a bit of a self-starter in my life at this point.

1636
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:07,400
So yeah, seeing people take control of their lives and pull themselves out of hell

1637
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:12,400
or seize opportunities, even ones that people didn't think that were there.

1638
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:17,400
Seeing them rise to the occasion, yeah, that really fires me up.

1639
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,400
It really does.

1640
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,400
Incredible.

1641
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,400
What turns you off?

1642
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:33,400
Oh, definitely entitlement or laziness are the ultimate disgusting things.

1643
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,400
Really leeches in general.

1644
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:44,400
If I see someone whose whole thing in life is that they depend on someone else to keep them afloat,

1645
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,400
oh no, oh no, I cannot be having this.

1646
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:56,400
I refuse to live my life in servitude to anyone or anyone else that I don't...

1647
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:04,400
Even if I want to support someone, if I do that and it's draining my time and energy,

1648
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,400
that means I can't go out and achieve the things I want to do.

1649
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,400
So yeah, that's not for me.

1650
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:19,400
People that are drains on time and energy and that do not contribute at least as much as they draw from the world around them.

1651
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,400
Gross, can't have it.

1652
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,400
Oh, sugoi!

1653
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,400
What is your favorite curse word?

1654
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,400
Well, I really like fuck.

1655
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,400
Fuck is really good.

1656
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,400
Though I've always had a soft spot.

1657
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,400
My brother and I read this book series back in the day, he read it.

1658
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,400
He's the one who turned me on to it, called The Wheel of Time series.

1659
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,400
It's a fantasy series.

1660
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,400
Robert Jordan?

1661
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,400
Was that the Red Bull guy?

1662
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,400
No, I don't know.

1663
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,400
By some guy.

1664
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,400
And maybe it was Robert Jordan.

1665
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,400
Brian Jocks is the Red Bull guy.

1666
01:15:54,400 --> 01:16:00,400
Okay, but regardless, there was a phrase uttered by the character of Matt at one point in those books called,

1667
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,400
or rather was, bloody buttered onions.

1668
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,400
And I've always liked that a lot.

1669
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,400
I thought that was real quirky.

1670
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,400
Like me, a gamer girl.

1671
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,400
But really, it's fuck.

1672
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,400
Like I use fuck all the time.

1673
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,400
It's great and I'm a big into it.

1674
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,400
Transcendent.

1675
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:25,400
What sound or noise do you love?

1676
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,400
I am a big guy into ASMR.

1677
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,400
So I really just like ASMR in general.

1678
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,400
So I'm always listening to tons of pleasant sounds.

1679
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:41,400
But hey, I can tell you, there's some evidence that things have narrowed down to what I really like the most.

1680
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,400
I like the voice of people telling stories.

1681
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:52,400
And I mean, I listen to men do it more because listening to women whisper in my ear is too sexual.

1682
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,400
And it makes me get loboner.

1683
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,400
And that is distracting when I'm trying to relax.

1684
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,400
I got to take care of that.

1685
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:06,400
So listening to men's soft voices tell stories is very, very nice.

1686
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:14,400
I kind of like listening to guys talk about, kind of like just like, I don't know,

1687
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,400
not like the kind of shitty empowerment stuff about how you're beautiful no matter what they say,

1688
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,400
that kind of weak ass shit.

1689
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,400
But I like hearing them say like, yeah, go out and seize the day.

1690
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,400
I don't know, man, maybe I'm a weirdo.

1691
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:33,400
But I like hearing like male voices whisper to me about like, go, you like put in your fucking work every day.

1692
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,400
Basically, I like the whispering equivalent of that song.

1693
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:42,400
That's like 10% luck, 10% skill, 18% positive concentrated power of will.

1694
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:47,400
You know, that song that in whisper form is what I fucking like.

1695
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,400
Also tapping sounds.

1696
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,400
Truly shameful.

1697
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,400
What sound or noise do you hate?

1698
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,400
What sound or noise do I hate?

1699
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:02,400
I don't know, like I kind of have encountered a lot of gross mouth sounds.

1700
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,400
I really am not into, but I don't know, sometimes I can kind of tolerate them.

1701
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,400
Sounds that I, hey, you know, you know what's one?

1702
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,400
Okay, I got the perfect answer for this.

1703
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:17,400
It's when I was a kid, I discovered something that like really was a pain trigger for me.

1704
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,400
So you know the whole nails on the chalkboard thing?

1705
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,400
Okay, that's like a meme one.

1706
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,400
It's so much worse, at least to me.

1707
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,400
It's the sound of, okay, no one's going to be able to understand this,

1708
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,400
but just ride with me on this gravy train, if you will.

1709
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:37,400
So the sound of a very dry hand rubbing on a cloth binder surface.

1710
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,400
It's just a, it's very shh, shh.

1711
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,400
The only word I can use to describe the sound is dry.

1712
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,400
It is the sound of dryness.

1713
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,400
And when I hear that sound, I can feel, it's like I'm being drained by crocodile in one piece.

1714
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,400
To use an example that everyone understands.

1715
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:59,400
But like I feel the essence of dryness, like murdering my body, especially my hands.

1716
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,400
My hands feel dry when I hear that sound and it causes me physical discomfort.

1717
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,400
So yeah, that one.

1718
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,400
Very kawaii.

1719
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,400
What profession, other than your own, would you like to attempt?

1720
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:20,400
Well, I would like to be, I mean, I'm kind of transitioning,

1721
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,400
I'm working on transitioning careers, like do YouTube full time.

1722
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,400
It's funny, because like right now, I am a professional programmer.

1723
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:31,400
What I would like to be is like an uncoverer of the secrets of the world.

1724
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:35,400
Like one who expands the knowledge of humanity in some way.

1725
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:40,400
So either like, I don't know, a physicist, an astrologist?

1726
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,400
No, an astronomer, an astrophysicist.

1727
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,400
Yeah, I think that's what I'm looking for.

1728
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,400
Really just like a scientist of some kind.

1729
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,400
I would love to just like, I'm almost any field,

1730
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,400
but I gotta say I have a soft spot for like space travel and stuff, you know.

1731
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,400
Starfleet, weird utilitarianism, whatever.

1732
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:03,400
Like I'd love to like work with Elon Musk and like work on turning humanity

1733
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,400
into a space faring civilization by like developing new technology

1734
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,400
and like uncovering like physical secrets that we don't know right now

1735
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,400
and developing stuff that'll let us do that.

1736
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,400
That's what I'd love to do.

1737
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,400
Yeah, sign me up Elon, I'm ready to go.

1738
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,400
Oh, how deliciously absurd.

1739
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,400
What profession would you not like to do?

1740
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,400
Um, waste management?

1741
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,400
You know, anything gross?

1742
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:33,400
Oh, anything dealing with like bugs would be absolutely repulsive to me.

1743
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:39,400
Also working at a pound where they have to put down animals would not be nice.

1744
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,400
Like I would love to work around like dogs because I'm a big dog.

1745
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,400
I fucking love dogs.

1746
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,400
I want to hang out with them all the time.

1747
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:53,400
But yeah, like that is like, I know that's a necessary thing,

1748
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:57,400
but it is something that, you know, repulses me greatly.

1749
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,400
Yeah, something like that, something like that.

1750
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:04,400
Even though I'm not kink shaming people who work at the pound who have to do that shit.

1751
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,400
I know it's necessary, but it always kind of makes me depressed.

1752
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,400
Oh, good one.

1753
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,400
And final question, Mr. Best Guy Ever.

1754
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:19,400
If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?

1755
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:23,400
Now this is the one question that I actually did prepare for,

1756
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,400
and I know exactly what I'm going to say.

1757
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,400
If I die and I go up to heaven and I see God at the pearly gates,

1758
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:34,400
here are the two words I want him to say to my face.

1759
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:38,400
I apologize.

1760
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,400
That's not actually a joke.

1761
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,400
Yeah, as everyone knows, I'm a big atheist.

1762
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,400
I think there's no good reason to believe that God is real.

1763
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,400
And if he was, in fact, real, if I died and he was there,

1764
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,400
and like it is like the God that this question implies it is,

1765
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,400
like the weirdo Christian God, you know, in heaven and shit,

1766
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,400
I'd be like, excuse me, sir, aren't you supposed to be omnipotent?

1767
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,400
There are like a billion people down there suffering in horrible ways,

1768
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,400
and you created them, so their suffering is literally your fault.

1769
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,400
I don't want to hear this cop out about free will because you control everything,

1770
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,400
so get fucked.

1771
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,400
I would have strong words for the guy,

1772
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,400
but really no matter what the strength of his apology,

1773
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:24,400
it will absolutely not be good enough for the terrible things that he's done.

1774
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:30,400
Yeah, I don't buy that this free will shit that I literally do not even think human beings have.

1775
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,400
I also don't believe in free will, by the way.

1776
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,400
Maybe you've heard about it, weird utilitarianism.

1777
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,400
Yeah, so he can get fucked.

1778
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,400
Free will is an illusion, it's not real.

1779
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,400
Yeah, fuck you, God.

1780
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,400
Enlightening as always.

1781
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:51,400
Now, thank you, Mr. Best Guy, please get the fuck off my stage.

1782
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,400
Yes, thank you, goodbye.

1783
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:58,400
That concludes the festivities for the evening.

1784
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:04,400
I would like to thank all our guests who came to join us inside the PCP studio today.

1785
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:08,400
We will see you soon with another epic meme.

1786
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,400
Good night, everyone.

1787
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,400
I'm not working.

1788
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,400
I'm doing nothing.

1789
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,400
My dick, I'm jerking.

1790
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,400
Myself, I'm sucking.

1791
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,400
I am an asshole.

1792
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,400
I am a stupid.

1793
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,400
I've got a deadline.

1794
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,400
Don't want to do it.
