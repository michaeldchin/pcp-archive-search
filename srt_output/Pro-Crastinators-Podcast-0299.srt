6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:42,600
believe it. Can't believe it. It's a Friday once again.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:51,320
Hello. Jumping right in. Episode 299 of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's me, Ben Saint,

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:00,160
and Oblivionfall is with me today. This week. Hey. I almost had to do another solo Bencast.

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,400
Everyone's favorite. But Oblivion jumped in to save me from that. I'm always hovering.

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,680
I'm always the specter. The specter of the solo Bencast is always hovering, floating,

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:23,840
just out of reach, haunting me. It's just a matter of staving it off. Yeah. How's it

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:32,320
going? What's up? What is up, dog? I'm here. The people have spoken. I read the comments.

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:41,040
They said, Oblivion, come back. And I did. Yeah. Put the baby in a blimba. Yeah, everybody

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,800
liked that. I was shocked to click on that episode and just hear my voice and I'm like,

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,400
what the fuck? Why am I at this? I wasn't on this episode and then I remembered. I had

16
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,240
some leftover voicemails I sent last week. Old ones that never got used. I was like,

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,200
oh, yeah. It was shocking. Shocking. What could this be doing here? Oh, I put it here. Yeah,

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:15,720
I said it was clean. Yeah, I said it was. Yeah, I kicked the habit. Well, how's your week been?

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,000
My week's been pretty productive. Because I haven't been productive enough, I did other

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,360
productive things. I was supposed to have my animation project done this month. I thought

21
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:36,120
for sure I could get it by January 15th. And so I realized shit, it's not going to be done. I

22
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,120
got to put something on Patreon. I guess I'll do another sketch dump because it's been about six

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,520
months. I want to do a sketch dump at least every six months. So I had to clean up a bunch of old

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:53,880
sketches. And I don't know if I can really share them because they're pornographic. So

25
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:03,800
of course. Just trust that at patreon.com slash oblivion. I did some good boob and penis and it's

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:15,560
good. I believe you. I believe you. I think I owe my patrons a Q&A. I haven't done a Q&A in a

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,720
couple of months because for a few months I've been like, well, I don't want to do a Q&A until

28
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,400
after the game is out. Because that's what I think people are going to want to talk about.

29
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,240
So I would put that off for a little while. Well, I was going to say I thought the game

30
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:37,560
would be done this month, but it is done this month. I was talking about this last week. I've

31
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,160
been drawing more of slime punishment because I need to have the comic done because the game and

32
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:52,840
the end of the comic are intertwined. They are one and the same. So I've been drawing that.

33
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,000
And then I realized I was like, okay, maybe I got like 30 pages. That's not so bad. So I started

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,840
cranking them out. I think I've done like 17. It'll probably be more than 30. It'll probably

35
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:11,800
be like 35 or 40. But then I realized, shit, I know what I have to draw up until the game.

36
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,320
And then I know what I have to draw is what happens immediately after the game.

37
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,360
And then that's the end of the comic. Slime and punishment is over. So I have to draw an ending

38
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,520
and I have no idea what the ending is. I know the climax. I don't know like, okay,

39
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,480
but what's the ending ending like? And they lived happily ever after. I don't know what I want to do

40
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:45,720
for that. So I have to think of that, I guess. I'm surprised. I'm surprised that wasn't like

41
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,200
planned way ahead. Well, I mean,

42
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,760
well, I mean, slime and punishment was an evolving thing because I kept changing it in

43
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:07,800
response to, you know, Chris Chan making up weird shit at me.

44
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:16,760
Waking up weird shit. They would never. They did. I did incorporate some things that she

45
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,560
told me in DMs. She would occasionally send me some weird DMs about like what she thinks should

46
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:32,040
happen. And I did incorporate some of that. I guess I don't mind spoiling a little bit.

47
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:39,880
For instance, you know, in S. Revert, Laka Kam falls in the alpha timeline and crushes Chris

48
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:48,200
Chan, Sonichu. But she mentioned in a DM that like an alternate version of herself would become

49
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,840
quote unquote corrupted by slime. So I have a little narrator's note from Discord,

50
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:02,600
the draconiquus, that there's an alternate version of Chris that is still in Laka Kam.

51
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,320
It's just like a slime junkie, just like sleeping in between dumpsters or whatever. It's great.

52
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:19,720
You know how it is. So I'm getting further on that. I will surely have it done this

53
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,240
in February, probably early February. I hope it won't even take. I hope it won't take most of the

54
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:37,960
month. Yeah. Damn. And then, I don't know, maybe I can like make some money selling,

55
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,480
doing a Kickstarter for a book of that in the not too distant future. That would be cool.

56
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,400
That wouldn't be. I need to buy me one of those plebeian that we blew rays, but my

57
00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:01,000
PayPal is sadly drained. As I had one of, okay, so you know how I do those,

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,240
those Milo Pony Vector Commissions, I still do them.

59
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,880
Yeah. Especially now that I don't have a job, it's an easy way to get and come on the side.

60
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,400
There was one that I offered a refund to like back in December, because very design

61
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,400
was just a little too much. It didn't work. It wasn't like some like super like,

62
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,120
OC do not steal like a million like wings and stripes or whatever. It wasn't that sort of

63
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,320
issue. It was just with the hair. Just looked like it would be a pain to do with how my roots work.

64
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,880
Yeah. It was like really wavy and had stripes in it. And I was just like,

65
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,800
that's difficult to handle with my templates. So I just said, hey, offer a refund, you know,

66
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll even give you 10 bucks extra because you waited, you know, about a year or more since,

67
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,400
because I accepted a big bachelor way back and took on way too many. So this person had been

68
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,040
waiting like a year. So I said, I'll give you 10 bucks extra. And then I don't hear anything for

69
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,320
like a month and a half. Yeah. And I'm just sitting there. I'm like, okay. And my PayPal is

70
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,600
getting a little smaller, my balance, but I still had like just enough in there to pay them back.

71
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,560
And then then I get an invoice from them. And it's like, they're like, in the invoice, it's like,

72
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,560
hey, sorry, I asked for 10 bucks extra. And I'm like, what do you mean? And I'm sitting here thinking

73
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,880
I already offered to give them 10 extra. What are we talking about? You were gonna give them

74
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,520
10 extra as like a sorry, can't take your commission. Here's $10 to cheer you up about it.

75
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:41,080
And then they were like, sorry, I'm putting 10 bucks extra on the invoice. And the invoice was

76
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:50,920
30 extra. So I was like, well, no, no, your math is not good. And then I was just annoyed. And I'm

77
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,880
like, you know, I actually only like received like $124 because PayPal like charged a $6 fee at

78
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,480
my end. So the 10 bucks extra is technically only going to be four bucks extra for you.

79
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,400
Because I never actually received the full 130 that was agreed on way back.

80
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,000
So that was a thing that happened. And then PayPal charged me like another $5 just to send

81
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,480
them the money back because of course it did. Yeah, wherever I receive or send money,

82
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,680
the charges only come out of my end and never the other person's end. It's weird.

83
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:36,120
Yeah, I saw you're, I don't know why you have like weird PayPal issues.

84
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,880
Yeah, someone thought maybe they switched me to like a business account or something,

85
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,800
like against my knowledge. I don't know. But like when I send like 20 bucks and it charges

86
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,080
me like almost five bucks worth of fees. And I'm like, that's not how it's not how it's supposed

87
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,160
to work. Yeah, definitely not how it's supposed to work. Yeah, the fees are really high for me.

88
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,040
And it might be because my account is like based in New Zealand, but they don't let me change it.

89
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,640
They say it's against policy to change the region. And I've been trying to like,

90
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,000
What if you move? I did. I mean, exactly. I move like almost six years ago,

91
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,520
I moved to America and I still am so confused. New Zealand PayPal account that tries to convert

92
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,800
everything to New Zealand dollars and I keep going to be like, no, keep it in America dollars.

93
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,320
I don't want even more conversion fees. And I tried setting up a new one and they're like,

94
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,200
oh yeah, you can't set up a new one unless you send us a picture of your driver's license or

95
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,200
if you have a bill that has your name on it, I can't get either of those things. My apartment

96
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,800
complex, we don't get bills. Like everything is like handled in the rent. There are no bills.

97
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,560
Like they're just none. And I don't have a driver's license and because I don't

98
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:55,400
fucking want to drive. At least not at the moment. My husband takes me everywhere I need to go if

99
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,800
I need to go somewhere. So I've had a PayPal account for like your housewife.

100
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:11,880
Yeah, totally. No, no, I'm just for cool. I'm just a cool cackling at your expense.

101
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm the cool artist man and my husband is my chauffeur. Okay. But yeah, that PayPal account,

102
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,280
I tried setting up three or four years ago. And there's I when I first set it up, I like

103
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,680
accepted a few commissions. So there's a couple hundred bucks just sitting in there. And I can't

104
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,360
access it. I can look at it, but I can't touch it. In your PayPal? Yeah, in my American PayPal

105
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,120
that I set up. It's the same one I use for the PCP dating sim OST, which made about $80, which is

106
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,880
alright. I'm sure the work on that was worth more than $80, but it was definitely worth more.

107
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:54,520
Yeah, just the fucking, the fucking like little music video I made that went on the PCP channel

108
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,720
like a week to do. Yeah, it looked great. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But that's, you know,

109
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:12,040
I'm actually really bothered by I, for some reason, after effects, if you have a wave file,

110
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,680
and of course, wave is like the best sound quality, like it's the most losses format.

111
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,880
If you have a wave file and after effects, I found this out when I was editing the PCP way back,

112
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:32,120
is there will be little popping and clicking sounds that'll start appearing in the audio. If it's,

113
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,520
if the audio is really long, like say an hour long, more than an hour long, around 30 to 40

114
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,200
minutes, and you'll start hearing little clicks and pops, and they get louder and more frequent.

115
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,360
And by the end of the video, it's like,

116
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,000
like, and it's like really like harsh sounds that it really, that's just okay. So what you're

117
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,240
saying is after effects like just simply doesn't process audio, correct? Yeah, like really long

118
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,840
lossless audio formats just kind of sound fucked up towards the end. And you have to either use an

119
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:09,160
mp free, or, which I guess I could have just done that. Or what I usually do is I use X media

120
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,280
recode to remix the audio afterwards. It basically just lets you like, you just swap out the audio

121
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,920
file for a different one and the video information is untouched. So you don't lose any quality.

122
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,040
And also it's really fast. It takes like two seconds. So that's what I did for the PCP episodes.

123
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,880
I forgot to do that for a dating sim because I wanted it, the soundtrack to come out exactly one

124
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,840
week after. And I was already like, running late on that day. And I guess I just forgot to so

125
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,880
the video went up with shitty audio and it's just been like that. And I've been mad about it.

126
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:49,240
Silently for like two years almost. Two years. Who would hold a grudge? Who would hold a grudge for

127
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,880
years of Libyan fall? Who would hold on to anger for that long? You know? I only anger against

128
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,920
myself. I don't, I can't hold grudges against other people. I'm incapable. It's like the Buddha

129
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:08,040
said grudges are like holding on to a hot coal thinking I'll throw it at, one day I'll throw it

130
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:17,640
at my enemy. Unironically, that's how I feel. Your enemy is yourself. Well, yeah, it's just

131
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:25,080
sitting up my ass, keeping it warm, I guess. I don't know. I've never been able to stay mad at

132
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,080
people. And there've been people who have like completely fucked me over who I've just forgiven

133
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,080
and like let back into my life. And that's happened a lot. And usually how does that work out?

134
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,240
It doesn't usually work out great. Granted, like it's not usually people who are like

135
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,840
really like fucking annoying. Like it's usually people who work close to me about it.

136
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,920
Like family or stuff like that where I've been like oof.

137
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:59,080
Yeah. But man, I'm mad. That's that's personal poopiness. I don't know where I'm going. It's

138
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,080
seems he's saying you might jump in. That'd be cool.

139
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:10,680
It seems like he's gonna. I'm glad you thank I'm glad you mentioned the the blue rays though.

140
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,640
Link in the description.

141
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:25,080
stcomics.com slash store.html for the store. $20, $20 cent fee $5. Unbelievable.

142
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,480
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. It's not for me when I get

143
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,560
I have I have orders for the blue rays have continued to trickle in. I have sold

144
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,760
about twice as many as I expected. Hey, Simsie. Hey, how's it going? Whoa. It's

145
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:48,920
Hey, leave the episode. Yo, well, that's three three man three man tag team today.

146
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,760
It's better than nothing.

147
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,960
You are recording, right? Yeah, I just started recording.

148
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,440
We'll do a sync at the end there.

149
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,600
Wait, let's do let's do a sync right now. On the on the count of three, say sync. One,

150
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:13,080
two, three, sync. One, two, three, sync. So I was just gonna say

151
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,160
I have sold about twice as many as I expected to sell my first batch of 50.

152
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,280
I have basically I think I have literally one more left of my second batch of 50.

153
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,680
So if I if two more people order blue rays, I will have to I will have to buy another set of

154
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:41,000
blank DVDs and cases for them, which is fine. When when people order it through when they order

155
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,000
it through when they when they just DM me and ask like where do I send the money and I give them

156
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,640
my my email address. Sometimes they choose, you know, buy as a buy it as a, you know, by a service

157
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:00,280
or item, which charges I think it's about 5% of a fee, which is not very much. So I don't mind

158
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,400
it that much. The best outcome is that they choose like buy through friends and family.

159
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,400
And then there's no fee at all, which is which is great. So I like that, although I don't blame

160
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,680
anyone for not wanting to do that, because like, you know, they are, if I were to rip them off,

161
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,840
they would they would have no way to like file a complaint and request their money back through

162
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,600
PayPal. So fair enough. And then the button that I made for the store page,

163
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,320
stcomics.com slash store.html is that one also charges a fee, but it charges like

164
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:41,000
ever so slightly more like instead of charging $1.50 for a $35 transaction, it charges like $1.65.

165
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,240
And I don't know why that is, but it's an insignificant difference. So I have not interrogated

166
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:55,080
it. But I did notice it and I thought it was odd. Yeah, fuck you. It's crazy. Evil PayPal's feeling

167
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:02,600
little man's money again. Elon Musk. Elon Musk. He's got he needs that $1.65 to build his big fucking

168
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,280
rocket ship that you can jerk off on his way to the moon in. Does he still does he still like run

169
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,480
PayPal or has he like sold it? I don't know. He was one of the guys who made it. I don't know like

170
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,640
if he's still involved in it. Yeah, but it's funny to blame everything on him because he's

171
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:26,920
dick face weirdo. Absolutely. And of course. How's your week, Simsie? How have you been?

172
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,560
Not too bad. I felt really sick last night. So I called in sick for work and I was like,

173
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,800
I ain't coming in. And then I got a text from work today saying, ha ha, even though you work

174
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,440
overnight and there's no customers there, you can't wear headphones anymore. So it's like, oh,

175
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,560
fuck. What the fuck? I'm going to be stacking shelves for eight hours without headphones on.

176
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:53,880
I'm going to go insane. I don't know. I think they said something about like people who come in

177
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,840
closer to when like the store opens. They leave their headphones in when the customers come in,

178
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,720
you're not allowed to do that. So they've just banned the whole thing. It was really annoying

179
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:10,440
for someone like me who only works when the store's closed. That's so awesome. That's so awesome.

180
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:20,520
I can't listen to the PCP while I'm stacking shelves. This is like how they insist that

181
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,800
like cashiers stand, like cashiers are not allowed to sit. Yeah, it's one of those type of things.

182
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,080
One of those is just like, I the boss just think that work should just be worse for me.

183
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,240
I just feel like it should be worse. So it is now. And that's good.

184
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,040
I'm really annoyed. I'm not looking forward to it. There's literally no reason they couldn't just

185
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:48,040
cashiers couldn't just sit. Luckily, my contract ends in March. So it's not going to be too bad

186
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:54,440
because it's going to be like a month of fucking pain. And then I'm going to say like,

187
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,240
please don't bother extending me. I don't want to work here anymore.

188
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,280
That's why I shop at Aldi. Aldi lets their cashiers sit.

189
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,640
Also, they're cheaper. Actually, I don't even shop at Aldi anymore because they don't have the

190
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,640
brand of ice cream that I like. Amazing. They don't have Knicks. Hey, Gib, what's up?

191
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Hey. Hello. Hello. There we go. Now I hear you. Nothing's up, really.

192
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:34,520
It was a slow week. I had a slow week because, wait, I already explained the whole thing about

193
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,680
how I'm drawing the pages, right? I already said that. You did mention that last time. Yeah.

194
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:48,200
Well, I mentioned it again this week. I'm just doing that. So that's my week.

195
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,680
What have you been, Gib? I've been okay. I've been like fucking...

196
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:09,080
I don't know. There's been the secret project and that's going along.

197
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,720
And then there's been a lot of ghost mailing stuff. And I've packaged some envelopes up

198
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,920
in tomorrow. They're going to come around, pick them up. And I got to buy a bunch more

199
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:26,120
for sending to all over the globe. There's one in Japan. There's a few in Chile.

200
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,240
And Greece and France and Belgium and fucking everywhere.

201
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,320
Is the guy... I have a suspicion about who the guy in Japan is. I think it might be the same

202
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,360
guy I talked to this week who is the same guy who does a lot of the like PCP, like the music

203
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,920
voicemails. It could be. There's one guy in Japan. He ordered a road to Radcon. He was a

204
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,080
Kickstarter backer. He ordered a Blu-ray. And he's in the comments too. He's the guy who...

205
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,560
Fuck. I forget what his handle is, but he's a...

206
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,960
It's the Pink Floyd guy.

207
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,040
Amazing. Anyway, I just like... It was a mastermind.

208
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,640
Dark horse.

209
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:23,320
But yeah, it's mostly just been like... My thing for this pickup is mostly to America.

210
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,960
They can come to my house and pick it up and put the labels on at their warehouse,

211
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,400
which is epic and nice. But for basically every other place that isn't America,

212
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,440
I need to go through Royal Mail, which is the cheapest option, but it requires

213
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:48,440
that I go to one of... I bring everything to a post office and I have to print the labels and

214
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,160
stick them on myself, which is like, yeah, it's a hassle. I got to do that.

215
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,040
You heard it here first, people. If you bought one of Gibbs Comics and live outside of America,

216
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,560
fuck you. How dare you?

217
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:09,560
No, no. It's just that I've yet to do that. And I don't know. I could barely believe a week has

218
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:17,560
passed. I didn't even notice. Yeah. I mean, same. I feel like that a lot. I feel like that a lot,

219
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:26,040
but I got to say something. I got to get in here and I got to convert my lived experience

220
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:33,560
into content somehow. I feel time just slipping away a lot. I don't notice the weeks anymore.

221
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,240
Maybe it's because of my horrendous scheduled sleep and work, but I just don't fucking realize

222
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,160
when one day it ends and the other one begins. I know this is... Oh, this is where everyone's

223
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:50,600
quarantine started, but fuck me. It's just been awful. I don't know what's happening. I don't

224
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,520
know where I am in the world. I don't know what's going on. We had a blizzard here yesterday,

225
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:07,800
so it was like a foot or two of snow outside, which has compounded the issue. Since New

226
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,320
Year, since everyone here got COVID, I have not been working out. I have gotten off of the

227
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:20,040
schedule wherein I used to go over to Munchie and Kazi's house and lift three times a week,

228
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:30,200
and I have not been doing that this month. And it's bad. That was a ritual, I guess,

229
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,040
that I had that got me out of the house, but not anymore. I'm hoping that starts up again soon.

230
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:43,480
Munchie's school schedule is like, I guess he's like, I don't know what my good schedule is.

231
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:53,880
Figure it out, bro. Compounds the like, I don't know. I don't do anything. I don't

232
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,160
leave my house. I have no reference point for when one week starts and another ends.

233
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,480
I mean, I've, working on The Secret Project has been really fun, and I really enjoy that,

234
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,760
which is why I can't wait to release it and then tell people, so I can talk about it in public.

235
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:19,080
Yeah. I know what you mean. So the days feel the same, but they're good days. It's not like I'm

236
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,240
like, despairing about everything. It's just sort of like, what the fuck, time passes?

237
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:34,760
Yeah. I can measure time passed in pages of slime and punishment drawn.

238
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,920
And you can get back to drawing comics as well.

239
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:47,000
That's really how it feels. I think I got, this week I have like 17 panels drawn,

240
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,880
which is not as many as I should have for a whole week, but that's what I got.

241
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,000
So that's like, if a day goes by and I don't do any, it's like, well, today might as well not

242
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,920
have even happened. What am I doing? I get that feeling a lot, where if I haven't drawn anything

243
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,240
that day, I would just be like, oh, I didn't exist. I didn't, it didn't happen. Nothing,

244
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,560
nothing happened today. Yeah. Before that, it was, when I was making the game, it was,

245
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,240
I would have like a to-do list. I would have like my items on the to-do list, like bugs

246
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,840
that needed fixing or like assets I needed to make. And it would be like, how many items

247
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,640
did I cross off the to-do list? That was how I used to measure it. Yeah.

248
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,800
My criteria has been like, unless something has gone up on my Twitter or my Patreon,

249
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,920
the day has not counted. It's not been a thing. It's, it's unreal.

250
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Absolutely. Absolutely.

251
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,960
But I've been pretty good about that recently. I was in a big art slump for like all of fucking

252
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,320
December. And then over the last month, I've slowly built up the steam again. And I'm putting

253
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,520
down a lot more than I used to. And I've actually started using my Patreon for the fucking first

254
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,240
time in like six months. Yeah, I've seen, I've seen you've been drawing a lot of, of one piece

255
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,440
girls. Yeah. Yeah. It's mostly because my, my friend has gotten into one piece recently. So

256
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,600
we've been talking about it a lot. And it's just like, cool rules. It's the best thing ever.

257
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:22,600
Yeah. It, I mean, it is. It's perfect. I've been seeing you, I've been seeing you draw that maid

258
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,840
girl. Oh yeah. The milkmaid. That's fun. I don't know if she has a name. Amelia. I mean,

259
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,400
it doesn't really matter, but yeah. She looks similar to I smell. Yeah. I have two characters

260
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,240
that wear the exact same thing. And I realize they need to redesign the horse to get rid of

261
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,960
or something, which is unfortunate because we used her for a drawcast episode recently,

262
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,960
but I just put a trash bag on her head, literally. Yeah. There we go. That work. I'm gonna give her

263
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,080
just like a generic Alma helmet or something to make it look funny. I don't know.

264
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,320
Whatever. Speaking of, speaking of the drawcast, I, I, uh, how many more people does the, uh,

265
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,040
does the, uh, the, the telephone episode have to go through?

266
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,240
Not that many people. We've just had a couple of people who just sat in it for weeks.

267
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,360
Yeah. Yeah. When did it start? I can't remember.

268
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:19,480
It's 12 months ago. Probably four months ago.

269
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,160
Maybe five. I just, uh, I don't know. Look, look, look at forward to that. I guess the list must

270
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,000
have grown because when I looked at the list, there weren't that many more people. There's like

271
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,480
20 people on the list, which is pretty long for a telephone, but I think that'll make it way

272
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,600
better when it's done. Cause the character will have evolved a lot more, I assume. I haven't seen

273
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:49,480
any of you yet. I can't look at it because I'm still waiting for my spot. I haven't looked at it

274
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:57,080
in a while. I looked at it. I looked at what was done after I did mine. I had assumed it was like

275
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,160
canceled because I hadn't seen it be updated for so long. I was like, are you, are you in that

276
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:08,840
Simsie? Yes, I think so. Oh, sick. Yeah, I had been waiting for a while. I had kind of been like,

277
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,640
that must be canceled if it's been this long. Okay. Well, that's good.

278
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,800
You got to hound people who love you and fool. You got to hound them. You got to say,

279
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,360
get this shit done like all my commissioners did. And I finally, I had commissions from

280
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,640
fucking four months ago that I hadn't done. I am the worst at this shit. I should not do it as a

281
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,440
shit, dude. That's pretty bad. That's pretty bad. It's like my record.

282
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,600
Jesus Christ. What was that though? Was that like a full vector model?

283
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,560
Well, yeah, that was one of those vector packs. Well, here's the thing, the vector packs,

284
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,360
most of the time I can do them in like a single day. The problem is it was really hard for me

285
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,560
to keep on top of them with pencilmation. I was always behind on things and those things had like

286
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,800
strict deadlines that like had to be done and everything was always like down for the wire.

287
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,320
And it was like that for like a couple years at a certain point. This is very hard for me to

288
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,800
actually make progress on my commissions. Now that I am not working at pencilmation anymore,

289
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,440
I can, what I'll do is I won't accept batches of commissions anymore. I'll accept one commission

290
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,120
at a time and I'll do it that day. And then I'll accept another one and do it that day.

291
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:21,480
That's what I decided on. So no one waits. The way I'm doing it going forward is if I'm in the mood

292
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,240
to do a commission, I think I can do one. I will put up on Twitter. Hey, I'm going to do a commission.

293
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,520
I'm not having multiple slots open because it will just get past me. And I know how my brain

294
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:42,040
works and it doesn't work properly. Speaking of, this reminds me of the most annoying comment

295
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,160
ever got on the last episode. I'm going to complain about this one commenter.

296
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,920
This one made me feel like I was losing my mind because this is like, I anticipated,

297
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:02,520
I imagined someone complaining that like me talking about the artist, you know,

298
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:09,160
bailing on the dojin and ghosting me. I imagined someone finding it objectionable

299
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,160
that I would complain about that. And then I was like, no, Ben, you're being ridiculous.

300
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,760
It's just so foolish. Well, some commenter was like, Ben, you're bullying this guy.

301
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:29,000
It's evil. It's cruel. You're a monster. It's not really true, I'm paraphrasing,

302
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,800
but someone was complaining that like, this guy thinks it's wrong. This guy thinks it's wrong

303
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:39,800
for me to complain about the guy who basically like scam. I didn't even do like a full scam.

304
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,320
It wasn't like a deliberate scam, but he did like, he took, he took money for a service and

305
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:49,000
he didn't deliver on the service and then he, then he ghosted. And I, I just can't believe this

306
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,360
guy thinks I'm the bad guy for just for saying that, for saying that that happened. Fuck you,

307
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:04,680
commenter. It's the ghosting part that makes it like, like a bad thing that you can complain about.

308
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,000
Because like if somebody is saying, oh, I'm taking a while, at least they're in contact with you.

309
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,840
Yeah, absolutely. And you can talk to them about it. You can, you can, you can like arrange

310
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,440
something and you don't have to say anything publicly because you're talking to them.

311
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,760
This fucking pussy. But if you have no way to, to talk to them, what are you gonna do?

312
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,480
This pussy, this pussy commenter was like, oh, you're probably just making them anxious. You're

313
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:31,080
probably giving them anxiety. Fuck you. Fuck you. We live in a society. I don't care. It's your

314
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,760
problem. When you do, you're, I guess we shouldn't, I guess we shouldn't have trials for criminal.

315
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,280
I guess when people do crimes, we probably shouldn't have trials for them because that would

316
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,680
be bullying them and it would probably give them anxiety. They'd probably be like, bothered by

317
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,560
that. You fucking, this sick fuck, sick fucking mentality this guy has. I hate it. I hate it.

318
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,120
Yeah, with my incredibly late stuff, at least like tried to contact and say, hey, sorry,

319
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,640
I haven't been able to work on it. Or when I went back to do those, I would not have been mad at

320
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,080
all. I would not have even been mad if the guy had been like, sorry, I'm three months late.

321
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,880
I'm working on it. I'd be like, you know what? No big deal. You know what? These things happen.

322
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,400
Three months is the cutoff point. Wouldn't even, wouldn't even about it.

323
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:17,800
Where I offered like a refund or the, or to just do it and then say, sorry. You know what I mean?

324
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,200
Yeah. Like half the people who's commissions were really late recently. I offered them refunds and

325
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,880
half of them took them. So it just seems fair. I mean, I'm not saying like that guy should give

326
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,360
you a refund, but he should give you a refund. He should give me, he should refund me at least

327
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,840
part of it because he didn't do, right. Cause I paid him half and he didn't quite do half.

328
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,480
He probably did like a third. So is that going to be used anywhere? What's been done?

329
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:50,360
Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm going to keep what's done. And, and, uh, uh, yeah, I'm going to keep what he

330
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:57,000
did. And, uh, Kaiju is just going to just do the rest. Yeah. The, the dodging is like a few like

331
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,840
short stories, isn't it? Yeah. So they can be like different art styles and not be too jarring.

332
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:13,480
Yeah. Yeah. I don't think he, I don't think he like finished. I think he did quit mid story.

333
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,480
So one story will be split. I don't, you know, I mean, not that they, they look the same,

334
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,480
but I feel like Kaiju and this guy have close enough style. They, they both do, you know,

335
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,560
sort of manga style, like, you know, black on white, uh, uh, line art, kind of sort of a

336
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,360
traditional manga look. It's not exactly the same, but I feel like they are, they are compatible

337
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:42,200
enough in a way that it's not like going to be a weird, like doesn't, doesn't look like the same

338
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,800
comic. Uh, I don't know, whatever. It'll just be a funny, like, oh, huh. This, this page was by,

339
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,320
you can see, you can tell when the art is shifted because the art style changes a little bit here

340
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,600
and here. Yeah. Yeah. Like, uh, when that voice actor from Avis Alastair Vendor died and they

341
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,680
got another white boy guy and it sounded like exactly the same and you can only barely tell.

342
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:10,840
Which, which, um, that's Iro. Iro, um, was voiced by Mako, I think. Yeah. I don't know.

343
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,840
Yeah. So it's sort of a, he was like a prestigious Japanese like actor who worked in a lot of stuff

344
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,200
and, um, very old guy, sort of had a, like a, like a, like, oh, voice.

345
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,440
But you mean in the English stuff? You mean in the, you mean the original?

346
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,520
So I was going to say, I didn't say it. I was, I meant the, but you, but you mean the English

347
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:41,320
voice actors? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't, I didn't know that. Okay. I never noticed the voice change. So

348
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,520
I mean, on the first watch, I didn't, but I think I've definitely noticed it every time

349
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,800
since the first watch. So I'm like, oh, that's when. If I ever watched it again, I'm sure I'd

350
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,080
be listening for it. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Oh, well, maybe I'm just kind of deaf.

351
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,120
I'm pretty, I'm pretty bad at noticing and noticing things like that. I have a tall,

352
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:10,360
kind of good, kind of like one of the best. Yeah. That's what they say. That's what they tell me.

353
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,960
Is it as good as they say though? Yes. Pretty much. Yes.

354
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,440
As far as the last airbender is really that good. Dude.

355
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,720
YouTube thumbnail, red text. Distilled critic watched every episode with his brother and they

356
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:31,480
talked about it and he said, show good. Hmm. I agree. Thumb up. I'm not sure if it's good.

357
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:42,600
I have a bunch of, um, I have a bunch of gripes. I have a bunch of life gripes that are bugging me.

358
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,360
I'm just going to go, I'm just going to go down. Hashtag Ben Sains life gripes.

359
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,480
Here we go. Top number 10. I'm just going to go down a list and list off things that annoy me.

360
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:59,880
The life grapes and the wine corner. You turn gripes into wines.

361
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,360
Yeah. Yeah. This is the wine corner and these are all the individual grapes that I'm about to smush.

362
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,480
Number one. My glasses broke, uh, sort of. I dropped them a little while ago and one of the

363
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:18,120
frames cracked and it's just a small crack in the side of the, of the, one of the, the frames and

364
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,160
the lens is fine. Like the lens didn't crack, but now like there's a little gap and I,

365
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,760
if I move my head a lot or like I, I, I, I hold them the wrong way, the lens will fall out.

366
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,800
So I need to like glue the frames. I should get new lens, new frames because I got these

367
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,120
like eight fucking years ago. Oh, let's try and come up with solutions for all of Ben's life

368
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:46,120
gripes. Uh, number one, get new frames or tape. Uh, uh, I, I'm going to order some gorilla glue.

369
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:52,760
I'm going to order some gorilla glue, but I, it's only like $6. So I had to buy some other stuff

370
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,400
to get free shipping on Amazon. So I'm waiting for it. Like I said, if I sell like two more

371
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,000
copies of the Blu-ray, I will have to buy more discs. So I'm waiting until like two more Blu-ray

372
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,320
copies sell so that I can order another batch of discs, which will get me over the $25 limit

373
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,800
to pay no shipping on an Amazon order. So so I get my gorilla glue free shipping charges.

374
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,960
You see, it's all, it's all connected. Would you like glue your glasses with like a glue gun

375
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,120
pointed towards, uh, like while you're wearing them, just right into your eye?

376
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:33,000
Cassie said they had a glue gun that I, I was going to, I was going to glue gun them

377
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,280
temporarily together, but I just forgot to, uh, and now I don't want to walk over there

378
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,600
because it's too cold out and there's too much snow. So I'm just, I'm just fucked.

379
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,760
All right, life gripe number two. Let's go. Let's go. Uh, my toilet is clogged.

380
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,280
Plunger, Amazon, uh, put you over the limit for the things.

381
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,320
I have to buy a new toilet.

382
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,480
Dude, you mentioned my plunger.

383
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,240
Destroy it. Plunger.

384
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,760
Dude, plunger, plungers are so cool.

385
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,760
When I was a kid, I loved when I run into the store and I would grab a bunch of plungers and

386
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,760
stick them to the walls. I have, I have been, I have a plunger and I have tried to plunge it

387
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:14,920
and it doesn't work. Okay. This, since I moved in, this, this toilet, this toilet in my apartment

388
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,040
is, I guess it sucks because it clogs quite often. It has clogged a bunch of times. However,

389
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,120
if, if I just like have like, let it, if I just have ignored it, because there's two

390
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,880
toilets in my apartment, I can just use the upstairs toilet, right? I can just, if I have

391
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,200
just let it sit for a day or two, eventually the clog like dissolves or whatever. And it,

392
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,760
and it has like cleared up and it's like fine. This time it has been clogged for like a week.

393
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,160
It has in fact only gotten worse. The clog has only gotten more severe. I don't know what's up with

394
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,800
that. Um, but so, and plunging has not fixed it. So God, I might actually have to like call my

395
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,080
superintendent or my landlord or something and be like, uh, fix it. Or I guess I could just go buy

396
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,600
some like Drano or something. I've never, I've never like, gotta get that, that like duct, toilet,

397
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:05,400
blast pipe, chemical dissolving, get like an air cannon and fire it into the toilet.

398
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,360
So I mean, whatever, I just been using the upstairs toilet. Like it doesn't even matter,

399
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,920
but it just makes me annoyed. It just makes me feel like I live in a, in a dump, which I do live

400
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,960
in a dump. So I guess that's fine. Uh, third problem is I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't have a,

401
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,640
I miss, I need another blanket. It's too cold. I need a third blanket. I have another blanket,

402
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,320
but it like, I think I spilled something on it like a while ago and I've been meaning to do my

403
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,040
laundry. I've been meaning to put it in the laundry, but it requires like a load unto itself

404
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,840
because it's a big blanket and I just don't want to put you over the limit of the spending thing.

405
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,480
And I just don't want to spay the $2. I don't want to pay the $2 to do a whole load of fucking

406
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,200
laundry just for one, actually $4 because I have to dry it afterwards. So I've just been,

407
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,760
so whatever, I just have a bathrobe. I just put it, I just put a bathrobe on top of my bed and

408
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,120
now that's my third blanket. Watch your fucking clothes Ben. Jesus. I don't, it's, it would take

409
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,680
a whole separate load just for the, just for a blanket. I don't want to. You can put some socks

410
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,800
and pants in there with it. No, it's too big. Oh, fuck you. And I don't, you're telling, oh,

411
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,880
what am I, what am I going to do, Simsie? Just, just lift myself, pick myself up

412
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,880
in my bootstraps and spend the $4 to do a whole load of laundry. Yes. Don't be ridiculous.

413
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:31,640
Self-care is important, my friend. I was thinking of like getting a blanket and buying like a brooch

414
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:38,200
and making a cloak because like, because that's basically what a cloak is. It's just like a long

415
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,160
big piece of cloth that you wrap around yourself. That's a problem with walking around your house

416
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,600
dressed like that. Well, not just like outside, like, but the only problem is like,

417
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,880
it's getting warmer, it's going to be spring and it'll be very weird to have a like cloak.

418
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,840
It's good for like when it's really cold. I mean, why not? And you can like wrap it around and it's

419
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:03,720
like, it's like a fashion thing that is completely gone for no reason. They're trying to sell you

420
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,560
coats. Coats aren't as cool. It's a, coats are a racket. Coats are a new agenda. Coats are a jacket.

421
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:15,240
They make fucking people. They, they, they sell, they sell us poison and then they suppress our

422
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,640
cures. Well, no, they, and they, to sell us cures while we suppress our medicine. Selling,

423
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:29,080
give us poison is cold. Sell us cures is coats. Suppress our medicine is cloaks clasped with a

424
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,800
brooch. Anyway, it's just, it's just such a, such a base cloak life, a base and easy solution.

425
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,360
All I need is a brooch. I don't know where to get one. I guess I can Amazon or look around.

426
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,080
A brooch is just like a pin, right? Like a pin in the class.

427
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,680
A big, a big hefty pin that you can go through and can withstand pulling forces of a big,

428
00:42:52,680 --> 00:43:02,600
heavy blanket. Big, heavy person pulling it real hard. Yeah, like give. Yeah. Yeah. Give you like

429
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:13,560
400 pounds, right? I cost a lot more than that. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Life grapes go. We

430
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,440
need another one. Yeah. I had one, one more, which is a dental insurance. I've been trying

431
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,880
to look into dental insurance and like it doesn't make any sense and it sucks so much and it doesn't

432
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,080
even work. Like it doesn't, it doesn't, it's not even good. It doesn't even like actually pay for

433
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:38,120
shit. Amazon.com, cheap dental insurance. Amazon Prime Dental, the new services they're rolling

434
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,960
it up. Because I got, because I got to go to the dentist because I'm sure I need a couple of

435
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,080
fillings at least. And so I'm like, okay, time to actually do that. So I tried to do it. I tried

436
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,360
to like be good and get my shit taken care of and I went and I tried to look into it. And I guess

437
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,760
the most popular dental insurance in Massachusetts is something called Delta Dental, but everyone

438
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,960
hates it and apparently it sucks. And I was looking at their policies and like you could get,

439
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,640
they'll give you, they'll give you like, they won't even pay for shit. They'll give you like 50%

440
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:14,280
off at best. That's the best, that's the best you can get for, for, yeah. It's 30% on some things.

441
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And then like, I don't know, like they're, I was looking at their plans and then they have like a

442
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,520
regular plan. It's like, oh yeah, this is a plan that like, if you have this plan, you'll have no

443
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,400
waiting period. It'll cover all this stuff. It's not available anymore. That one's, you just can't

444
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:35,400
get that one anymore. I'm like, okay, cool. So I don't know. It's just, it's so like inscrutable

445
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,440
and like they don't even tell you what a plan costs. They don't list the price anywhere. They just

446
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,080
will say, yeah, this plan exists and this is what it covers. What does it cost? I don't know.

447
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,920
Depends on how big your teeth are. Don't even worry about it. Well, how am I supposed to

448
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,720
fucking choose a plan? You freaks. You sick fucks.

449
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:09,560
I called my, called my parents and I asked my dad like, what should I do? And I forgot like, well,

450
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,720
they have like Medicare. So like, they don't have to worry about this shit. Okay, great.

451
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:24,600
My dad, because my dad gets all of us kids, my dad gets all of us offspring, a AAA membership.

452
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,960
Every year. So he recommended that I get some insurance offered through AAA. There are some,

453
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,320
there are some companies that are like, affiliated with AAA. I was like, okay.

454
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,400
So I was going to look through those, but like, I didn't because it's like,

455
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,800
they have names like choosy, like they sound like fucking apps.

456
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,000
Jeez.

457
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,880
That's horrifying.

458
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,480
They sound like fucking Twitter artists.

459
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,960
C-H-E-W-S-I. I don't know, man. That sounds weird for an insurance company.

460
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,400
Choosy Manfredo.

461
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:05,480
Yeah. So, so, uh, I just, just, um, I don't know. I haven't done it.

462
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,840
That's a life gripe that you've got to solve on your own, my friend.

463
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,880
Yeah. I'm afraid Amazon free shipping isn't going to solve this one for me.

464
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,520
As it does so many things.

465
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Yeah. So that was it. That's the end of my, uh, that's everything on my list of stuff that's

466
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:23,960
bugging me.

467
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,080
That will be a recurring segment every week where we go through all the little things that

468
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,680
have ruined Ben's existence and life.

469
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,560
I mean, I mean, it pretty much is already. It's just we've never put a name to it.

470
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,040
We need a jingle for it.

471
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,960
Ben's life gripes.

472
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,520
I think, is it, I'm going to get that guy, I'm going to find that guy's name.

473
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,480
Came to make a life gripes jingle.

474
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,560
Oh, yeah, please. Somebody has to do it.

475
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,560
Genius.

476
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,280
That's all I got. That's all I got.

477
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,440
And we're only 45 minutes in.

478
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,320
Um, well, I guess I can talk a little bit about maps. I said last time.

479
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,880
Mutu Sandu. Mutu Sandu is the guy in the comments. He's the guy who does the music.

480
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:17,880
And I think he's probably the guy in Japan that you got to ship to, perhaps, perhaps, maybe.

481
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,720
He's a real Tokyo boy. He's got a Tokyo address. He gave me his, his shipping address to send

482
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:28,200
them some stuff, but he gave it to me like in like fucking kanji.

483
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,360
I'm like, what the, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?

484
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,640
Oh, speaking of Japan, I got my first, he gave it to me in English too.

485
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,200
I got my first embarrassing sexy one piece figure.

486
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,080
Hooray.

487
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,280
Hooray.

488
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,360
When it arrived at the house, my dad looked at the package and he was like, Fukuoka City.

489
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,600
What the hell's that? I was like, never mind.

490
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,960
I want to see you, Simsie.

491
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,720
Uh, it's on my Twitter. It's not.

492
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,440
Is it Robin?

493
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,080
Yeah, it's Robin. Of course it's Robin. What the fuck do you think I am? So I'm going to plebeian?

494
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,520
Or I'm going to buy a fucking.

495
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,200
Like Batman and Robin?

496
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,360
Yeah. From one piece.

497
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:03,720
From one piece.

498
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,720
He's got his, he's got his like little short, short.

499
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:05,960
Hang on.

500
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,760
But out.

501
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,880
Here's a picture.

502
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,640
I bought it with leftover Amazon money that I had from.

503
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,840
That's not embarrassing.

504
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,320
No, but it's like, fuck yeah, there it is.

505
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,720
Dude, I didn't know she was that much taller than Bulma.

506
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,920
What the fuck?

507
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,120
I know. I was very surprised.

508
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,680
It's the same brand as well. It's Canon. That's the Canon height.

509
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,960
Wow, she's tiny.

510
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,280
Yeah.

511
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,400
Oh, I like it.

512
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,000
Oh, I found her. I found her.

513
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,640
And I immediately bought another one because I was like, that's cool.

514
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,080
I want to know. I need an Ami now.

515
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:43,800
These sorts of figures are like cool as a photograph.

516
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,840
When I see them in, in like real life,

517
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,200
like the time I went to Digi's or Trixie's older house

518
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,600
for Redcon one and two and stuff.

519
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,160
I saw all those figurines and I was like, oh, that's what they look like

520
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,840
in person because I'd never bought one.

521
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,000
And they're like, this just annoys me because of like,

522
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,360
it not not because of what it is.

523
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,880
I don't care about anime or whatever or like whatever it is.

524
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,520
Like, oh, it's it's embarrassing. It's not. It's just a figure.

525
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,520
But like, yeah, having figures that with with like, oh, you got to dust them.

526
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,080
You got to put the fine shelf space for them.

527
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,400
Yeah.

528
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,680
I'm like, that's a whole that's like a full time job is keeping a display looking nice.

529
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,360
I do hate owning things.

530
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,720
I do hate owning things.

531
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,720
Just minimize ownership and everything's fine.

532
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:35,560
Yeah.

533
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,760
Well, that's that's the attitude that got me in a fucking shithole apartment

534
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,680
with a clogged toilet and so, you know, who's who's not enough.

535
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,680
I have I have a plunger.

536
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,880
I have a plunger.

537
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,640
I guess I need to plunger.

538
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,920
I need to do one.

539
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,640
You got to you got to you got to do a dual system.

540
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,560
Yes, that's the phrase I was looking for.

541
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,800
You're using the right bed.

542
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,400
You're not sticking a thin bit down the toilet.

543
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,640
Oh, it's just just jam the.

544
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, yeah, you jam the wooden end down.

545
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,480
You just wash it around to try and break up the clog.

546
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:07,720
Right.

547
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,080
Right.

548
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:10,680
Yeah.

549
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,280
Well, well, it doesn't fucking work.

551
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,480
So what you fix a clog door is you keep flushing it until the water comes out.

552
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,440
And then it's done.

553
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,400
And it's everything's fine.

554
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,720
It used to work.

555
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,960
It used to just it used to just unclog itself.

556
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,720
But not anymore.

557
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,480
Now, well, not that not this time.

558
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,960
Yeah, I like toys.

559
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,680
I like buying embarrassing toys to have my desk and it makes me smile.

560
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
That's all I wanted to say, really.

561
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:41,320
I have like more like a collection of of plush toys instead.

562
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,560
And those at least you can squish together and like and throw on the bed or on the floor.

563
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah, you can have the you can have convenient storage of plushies.

564
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,280
Yeah, you don't have to worry about all that fell off the shelf.

565
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,320
Yeah.

566
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,680
Oh, or or anything.

567
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,760
Because along the top shelf.

568
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,840
Along the top shelf, which is next to me.

569
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,240
Yeah.

570
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,240
Along the top of the bookshelf, which is next to my desk,

571
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,760
I've got all my like Gundam models and action figures and shit set up

572
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,160
because I'm an embarrassing 22 year old fucking freak.

573
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,320
But I own I own nothing.

574
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,440
I own nothing.

575
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,240
You own you have digital ownership of things, but it's fine.

576
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,840
I have a little my friend.

577
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,240
My friend Chelsea gave me a little a little Homer Simpson Buddha,

578
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,520
who's like holding a donut.

579
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,280
That's the right kind of thing to own a little a little.

580
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm not I'm not sure if it's plastic or rubber,

581
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,880
but it's a little a little figurine of a little Buddha Homer Simpson.

582
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,400
And that's that's my Nika Robin.

583
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,160
You look at him longingly every day.

584
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,640
And that's culturally insensitive to someone, probably.

585
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:56,440
He's up on my he's up on my shelf next to my Sonic the Hedgehog and Shrek glasses.

586
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,080
Very nice.

587
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,600
I collect collectible glasses.

588
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,640
Shrek glasses.

589
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,120
Do they have I have do they give you a little Shrek here?

590
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,080
Let me put them on.

591
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,600
They just have a little screened on.

592
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,360
They're like promotional glasses from like Shrek three, I think.

593
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,120
Oh, the one with the best one.

594
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,160
You mean the one with the babies.

595
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:17,320
You mean drinking glass or eyeglass is they're not shot not shot glasses.

596
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,600
They're just I don't know what you call them.

597
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,240
Tumblers.

598
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,840
Tumbler glasses.

599
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,160
They're you know, they're like not like tall glasses.

600
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,400
They're like, you know, medium height glasses of normal width.

601
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,240
Yeah.

602
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,400
Chugging down your Shrek flavor, Jack Daniels.

603
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:34,440
Yeah.

604
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,280
Shrek coming green green.

605
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:40,600
Yeah.

606
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,040
Green St. Patrick's Day Shrek themed whiskey.

607
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,320
They do green versions of basically every food like I know around Halloween,

608
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,400
Jaffa cakes, they do like green versions of those and I've always been scared to try them

609
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,000
because I don't know why we don't have we don't have Jaffa cakes over here.

610
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,920
But I mean, they do green.

611
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,880
They do green beer.

612
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,880
Yeah, they do some green.

613
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,000
I've never had green beer.

614
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,360
That sounds terrible.

615
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,400
That might be that might be a thing that they just do like at bars.

616
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,240
Like how do you tell it's green because you're drinking it, you know, looking at it.

617
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:21,800
I don't know if they sell like I don't know if they if many brands like sell green beer

618
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,760
like in bottles.

619
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,120
No, of course not.

620
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,680
It's funny.

621
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,320
I used to think beer was green because they were in the glass bottles.

622
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,200
I didn't really put it together that it's not that color.

623
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:32,920
Yeah.

624
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,600
This is like way before I started drinking.

625
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,320
There's just like, oh, I see that beer bottles are green or wine bottles are like a weird color.

626
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:42,680
Yeah.

627
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,920
I think my parents drank like mostly like clear bowl stuff all the time.

628
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,760
And then they straight vodka.

629
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah.

630
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:50,920
Yeah.

631
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,800
I was like, that's cool.

632
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,560
That footage just makes you act real strange.

633
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:01,400
My dad, one time at Olive Garden, my dad gave me a sip of his firewater whiskey.

634
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,280
And when I was like a kid and I was like, oh god, he like laughed.

635
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,960
He thought it was funny that I was like, disgusted by it.

636
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,720
Honestly, it probably was funny.

637
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,320
Honestly, I think I get it.

638
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,560
Yeah.

639
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,440
That happened with me, but with like a normal beer.

640
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,000
Like, you know that warm throat feeling you get from alcohol?

641
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,880
Like too much of it.

642
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,120
Yeah.

643
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,160
I had that.

644
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,240
I had like a sip of my dad's desperado.

645
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,760
So when I was like eight and I was like, my throat's burnt.

646
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,720
It's on fire.

647
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,600
What's going on?

648
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,600
I smell.

649
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:36,280
I smelled beer as a kid and I thought it smelled because I would because we would have

650
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:42,680
to like sort our recycling into, you know, you know, returnables and non-returnables.

651
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,560
And then, you know, my parents would let, we, okay, we didn't have like, like trash pickup.

652
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:53,960
We had to take our trash to the dump and we would sort recyclables and we could bring

653
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:59,480
the recyclables to a local, to a liquor store, actually, or to a returnery or whatever you

654
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,120
call it.

655
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,520
And they would accept, you know, cans and they would give you return money for it.

656
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,800
A nickel per can or whatever.

657
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,440
And so parents, when we were little kids, parents would let us sort it and then we

658
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,760
could take it and return it and we could get the return money.

659
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,080
And, you know, I would do that and I would sort out my dad's beer cans and I'd be like,

660
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,200
oh, this is gross.

661
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,480
It's so fucking disgusting.

662
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,600
It smells nasty.

663
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,240
So I never wanted to try tasting beer as a kid.

664
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,840
I thought it was the grossest shit ever.

665
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,520
And I was right.

666
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,160
You were correct.

667
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,560
I should go, I should go back.

668
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,000
I should go back to that.

669
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,400
Yeah.

670
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,520
If only it was possible.

671
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,240
My dad, my dad, by which I mean my bare father, who's a piece of shit.

672
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,400
Let me try beer and it was fucking gross.

673
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,280
It was the worst shit.

674
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:53,320
And later, like over a decade later, I got my first job and the boss from America

675
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,240
randomly showed up at our tiny office.

676
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,400
He just walked in unannounced to check up on me.

677
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,440
Was this in New Zealand?

678
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,160
Yeah, it was in New Zealand.

679
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,360
He puts a beer on my desk.

680
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,400
It was like, yeah, I bought you this.

681
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:05,880
Haha.

682
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,320
It's brand is really good.

683
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,560
And I'm like, oh, thank you.

684
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,960
I don't really drink alcohol, but sure.

685
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,720
I'll give it a try.

686
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,600
And I tried it when I got home and it was not good.

687
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:17,960
Yeah.

688
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,600
Do you still not like beer?

689
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,320
Well, that was only a few years ago.

690
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,960
Most alcohol I don't like the taste of.

691
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,120
Well, sure.

692
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,360
The alcohol itself is just kind of nasty.

693
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,720
And there's only been a couple where the flavor has been good enough to

694
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,200
mask it or work with it.

695
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,320
Like I like Baileys.

696
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,280
That's why mixed drinks exist.

697
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,760
The point of them is that you mixed stuff together so you don't taste the alcohol.

698
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,320
I think there was a few beers I've liked.

699
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,400
I like Hobgoblin, which is like a.

700
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,160
That's funny.

701
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,680
I've never heard of that.

702
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:05,080
It's like, I don't know what it is, like ale or pale ale or whatever.

703
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:05,960
It's a beer.

704
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,600
It's got a hobgoblin on the front, like a fancy creature.

705
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,960
Let me see.

706
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,000
Those taste all right.

707
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,120
I think it's a gold beer.

708
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:19,480
I remember really liking, yeah, I remember really liking this Icelandic beer

709
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,520
because it was like a lot of beer is quite bitter and like

710
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,320
yeasty or fermenty flavor.

711
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,400
And it's like whatever who cares.

712
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,880
But this was sort of sweet and smooth, but not super strong either.

713
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,640
It was it was really good.

714
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,760
And I don't know what it was called.

715
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:48,200
One time at in Atlanta with econ, I went to we went a couple times to this ramen restaurant.

716
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:54,440
And this place had a couple of Japanese beers and one beer that they had was this.

717
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,600
I guess it was sort of a novelty beer.

718
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:01,160
It was blue, but like it was light blue was pale like sky blue.

719
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,760
The beat the liquid was and it was supposed it was supposedly like

720
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,800
supposedly it was like it was naturally that color.

721
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,160
Like it was brewed with like glacier water or something.

722
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,440
And it was like, I don't think it was died.

723
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,200
And it was really good.

724
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:16,920
I really liked it.

725
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,600
It was very light and a little bit sweet.

726
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,800
And I was like, this is great.

727
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,480
It was like it was like 12 fucking dollars a bottle though.

728
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,680
So, you know, that's the way.

729
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,760
But it was neat.

730
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,640
I'm not sorry.

731
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,200
I tried it.

732
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,400
I like I like sours.

733
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,480
I like I like beers that are like.

734
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,800
Yeah, that are not that are very.

735
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,640
I mean, I don't exactly know what a sour is like how it's made.

736
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,560
But it's it's very like light and it's not very hoppy and it's very tart.

737
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,640
And sometimes it has a fruity taste.

738
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,680
I like sours a lot other than I like I don't really like dark beers.

739
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,800
I don't really like loggers.

740
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,520
I kind of just like drinking like some fucking like Miller light,

741
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,960
like piss water bullshit, because it's like whatever.

742
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,000
It's basically just water.

743
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,640
Ah, what we.

744
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,920
Like I barely even taste.

745
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,280
I mean, it's a good word for it.

746
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,920
Oh, because it's because it's just like drinking water.

747
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,880
You barely even taste it.

748
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,920
It's like fuck it.

749
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,160
Yeah.

750
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,280
Yes.

751
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,400
It was Einstok Icelandic pale ale.

752
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,280
I like that one.

753
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,400
And the hobgoblin is a dark English ale.

754
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:19,800
Yeah.

755
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,320
I guess I like ales.

756
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,120
Ales are good.

757
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,160
Have you ever had doomba?

758
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,200
Doomba is pretty good.

759
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:24,600
Corned.

760
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,960
Doomba is very good.

761
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,360
I love.

762
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,920
Well, I wouldn't say very good.

763
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,120
Most beer is like that's that's all right.

764
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:38,120
And hobgoblin and Icelandic pale ale go a little further.

765
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,600
I think they're not like my favorite thing to drink.

766
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,840
I'm just like if I'm in the mood to get drunk, I'd rather be this.

767
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,400
I think it's the seeds of the bloke in me that has come out in the last few years.

768
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,400
I just I just love the.

769
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:51,720
Seeds of the bloke.

770
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,600
There are aspects to my personality and the things that I like that I'm like,

771
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,800
oh fuck, I'm kind of am like a typical English fat guy bloke sometimes.

772
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,800
Dude, I take one drink of ale and I am king in the north.

773
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,000
I am Jon Snow.

774
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,120
I am all of that.

775
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,480
I'm glued to the footy.

776
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,080
I'm arguing about the rugby.

777
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,400
I'm kicking the cricket ball right in my son's head.

778
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,360
I'm doing all the stuff.

779
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,680
Hmm.

780
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,640
Well, I mean, you just lean into it, I guess.

781
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,760
I guess I could do.

782
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,040
You're going to be you're going to be wearing like an like a newsy cap and.

783
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,920
But what's what's a bloke?

784
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,280
What's a blokely thing to do?

785
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:35,240
Opening a newspaper to look at the boobies on page three.

786
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,120
Getting a tattoo of your favorite football team on your shoulder.

787
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,040
And then you're you're then you get really fat.

788
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,280
So the tattoo gets stretched out and it looks really terrible.

789
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:43,880
Seen that before.

790
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,360
That's pretty good.

791
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,960
It's a it's a it's a tradition.

792
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,600
It's a tradition.

793
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,240
It runs in the family.

794
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,240
Alcohol, cigarettes.

795
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,520
It's all garbage.

796
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,480
It's all shit.

797
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,600
It all tastes like crap.

798
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,880
It all smells terrible.

799
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,320
Just to have sex.

800
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,440
That's the only thing.

801
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,640
Just have sex.

802
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,880
Just just have sex, a virgin.

803
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,760
Yeah.

804
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,760
Especially to get a beer though.

805
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,520
You can only have one.

806
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,360
If you can't get it, draw it.

807
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:12,920
That's mine.

808
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,320
That's mine.

809
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,680
If you get drunk enough.

810
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,400
Draws beer.

811
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,600
Just damn.

812
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,360
Damn, I'm thirsty.

813
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,280
Draws a draw.

814
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:22,920
Draws a pint.

815
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,960
Beer or booba.

816
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,000
You could only draw one.

817
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,120
The answer is clear.

818
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,360
And it's not beer.

819
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,160
I'm slave to your edges, oblivion, full of your slight.

820
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:42,920
Most most most like guys, a lot of guys that I know and I'm friends with are very

821
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,040
they're very like into beer.

822
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:51,880
They're like they like they like to buy like micro brews and like oh locally brewed like oh

823
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,320
an IPA or like a pale stout or whatever.

824
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,280
It's like you know buying a fancy whatever.

825
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,080
Pick a new brand every week and it's and I'm like that's fine.

826
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,440
That's cool and all.

827
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,160
I like trying new things as much as the next guy.

828
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,800
But at the end of the day most of these most like of those beers are like they're strong.

829
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,960
They're like they're brewed to have a strong flavor.

830
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,760
Yeah.

831
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,640
And I'm like I don't kind of I kind of don't like the flavor.

832
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,960
I don't really drink it for the flavor like it's fine.

833
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,920
Like I kind of get how you can kind of enjoy like you sip like a dark lager

834
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,080
again or whatever and you're like ready.

835
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,680
It's like it's fine.

836
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,040
But like I kind of don't really care about that.

837
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,040
So you know just the piss water.

838
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,320
Piss water is fine.

839
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,160
And it's like a dollar fifty you can.

840
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,360
So who's the who's the real genius.

841
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,040
Who's the real real beer official.

842
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,440
I've only ever dipped into like fancy beers like once.

843
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,200
And it was when me and my friends went to a micro brewery in Lincoln.

844
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,400
And we had like a chocolate hazelnut stout.

845
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,200
And it was so fucking fulfilling.

846
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,640
It was like jam packed with fucking stomach space.

847
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,200
It feels like a couple years ago.

848
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,000
This was right when I moved back from Atlanta.

849
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,200
I moved back into my old place monkey house as we called it.

850
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,640
And I think like shortly after that I guess I wasn't invited.

851
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,320
Because I guess they had I guess they had had to schedule this in advance.

852
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,320
And I had not been back at the time.

853
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,360
So I couldn't go.

854
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,080
But a bunch of those guys went for one of their birthdays.

855
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,360
They went to some brewery.

856
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,640
And as part of this brewery trip they got to like.

857
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,000
They got to like mix their own a batch of their own beer or whatever.

858
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,040
Like they mixed it in like a keg or something.

859
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,680
And they you know then like later they would bottle this entire batch.

860
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,360
And they gave them like the whole batch and bottle.

861
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:43,880
So this guy got like yeah he got like like several dozen bottles of some like beer

862
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,520
that he had like technically brewed himself or whatever.

863
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,560
And I never tried it.

864
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,680
I never got to try it.

865
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,960
That's a cool gimmick.

866
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,160
It's a cool gimmick.

867
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,080
Wonder if it was good.

868
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,840
Yeah apparently brewed beer is actually really hard in terms of like stirring

869
01:03:58,840 --> 01:03:59,240
it and shit.

870
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,320
So they might fuck that up and made some shitty beer.

871
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,040
I like to pretend that.

872
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,960
One one Christmas.

873
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,000
One Christmas I went to my uncle's house and my cousin was there.

874
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And he and we didn't have anything to talk about.

875
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,600
So he kind of told me he was getting into like brewing his own beer or whatever.

876
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,520
I think he eventually like quit his his normie job and became like a.

877
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,280
He worked for some like micro brewery that he had like part ownership of or whatever.

878
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,160
They became a brew only.

879
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,880
They started a beer co-op or something like that.

880
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,960
And he showed me some of his like he showed me his like active.

881
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,440
I don't know what you call it.

882
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,280
He's like he showed me his active cultures.

883
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,000
He showed me some like tank that he was brewing in.

884
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,280
And like if you looked inside of it you could see that it was moving

885
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:51,080
because like the yeast inside was like alive and it was like swimming around in there fermenting.

886
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,800
And I was like weird man.

887
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,960
That's crazy man.

888
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,040
Seems cool I guess.

889
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,360
Yeah.

890
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:00,600
I don't know.

891
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,400
Not not a hobby I would probably pick up.

892
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:03,720
Yeah.

893
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,960
It's one of those things that's so like it's such a bad thing where like he gets.

894
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:08,760
Yeah it is.

895
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,920
He gets to like 60 and then he's not 60.

896
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,800
Like he gets like let's say 48.

897
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,720
I would say he's the perfect age for a dad to get really really into brewing.

898
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,960
And he clears out his garage and he puts fucking three vats in there.

899
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,760
It's like what are you doing?

900
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,280
It is a dadly thing.

901
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:26,760
I don't know.

902
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,120
I don't know.

903
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,440
You need a hobby I guess.

904
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,240
Yeah.

905
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,040
You do your thing.

906
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,880
Do your thing on the side.

907
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,600
Whatever if it's sparks joy in you.

908
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,320
Yeah.

909
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,360
More power to you.

910
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:42,520
It's you know it's equivalent to like making keto gummies.

911
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:47,800
It's just like what if I was in charge of what I consumed.

912
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,040
What if I was the means of production.

913
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,640
It probably yeah basically basically is.

914
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,280
And that's why I draw.

915
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,440
Yeah yeah.

916
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,160
Man sad again.

917
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:01,880
Sad again.

918
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:08,760
Crack found a link to a site that's that purported to offer isomaltoligosaccharides.

919
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,360
And it asked me to like enter my info and they would send me like a quote.

920
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,960
They would send me a quote for like how much will a certain quantity cost.

921
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,840
And I did it and they didn't send me anything.

922
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,480
I think the site is like is like soft to defunct.

923
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,360
It just doesn't work.

924
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:23,960
I was like damn it.

925
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,560
They were like this chump doesn't need enough

926
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,160
saccharide.

927
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,520
Maybe it maybe it was maybe like they saw the numbers I was asking for.

928
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,120
And they were just like this guy's not worth our time.

929
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,640
This guy's working in change.

930
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,840
We're dealing with this guy.

931
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:43,160
I'm sorry I only I'm sorry I only need like 10 to 20 pounds of the stuff.

932
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,280
I don't need like metric tons at a time.

933
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,800
Where would I even store it.

934
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,080
Where would I even store metric.

935
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,560
Wait.

936
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,680
I just thought of another gripe.

937
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:52,760
This is really important.

938
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,960
Can't get it's not a gripe.

939
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:55,720
No.

940
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,760
There's mice.

941
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:57,480
There's mice.

942
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:57,800
Oh no.

943
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,600
Mice in my kitchen.

944
01:06:59,160 --> 01:06:59,480
Mice.

945
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:00,920
Ratatouille.

946
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,000
There were mice.

947
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,120
There were mice months ago.

948
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,680
I saw mice months ago and then I put down traps.

949
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,880
And I haven't seen any mice.

950
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:15,000
But then I was walking out my I was walking out my fucking bedroom door.

951
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,160
To my fucking clog toilet bathroom to not use it I guess.

952
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,400
And I heard and I heard a little rustling.

953
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,320
I heard something like twitch.

954
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,400
I heard a little paper bag rustling sound under the kitchen table.

955
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,800
Where we keep a bunch a bunch of people have bags of stuff.

956
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,280
And I went and I looked and I was like and I stopped and I listened.

957
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,320
And then I heard it again.

958
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,120
I heard a little rustle.

959
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:38,760
I heard a little rustle.

960
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,360
And I was like I think there's something.

961
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,160
I think there's something in one of these bags some creature.

962
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,240
So I like I walked towards it and I tried to like.

963
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,000
I wondered like what if I just picked up the bag that it's in.

964
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,640
And I just like threw it out into the parking lot.

965
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,880
Just throw the mice out of the house.

966
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,600
Right.

967
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,040
But I but I walked up towards it and as I got closer I stopped hearing it.

968
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,280
And then I couldn't I couldn't hear it anymore.

969
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,560
So I didn't know where it was.

970
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,400
And so I tried like I tried like nudging it.

971
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,040
I tried like kicking the little box that like the bags were in to try and see if I could make it move.

972
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,160
And I didn't hear anything.

973
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,400
And I was like and I was too scared.

974
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,000
I was too scared to like pick up the bag that I thought it was in.

975
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,440
Because I was like what if it like jumps out?

976
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,400
What if it like runs up my arms?

977
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,640
You're gonna fit five nights at Freddy's jump scares me right in the face.

978
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,280
Yeah.

979
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:20,920
Yeah.

980
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,440
So I couldn't do it.

981
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,080
I was like I'm just gonna I'm just gonna pretend I didn't hear anything.

982
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,920
I'm just gonna pretend it's not real.

983
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,800
And maybe it won't be.

984
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,280
But then why do I keep things under the table in bags?

985
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,480
You never keep like a bag of like rice or something?

986
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,600
I put it in a cupboard on the floor.

987
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,360
It's like asking for like little little creatures to come and get it.

988
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,400
Well, it's in like a rubber.

989
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:47,720
Yeah.

990
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,560
I mean in this I mean you're right.

991
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,080
And that's and that's what happened.

992
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,080
My stuff is at least it's in like a box.

993
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,280
It's not just like on the floor.

994
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,320
It's in like it's on the floor under the table, but it's in like a box.

995
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,400
But anyway, so I ignored it.

996
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,720
And then long story short, two days later I go again.

997
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,320
And this time I hear it again.

998
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:13,160
And this time I see two mice at the same time run out from under the table and run under the refrigerator.

999
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:23,560
And I'm like I think I think that my door closes tightly enough that the my that mice could not

1000
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:28,440
come into my room as long as the the door was closed.

1001
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,440
I think they could not get into my room unless they were to like burrow through the walls or

1002
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,760
something. I don't know that for sure.

1003
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:39,080
I would be very upset if there was like a mouse in my room like living in like a pile of my dirty

1004
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,800
laundry or something that would that would ruin my my day.

1005
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,480
There's not a chance there's not a mouse in your room.

1006
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,920
There's one that poops in your mouth every night.

1007
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,640
I'm sorry it's true.

1008
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,560
So that's my other that's my other gripe.

1009
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,160
Just pretend they're pets and then everything's fine.

1010
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,920
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?

1011
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,280
Can we pretend that mice that live under our table are really nice?

1012
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,200
No they are nice. They seem nice. They're just gross.

1013
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:14,920
You seem chill.

1014
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,800
Mice are so small they're like cockroaches.

1015
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,120
No they're not. They're cute no matter what.

1016
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,280
They are a little cute.

1017
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:28,920
They're cute but like if they're around on the floor and like you step on one and you kill it

1018
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,160
that's terrible.

1019
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,320
A corpse of any kind is not very cute.

1020
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:41,000
I don't like knowing that like at any moment I could tread on an animal.

1021
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,600
They are a little cute like up close but like from a distance like you turn on the light and one

1022
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,360
of them scurries across the floor it's not it's it's like disgusting it's like it's a

1023
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,880
cockroach it might as well be a cockroach.

1024
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,160
I run over and try and give it a high five as quick as possible.

1025
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Ends up like slamming into the wall.

1026
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,720
Just smushing it with my hand and killing the poor thing.

1027
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:06,120
I would love have I ever I've probably mentioned the time that one time in my

1028
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,120
old in monkey house I dropped a frying pan on a mouse on purpose.

1029
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,000
There was a mouse and I saw it was on the floor and I was like how do we get it and I just dropped

1030
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,320
a frying pan and it crushed it.

1031
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,040
That's horrible.

1032
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,240
I know but that's life.

1033
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,440
That's not the life that's death.

1034
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,520
That's mouse life ladies and gentlemen.

1035
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,880
Son it's not disgusting it's just reality.

1036
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:33,400
Take a deep breath and kill some mice.

1037
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,840
Kill some mice.

1038
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,040
Yeah.

1039
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,680
I have to go to the bathroom.

1040
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,040
I'll be back in one second.

1041
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,520
I gotta pee.

1042
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,960
Oh no we gotta entertain ourselves.

1043
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,960
He's gonna go to the bathroom.

1044
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,920
And he's gonna go and he's gonna go be like oh no that's blocked still.

1045
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,320
It's clogged and there's mice in my toilet.

1046
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,560
Then he's gonna walk over to the next the the other toilet and he's gonna

1047
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,200
encounter a mouse or two and he's gonna come back and say guys there was a mouse's.

1048
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,040
Oh my god.

1049
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:04,920
That's my prediction.

1050
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,120
Oh my god.

1051
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,400
Oh my god.

1052
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,320
Yeah you go oblivion for what you gotta say.

1053
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,800
Um what do I have to say?

1054
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,160
Um mouse cute.

1055
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,200
What's better than a mouse?

1056
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,160
A mouse woman.

1057
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,840
No no here we go.

1058
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:24,840
It's true.

1059
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:35,000
There's a guy on youtube who draws for mouse and she has an ass and it's good.

1060
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,920
Right is it?

1061
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,280
I can imagine such a thing.

1062
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,760
Is it the guy who's using the name of something like J-A-O.

1063
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,920
J-I-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O That's his name.

1064
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,080
J-I-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O He follows me.

1065
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:48,600
It's great.

1066
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,720
Yeah that's cool.

1067
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,520
Legend moment.

1068
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:57,320
Uh I wanted to think, I designed a mof uh a big tittie mof character.

1069
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,440
Oh yeah I saw that that was cute.

1070
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,400
On the draw cast.

1071
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,440
I like that.

1072
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:05,080
Yeah um she's cute and I and I thought of a really funny idea.

1073
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,360
I'm back.

1074
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:07,960
Hello.

1075
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,360
What's not.

1076
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,040
Part of a funny idea with my mof character.

1077
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,520
I'll post a picture over if it doesn't show her pussy.

1078
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,140
So that way you'll be safe.

1079
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:14,640
Impossible.

1080
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,140
I don't believe you've drawn such a thing.

1081
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:17,940
It's cropped.

1082
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:18,840
I mean, it's cropped.

1083
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,640
Yeah, I cropped it.

1084
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,640
Um, okay.

1085
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,520
The uncropped is on my Patreon at the moment.

1086
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,980
There's also a version where she lifts her shirt.

1087
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:31,720
But, um, so, so the idea I had, if I want to, I want to have a NOC that's like a

1088
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,660
masochist, uh, cause I think that's funny.

1089
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,020
I think it's funny if you have a character who just wants to get beat up and

1090
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,020
they think it's good, actually.

1091
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:44,660
Um, I thought, what if, what if I do that with a character who's a bug?

1092
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:48,900
She's just a little bug and she wants, she wants you to like pull her fucking

1093
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,140
legs off and shit.

1094
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:50,860
Oh my God.

1095
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:54,740
Yikes.

1096
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,980
Cause I drew it with two arms and I'm like, people like, oh, don't usually like,

1097
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:00,500
if you're drawing like a bug girl, you give her four arms.

1098
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,100
And I'm like, oh, I fought about it.

1099
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:06,660
I'm like, no, she had the other arms pulled off because, um, she enjoys it.

1100
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,140
And then they just grow back.

1101
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,820
They grow back and pull them off again.

1102
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:14,660
You know, you can't pull off too many, you can't pull off too many at a time.

1103
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,540
You can't put a whole, yeah.

1104
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,260
Like she, she, she's got to keep at least two so she can go for her daily

1105
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:22,340
functions, but, uh, she, she likes bug zappers, you know, you know, people in

1106
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,980
the BDSM sometimes I like getting electric shocks.

1107
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,140
She likes the bug zapper.

1108
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,180
She likes to fly swatter.

1109
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,180
She likes newspapers.

1110
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,980
She likes getting hit by cars.

1111
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,900
Um, I, I, I was like, what?

1112
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:35,540
Like splatting on the windshield, just splatting on the windshield.

1113
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:35,820
Yeah.

1114
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:38,580
Oh, I was thinking about size cars.

1115
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,700
Yeah, like human, human cars.

1116
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:41,660
She's in the human world.

1117
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,180
She's just this, she's like one foot tall or something.

1118
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,620
She's, she's got to be at least big enough to put a penis in.

1119
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:50,220
Um, and it's too big and that's also good.

1120
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,260
And I thought of a funny like music video.

1121
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,900
I just want to montage of her just getting squashed and electrocuted, but enjoying

1122
01:14:55,900 --> 01:15:02,140
it and then go into a bug hospital and just, I've been thinking of all these

1123
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:05,620
funny ideas in my head and I want to do like a simple, I want to do in like a

1124
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:11,340
simplified, like almost like barely more of a storyboard style animation similar

1125
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,220
to that, uh, that one guy who draws the mouse for joy.

1126
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,060
Oh, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

1127
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,740
Um, anything that'd be fun.

1128
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:22,300
Yeah, the only thing is that after drawing this character, I stared at it

1129
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:27,580
and I stared at it for a while and I'm like, looks, looks a little familiar.

1130
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,300
Looks.

1131
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:30,700
Oh, no.

1132
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:31,780
I, I, I hope.

1133
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,900
Wait, I think I see it.

1134
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,460
I see it.

1135
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,300
Yeah.

1136
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:35,860
Yeah.

1137
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:41,980
And I'm like, huh, maybe I should change the hair a bit because it's a little too

1138
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,380
similar to someone we know.

1139
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:50,180
She doesn't have a copyright on that hair style.

1140
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,020
I think it's just like the mitt.

1141
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:54,260
Yeah.

1142
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,820
It's Marge Simpson.

1143
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,980
Oh, yeah, Marge Simpson, she starts with an M.

1144
01:15:59,260 --> 01:15:59,860
Exactly.

1145
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:00,300
You're right.

1146
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:00,740
I don't know.

1147
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,380
I couldn't tell, so I don't know.

1148
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:06,340
You know, I actually think Marge Simpson might not even be real.

1149
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:10,020
That's a controversial opinion, but if she's not, if she's a fictional character,

1150
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,220
she can't copyright anything.

1151
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:12,860
True.

1152
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,380
Mickey Mouse can't even copyright themselves.

1153
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:18,100
So really, um, it's all fair game.

1154
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,460
True.

1155
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,300
True question.

1156
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:27,660
Only his, his, uh, his master, his, his, his wrangler can, can copyright Mickey Mouse.

1157
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,180
John Mickey, what's his name?

1158
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:30,620
John Doon.

1159
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,980
No, he can't because he's dead.

1160
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:32,620
It's true.

1161
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,220
No, it's Walter Mouse.

1162
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,820
Because he's fucking dead.

1163
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:37,500
Walter J.

1164
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,740
Is that from, is that from Mr.

1165
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,060
Boop?

1166
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,540
Walter Mouse.

1167
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:42,900
Yeah.

1168
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,340
No, it's doing like Walt Disney, but his last name is Mouse.

1169
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:46,700
Okay.

1170
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,020
Okay.

1171
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,340
And he named his Mickey after it.

1172
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:49,460
But in Mr.

1173
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,660
Boop, he goes to, no, it's, no, it's Mr.

1174
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,700
Boop, but Mr, doesn't Mr.

1175
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:58,100
Boop also own Mickey or just, or did they just mention Mickey?

1176
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,460
Because Mickey has copyright issues also in that.

1177
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,140
That's part of the story.

1178
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,740
Oh, it's been so long since I read it.

1179
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:05,660
I have no idea.

1180
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,500
You can't have been that long.

1181
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,420
It was only last year.

1182
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,660
Yeah, but I'm a fucking idiot.

1183
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,980
But I, I, yeah, well, I forget to.

1184
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:13,020
So who am I?

1185
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,300
Who, who am I judge?

1186
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,140
Uh, no, I got, no, I don't think so.

1187
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:22,300
Cause I, cause I remembered there was like, oh, big copyright man.

1188
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,180
But I was thinking of Mr.

1189
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:25,980
Boop, like the, the dad.

1190
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:31,700
But then I also remember that Mickey is like, oh, oh, my, my master

1191
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:35,460
wouldn't be happy if he knew that I was having orgies with other cartoon

1192
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,060
characters.

1193
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,740
Oh, and, uh, and I conflated, I conflated them.

1194
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:40,700
No way.

1195
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:41,740
Hmm.

1196
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,060
No way.

1197
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,180
Mickey Mouse did that.

1198
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,180
It's true.

1199
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:45,620
He did.

1200
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,700
Master would be happy.

1201
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:47,260
Clearly.

1202
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,500
You see his dick.

1203
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:49,820
You see Mickey's dick in that.

1204
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:51,260
My main memory from Mr.

1205
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:54,980
Boop was a, a very move Goku coming downstairs with a bath towel around his

1206
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,980
cock saying, Hey, get back here with continuing the orgy or something like

1207
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:58,140
that.

1208
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,100
And I was like, that's awesome.

1209
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:00,820
I think that happened.

1210
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:02,220
Yeah.

1211
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,180
That was, that was pretty good.

1212
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:03,780
That's pretty good.

1213
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,220
Mid, mid, mid, mid, mid run.

1214
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:10,420
That's stuck with me.

1215
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:14,580
There's a, just the, the, the, the, the, in the orgy era.

1216
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,660
There's something about sticking Goku in things that makes it funny.

1217
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:18,420
I don't know why.

1218
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,420
Yeah.

1219
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:24,380
Is it his like ridiculously like carved angular muscles.

1220
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:24,980
Yes.

1221
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,780
That clash with every other art style.

1222
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:28,020
It exists.

1223
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:28,700
It's true.

1224
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,620
And then it's also the, the eyebrows.

1225
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,460
It's the fact that he's, he's, he's wacky silly as well.

1226
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,180
Goku is a wacky silly character.

1227
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,860
So putting him like in anything is just odd.

1228
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,380
I don't know why he does, he does act.

1229
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:48,580
He is silly enough that his, his, his personality is like cartoonish, goofy,

1230
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:54,340
Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, goofy style, I guess, but he just looks like that.

1231
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:54,860
Yeah.

1232
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,940
This is beefcake muscle, man.

1233
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:57,660
What a hero.

1234
01:18:58,460 --> 01:18:58,820
Yeah.

1235
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,580
A true shonen hero.

1236
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:05,780
Speaking of which, I've been reading Full Metal Alchemist recently

1237
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:10,740
because I watched it like years ago and I remember literally nothing about it.

1238
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:11,580
So it's.

1239
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,220
Did you watch Brotherhood?

1240
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,340
I think I watched Brotherhood.

1241
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:14,940
Yes.

1242
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:15,940
Okay.

1243
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:16,380
I believe so.

1244
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,700
I've only seen the original.

1245
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:18,580
I've never seen Brotherhood.

1246
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:23,820
I know the original gets pretty crazy and it sounds funny and cool, but.

1247
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,220
I, it's pretty weird.

1248
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:32,060
The original, the original ending and the movie that they made about it is

1249
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,140
pretty, is pretty fucking weird.

1250
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:35,900
I liked it.

1251
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:36,580
I liked it a lot.

1252
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,580
It sounds very unique for it.

1253
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:42,220
And I, yeah, there were like little bits in the manga that I

1254
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:45,300
referenced that I was reading that were like, you know, how like the beginning

1255
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,660
of a manga chapter, sometimes the author will have like a comment.

1256
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:52,980
And it was, it was, she was talking about how the anime was ending.

1257
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:56,420
And I was like, oh, Jesus, that makes, that puts it in timeline really

1258
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,460
weirdly in my head.

1259
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:57,820
Yeah.

1260
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:02,060
But, um, and like how she, she, she gave them a few ideas and was just like, yeah,

1261
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:02,660
go wild.

1262
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,660
And she loved the way that it went.

1263
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,180
And I was like, ah, that's cool.

1264
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:08,060
Maybe I'll have to give the anime a chance someday.

1265
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,980
This is very, it's like George, it's like George RR Martin.

1266
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,060
It's like Game of Thrones.

1267
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,060
They're just like, well, I'm still right in the book.

1268
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,980
They're, they're finishing the, the show.

1269
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,820
Uh, I guess I'll just tell them like, uh, what if you did this?

1270
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,100
What if you, what if you ended like that?

1271
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,380
Fuck it.

1272
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:25,500
Um, is that how, is that something that happened?

1273
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:30,860
I thought he was like largely like disconnected from the show running by

1274
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,140
that, the point they were going beyond the books.

1275
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,140
I remember hearing that he gave them the outlines for the end.

1276
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,020
And he like barely understood what was going on.

1277
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,540
It's just like, well, you know, that's, that's their thing now.

1278
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:44,740
So I, I don't think so because I don't, I mean, he might have been less involved

1279
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:49,700
by that point than he was originally, but I think he did have input because I

1280
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:54,500
remember they talked about like the, the, the hold the door thing was like

1281
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,340
direction him.

1282
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,780
Like, like he told them about that.

1283
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:58,980
That's, that's, they didn't come up with that.

1284
01:20:58,980 --> 01:20:59,300
Right.

1285
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,580
The, yeah.

1286
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:07,380
He, I'm sure he gave them like a general gist of like where characters end up.

1287
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:16,140
Um, but like the, I mean, a lot of the reason the show is so like shit right at

1288
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:20,100
the end is that they have the ending in mind and they don't like,

1289
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,540
they don't properly build to it.

1290
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:27,020
They just sort of have the characters as they've evolved through the show as opposed

1291
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:31,980
to the books and then, you know, changed a few character arcs and like dropped a

1292
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:35,900
bunch of them and just say, okay, well, you wouldn't do this, but because your

1293
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,380
ending is coming up, you will now do this.

1294
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:41,300
And it's completely out of character for you in the show.

1295
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:45,980
And who cares six episodes in the last season, just get, get it done.

1296
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,460
Well, and that's why that was like different.

1297
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:55,580
So I know he, he had, he had some like say in like, what would the ending be?

1298
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:56,020
Yeah.

1299
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,700
That he has for his book thing.

1300
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,140
I remember hearing that he gave an outline of who ends up where, like in terms

1301
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,260
of throne things like that.

1302
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:04,940
Yeah.

1303
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,060
I don't know if I should just say it.

1304
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:09,860
I think he may have changed his plan since though.

1305
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:16,380
Like he's, he's, he's mentioned that his, his books will not be the same as the show.

1306
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:17,620
Yeah.

1307
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:18,420
I think that's a given.

1308
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:19,060
Which is a.

1309
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:19,460
Yeah.

1310
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:26,020
So I'm wondering if he like just said, here's my like first draft ideas for how

1311
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:29,420
the show ends or how the books end and use that.

1312
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:30,900
I kind of like that.

1313
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:35,940
I know the second My Hero Academia movie does that where the author of the

1314
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:39,180
manga had come up with what he wanted the final action scene to be.

1315
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:40,340
And he changed his mind.

1316
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:42,100
So he just gave them that to do in the movie.

1317
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,940
And it's just fucking ridiculous.

1318
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,700
And it's like, oh, it's in a non-canon movie.

1319
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,100
So it's nice that we got to see it.

1320
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,580
It's that that's fun.

1321
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,180
I like that.

1322
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:54,100
It's not the ending of the TV show that everyone loved and ruining it though.

1323
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,300
They didn't actually love it, right?

1324
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:57,820
No.

1325
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,220
Yeah.

1326
01:22:58,980 --> 01:22:59,500
Okay.

1327
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:04,500
Uh, I don't, I don't, I haven't seen, I haven't, I've read a little bit of, I like,

1328
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,340
I read the beginning of My Hero Academia.

1329
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,900
It is fine.

1330
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,460
It's completely the most like white bread.

1331
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:17,180
Like, yeah, this is quality, but there's nothing, there's really nothing special

1332
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,540
about it, aside from the art style.

1333
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,540
I think I liked, I did like the art impression.

1334
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:25,900
Yeah, I like how the faces look, like how the eyes look on the, I like that the

1335
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,500
mouths, the mouths and the teeth.

1336
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:30,940
The mouths are always really like rounded and cute looking and fun.

1337
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,420
And the teeth are very detailed and weird.

1338
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:35,380
Ben, into Vor once again, clearly.

1339
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:41,540
I, I, it was, it was all over like the internet, like everyone was talking about,

1340
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:44,300
it felt like everyone was talking about My Hero Academia for a while.

1341
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,740
I had checked it out a little bit before that.

1342
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:49,820
I think maybe Nate had talked about it or someone had talked about it.

1343
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,220
And I had checked it out and I read a bit and I was like, yeah, that's cool.

1344
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:58,980
I think I liked the gimmick of like, I think I was, I think I liked, uh, All Might.

1345
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:02,820
I think that like, that he was like, that he was, I liked that he was like weak.

1346
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:03,340
Yeah.

1347
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:03,780
I don't know.

1348
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:05,820
I thought that was reminds me of myself.

1349
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:09,100
I think I checked it.

1350
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:09,780
Yeah.

1351
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:14,100
It's, it's, but, but, but then now late, everyone, it seemed like everyone was

1352
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,260
really, really excited about it on the internet for a while.

1353
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:19,420
But now, whenever I see anyone talk about it, it's like they were, it seems

1354
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,820
like everyone was disappointed in it.

1355
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:24,020
Or it seems like generally the opinion has somewhat turned.

1356
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:24,340
Yeah.

1357
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:26,980
I think not like hugely against it, but somewhat.

1358
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,700
I think part of it is what I like to call the legend of core effect where

1359
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:33,900
something is okay, but then everyone like turns on it because it's so popular

1360
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:34,820
and loved.

1361
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:38,100
Um, yeah, that, that has happened to some extent of it.

1362
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:41,860
There are definitely parts of the series that I think kind of smell and a boring,

1363
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:47,220
but like the last like year or so of it have been pretty like solid.

1364
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:47,860
I don't know.

1365
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,540
But, um, seems, seems kind of like what happened to attack on Titan.

1366
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:51,900
Yes.

1367
01:24:51,900 --> 01:25:01,020
This is my hero academia, a, a, a manga story about a young man with a super

1368
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:04,820
power and all these people who have superpowers, but they also have to go to

1369
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:07,340
school and they're superpowers at school.

1370
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,580
Is that what it's about?

1371
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,060
Yes.

1372
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:09,620
That's right.

1373
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:10,300
Basically.

1374
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:10,620
That's right.

1375
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:11,300
Damn.

1376
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,260
So basic.

1377
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:12,780
I know.

1378
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,220
So fringe.

1379
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:13,940
Exactly.

1380
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:17,620
I assume that's what it was from what I saw.

1381
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,980
And I'm like, there's a little twistiness of it.

1382
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:24,300
One punch man just come out and it's like a parody of that and it's so much funnier.

1383
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,180
One punch man doesn't go to school.

1384
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:26,700
Yeah.

1385
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:27,820
No, but like it's like.

1386
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:32,580
Also, that was like 10 years ago of one punch man is like 100 years old now.

1387
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:33,420
Go with the times.

1388
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:36,740
I feel like the thing that sets my hero academia apart is the fact that the

1389
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:40,260
they explained that the, that it's 90% of the planet or something like,

1390
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:43,060
or 99% of the planet that have some super power.

1391
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,060
So it isn't just like a certain people have it.

1392
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:48,100
It's everybody has something and some people are really good.

1393
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,220
But like, what does that change about it?

1394
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:50,900
It's cool.

1395
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,060
Like it's all right.

1396
01:25:53,660 --> 01:26:04,020
Shonen, generally, they are a vehicle by which combat can be, you know,

1397
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:04,860
experienced.

1398
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:05,380
Exactly.

1399
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:06,460
My hero academia.

1400
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:13,420
What if this was like a fight and instead of punching, there was some weird wacky thing instead.

1401
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,260
My hero academia.

1402
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,220
Bulk of what the Shonen genre is about.

1403
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:22,620
Takes place in an alternate timeline of the Incredibles universe where syndrome

1404
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,940
one, yes, and everybody got a, got a super power.

1405
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:25,500
That's true.

1406
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:25,780
That's true.

1407
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,740
Dude, that's correct.

1408
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,980
And so Madagascar.

1409
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,980
Huh?

1410
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:32,500
That's true.

1411
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,580
Madagascar ending.

1412
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:34,580
That's true.

1413
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:38,980
I look, I got this, I saw like a video talking about this, but if you see a

1414
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:42,660
world map and attack on Titan after everything gets expanded and they,

1415
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:45,460
they leave the walls and they leave Ireland and everything.

1416
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:50,220
And the world map is just Earth, just flipped upside down and everything

1417
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,900
takes place on Madagascar.

1418
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:53,780
Crazy.

1419
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:55,860
Like the movie Madagascar?

1420
01:26:55,860 --> 01:27:03,780
No, like the, the play like, is Madagascar the movie canon to attack on Titan?

1421
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:04,500
The movie Madagascar isn't a fictional place that Dreamworks invented.

1422
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:07,420
It's real, it's a real place.

1423
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:12,260
Yeah, but, yeah, but I want to know if the events of the film Madagascar and

1424
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,940
sequels are canon to attack on Titan.

1425
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:17,660
Did Chantelle Dubois happen in the, in the attack on Titan universe?

1426
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:20,620
Did that villain from Madagascar three Europe's most wanted, the best

1427
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:21,260
film ever made?

1428
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,340
Did she canon to attack on Titan?

1429
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,100
That is, she is an acrimon.

1430
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:28,540
She is a descendant.

1431
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:29,540
Oh, cool.

1432
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:30,660
Very nice.

1433
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:33,340
Attack on Titan is another movie Madagascar free.

1434
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:34,780
It's a game of fucking psychotic.

1435
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,700
I kind of think she's great.

1436
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:39,780
I would say Attack on Titan is a game of thrones level blunder for me.

1437
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:42,220
I know some people really like the ending, but I fucking get it.

1438
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:46,060
Oh, I never, I never got to the ending.

1439
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:50,180
I'm very excited because the, the last season is coming out now, I think.

1440
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,300
So people are going to see the ending.

1441
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:54,500
I'm very excited to see the discourse come around about it and see what people think.

1442
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,580
I think, I think the ending is weird.

1443
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:02,300
I, I liked when like the world opened up and we got to see, see like all like.

1444
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,380
Yeah, I love that.

1445
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:06,980
The world has like more modern technology that like to me made the show

1446
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:10,780
finally like actually interesting because I didn't, I didn't care about that.

1447
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:13,580
It was just a big mystery box fest for a long time.

1448
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,580
I didn't give a shit about that really.

1449
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:18,700
And then when I said it's like a game of thrones, I mean, like

1450
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:23,740
the very last second it throws the bucket in like the last five chapters,

1451
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:25,820
I think Attack on Titan just falls off a cliff.

1452
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,220
Do the fucking weird.

1453
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,460
The bigger they are, the harder they fall BS.

1454
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:35,500
We can't, we can't talk about it because it's going on right now.

1455
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:40,460
And I don't want to ruin it for people, but for my own opinions, it sucks.

1456
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:44,860
The Titans are actually not as big as we thought.

1457
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:48,300
They were actually bigger Titans and those they just

1458
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:52,380
one of the biggest Titans in the universe came and he put his foot down,

1459
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:53,820
smashed the earth, everyone's dead.

1460
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:57,140
It's you've seen, you've seen the end of Gerr, of Gerr and Lagann when,

1461
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:00,900
when, when the guys in their mechs get their mechs into bigger mechs

1462
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,100
and then they get those mechs into even bigger mechs.

1463
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,980
Well, Attack on Titan, same thing.

1464
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:08,500
The Titans get form even bigger Titans around themselves.

1465
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:10,940
It's alarming how on point you guys are.

1466
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:16,500
Oh, no, you're kind of like unironically correct.

1467
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:18,540
Yeah, it's been addressed.

1468
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,100
It's been addressed in the anime at this point.

1469
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,860
So we can't kind of talk about it, but there's this concept called the rumbling

1470
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,340
where like a fuckload of colossal.

1471
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:26,500
You remember the colossal Titan, the really, really big guy.

1472
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:31,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's like hundreds of them and a character.

1473
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:35,780
It's millions at the word that they specifically say that there's millions.

1474
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:37,580
Is it millions? Jesus.

1475
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:42,020
That's that's at least the translation I read of the is millions of them said that

1476
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:46,780
and they're going to use them to wipe out the rest of the planet as revenge for being fucked over.

1477
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:47,940
It's just big.

1478
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,420
All right. How tall is a colossus Titan?

1479
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:54,540
I think the colossal one is the one that is like taller than the walls of the like 60.

1480
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:56,380
They're like so like hundreds and hundreds.

1481
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,700
Yeah, they're like.

1482
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,300
Yeah, hmm.

1483
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:05,260
I'm trying to think of like like the biggest dinosaurs and how like the potentially

1484
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:07,500
largest way bigger, way bigger, way bigger.

1485
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:13,820
OK, no, a regular, a regular Titan is like a regular Titan is like dinosaur size.

1486
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:15,980
The colossal Titan is like.

1487
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:20,980
I mean, even I mean, it's like it's like a hundred blue whales or bigger, bigger than that even.

1488
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:23,340
Should I post all of the manga panels?

1489
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,180
No, no, it's Godzilla.

1490
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:26,500
It's Godzilla sized or even bigger than Godzilla sized.

1491
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,220
Should I post one of the manga panels to give some idea?

1492
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,900
I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll provide.

1493
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:31,460
I'll provide.

1494
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,460
So there's this funny flash game called Age of War, right?

1495
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,420
Mm hmm.

1496
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:38,020
Do you remember this as cool?

1497
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:42,220
I remember I had Halo music as I've ever played this one.

1498
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,220
Well, anyway, there's these funny YouTube videos.

1499
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:48,060
Why is there like a Jesus meter in the top right?

1500
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:49,620
It's like a guy being crucified.

1501
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,980
You can use your smite ability or something.

1502
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:56,260
OK. Well, anyway, there's a funny YouTube video.

1503
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:59,460
There's a whole bunch of videos like doing size comparisons for all the Titans

1504
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:02,420
and some of the really wacky crazy ones that come out in every end

1505
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:05,140
that are like 400 meters tall or some bullshit.

1506
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:09,620
And the videos look like this game.

1507
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:12,500
They have these little funny walking animations that are really janky

1508
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:15,700
and they're just walking in place and it's really funny.

1509
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,900
But but the size comparison is useful, I guess.

1510
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,740
But it's spoilery.

1511
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:24,260
I don't know if I could share if people care about spoilers.

1512
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:30,020
I don't care when the Colossus Titan from Attack on Titan

1513
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:35,580
or the behelit like like what's his face?

1514
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:37,860
The many faced big guy.

1515
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:39,180
Ganesha from Berserk.

1516
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:41,260
Ganesha a man from Berserk.

1517
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:45,900
I think Ganesha would win because he's fucking like a god man by the end, isn't he?

1518
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,220
He turns into a tree, though, and he has no brain.

1519
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:52,980
He's like so he's so he did the thing twice.

1520
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:56,900
I mean, all the Colossus Titans do is walk forward and kill people basically.

1521
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,020
They just stomp.

1522
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,020
Oh, my gosh, dude.

1523
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,420
This is the size comparison video.

1524
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:03,460
Me, me, me cast a acrimon, the smallest Titan of them all.

1525
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:05,060
It's true.

1526
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:05,860
It's canon.

1527
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:07,900
Oh, God, these fucking flash puppets.

1528
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,500
Why did they even bother?

1529
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,700
Why don't they animate it like this?

1530
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:15,340
Why wouldn't you just have you could just have a static image?

1531
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:16,500
It would be fine.

1532
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,980
It's terrifying.

1533
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:20,460
It's because it's an animated show, Ben.

1534
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:22,940
You've got to have animated in your YouTube.

1535
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:27,140
Literally like skipped like to the five minute mark to start seeing the big ones,

1536
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:29,260
I guess. Yeah.

1537
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,300
They're pretty big.

1538
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,380
This is a terrible video.

1539
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:35,860
They start out pretty small.

1540
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:37,060
Really funny.

1541
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,540
They start out pretty small.

1542
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:40,780
They're only oh, hmm.

1543
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,500
Hmm.

1544
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,540
How do they hold up their own way?

1545
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:48,620
A cartoon logic, because, you know,

1546
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:52,260
attack is a wacky silly cartoon found founding Titan.

1547
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,940
Oh, my God.

1548
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,340
What the?

1549
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,580
Yeah, it gets pretty crazy.

1550
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:58,020
That's stuff I like.

1551
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,300
It's just like.

1552
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,860
I've never seen this like fucking fish skeleton one.

1553
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,500
Yeah.

1554
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,420
Oh, well, that's that's a spoiler.

1555
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:07,460
OK, that's a huge.

1556
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:11,140
That's what happens when you tell Aaron Yeager that he smells like a barker

1557
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,140
and he turns into a giant fish monster and kills the entire planet.

1558
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:16,900
Yeah. Jesus.

1559
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,580
It's pretty cool. OK, there.

1560
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:19,900
Well, like, technically,

1561
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,580
technically, I've watched the whole show now.

1562
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,220
That's true.

1563
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:24,500
That's all that's all that runs in the rib cage.

1564
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:26,540
I see the most creepy monsters.

1565
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,580
These things are disgusting.

1566
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:33,180
Then these are like, then it's genuinely invested in the designs.

1567
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:35,540
I am. No, I always was.

1568
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:39,340
I always really liked how like how just how viscerally gross

1569
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,500
and like I hate these things so much.

1570
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,460
The Titans are like, they're so vile.

1571
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:45,700
It's one of the strongest aspects of it, I think.

1572
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:47,660
Yeah, I like the founding Titan.

1573
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,340
Yeah, wherever the.

1574
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:52,420
And I know the manga artist has like another artist

1575
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:55,460
who does like the really nice panels that show up every so often.

1576
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,340
Oh, really? The founding Titan is pretty cool.

1577
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:01,020
I they have to because the art style is like suddenly like really good on some

1578
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:02,820
yeah, and then it looks janky elsewhere.

1579
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:04,540
I will say because the guy panels.

1580
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:06,260
The guy's like not a very good artist.

1581
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:08,860
Like his original manga is like, it looks pretty shit.

1582
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:11,100
Yeah, the first few volumes are pretty rough looking,

1583
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:14,260
but I feel he really does improve throughout the course of it.

1584
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:18,980
And it does look great unless like oblivion for said the other guy was doing the whole thing.

1585
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:21,980
He he he doesn't improve.

1586
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:24,700
He probably also had assistance to do like, you know, cleaner,

1587
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,740
cleaner line work and stuff like this.

1588
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:29,300
It's fucking cool. I'm sorry.

1589
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:30,740
This one's pretty spoilery.

1590
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:33,460
I shouldn't have posted that. Oh, God.

1591
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:35,660
It's horrible. It's OK. I didn't mind.

1592
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:40,500
I'm pretty sure I like this image where the where the skeleton

1593
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,940
like is just screaming.

1594
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:44,100
You look at his jaw and it's just wide open.

1595
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:46,220
I'm pretty sure the show's reached this point.

1596
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,500
I haven't watched the last two episodes,

1597
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:52,340
but I'm pretty sure it's reached. Yeah, I think it's I've got gearing up.

1598
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:54,580
I've heard big stuff.

1599
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:56,980
I've heard that the.

1600
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:57,860
Oh, you know what?

1601
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,820
I remember at the end of the part of the show I watched,

1602
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,340
you see the wall crumble and you see what's inside the wall.

1603
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:07,060
So OK, this is kind of like I kind of get what's going on all the millions of

1604
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:12,020
Titans that stomp on that stomp on everyone are the ones from the walls, basically.

1605
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,900
Yeah, I did.

1606
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:17,300
I did always want to finish the show because I did like what I read.

1607
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:20,180
Everyone said the ending was was bad and it gets really stupid.

1608
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:22,980
And that was like that a chilling effect on me.

1609
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:27,260
I guess I wasn't enjoying the show for a while.

1610
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:32,060
I read after like because we were waiting a million years for season two

1611
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,180
and then eventually I'm like, fuck it, I'll read a bit of the manga.

1612
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:36,220
And I did. I would I would rather watch.

1613
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:39,820
I would rather read almost any manga than watch the show version.

1614
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:42,340
Yeah, basically unilaterally.

1615
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:44,700
I don't know if there's any exception to that.

1616
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,420
I mean, in terms of a show,

1617
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:49,300
I would say it's only worth watching up until the end of season three,

1618
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:52,500
because that's when they still had their really good animator on board,

1619
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:56,420
the one who is basically who basically fucking carried the whole show.

1620
01:35:57,060 --> 01:36:02,860
By doing like every fucking action scene by being a god tiered piece of shit,

1621
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:04,580
who I love.

1622
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:06,380
And then in season four, they changed studios

1623
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:08,220
and that guy no longer works in the show.

1624
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:12,740
We also did all the best like fighting like moments

1625
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,140
and one punch man as well.

1626
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,140
Yeah.

1627
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:17,700
Right, right, right.

1628
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:19,460
He's a really good animator.

1629
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:22,620
So it's worth seeing at least his scenes because they are really well done.

1630
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:25,420
But beyond that, just read the manga, probably.

1631
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:29,940
The Mr. Boop guy, Alec Robbins, a little while back,

1632
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:33,020
I think he finally got around to watching Mob Psycho

1633
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:35,380
and he said he loved Mob Psycho.

1634
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,060
So he was gushing about it.

1635
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:38,500
It made me want to check it out.

1636
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,420
Oh, you haven't seen Mob Psycho?

1637
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:41,900
No, I have not seen Mob Psycho.

1638
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:44,060
Oh, it's really good.

1639
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:46,340
I only I only hear really good things about it.

1640
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:47,300
Yeah, it's what I did.

1641
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:50,380
I did like one punch man, although I never finished one punch man.

1642
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:54,220
Yeah, but it's in the anime season or the manga.

1643
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:58,300
I I think I read up to the point in the manga

1644
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:00,300
that had been drawn at the time.

1645
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:03,660
I don't know if it if it finished, I assume it did.

1646
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,620
No, the manga is still going, I believe.

1647
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,900
Really? Oh, wow. OK.

1648
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:11,420
Because the web comics still going as well, I think,

1649
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:15,180
because you know how it's as he needed to use two punches at this point.

1650
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,100
With the web, that's the web comic.

1651
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:21,300
Like the originally drawn web comic is still going. Yes, I think so.

1652
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:23,860
What? Yeah, no way.

1653
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:26,380
They're still building up to crazy shit, apparently.

1654
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:29,420
I haven't kept up with it, but I see stuff every now and again

1655
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,700
when talking to people and it seems like it's going strong.

1656
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:32,740
I didn't watch.

1657
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:35,460
I didn't watch the anime because I had read the manga.

1658
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:36,780
I know it looked great.

1659
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:39,260
Everyone praised the animation and it did look pretty good,

1660
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:42,460
but like I don't really care that the manga is also one of the best looking

1661
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:44,420
manga of all time. It does.

1662
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:46,820
It does. Yeah, it really does.

1663
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:50,500
Although I still like the idea of reading the original

1664
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:54,900
web comic comic that drawn by one, even though even though the art is bad.

1665
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,140
Like, I just think that's cool.

1666
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:58,660
Yeah, I don't know.

1667
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:00,300
Yeah, I need to read that.

1668
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,540
That's what makes Mob Psycho work so well is because it's directly

1669
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:08,300
it's directly adapted from his comic as opposed to like a re adaptation

1670
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:10,060
in the manga, like where it's drawn better.

1671
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:13,780
So it's like, yeah, it's these sketchy, simplistic character designs

1672
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:17,460
that are like focused entirely on expression, basically, and not aesthetic

1673
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:21,940
quality and they're animated by the gods at Studio Bones.

1674
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:24,780
And it just makes Mob Psycho one of the best looking things ever.

1675
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:28,740
So they can they can go very simple with the faces and stuff

1676
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:32,060
and then go crazy with like effects and things like that and motion.

1677
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,900
Yeah. So it was it was a manga first.

1678
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,940
Yeah, Mob Psycho was a manga, which was like OK.

1679
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:39,340
I think it was pretty short.

1680
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:42,260
I think it was like 10 or 11 volumes, so it wasn't crazy long.

1681
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,860
But yeah. Yeah.

1682
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,140
I should I should watch it's great.

1683
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:49,340
Season three coming at some point this year, which I think will be the end.

1684
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:52,140
Oh, it's still going. Yeah, I thought it was I thought it was done.

1685
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:55,020
I thought it was just a one season one and then season two came out in like

1686
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:57,060
twenty seventeen, so it's been like years.

1687
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:01,340
Yeah, because I didn't want to read the man because the anime is too good.

1688
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:05,620
It's one of those things where I got caught. Yeah, that's fair.

1689
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:10,340
My friend's been he's been watching one piece of the anime, all of it.

1690
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:11,940
And he's on nice.

1691
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,580
He's on Dressroser at the moment and he's starting to feel it.

1692
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:16,580
He's starting to feel that the slow.

1693
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:22,180
I think that's Dressroser in specific is like terrible.

1694
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:27,260
I think most people stopped at that point and switched to reading the manga.

1695
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:30,540
Yeah, I think I switched to reading the manga a few arcs earlier.

1696
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:32,780
It was I got frustrated.

1697
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:37,540
I got frustrated with the pace even reading the manga in in I think it was

1698
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:41,700
Fishman Island. Yeah, I was like, this is this is going on a really long time.

1699
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:45,460
It was at the time the biggest arc, Fishman Island.

1700
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,100
Yeah, you can say that about every arc at this point.

1701
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:51,380
I got I can't imagine watching longer.

1702
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:54,860
I can't imagine watching all of the show at this point.

1703
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:57,060
I know, I don't know how he did it.

1704
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:00,380
It's got to be like it's it's got to be over a thousand episodes, right?

1705
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:04,020
There's something I've noticed where where people seem to have

1706
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:06,580
like a like a like a charge in them of how much

1707
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:08,140
anime they can watch in their lifetime.

1708
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:09,820
And then like after you've watched a certain amount,

1709
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:12,580
you'd switch to like way shorter stuff or you'd stop watching.

1710
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:16,020
Yeah, because like he's realized that it's just more efficient.

1711
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:17,580
Yeah, it's just the better you see your time.

1712
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:23,620
My friend, his only watched Naruto and Fulmer Alchemist, I think, before One Piece.

1713
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:27,820
He was really not like a big anime guy and it's like, wow, yeah.

1714
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:28,540
How is he doing?

1715
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:34,340
I think it would take one piece as a as like an like if you haven't seen a lot

1716
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:42,020
of anime is very good mostly because of like the really good music that sells

1717
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:46,300
a lot of the epic moments and gets you hyped to watch the next episode every time.

1718
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:48,020
It's very easy to binge.

1719
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:57,060
I remember watching, I think like the anime was like a thriller bark or something beyond that.

1720
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:03,580
I actually can't remember, but like I remember binging all of One Piece and I

1721
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:06,620
got like like a couple of hundred episodes in a week.

1722
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:08,820
Yeah, that's maybe more than that.

1723
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:10,860
And it was like, it was great.

1724
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:11,300
I can't remember.

1725
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:15,940
I like it's it's kind of upsetting though, because it's like the music and some

1726
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:21,620
of the scenes that are depicted in the anime of One Piece are like so like emotional.

1727
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:22,420
Yeah.

1728
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:28,060
And like it being animated and with the sound effects and the voice acting and

1729
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:31,260
then the music, yeah, it adds so much to those moments.

1730
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:34,380
But like, I can't recommend people watch One Piece.

1731
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,780
That's so fucking long.

1732
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:37,380
Yeah, they'd never do it.

1733
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:38,500
Completely agree.

1734
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,340
That's it's it's big.

1735
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:43,460
Binks sake is so much better in in the in the anime.

1736
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:45,980
Yeah, you can hear it when there's a whole musical sequence to it.

1737
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:50,100
But yeah, but you'd have to but you'd have to watch 981 episodes a few years ago.

1738
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,660
Do it when I got into One Piece.

1739
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:55,300
It was like I watched the podcast like live thingy.

1740
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,860
I think it was and like where you talk about how to get into it.

1741
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:00,820
I think briefly and it's like, I'll read the manga and watch all the

1742
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:03,380
bit the moments that you liked the most from the manga on YouTube.

1743
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,740
And I did that and that was pretty much perfect.

1744
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:07,300
Yeah.

1745
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:10,460
And I did some I did some listening to the soundtrack while I read it

1746
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:12,820
because I'm one of those weirdos.

1747
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,940
The the OK.

1748
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:18,820
So it's 981 episodes, which OK.

1749
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:22,940
I guess you you could watch all of the all of that in less time

1750
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:25,820
than I have spent playing Noida in my life.

1751
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:29,060
So yeah, that's you know.

1752
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:32,620
So I guess I guess I I guess you could do it.

1753
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,820
I swear it's more than that.

1754
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:36,180
But I could have sworn they got past episode 1000.

1755
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:39,860
I thought it would be for the bankers gone past that.

1756
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:43,340
Yeah, apparently the way the anime is on episode 1008.

1757
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:46,780
Apparently, according to this totally legal anime watching website.

1758
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,380
Oh, well, I well,

1759
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:50,300
Google says 981.

1760
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:52,620
Well, they're bloody maybe they're maybe they're wrong.

1761
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:55,900
OK, OK, OK, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1762
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:57,900
Oh, oh, here's another interesting detail.

1763
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:00,820
I think he's watching the dub, which is.

1764
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:04,820
I don't think I've ever heard a whole show.

1765
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:07,420
Yeah, they've gotten up to Zoe, I think.

1766
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:09,940
So he's going to have to switch soon.

1767
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:12,180
They they they Zoe is the elephant.

1768
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:13,660
Yeah. Yeah.

1769
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:15,100
Just before Holkig Island.

1770
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:19,980
So I don't think I've ever heard anyone speak about the one piece stuff.

1771
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:25,540
So people don't know that I remember back in the day that the dub was done

1772
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:29,260
by four kids and it was like laughable and that's terrible adaptation.

1773
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:30,340
That's how I found it.

1774
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,780
That's how I that's how I got into one piece was through the four kids dub.

1775
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,860
But then there was another dub.

1776
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,020
Was it the Funimation?

1777
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,260
Yeah, it's Funimation.

1778
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,900
Yeah, and they should be doing the entire show.

1779
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,460
Yes, I did.

1780
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:45,540
Did they I thought they just kind of picked up where four kids left off?

1781
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:48,860
No, they went back and did it later for DVD releases, apparently.

1782
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:50,380
OK, well, that's probably good.

1783
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,420
The whole thing exists.

1784
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:52,860
And I listened to some clips of it.

1785
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:55,340
It's surprisingly pretty good.

1786
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:57,900
Something about Shodan works in dubs for me.

1787
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:00,060
I don't love Luffy's voice, though.

1788
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,700
It's kind of not great, which is kind of a problem.

1789
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:03,580
What does it sound like?

1790
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:05,260
It's the big character.

1791
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:07,660
Did you ever watch Dragon Ball Kai Gip?

1792
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:08,660
Nope.

1793
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:11,780
OK, it's the voice actress for Gohan from that.

1794
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:15,020
And it's Hello and Luffy.

1795
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:17,140
It's a little too scrimmy.

1796
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:19,820
Luffy is scrimmy, but there's lots of deadpan moments.

1797
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:22,740
Yeah. Oh, what do you what do you mean, Zoro?

1798
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:24,860
Yeah, it's a bit like that.

1799
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:29,140
It's a bit full on all the time and just a tiny bit too feminine.

1800
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,700
I'm a pirate. Believe it.

1801
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:35,860
Yeah. Yeah, it's a it's a little Naruto dub kind of.

1802
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:37,780
No, that's a shame.

1803
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:39,100
That's a shame.

1804
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:41,020
But everyone else is pretty solid.

1805
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:43,540
I like I like what I saw.

1806
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:45,740
Usopp is just Krillin, because, of course, he is.

1807
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:48,180
Yeah, I heard they got him.

1808
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:50,700
No, it sounds that makes sense.

1809
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:55,780
I think the thing is in the Japanese dub is is that like

1810
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:58,940
the voice actress plays Luffy.

1811
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:02,660
In a way that he sometimes just sounds like a monkey.

1812
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:05,180
Yeah, like he laughs like a monkey.

1813
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:08,140
He also has a lot of deadpan deliveries, I think, I feel like.

1814
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:10,980
In the anime, which people don't talk about a lot,

1815
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:12,300
but the her voice performance is him.

1816
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,540
There's a lot of moments where she's like, oh, OK, like that.

1817
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:16,180
And I'm like, that works pretty well.

1818
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:18,780
And there's none of that in the dub, which is a problem, in my opinion.

1819
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:22,100
Because Luffy saying things flat because he's a fucking moron is

1820
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:24,180
one of my favorite things about him.

1821
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,700
Next episode of Talking Pirates will talk more.

1822
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:34,420
I haven't watched Pease.

1823
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:36,020
I haven't. What am I?

1824
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:37,740
What am I? I'm still I'm still at.

1825
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:41,260
I'm still at in one piece, the place where I was

1826
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:46,860
when I almost caught up at Radcon 4, which is I'm past Whole Cake.

1827
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:50,500
Oh, hey, I had just gotten to Wano.

1828
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:54,300
Yeah. So you went through the the reverie stuff,

1829
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:56,340
which is like a few chapters in between.

1830
01:45:56,340 --> 01:46:01,260
Wait, that's when all the kings and queens come together and chat.

1831
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:04,980
Yes, Rebecca and VV together, and they look exactly the same.

1832
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:10,340
Hmm, because they have the default female character of Ark model.

1833
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,940
They're Nami types.

1834
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:16,500
Have I shown you my one piece girl types chart that I made?

1835
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:19,340
I know, maybe. Let me see this.

1836
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:20,340
This might be funny to post.

1837
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,980
I mean, when you say chart, you mean like two?

1838
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,180
Like they're either Nami.

1839
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:28,300
No, they're ridiculously exaggerated.

1840
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:31,020
There's Nami types, there's Robin types, and there's aberrants.

1841
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:34,100
And here is it. Here is the fact that I made.

1842
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:37,620
Of these, and then there's subtypes within them.

1843
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:43,900
Almost all Robin are in the lip subtype.

1844
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:48,140
Interesting fact, almost all Robin subtypes are in the lip subtype.

1845
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:51,420
I can't remember why I made this.

1846
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,500
I think I was just very tired and thinking about it.

1847
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,700
And I was like, yeah, why not?

1848
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:57,500
Ugly subtype.

1849
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,740
OK, OK.

1850
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:01,780
My criticism is the only difference

1851
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:04,380
between Nami types and Robin types is the hair color.

1852
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:08,060
Yeah, looking at it now.

1853
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:11,140
There's a there's a difference with the eyes as well.

1854
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:13,540
The eyes are a lot rounder on Nami types, I feel like.

1855
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:18,100
In my opinion, maybe on some of these.

1856
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:22,140
They usually like Robin and Hancock have like slanted

1857
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:24,060
downwards eyes on the outside.

1858
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:25,500
It's like they I'll be honest.

1859
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,820
I didn't know that Robin and Hancock were different characters.

1860
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:30,380
I know. I know what you mean.

1861
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:32,540
Until I see the names, like I forget.

1862
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:34,100
I really don't.

1863
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:38,260
OK, I can tell I'm only three minutes in to Nate's lecture.

1864
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:39,740
Wait.

1865
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:42,220
I OK, I'm trying to identify.

1866
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:44,700
OK, there's some.

1867
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,540
There's two that you won't know because of one, three.

1868
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:52,180
OK, several of these I genuinely can't tell aren't just Robin and Nami.

1869
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:54,620
OK, OK, I see Shira Hoshi.

1870
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:57,420
I don't know the girl with the horns.

1871
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:00,100
I know the bunny girl.

1872
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:02,140
Who I don't know who that chef is.

1873
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,100
I guess she's just some rando from a whole cake.

1874
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:05,540
Is that that's pudding?

1875
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:06,900
Yeah, that's pudding.

1876
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,460
Why is she dressed like a chef?

1877
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,540
Because it's when they make the wedding cake.

1878
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:14,060
Oh, because she goes crazy.

1879
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:15,660
Is that a is that a mermaid that last

1880
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,780
is an unusual outfit for her?

1881
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:19,540
That's camey the mermaid.

1882
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:20,900
Yeah. OK.

1883
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:21,740
And then they're OK.

1884
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:23,260
I see in the Robin types,

1885
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:26,740
I see there's the the smokers assistant lady.

1886
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:28,180
Tashige. Yeah.

1887
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:29,820
Tashige, Boa Hancock.

1888
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:32,620
I don't know the next two.

1889
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:35,700
And those are those different characters, Ben, those two there.

1890
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:39,980
Yeah, are they? OK.

1891
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:42,540
And then the one with the mask is one of the

1892
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:44,020
Oh, fuck, what are they called?

1893
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:46,140
The ones that they fight in the dress.

1894
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:47,900
Rosa in Alibaba.

1895
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:51,340
No, in alabaster. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1896
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:53,420
Not to press Rosa, Ben.

1897
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:56,100
Really? She's like she baby five.

1898
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:56,820
Is that her name?

1899
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:57,740
That's baby five.

1900
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:59,740
She's the one that turns her body into guns.

1901
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:03,500
And she's she has a devil fruit turns her body into weapons.

1902
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:05,980
Yeah, OK. What was I what am I thinking of?

1903
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:08,500
What's the what's Crocodile's organization called?

1904
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:11,780
But the Baroque works.

1905
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:13,700
Yeah, I thought she was a Baroque works girl.

1906
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:14,700
But no, OK.

1907
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,180
She's yeah, you're right.

1908
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:18,140
And then the last one.

1909
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:19,220
Oh, the last one is that one that

1910
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:22,380
Sanji like falls in love with in dress Rosa.

1911
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:23,180
What's your name?

1912
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:25,660
Violet. Yes.

1913
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:27,580
Yeah.

1914
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:28,980
Best, best, best one.

1915
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:30,780
Best one piece girl is Perona.

1916
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:31,500
There's no.

1917
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,740
I would have thought Perona would be yours.

1918
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:35,180
Yeah, well, it's true.

1919
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:37,460
It's true. She's one of the funny eyeballs.

1920
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:41,020
But the round the really round.

1921
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:43,020
Yeah, that's that's Perona with the big hat.

1922
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,460
That's Perona. Yeah, pink hair.

1923
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:46,860
The one the one to her right is my favorite.

1924
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:49,140
Sanderson. Oh, Sandersonia.

1925
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,180
Yeah, I drew her.

1926
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:52,820
I just really like her wide face.

1927
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:56,020
Yeah, that makes that makes sense.

1928
01:49:56,060 --> 01:49:57,340
That makes total sense.

1929
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:58,500
Sandersonia.

1930
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,380
I really, I really like this.

1931
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:05,060
This this Ukiyo a like side view Japanese looking one.

1932
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:06,700
She's one of my favorite designs.

1933
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:07,820
She's awesome.

1934
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:09,620
Actually, I really I also really like

1935
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:12,220
Shirahoshi's mom.

1936
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:13,020
What's what's her name?

1937
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:16,300
Otohime. Yeah, I think she's one of my favorite signs.

1938
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:18,420
Otohime is is one of the best ones.

1939
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:20,540
Yeah. Yeah.

1940
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:22,060
So Yoda can do it sometimes.

1941
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:23,940
He just likes to default to the simple ones.

1942
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:26,220
He just he just likes drawing

1943
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:31,980
like this a circle head with facial features that are the same.

1944
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:34,980
These ones that are different are actually they're actually good.

1945
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:37,660
Who's this one with the blonde hair in the glasses?

1946
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:39,020
Is that a CP nine?

1947
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:40,860
Yeah, no, that's yeah.

1948
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:42,460
That's Khalifa.

1949
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:44,340
Yeah, I think the name's not sheep.

1950
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:47,100
The the the the bubble, the soap one.

1951
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:48,460
Yes, what not me?

1952
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:50,100
Yes, yes, I remember.

1953
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:55,100
I don't recognize this like snake looking one,

1954
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:56,020
even with the chopsticks.

1955
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:57,220
Is she a wano girl?

1956
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:58,780
No, she's from Fishman Island.

1957
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,380
She's the prophecy lady.

1958
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:01,380
Oh, yeah.

1959
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:02,740
Yeah, I'm Shirley.

1960
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,100
Yeah, yeah, Charlie.

1961
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:05,980
Yeah, OK, I remember.

1962
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:08,420
OK, well, I kind of know that stuff.

1963
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:11,140
You know most of them, Ben.

1964
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,980
Fine, I know most of them.

1965
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:14,060
That's pretty good.

1966
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:18,700
Rebecca right there looks like so non-distinct,

1967
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:20,900
even amongst the nami types.

1968
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:25,820
Yeah, Otohime would be played by Helena Bonham Carter.

1969
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:27,820
Yes, true.

1970
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,820
Yeah.

1971
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:30,780
Actually, you know what?

1972
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:31,940
That makes me like her less.

1973
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:33,100
No, Charlie would be.

1974
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:35,100
Charlie would be.

1975
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:39,700
Oh, is it because like Otohime has like mascara or like eyeshadow?

1976
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:43,100
I think it's it's like kind of kind of her like rectangular head.

1977
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:47,740
And big lips and big lips and Otohime.

1978
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:51,300
Well, it's not rectangular, but she's like a wide set head and wide jaw.

1979
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:52,860
I don't know.

1980
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:53,580
What a good design.

1981
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:55,500
Cute, cute, so cute.

1982
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:58,660
I love God bless.

1983
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:00,220
God bless.

1984
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:01,540
Oblivion for read one piece.

1985
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:02,620
You'll like it.

1986
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:03,940
God bless everyone.

1987
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:06,740
Never have something else to do first.

1988
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:09,860
No, Bummer.

1989
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:13,300
You're missing out on some very funny character designs.

1990
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,700
Very funny character designs.

1991
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:16,740
I still gotta finish watching Detective Conan

1992
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:19,900
and then that's like a number of five hundred episodes

1993
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,860
and I've already watched five hundred episodes.

1994
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:25,060
How could you not get tired of Detective Conan?

1995
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:26,380
I like it.

1996
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:27,740
That's the it's it's detected.

1997
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:31,100
And I guess it's like if you like detective little mini stories

1998
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:32,540
of one after the other.

1999
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:36,500
The mystery is a lot of them are really, really, really, really fucking clever.

2000
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:38,500
And I'm like, damn, I want to commit a murder now.

2001
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:43,220
I read like a bunch of like a hundred or so a bunch of chapters.

2002
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:45,260
I don't know how many chapters I read, but I was like,

2003
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:49,140
OK, you you grabbed me with this initial mystery

2004
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:53,420
and I enjoy these side mysteries that are just sort of like Detective Conan

2005
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:57,380
solving a mystery, but I don't like that you've decided to pretend

2006
01:52:57,380 --> 01:53:00,260
to string me along with an answer to this bigger mystery about

2007
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:03,180
who's behind turning him into a small child,

2008
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:05,260
because I know you're never going to do it.

2009
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:07,660
You just fucking lied to me and I got a mad.

2010
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:11,940
No, this this this being this being some like big ass fucking things

2011
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:14,820
that have happened that just really spread out.

2012
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:18,860
And there's wait, like recently, well, no, like around episode

2013
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:24,300
five hundred of the show, at least, and I think around episode 128.

2014
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:27,460
There's been a few points where like they've revealed some big stuff

2015
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,620
and there's been big plot things.

2016
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:31,180
There is a lot of filler and a lot of the filler is good,

2017
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:32,300
but some of it is kind of boring.

2018
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:37,380
I feel like like Detective Conan would be more enjoyable

2019
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:43,660
if it was just this is a young kid who's really good at detective work.

2020
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:50,540
And here's like a serial of him doing detectives things.

2021
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:54,340
And every week, there's a new every episode, there's a new mystery.

2022
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:57,020
Oh, and it's fun.

2023
01:53:57,020 --> 01:53:58,340
Simsie, who is this?

2024
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:01,380
It's Charlotte Amanda from One Piece, one of Big Mom's daughters

2025
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:03,100
who doesn't really do anything, but she's great.

2026
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:04,500
She. Yeah, she's got the best.

2027
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,940
Like I got a huge part giraffe.

2028
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:08,900
You is that you're drawing Simsie?

2029
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:09,940
Yes.

2030
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:11,940
She drew her hat way too small.

2031
01:54:11,940 --> 01:54:15,740
That hat is like, I know.

2032
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:17,620
The next one is not long enough.

2033
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:18,820
What's her name?

2034
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:24,220
Amanda, like Amanda, not the best design.

2035
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:25,660
Yeah.

2036
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:28,220
She literal T pose woman.

2037
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:31,180
Charlotte Amanda, Amanda, I see face.

2038
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:33,260
Oh, my God.

2039
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:35,500
It's such a funny image.

2040
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:39,740
She looks way better in your drawing in real life.

2041
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:41,300
No, she's a lamp face.

2042
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:41,940
Oh, you know what?

2043
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:44,180
Actually, she's got like a bowling pin head.

2044
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:47,700
Actually, when you see her, her like full body.

2045
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:49,380
OK, this is this.

2046
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:51,940
She looks cool here.

2047
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:54,500
Oh, you already are.

2048
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,300
You already posted it.

2049
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:57,900
OK, yeah, she looks.

2050
01:54:57,900 --> 01:54:58,940
OK, I get it.

2051
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:00,260
I get it. She's sick.

2052
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:01,380
Shut up.

2053
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:02,340
What's this? OK.

2054
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:03,340
All right. All right.

2055
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:04,100
This is awesome.

2056
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:06,100
All right. One piece kind of good.

2057
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:09,420
Does she really?

2058
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:11,020
She doesn't like fight or anything?

2059
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:15,460
No, she she makes sticky and then steal something out of her tits.

2060
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:16,740
I remember that.

2061
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:20,540
There was like a there's so many good character designs.

2062
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:22,540
There's not time for them all to do some cool.

2063
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:26,020
Yeah. And in whole cake, I remember, there was like, here's.

2064
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:31,300
Well, here's a big mom's crew.

2065
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:34,900
There's so many people in it, and it's an unwinnable situation.

2066
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:36,340
We have to get the fuck out of here.

2067
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:37,100
So they couldn't.

2068
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:40,060
It wasn't really like a let's defeat all of these people in turn.

2069
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:41,660
It's here's too many people.

2070
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:43,260
We got it. We can't defeat them.

2071
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:45,300
So they didn't actually get to do much.

2072
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,020
And they're all perfect.

2073
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:49,100
They just got to stand there and look cool.

2074
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,260
And it's scary.

2075
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:54,180
They're just flexing a whole room of like any one of these could be

2076
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:56,740
look could have like a whole like side arc devoted to them

2077
01:55:56,740 --> 01:55:58,860
if I felt like it, but I don't fuck it.

2078
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:00,340
Let's move on.

2079
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:02,860
It's such wrong.

2080
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:04,300
What a good design.

2081
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:05,460
There's just too many.

2082
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:08,540
That's just like how he draws like fat ladies.

2083
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:10,860
I don't know why they're really funny.

2084
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:12,860
They are funny.

2085
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:16,140
That's funny.

2086
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:19,660
These are this makes me this this makes me happy.

2087
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:22,180
This brings us this brings a smile to my face.

2088
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:23,700
This whole.

2089
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:26,220
Oh, it's like about one face.

2090
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:30,420
A smoothie.

2091
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:32,580
Smoothies pretty good. Yeah.

2092
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:35,420
I tried drawing once it was pretty bad.

2093
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:37,820
Oh, in the anime, she.

2094
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:40,380
All right, this image is funny.

2095
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:43,300
But I remember in the.

2096
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:46,140
In the manga, those are like when she was introduced.

2097
01:56:48,700 --> 01:56:51,500
There was like a picture of her sitting down.

2098
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:54,340
I remember her and like the angle of it was like really cool.

2099
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:58,060
But when she stands up, her legs are a little little ridiculous looking.

2100
01:56:58,300 --> 01:56:59,060
Hang on.

2101
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:01,740
I found the panel, I think.

2102
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:02,900
Oh, I'm such a good.

2103
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:03,940
Where are her knees?

2104
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:05,940
Are they like in the little bulby part or the?

2105
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:07,260
Yeah, they're just like right at the.

2106
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:10,900
Yeah, look at them legs and look at that that wine glass.

2107
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:11,860
That's what I love.

2108
01:57:11,860 --> 01:57:13,260
That's a big wine.

2109
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:15,580
Swishin, it's swishin.

2110
01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:16,180
Oh, yeah.

2111
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:20,300
You were earlier with your assumption that like any one of the

2112
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:23,860
the Charlotte family could be the main villain of another one piece arc.

2113
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:27,340
Like, in terms of how well designed they are, they're great.

2114
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:28,620
They're so good.

2115
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:30,980
Yeah, they're awesome.

2116
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:34,540
Fuck yeah, they better come back in spades.

2117
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:36,620
There's just not time.

2118
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:40,020
But I think there's time for at least like smoothie to do something.

2119
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:42,140
At least two of them have come back.

2120
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:45,220
She's like third or fourth in command or something.

2121
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:48,020
Quite high up there.

2122
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:49,580
She's the I.

2123
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:53,580
I feel like at some point we tipped over into like a critical.

2124
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:59,620
Zone like a tipping point was reached where in like new like awesome characters

2125
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:02,860
or just like every chapter, there's like a big splash page of like,

2126
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:06,340
oh, here's a new guy with the coolest character design you've ever seen.

2127
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:12,740
Yeah, it's it's it's it has to happen because like the idea that a new crew

2128
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:17,260
that you've heard about and that is like unparalleled power in the seas

2129
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:22,700
would not have a wacky large crew like other smaller crews that you like

2130
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:25,220
the one the store have parts have defeated before.

2131
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:28,900
They've got to have a big crazy crew with the kooky characters.

2132
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,780
Just they can't have just jobbers.

2133
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:32,260
Yeah, you're you're right.

2134
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:35,940
Think think back to like what like the pirate crew has looked like

2135
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:40,180
with like back when like Alveda and buggy and like East Blue,

2136
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:43,740
like the very like guys with like striped shirts and glasses.

2137
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:47,900
Like they had like maybe maybe five named characters

2138
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:50,340
that had their abilities and they were like in command.

2139
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:52,380
And then there was the the crewmates,

2140
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:55,420
just the people who would roll barrels and yell.

2141
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:58,580
Yeah, just some dudes, just some dudes.

2142
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:02,620
They even had to do that to the Marines,

2143
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:06,060
because like Marines in the New World, they can't just be like

2144
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:09,500
skinny twinks with a with a rifle.

2145
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:13,380
They've got to be like meaty gorilla brutes with with all of these

2146
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:16,900
like like bazookas and like double bazookas in each hand.

2147
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:19,780
It's like they've got to they've got to wear like big fur collars

2148
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:23,140
and like, you know, have like big, I don't know,

2149
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:26,380
gold boots or whatever and like crazy facial hair.

2150
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:27,700
We've got to have something.

2151
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:29,500
We've gone from like buggy, second in command,

2152
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:33,820
being just a guy who tames lions to like an entire family

2153
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:37,780
of crazy devil fruit piracy is that all themed around sweets

2154
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:41,140
and very sizes. Oh, my God.

2155
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:42,380
It's inspiring.

2156
01:59:42,380 --> 01:59:43,700
And I is.

2157
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:45,660
Is that that guy in the far right?

2158
01:59:45,660 --> 01:59:49,340
Is he is he in one of the crews?

2159
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:54,740
Well, the egg man Tom ago, that's Tom ago from from a

2160
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:57,900
he's in like the Beast Pirates, right?

2161
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,020
No, I don't think so.

2162
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:01,220
No, he's a big mum pirate guy.

2163
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:02,540
OK, but who am I thinking of?

2164
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:05,940
There's there's another egg guy named Tom ago who's in the Beast Pirates.

2165
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:09,740
Is there? Yeah.

2166
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:11,860
Are you sure you're not confusing him?

2167
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:15,060
Because you meet we meet him before we go to Whole Cake is

2168
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,460
we meet him in Fishman Island.

2169
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:18,420
He and Peckons are just hanging out.

2170
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:22,980
And they're thinking of an egg shaped man from one

2171
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:25,020
local queen. No.

2172
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:27,860
OK, this is no, this is the guy.

2173
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:29,660
This is Tom ago.

2174
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:31,700
Oh, I guess he is part of the big mom.

2175
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:35,100
Oh, I thought I thought he was in the Beast Men.

2176
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:38,460
No. Oh, well, well, well, you misunderstood.

2177
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:40,940
I guess I misunderstood.

2178
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:45,140
Bomber. Well, actually, it's fine.

2179
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:46,420
It's fine either way.

2180
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:47,860
This is wacky.

2181
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:48,740
What's wrong with living full?

2182
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:50,580
That's why it's wacky.

2183
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:53,700
There is an unlimited wank.

2184
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:58,860
Yeah, no, but it's wacky, but also it'll make you cry your fucking little nuts off.

2185
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:00,580
This is good.

2186
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:02,740
It's it's it's the my favorite thing.

2187
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:07,220
It's like he he has these ideas for these designs.

2188
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:12,260
They're so simplistic in in aspects of like,

2189
02:01:12,380 --> 02:01:14,980
what if there was a guy who was just a circle?

2190
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:17,500
You know, like that that's the the character design.

2191
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:19,620
But then on top of that, he has details.

2192
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:21,940
He gives them personality quirks.

2193
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:24,620
And then, you know, someone like

2194
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:29,460
Waltz's face in Dressroser, famous example.

2195
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:32,740
For baby boy. Oh, yeah.

2196
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:34,740
The baby boy.

2197
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:38,140
He's a boy. He's a man who's like a cool macho man.

2198
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:39,340
I don't remember his name.

2199
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:41,940
And he yeah, Senor Pink. Oh, Senor Pink.

2200
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:42,700
Yeah. Yes.

2201
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:46,260
Senor Pink, he dresses up as a big baby with a bonnet guy.

2202
02:01:46,620 --> 02:01:49,340
He's like a cool guy, like mafia boss with like a

2203
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:52,580
cadre, he's like a harem of like hot girls that are just like

2204
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,780
following around everywhere.

2205
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:56,380
Rips girls bras off and wipes his face with them when he gets sweaty.

2206
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:58,140
And then just throwing away.

2207
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:01,980
Yeah, he's like it's like a complete insane parody of like,

2208
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:03,900
what the fuck's kind of guy is this?

2209
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:08,940
And then because of that, it's the most funny thing to do would be

2210
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:13,300
to give him a heart wrenching backstory to explain why he dresses up in a diaper.

2211
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:19,060
And it's like, it's his, it's because his wife,

2212
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:21,980
I can't remember the exact details, but his wife was like dying

2213
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:28,820
and their their child had died and he dressed up as a baby

2214
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:34,300
to pretend to be their dead child to cheer her up in her final days.

2215
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:38,260
Yeah, his wife went crazy and couldn't like emote anymore

2216
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:41,980
unless he dressed up as a big baby and reminded them of the kid.

2217
02:02:42,700 --> 02:02:47,300
Yeah, and so she she she she managed to smile again

2218
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:50,060
because he dressed like a baby, but then eventually she died as well.

2219
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:53,140
And so to honor her memory, he still dresses as a baby.

2220
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:55,740
And it's like it's so heartfelt.

2221
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:58,020
Everyone cries. It's great.

2222
02:02:58,020 --> 02:03:00,820
I literally like I was talking about one piece of my friend the other day

2223
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:03,060
and he was like, oh, this in your pink guy seems kind of lame.

2224
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:04,740
And I said to him, I was like, that's legit.

2225
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:06,260
One of the best characters in one piece.

2226
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:09,620
And then two weeks later, when he'd seen his backstory, he came back to

2227
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:12,500
like, you're completely right.

2228
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,140
It's just that's that's the vibe.

2229
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:17,260
It's like, what's the most ridiculous thing we could do

2230
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:19,500
and do it as seriously as possible?

2231
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:23,100
Do it seriously and just good as possible. Yeah.

2232
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:26,620
Well, I'm feeling overwhelmed by my feel

2233
02:03:26,620 --> 02:03:29,380
and by my by good one piece feelings.

2234
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:30,860
I'm just staring at the size

2235
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:33,300
comparison chart and thinking about attack on Titan.

2236
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:34,860
Yeah.

2237
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:39,620
I'm thinking of them in their little puppet walking animations.

2238
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:41,820
Yes. Why is that fat woman so big?

2239
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:42,700
Why is she big?

2240
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:43,900
That's big mom.

2241
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:45,380
She's just big.

2242
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:47,700
She's that big because she's big mom.

2243
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:49,020
You idiot.

2244
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:50,020
Why else?

2245
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:53,540
Don't call her that fat woman.

2246
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:55,060
That's big mom.

2247
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:57,260
That's a young girl, big mom.

2248
02:03:57,260 --> 02:03:58,580
You big mom.

2249
02:03:58,580 --> 02:03:59,700
Don't you know what that means?

2250
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:00,700
You're full.

2251
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:02,820
I'm a fool.

2252
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:04,780
I mean, Katakuri is so fucking big.

2253
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:06,220
Katakuri is that big.

2254
02:04:06,220 --> 02:04:08,380
Yeah. Katakuri is that big.

2255
02:04:08,380 --> 02:04:10,220
You don't realize it when you're like reading it.

2256
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:14,020
But when I know, like, I thought he was like, you know, tall.

2257
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:16,500
I thought he was maybe like twice as tall as Luffy.

2258
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:19,300
No, I don't realize he's like 40 feet tall.

2259
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:24,260
It's because Luffy gets really big when he's in that form that he uses.

2260
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:28,940
If he gets at least twice as big when he's in Snake Man, I think it's called.

2261
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:31,780
But Katakuri is a big boy.

2262
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:35,860
All right, that kind of that kind of makes up that kind of explains it.

2263
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:37,740
Yeah. Oh, and there's the panel.

2264
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:41,100
It's hard to tell in some of the the manga panels, because like in the big

2265
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:43,740
mom parts, there are quite a lot of people who are just very big.

2266
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:49,860
It's like sometimes it doesn't you can't really get a sense of how big he is

2267
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:53,660
in comparison to like the generic human actual size.

2268
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:55,220
It's almost where Luffy is.

2269
02:04:55,220 --> 02:05:01,500
It almost feels like Oda just wanted to like cram so much personality

2270
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:04,860
into all of his side characters that you just had to keep making them bigger

2271
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:06,940
and bigger because it just wouldn't fit otherwise.

2272
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:08,620
So true. Yeah.

2273
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:13,620
It's because because they have to they wouldn't fit on the screen.

2274
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:16,340
They wouldn't fit in the panel because they have to stand up behind

2275
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:17,940
the other guys so you can see them all.

2276
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:20,980
Yeah, they said he needs to get progressively bigger.

2277
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:23,580
Yeah, depending on how important they are.

2278
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:25,940
I almost think that like that might be it.

2279
02:05:25,940 --> 02:05:29,700
Like he just wants to like have like big people so you can see them all in a crowd

2280
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:30,620
shot. I don't know.

2281
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:33,060
That's why Franky got big.

2282
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:37,180
Yeah. Yeah, pretty sure that's why you did it is just so that you could

2283
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:40,580
add Frankie in the background of Straw Hat panels and still see him.

2284
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:43,020
Oh, you mean after you mean after the timescale?

2285
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:44,780
Yeah, because you know, you got like four times bigger.

2286
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:48,100
I'm pretty sure you did that intentionally so that Franky could be the background one.

2287
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,660
Well, good. It was the right move.

2288
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:52,620
It works, but he's still he's still good.

2289
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:54,500
He's he's all right.

2290
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:58,420
I still prefer the Popeye arms to what he has now.

2291
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:00,540
Yeah, I can see both.

2292
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:02,140
It's a little busy right now.

2293
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:05,820
It's it's the only thing he keeps getting busy and busier.

2294
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:10,980
I mean, I mean, yeah, they all do.

2295
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,780
Like Brooks outfits and stuff.

2296
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:15,780
Yeah, that's true.

2297
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:17,180
They did like it's not so bad.

2298
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:19,980
He's he wore that feather boa and that crown for a while,

2299
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:22,340
but he hasn't done it in Wano, I don't think.

2300
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:25,780
No, in Wano, he was in the ghost disguise most of the time.

2301
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:28,540
It's good.

2302
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:30,420
God, one piece kind of cool.

2303
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:31,820
No, I can't know what I know.

2304
02:06:31,820 --> 02:06:32,820
I want to catch up.

2305
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:36,100
Yeah, so I'm suddenly feeling inspired to catch up.

2306
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:37,420
No, I can't know.

2307
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:38,940
I know I got to draw.

2308
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:40,300
I got to draw my fucking comic.

2309
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:43,780
You got to draw my stupid ass comic and then read and then maybe read.

2310
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:47,300
Four times a night before bed.

2311
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:49,660
No, I want to read it all at once.

2312
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:51,540
OK, there's no point.

2313
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:55,180
But then you can talk about it weekly in a segment on maybe on

2314
02:06:55,260 --> 02:07:00,380
twitch.tv or on this podcast, I guess I could do that.

2315
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:05,540
I don't know. I'll do it.

2316
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:08,260
I'll do it. I'll I'll do it.

2317
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:11,180
It worked. I finally we finally convinced them.

2318
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:12,900
We finally did it.

2319
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:15,740
Maybe as soon as you catch up, you'll fall off right again.

2320
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:20,340
Well, probably, yeah, conversing pirates.

2321
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:23,260
Yeah, we'll call it one piece of my mind.

2322
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:24,020
I can't remember who said that.

2323
02:07:24,020 --> 02:07:24,940
I think it was crack.

2324
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:26,980
I think it was crack is one piece of my mind.

2325
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:28,420
Terrible, terrible title.

2326
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:29,980
I hate it. No, that's perfect.

2327
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:31,980
We've got to use it. I don't like it.

2328
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:38,340
Well, I have I have nothing else to say about one piece other than that.

2329
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:39,820
It's good and I like it.

2330
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:41,260
Oh, OK.

2331
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:44,340
Now I see this final panel of Katakuri on the holy shit.

2332
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:45,860
He's a big boy.

2333
02:07:45,860 --> 02:07:46,900
That's fucked.

2334
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:47,900
He's a big gentleman.

2335
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:51,420
So you can you can live in his shoe than many of the Titans.

2336
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:53,020
He genuinely is.

2337
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:55,140
Yeah, OK.

2338
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:55,820
You have a band.

2339
02:07:55,820 --> 02:07:57,620
It makes him look strong.

2340
02:07:57,620 --> 02:07:59,380
I it sure does.

2341
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:03,060
It sure does.

2342
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:05,340
And it makes it funny when you find that he likes doughnuts.

2343
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:08,460
I'll give you a toilet.

2344
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:10,260
They just use the ocean.

2345
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:12,620
They've got all of these different sized people.

2346
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:14,820
And when they go to the bathroom, we never see that.

2347
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:18,260
Everybody has like six or seven different rooms.

2348
02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:20,020
That's why the Seekings are so pissed off

2349
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:22,340
is because they're constantly eating people shit.

2350
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:23,980
And they're not happy about it.

2351
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,780
People just keep getting bigger and bigger.

2352
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:28,740
And the poo just just keeps being more and more poo in the ocean.

2353
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:30,580
And they can't damn.

2354
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:32,740
They can't fucking take it anymore.

2355
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:35,860
So they eat people.

2356
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:37,260
Yeah, yeah.

2357
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,820
People have to decide them, though.

2358
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:41,020
It doesn't really solve the problem, does it?

2359
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:42,900
All right, you got to you got to cut it off at the source.

2360
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:46,060
It's worth eating a little bit of poo now to avoid eating more.

2361
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:52,220
It's a it's a simple cost-benefit analysis

2362
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:54,580
that the Seekings has performed to decide that eating people

2363
02:08:54,580 --> 02:08:56,660
poo and all is the is the best solution.

2364
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:01,460
Yeah, yeah.

2365
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:03,660
Imagine imagine being an animal

2366
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:05,740
and killing and eating another animal and you're eating them

2367
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:07,780
and you take a big bite of their large intestine

2368
02:09:07,780 --> 02:09:10,660
and just poo just starts flowing out just into your mouth.

2369
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:13,540
Delicious, my favorite.

2370
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:17,380
Do do they just not I do they just not eat that part?

2371
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:21,420
I think they mostly don't care or they eat around it.

2372
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:24,740
I mean, dogs eat shit sometimes because they're really idiots.

2373
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:28,420
Yeah, they just see shit and they're like, oh, look, that's something.

2374
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:31,540
It's something. I got to eat it.

2375
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:34,940
I feel like maybe do you do like lie like a lion kills a gazelle?

2376
02:09:34,940 --> 02:09:38,700
I can't imagine that like one like like all the lion pack

2377
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:41,220
like jump on the gazelle and they're all tearing bits off of it.

2378
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:43,220
And then one lion is like, oh, well,

2379
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:45,180
I guess my part is the large intestine.

2380
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:46,380
Oh, it's got poo in it, though.

2381
02:09:46,380 --> 02:09:49,820
But I just got to eat it while you shit yourself when you die as a courtesy.

2382
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:53,740
Get it out of there.

2383
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:56,340
I hope that's that's literally what happens.

2384
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:58,140
It's a nature solution.

2385
02:09:58,140 --> 02:09:59,540
I don't do, dude.

2386
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:02,700
Now I believe Jesus absolutely is correct.

2387
02:10:03,940 --> 02:10:05,340
Why? Why?

2388
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:06,340
Because he's a lion.

2389
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:08,620
And he eats people.

2390
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:11,380
From now, I can't think of an evolutionary benefit to shitting

2391
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:13,780
when you die other than to make other animals happy,

2392
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:15,740
which means it had just like this.

2393
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:16,740
I am is correct.

2394
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:17,820
That's for proof.

2395
02:10:17,820 --> 02:10:19,740
That's what Jesus said of the Sermon on the Mount.

2396
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:21,060
He said, blessed are the meek.

2397
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:24,460
And also, you know, it's kind of good that when you shit yourself in the back.

2398
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:28,900
They left that pile because everyone was like, that was a weird.

2399
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:31,060
I don't know what I'm going to write that one down.

2400
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:36,860
Lost the time, but it did happen.

2401
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:40,140
It got it got everyone on his side, but they all agreed like,

2402
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:42,740
you know, future generations probably don't need to hear that.

2403
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:44,740
They hated him for he spoke the truth.

2404
02:10:44,740 --> 02:10:47,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2405
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:49,540
Thank you Jesus.

2406
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:52,300
Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.

2407
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:54,300
That's all for me.

2408
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:58,860
That's all for that's all for me, too.

2409
02:10:58,860 --> 02:11:02,180
I don't know anything else.

2410
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:04,340
We could we could start voicemails now.

2411
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:06,300
We have a lot of voicemails, actually.

2412
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:08,300
Like we should probably get through them

2413
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:10,860
because I don't think I can stick around too much longer.

2414
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:13,980
OK, sure. Well, let's let's let's start that out.

2415
02:11:13,980 --> 02:11:17,260
We'll try and I don't know why we got so many.

2416
02:11:17,380 --> 02:11:18,500
It's crazy.

2417
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:20,620
Was it the big stuff?

2418
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:22,900
People want to talk about that, I guess.

2419
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:26,660
Uh, it doesn't really look like it.

2420
02:11:28,020 --> 02:11:32,180
Maybe maybe we wanted to the stuff happened that I didn't hear about.

2421
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:35,020
A little bit, a little bit.

2422
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:36,660
Nothing interesting, nothing.

2423
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:38,260
Because it's big stuff.

2424
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:40,020
Yeah, I mean, true.

2425
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:41,820
OK, OK, so here we got one.

2426
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:45,500
This is called this is called Red Five Rainbow.

2427
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:49,420
Put it in the general.

2428
02:11:49,420 --> 02:11:52,860
There we go. OK, three, two, one, go.

2429
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:57,140
One of my classes this semester requires me to use Proctorio

2430
02:11:57,140 --> 02:11:58,900
whenever I take an exam.

2431
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:00,860
And what that is is basically a software

2432
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:04,220
that records me through my webcam and records my computer screen

2433
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:05,620
the whole time I'm taking the exam.

2434
02:12:05,620 --> 02:12:07,820
And it has an AI to analyze

2435
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:11,220
whenever I'm doing suspicious behavior to make sure that I don't cheat.

2436
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:14,340
Can we talk about how that's fucked?

2437
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:16,060
Suspicious behavior.

2438
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:18,260
That's literally 1984.

2439
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:21,060
Probably like looking.

2440
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:23,860
Probably like looking, looking like off your desk or something,

2441
02:12:23,980 --> 02:12:26,660
looking at your phone.

2442
02:12:26,660 --> 02:12:28,420
Dude, yeah, that's fucked.

2443
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:30,420
I had to use someone.

2444
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:32,900
I forget who they are, but they worked from home

2445
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:35,020
and they had to have a software installed.

2446
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:38,380
They had to like basically have like OBS or something

2447
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:42,860
like recording their entire screen like one of my old one of my old roommates

2448
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:45,260
had he would have to take tests online.

2449
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:47,660
And yeah, there would be a Proctorio that would be like watching him

2450
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:51,140
through a webcam to make sure he wasn't doing any weird shit.

2451
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:52,460
You know, this wasn't even test.

2452
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:56,140
This was like a worker like at a company who was working from home

2453
02:12:56,140 --> 02:12:57,980
and they recorded their screen out eight hours a day

2454
02:12:57,980 --> 02:13:00,620
just to make sure that they weren't slacking off.

2455
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:03,340
Jesus, my friend had that where

2456
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:05,940
but they would also check his like internet history on the laptop

2457
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:07,660
because he had to work from this laptop from home

2458
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:09,300
and then turn it in every now and then.

2459
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,620
Because I think he did like online programming and stuff.

2460
02:13:11,860 --> 02:13:14,500
And he specifically, I specifically know this

2461
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:17,740
because he was watching Gundam and he could only watch the ones that were on YouTube

2462
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:20,900
because he couldn't go on any piracy websites or anything.

2463
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:23,980
So we have to wait fucking months for it to come out

2464
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:25,580
on some weird streaming service here.

2465
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:26,980
And it was very strange.

2466
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:29,220
I saw that I use VPN.

2467
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:33,540
I saw that the SATs are going like all online or something.

2468
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:36,260
That's weird.

2469
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:38,420
I guess they're probably going to do the same thing.

2470
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:39,460
Use some weird software.

2471
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:41,740
I bet I bet it'll still be possible to cheat.

2472
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:44,340
I mean, I guess you could cheat the in-person version as well.

2473
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:45,380
They won't in England.

2474
02:13:45,380 --> 02:13:47,780
Ha, ha, why not?

2475
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:50,340
Because they're giving up on all COVID restrictions, aren't they?

2476
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:53,980
Oh, yeah, they're going back in.

2477
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:56,660
Yeah, I don't I'm not paying attention to that.

2478
02:13:56,660 --> 02:14:00,660
It's just like a yes or no to everything possible

2479
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:02,100
that you could or could not be doing.

2480
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:03,900
Please do or do not do everything.

2481
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:04,580
It's like, I don't know.

2482
02:14:04,580 --> 02:14:05,780
I'll just wear a mask.

2483
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:07,940
Yeah, I'll just wear a mask and I'll just go outside.

2484
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:10,660
If there's no legal requirement to wear a mask anymore,

2485
02:14:10,660 --> 02:14:13,580
there's no legal requirement to work from home or any of that shit.

2486
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:15,300
There's nothing, basically.

2487
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:16,940
There's no restrictions anymore.

2488
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:20,380
Damn, I think it's just the NHS are going to start firing people

2489
02:14:20,380 --> 02:14:22,380
who aren't vaccinated or something like that.

2490
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:23,900
That's the only one that's sticking around.

2491
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:25,620
Something, something, I guess.

2492
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:27,700
Yeah, take what I can get.

2493
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:33,660
I guess Boris, my the lawsuit against the New Zealand government

2494
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:36,020
that my mum is involved with.

2495
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:41,300
As there was a little thing written about it recently.

2496
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:44,700
It's a COVID restriction thing, right?

2497
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:47,180
Yeah, but churches.

2498
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:50,540
Why do I why do I have to? Oh, yeah, that whole thing.

2499
02:14:53,740 --> 02:14:57,740
All right, I think the next one might be the same one again,

2500
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:59,780
because there's another one called Red Five.

2501
02:15:01,340 --> 02:15:04,140
Three, two, one, go.

2502
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:07,100
Oh, my gosh, I already left this as a comment on the last episode.

2503
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:11,060
No, different, OK, probably two episodes ago once you hear this.

2504
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:15,220
But for wordle, it's based off of your system time.

2505
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:18,260
So if you just like set your date to a different date,

2506
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:20,580
it will give you a wordle for that day.

2507
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:22,820
So you can play the past wordles.

2508
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:24,660
You can play some future wordles, too.

2509
02:15:24,660 --> 02:15:26,460
Hmm, really? Wacky.

2510
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:28,940
You could go you could go and just play future ones

2511
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:30,020
that no one has seen before.

2512
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:32,220
You could go and spoil all future wordles.

2513
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:36,140
That's interesting, because the timer when it reset

2514
02:15:36,140 --> 02:15:40,060
seems to be based off like UK time, because it like it resets like

2515
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:44,140
at like nine p.m. for me, which would be for me.

2516
02:15:44,140 --> 02:15:46,740
It resets at midnight.

2517
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:48,940
Yeah, I thought it was like midnight wherever you are.

2518
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:50,340
It's not midnight for me.

2519
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:53,140
Like it seems to if I check.

2520
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:57,340
If I check wordle, when's the next one?

2521
02:15:57,340 --> 02:15:58,540
Every everybody else.

2522
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:00,300
Everybody else seems to reset at midnight.

2523
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:02,660
Oh, wait, no, now it's now it's set to midnight.

2524
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:05,780
That's weird. The other day, like I was able to like access a new one

2525
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:08,660
like like five or six hours before midnight,

2526
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:11,460
which would have lined up with the UK. That's pretty weird.

2527
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:14,860
Never. Maybe they recently changed the system time

2528
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:17,580
because of the popularity.

2529
02:16:17,580 --> 02:16:20,220
Maybe or or I'm stupid.

2530
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:27,340
Nakes. OK, next one is please tell me this is in the Blu-rays.

2531
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:30,060
And then there's a YouTube link.

2532
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,700
That is not a YouTube link.

2533
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:33,500
This is not a YouTube link.

2534
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:34,980
That is not a note.

2535
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:36,820
Yeah, this video isn't of it.

2536
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:38,740
Yeah, yeah. No, here's what fucking happened.

2537
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,900
They pasted the link and didn't notice that their their voicemail title

2538
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:46,620
was too long and it only put part of the link there.

2539
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:48,620
I feel like I feel like this happens all the time.

2540
02:16:48,620 --> 02:16:51,100
I feel like this happens very often.

2541
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:55,980
I am going to I'm going to assume this is a Jesse video

2542
02:16:55,980 --> 02:16:59,020
and I'm going to look at the URL that has 69 Q in it.

2543
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:02,380
I have I have a I have a guess for what this might be.

2544
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:07,100
Is it is it that one Jesse video that went viral recently?

2545
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:09,940
Wait, one went viral recently.

2546
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:13,980
Yeah, there was one going the the Windows updates one was like

2547
02:17:14,420 --> 02:17:17,020
it went viral on TikTok recently.

2548
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:23,340
It went viral. You made me a racist, Obama, you made me a racist.

2549
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:25,620
As long as I kept that part in and good, I guess,

2550
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:28,380
because when it went viral on Facebook, if I cut that part off.

2551
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:32,860
So just ended with the N word without the the dawning horror

2552
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:34,780
that they have become a racist now.

2553
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:36,540
That would that's the punchline.

2554
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:40,140
Yeah, that's pretty much ruin the whole point of the of the bit.

2555
02:17:40,140 --> 02:17:41,140
Yeah.

2556
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:46,540
It's like I hate Windows update so much that I became racist about it.

2557
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:49,940
But there's a way it doesn't work if it doesn't work

2558
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:53,620
if if you if you omit the self-awareness of I guess.

2559
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:55,580
I guess it would be funny in a different way

2560
02:17:55,580 --> 02:17:57,980
if you just cut it off after the N word.

2561
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:03,140
But like it's like then it becomes like a crazy person yelling.

2562
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:05,580
Yeah, that's all shock value, which is funny in its own way.

2563
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:08,780
But like, yeah, then you just think it's just a person who's.

2564
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:12,140
Yes, that's why it went viral.

2565
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:15,940
Well, well, no, yeah, that's that sucks.

2566
02:18:17,940 --> 02:18:21,260
All right, next next one is a is a vocabru.

2567
02:18:22,980 --> 02:18:24,620
Is a vocabru link, I guess.

2568
02:18:24,620 --> 02:18:27,380
So let's let's check. Let's check it out.

2569
02:18:28,980 --> 02:18:30,180
Wait, oblivion fall. What are you?

2570
02:18:30,180 --> 02:18:30,980
What are you?

2571
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:37,860
I am I am doing some I'm doing some detective work detective work.

2572
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:40,460
Yeah, so with YouTube videos.

2573
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:44,420
You I learned this from Vsauce.

2574
02:18:44,420 --> 02:18:47,860
You can search for videos based on what the URL is.

2575
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:53,340
So I can search for a YouTube URL that has that in it.

2576
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:56,540
And hopefully.

2577
02:18:57,300 --> 02:18:59,380
Oh, wow.

2578
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:03,660
OK, I'm getting a few videos with this.

2579
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:06,940
Oh, no, it's not case sensitive.

2580
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:09,060
This is just a Minecraft video.

2581
02:19:09,060 --> 02:19:12,260
I know there's only three letters that's not enough if we had four, maybe.

2582
02:19:13,140 --> 02:19:15,300
Well, well, we'll never know.

2583
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:16,980
You done fucked up, voicemailer.

2584
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:19,300
You done fucked it up.

2585
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:22,540
All right, next next one is this vocabru link.

2586
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:24,380
All right, I'm looking on it.

2587
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:27,300
I got it. Three, two, three, two, one, go.

2588
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:51,860
I couldn't understand it.

2589
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:53,300
No, I don't know what I said.

2590
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:54,540
I couldn't understand a single word.

2591
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:55,740
I have no idea what they said.

2592
02:19:55,740 --> 02:19:57,460
Sorry. Good try.

2593
02:19:57,460 --> 02:19:58,340
Good try.

2594
02:19:58,340 --> 02:19:59,140
Sounded cool.

2595
02:19:59,140 --> 02:19:59,820
Sounded nice.

2596
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:01,900
And credits of Red Dead Redemption 2 or something,

2597
02:20:01,900 --> 02:20:03,780
but I did no idea what that said.

2598
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:08,260
It's too bad.

2599
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:10,460
Next one is.

2600
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:14,020
It's OK, parentheses.

2601
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:14,700
It's a cover.

2602
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:18,300
It's called It's a Cover of a Song Called Nightfall at Runescape is Fucking

2603
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:20,740
based, whatever, whatever.

2604
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:23,020
OK.

2605
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:29,940
Next one is Shraft, Shraft 3.0.

2606
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:32,300
OK, there it is.

2607
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:34,420
Three, two, one, go.

2608
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:38,460
Hey, PZP, two questions.

2609
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:41,700
Well, really one question, but in the form of two,

2610
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:43,860
because I'm that much of an asshole.

2611
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:46,940
So the internet, it's constantly changing.

2612
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:50,860
It's, you know, the internet of 10 years ago is gone

2613
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:54,980
and the internet of 10 years from now is what I'm about to ask you about.

2614
02:20:55,380 --> 02:20:59,700
So what do you think the internet is going to look like in 10 years from now?

2615
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:01,420
What are going to be the hot trends?

2616
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:03,820
What's what's everyone going to be chasing for cloud?

2617
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:06,740
What kind of rat race are we going to be stuck in?

2618
02:21:07,220 --> 02:21:11,820
And secondarily, what type of internet would you like to see in 10 years?

2619
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:13,380
What would be a good internet?

2620
02:21:13,380 --> 02:21:15,100
And don't fucking.

2621
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:18,300
OK, this is an obvious like trash web 3.0 shit.

2622
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:22,660
But like, let's say let's say fucking

2623
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:25,340
the crypto bros don't get their way.

2624
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:28,460
What what what do you think would happen maybe outside of that?

2625
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:30,660
So be more creative, you fucks.

2626
02:21:30,940 --> 02:21:32,980
Well, that's too that's too broad a question.

2627
02:21:33,180 --> 02:21:34,940
Oh, I have no I have no idea.

2628
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:38,780
I mean, 10 years ago, the internet was like

2629
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:42,500
slowly becoming exactly what it is now,

2630
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:46,900
which is just sort of whatever.

2631
02:21:48,380 --> 02:21:52,460
Content, content for the viewing public, the masses, social media.

2632
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:54,580
I feel like it's going to be the same for the next 10 years.

2633
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:59,940
I feel like it was leading up to this and I can't see it like changing anymore.

2634
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:01,660
Well, what I want is a gallery.

2635
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:04,780
A few years anyway, all I want is a proper gallery mode on Twitter.

2636
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:05,620
That's all I need.

2637
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:07,700
It goes month or maybe every media post.

2638
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:09,940
That's all OK.

2639
02:22:10,060 --> 02:22:14,700
So the last like 10 years has seen like consolidation of content into like

2640
02:22:15,580 --> 02:22:21,380
what's the word, agglomerating platforms, aggregating.

2641
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:24,180
Yes, aggregating platforms.

2642
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:27,740
I'm going to say that maybe that trend will continue.

2643
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:31,340
But I don't know, maybe optimistically,

2644
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:36,820
a sort of like maybe like a more like underground

2645
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:41,380
sort of trend will emerge and become stronger.

2646
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:44,260
Maybe there will be like a strong like a stronger like counterculture

2647
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:49,020
sort of like not like something that will maybe some

2648
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:52,980
maybe some kind of opposition to that will coagulate because there really is,

2649
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:56,860
I don't know, I think it's a vague prediction, but it's something.

2650
02:22:57,860 --> 02:23:02,700
Yeah, I think for that to happen, crypto would need to completely die

2651
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:07,140
because at the moment, the whole counterculture like desire

2652
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:11,060
is in the minds of those crypto bros who are like fighting the system

2653
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:13,860
and everyone else is just sort of laughing at them because they're stupid.

2654
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:16,900
And everything they're doing is idiotic.

2655
02:23:16,900 --> 02:23:20,700
I don't know if there's like a counterculture to the internet as exists.

2656
02:23:20,860 --> 02:23:25,740
Everybody seems to hate Twitter and nobody seems to be trying to go anywhere else.

2657
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:31,100
So like, I don't know, I see it staying about the same.

2658
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:32,940
I mean, it's like Torrance.

2659
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:35,140
Stuff like Torrance seem good.

2660
02:23:35,140 --> 02:23:41,820
Stuff that is like, you know, free freeware and just just distributed,

2661
02:23:41,900 --> 02:23:43,580
really distributed.

2662
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:47,940
Yeah, I guess if there's like a what would you like the internet to be more?

2663
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:56,700
I'd like it to be more independent individual websites

2664
02:23:57,140 --> 02:24:02,460
and that somehow people like going to in the same way that there's like the big city

2665
02:24:02,940 --> 02:24:06,540
where you have social media and then you can go on a country road

2666
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:09,740
and explore the towns and the villages outside.

2667
02:24:09,740 --> 02:24:11,780
And there are cool websites everywhere.

2668
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:14,260
And there's like a wonderful hamlet of Gibb and take dot site.

2669
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:16,660
We need we need to bring back web rings.

2670
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:20,380
I don't know what that is.

2671
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:23,300
I think I think a web ring was basically just like back when there were

2672
02:24:23,380 --> 02:24:27,500
when everybody had a website, you would just like like like websites

2673
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:30,900
would just like ally with each other and they would put links to each other

2674
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:34,420
in their in their in their descriptions.

2675
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:37,620
And then like just a bunch of websites that all linked to each other

2676
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:39,420
would be called a web ring, right?

2677
02:24:39,460 --> 02:24:41,020
I think that's what they were.

2678
02:24:41,020 --> 02:24:43,140
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.

2679
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:45,260
So maybe I don't know.

2680
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:49,820
I could I could kind of see like a sort of retro movement coming back,

2681
02:24:49,820 --> 02:24:54,140
like a kind of like we sort of sort of recreate the old internet

2682
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:58,180
with web, web rings and stuff sort of underneath the, you know,

2683
02:24:58,180 --> 02:25:00,660
the fucking the top level web 2.0.

2684
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:03,620
Everything's accumulated on platforms.

2685
02:25:03,740 --> 02:25:06,620
Yeah, I think I'm.

2686
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:10,540
I think server hosting costs.

2687
02:25:12,820 --> 02:25:18,460
Like you have to buy, you have to pay a server to host your website

2688
02:25:18,460 --> 02:25:20,420
or use your own computer.

2689
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:25,980
And I think a technology that would be nice in the future

2690
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:28,020
is like more peer to peer stuff.

2691
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:34,220
So like making it more like what's that thing

2692
02:25:34,260 --> 02:25:39,660
that people use, those chat rooms that are like pre forums

2693
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:44,020
that are basically proto forums that I know the ones to peer.

2694
02:25:45,860 --> 02:25:48,700
I know the one you're talking about sex hotlines.

2695
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:52,060
I don't know what's going on. Yes, we need sex hotlines.

2696
02:25:52,060 --> 02:25:53,300
More sex hotlines.

2697
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:54,420
That's what the internet is going to be.

2698
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:56,820
I think the metaverse is going to completely fail.

2699
02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:58,020
I don't know. Oh, of course.

2700
02:25:58,020 --> 02:26:00,100
It's it's like it's it's.

2701
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:03,620
Zuckerberg like discovering Second Life and thinking he's invented it.

2702
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:05,420
Like, yeah.

2703
02:26:05,420 --> 02:26:07,780
Are you talking about like CompuServe?

2704
02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:09,420
I don't really know what I'm talking about.

2705
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:12,980
I think I've heard of like a peer to peer messaging system.

2706
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:14,340
I know the one you're talking about.

2707
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:16,580
Early internet stuff.

2708
02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:20,380
I see IRC IRC IRC IRC.

2709
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:23,300
I think you're talking about IRC internet relay chat.

2710
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:28,140
Yeah. So like more peer to peer stuff to like lower the costs of

2711
02:26:28,660 --> 02:26:31,340
manage like having a server that has a lot of traffic.

2712
02:26:31,340 --> 02:26:35,820
If it's like spread out across, I don't know how stuff like that could work.

2713
02:26:36,540 --> 02:26:39,220
But like, all I know is that if you want a website,

2714
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:42,820
you'll need to pay for however many people come to see it.

2715
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:46,060
And you want people to see it, so you'll need to make a lot of money.

2716
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:48,060
And if you need to make a lot of money,

2717
02:26:49,140 --> 02:26:52,740
it's in your best interest to maybe put advertising on the website.

2718
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:55,180
And then when it comes to that, it's like,

2719
02:26:55,260 --> 02:26:58,460
well, what about all of these free services that have wider reach

2720
02:26:58,460 --> 02:27:00,820
and require no monetary input on your part?

2721
02:27:01,380 --> 02:27:04,620
And it's like, dang, I guess I should just post on these sites.

2722
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:08,380
These these conglomerate everyone's here sort of things.

2723
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:11,300
So like technology would need to make it really cheap for people

2724
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:14,180
to have their own websites before people would actually be able to do it.

2725
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:18,940
I mean, I mean, I have a website and it cost me like ten dollars a month.

2726
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:24,020
Sure, like if you have if you had a lot of people coming to that website,

2727
02:27:24,020 --> 02:27:28,260
it would cost more, maybe would it?

2728
02:27:29,060 --> 02:27:31,300
Well, I guess not for a comic website.

2729
02:27:31,780 --> 02:27:32,900
I'm not entirely sure.

2730
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:34,380
I don't really know how it works.

2731
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:38,860
Larger traffic makes it slower to maybe maybe like if it needed to handle

2732
02:27:38,860 --> 02:27:42,060
like a bigger traffic load, I would have to upgrade like a subscription

2733
02:27:42,060 --> 02:27:44,740
to like a higher traffic version or something. Yeah. Yeah.

2734
02:27:44,740 --> 02:27:47,820
I mean, it's probably I mean, when a Homestuck update came out

2735
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:50,740
and everybody was clicking on it, the website would crash.

2736
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:54,100
So clearly, there's something that can go wrong if too many people

2737
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:55,940
are reading your stuff.

2738
02:27:55,940 --> 02:27:58,700
So it's fine if like you're you're relatively obscure,

2739
02:27:59,060 --> 02:28:02,420
but as soon as it scales up, you need to scale up the money as well.

2740
02:28:04,060 --> 02:28:07,740
And so at that point, it becomes more of an of an annoyance.

2741
02:28:11,140 --> 02:28:13,580
The future sucks.

2742
02:28:13,580 --> 02:28:15,900
The future hasn't happened yet. We don't know.

2743
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:17,780
It's true. Sad but true.

2744
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:19,300
All right. Next next one.

2745
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:21,660
Next one is called VTuber Revolution.

2746
02:28:21,660 --> 02:28:23,140
I don't know. Yeah.

2747
02:28:23,140 --> 02:28:25,780
Three, three, two, one, go.

2748
02:28:26,620 --> 02:28:29,820
Hey, PCP, I think I'm going to stop watching

2749
02:28:29,820 --> 02:28:32,500
unless you literally all become VTubers.

2750
02:28:32,980 --> 02:28:36,340
I want to see avatars moving around, bopping and bopping.

2751
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:38,100
I want to see Ben St.

2752
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:42,220
is the cop killer. I want to see Gibb moving around.

2753
02:28:42,220 --> 02:28:44,540
I want to see everyone's mouths flapping.

2754
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:47,700
We have the mouth flaps animations on the podcast.

2755
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:50,220
I think I'm just about done with this show.

2756
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:54,140
Good. Thank you both for that.

2757
02:28:54,140 --> 02:28:56,900
They make a compelling point.

2758
02:28:56,900 --> 02:29:00,740
I tried to make that phantom horn VTuber rig one time and it was weird.

2759
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:01,980
It didn't act right.

2760
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:05,020
Its eyes were like jittery and I couldn't get them to stay still.

2761
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:08,020
Yeah. Ben, your eyes are just jittery.

2762
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:11,700
Some sort of a crazy setup to get at the tracking.

2763
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:15,660
I think I've seen these clips of this one VTuber girl,

2764
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:20,220
DM, who has like a three dimensional VTuber avatar.

2765
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:24,700
Yeah. And her tracking is like, I think she uses like an iPhone.

2766
02:29:25,300 --> 02:29:28,260
And the face tracking on that is like perfect.

2767
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:31,700
The expressions are like immediately picked up.

2768
02:29:32,260 --> 02:29:34,540
And it's like girl DM.

2769
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:36,980
Oh, yeah. I just want to see what she looks like.

2770
02:29:36,980 --> 02:29:39,620
She's one of those people who has a really nice model.

2771
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:41,860
Yeah, she's got a real nice model.

2772
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:43,940
She's funny, which is nice.

2773
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:45,660
I haven't bothered to like look at her streams.

2774
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:48,820
But the clips I've seen are like, dang, that's really good tracking.

2775
02:29:48,820 --> 02:29:51,420
That really good face tracking shit.

2776
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:53,940
It helps out the it was the models by the art gun.

2777
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:56,220
They do a lot of really, really, really high quality ones.

2778
02:29:56,500 --> 02:30:00,780
Oh, a lot of the a lot of the face stuff can be done

2779
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:04,860
so that it is mode shifting as opposed to trying to emulate every single expression.

2780
02:30:04,860 --> 02:30:06,260
So it will only like subtly change.

2781
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:08,900
And then you press a button and it will switch to like different expressions.

2782
02:30:08,900 --> 02:30:10,460
But when you're playing a game,

2783
02:30:10,460 --> 02:30:13,100
pressing buttons to change your expression is too hard.

2784
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:16,540
That's why you get a little off this controller and bind it to different things on that.

2785
02:30:16,820 --> 02:30:19,020
You have a little foot. I've seen people do that.

2786
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:22,260
Yeah, this is I'm not an organ player.

2787
02:30:23,940 --> 02:30:25,020
Good guitar.

2788
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:28,980
Sorry, clone hero players have foot pedals to activate certain things in game.

2789
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:30,460
They're crazy.

2790
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:33,460
I'm not a car driver.

2791
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:37,820
What if I was playing a car game and I had a pedal

2792
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:42,660
and I had my twitch like reaction pedal and I would switch over to it.

2793
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:44,580
And like, oh, shit, I'm going to crash.

2794
02:30:44,580 --> 02:30:46,740
Click and I'm screaming.

2795
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:47,700
It goes.

2796
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:50,860
VTubers cringe.

2797
02:30:50,860 --> 02:30:54,060
Then I need to be like, I need to be a VTuber

2798
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:56,420
and like have a nice freedy model and it's German.

2799
02:30:56,420 --> 02:30:58,420
I'm just like a cartoon German.

2800
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:00,740
No, just a real German.

2801
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:03,820
It's like German's face cut up and like, wait, yeah, just a realistic German.

2802
02:31:03,820 --> 02:31:05,740
I think I think I complained.

2803
02:31:05,740 --> 02:31:09,260
I think I complained about whenever I see VTubers that are all just like

2804
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:13,300
VTubers on low level VTubers on Twitter,

2805
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:17,700
all like evincing this weird like fake solidarity, this like fake friendly thing.

2806
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:20,060
It's like, we all got to follow each other to support each other.

2807
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:21,820
We're all going to make it.

2808
02:31:21,820 --> 02:31:23,660
No, it's a pyramid scheme.

2809
02:31:23,660 --> 02:31:24,940
It's a pyramid scheme.

2810
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:27,820
That's not true, but it's annoying.

2811
02:31:27,820 --> 02:31:31,420
Red Man was a pretty good VR VTuber, not VR.

2812
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:32,860
The best.

2813
02:31:32,860 --> 02:31:35,740
He was wobbly and he had one frame for his mouth opening.

2814
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:39,780
The only problem was the eyes were would would not track at all

2815
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:41,740
and it would completely lose track of my face.

2816
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:43,580
Yeah, it was Phantom's eyes were the problem.

2817
02:31:43,580 --> 02:31:46,420
Just the pupils just would not stay still and it just didn't look right.

2818
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:49,740
It didn't like it might have been where like big googly eyes.

2819
02:31:50,180 --> 02:31:53,380
It was probably just that my setup was not good enough.

2820
02:31:53,380 --> 02:31:55,380
The lighting was not good and it couldn't track it well.

2821
02:31:57,300 --> 02:32:01,460
OK, next next voicemail is called D and balls.

2822
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:05,220
There it is three, two, one, go.

2823
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:10,540
Ha, hey, what do you think about drum and bass music?

2824
02:32:10,660 --> 02:32:12,460
I don't fucking care.

2825
02:32:12,460 --> 02:32:13,380
I think it's pretty good.

2826
02:32:13,380 --> 02:32:14,380
I haven't heard much.

2827
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:17,740
I think I listened to like a something on YouTube

2828
02:32:17,740 --> 02:32:19,620
that had a pig on the front cover.

2829
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:21,540
Nice. Nice.

2830
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:24,020
When I was in school, people listened to music

2831
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:25,620
that they called drum and bass.

2832
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:27,540
But I don't know if it counts as drum and bass anymore.

2833
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:30,780
It sucked. So I don't know what drum and bass is.

2834
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:33,620
I don't even know what drum and bass is.

2835
02:32:33,620 --> 02:32:36,140
The fucking Powerpuff Girls theme song,

2836
02:32:36,140 --> 02:32:40,180
that bit where the the drums are playing, that's drum and bass.

2837
02:32:41,660 --> 02:32:43,020
It sounds sounds fine.

2838
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:44,940
See, when I was in secondary school,

2839
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:47,340
people basically referred to drum and bass as like,

2840
02:32:47,340 --> 02:32:49,500
it's like soft the dubstep it was.

2841
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:51,580
And it's like, this doesn't this is shit.

2842
02:32:51,580 --> 02:32:54,660
And also, I don't think that's what that should have been called.

2843
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:59,540
That that that drum sample is like from like the 70s or 80s or some shit.

2844
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:01,860
Yes, yes.

2845
02:33:01,860 --> 02:33:05,380
It's it's just being like reused and repurposed like a million times.

2846
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:07,220
It has a name. I forgot what it's called.

2847
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:09,700
It was from like some jazz called the stolen drum beat.

2848
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:10,980
And the drummer is sad.

2849
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:12,980
They didn't get royalties.

2850
02:33:12,980 --> 02:33:14,700
Yeah.

2851
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:16,340
Anyway, this is voicemail.

2852
02:33:16,340 --> 02:33:20,020
Next voicemail is called one of us doesn't understand boxes.

2853
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:22,260
Three, two, one, go.

2854
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:27,420
Ben, just put it all in a fucking box.

2855
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:32,220
No, like you take a box, you put the blu-ray in it,

2856
02:33:32,980 --> 02:33:36,540
then you put the book in it, then you close the box and seal it.

2857
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:37,940
And you mail that customer.

2858
02:33:37,940 --> 02:33:39,340
It would be why the fuck do you need it?

2859
02:33:39,340 --> 02:33:44,660
Like, it would be more expensive, stupid, more expensive to ship.

2860
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:46,660
Yes, it is so much more expensive.

2861
02:33:46,660 --> 02:33:48,420
He doesn't understand like, I don't know.

2862
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:50,460
I don't deal with with a whole lot of ship.

2863
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:54,500
Well, like clearly, you don't know, see, seems pretty simple.

2864
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:56,420
Hmm. Ben, why don't you do this thing?

2865
02:33:56,500 --> 02:34:00,340
Hmm, could it be could it be for this reason?

2866
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:02,060
I don't know. I don't know anything.

2867
02:34:02,060 --> 02:34:03,740
So why don't you do it?

2868
02:34:03,740 --> 02:34:05,860
Well, clearly, Ben doesn't understand boxes.

2869
02:34:05,860 --> 02:34:08,620
This guy doesn't understand shipping.

2870
02:34:08,620 --> 02:34:09,980
Dude, fucking. All right, all right.

2871
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:13,780
I was selling all like me and my partner when we were moving to America.

2872
02:34:13,780 --> 02:34:15,100
We had to we had to sell a bunch of shit

2873
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:16,860
because we couldn't take it all on the plane.

2874
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:19,060
And we had a whole bunch of my little pony merch

2875
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:20,700
that they had accrued over the years.

2876
02:34:20,700 --> 02:34:22,740
And we were like sort of falling out with the show.

2877
02:34:22,740 --> 02:34:24,740
So we're like, we'll just sell a bunch of his shit.

2878
02:34:24,740 --> 02:34:27,620
It was like eight hundred dollars worth of like various things.

2879
02:34:27,620 --> 02:34:30,180
And we advertised it on a Facebook group

2880
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:34,340
and some person said they wanted it and we put it all in a box

2881
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:36,900
and they were willing to pay like four hundred for it.

2882
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:40,100
And the shipping was like three hundred seventy

2883
02:34:40,300 --> 02:34:42,860
because it was in a fucking box.

2884
02:34:44,660 --> 02:34:46,700
That's cold. Fucked.

2885
02:34:46,700 --> 02:34:49,900
Yes, really made like 30 bucks to this guy.

2886
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:52,140
Yes, it is just it is simply much cheaper

2887
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:55,780
to put the book in an envelope and send it as a letter

2888
02:34:56,060 --> 02:34:59,340
than it is to put it in a box and ship it as a package.

2889
02:34:59,860 --> 02:35:03,100
I got a CD on discogs from New Zealand recently.

2890
02:35:03,100 --> 02:35:06,180
And they said, hey, if I put it in a jewel case,

2891
02:35:06,180 --> 02:35:10,140
it'll literally cost like 10 bucks, like 15 bucks extra to ship.

2892
02:35:10,500 --> 02:35:13,900
If I put it, if I put the CD in an envelope, it'll be like two bucks.

2893
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:15,180
And it's that all right.

2894
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:16,100
And I'm like, sure.

2895
02:35:16,100 --> 02:35:18,820
And I got the CD in a very nice.

2896
02:35:19,300 --> 02:35:20,580
I have I have a big box.

2897
02:35:20,580 --> 02:35:22,780
So I think I have like 40.

2898
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:25,580
I think I have like 40 more that I need to take to the post office,

2899
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:29,460
which I will do as soon as the snow melts a little bit.

2900
02:35:29,460 --> 02:35:30,380
I think I'll give that.

2901
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:31,060
Just bring a friend.

2902
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:35,100
Maybe I'm like, yeah, if I if I could get one.

2903
02:35:36,460 --> 02:35:41,100
Next, the voicemail is called Terry Walker.

2904
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:43,300
I'm putting it in chat right now.

2905
02:35:43,300 --> 02:35:45,940
There it is. Terry Walker, three, two, one, go.

2906
02:35:47,260 --> 02:35:49,660
All right. The setting is December 2019.

2907
02:35:49,820 --> 02:35:52,260
I'm making New Year's resolution to stop watching YouTube.

2908
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:54,260
Believe me, I had a problem.

2909
02:35:54,260 --> 02:35:56,340
I'm not going to pretend I need to be caught up, though.

2910
02:35:56,340 --> 02:35:57,820
I do have a Twitter.

2911
02:35:57,820 --> 02:35:59,700
Then it was December, 2021.

2912
02:35:59,700 --> 02:36:02,420
I rewatch and get caught up on all the PCP's content.

2913
02:36:02,780 --> 02:36:05,100
Like I said, I have a problem.

2914
02:36:05,100 --> 02:36:07,500
There was a hot week there that I was confused about

2915
02:36:08,060 --> 02:36:11,460
because y'all were talking about the Brony lecture, but no matter how many times

2916
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:13,860
I scrolled through the lecture playlist, I couldn't find it.

2917
02:36:13,860 --> 02:36:14,860
Yeah.

2918
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:19,180
Well, where are you now?

2919
02:36:19,220 --> 02:36:20,420
See what you've done, Trixie?

2920
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:22,660
What is it? Because this could have all been prevented.

2921
02:36:22,660 --> 02:36:24,380
This person.

2922
02:36:24,380 --> 02:36:26,540
I'm not sure what the point of this.

2923
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:27,940
I'm not sure what the point of this is.

2924
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:30,820
Isn't it interesting that if you haven't gotten to the point?

2925
02:36:31,300 --> 02:36:32,020
Oh, does he not?

2926
02:36:32,020 --> 02:36:34,780
Does he not know? Does he not know? Oh, yeah.

2927
02:36:34,820 --> 02:36:35,820
Well, there's no Brony lecture.

2928
02:36:35,820 --> 02:36:37,340
It was thrown in the trash. Trixie.

2929
02:36:37,340 --> 02:36:38,820
Trixie destroyed it.

2930
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:43,620
Trixie destroyed it in a fit of fury of rage and from.

2931
02:36:44,300 --> 02:36:47,700
Yeah. Oh, yeah, you asked me for the lecture.

2932
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:50,300
Will you? Well, I'll punish you for it.

2933
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,740
You fools.

2934
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:53,940
It was only, but this is only a character I'm playing.

2935
02:36:57,340 --> 02:36:58,340
Next.

2936
02:36:58,340 --> 02:37:02,940
Next voicemail is, yeah, it was destroyed, was destroyed, is the answer.

2937
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:05,340
Next one is called, wait.

2938
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:07,620
Well, okay.

2939
02:37:07,620 --> 02:37:10,740
Next one is called insanely transphobic procrastinators.

2940
02:37:10,740 --> 02:37:14,100
Part one, three, two, one, go.

2941
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:17,260
So the reason I called in was I wanted to express

2942
02:37:17,300 --> 02:37:20,220
my confusion of Trixie critics that feel the need to shoot the arguments

2943
02:37:20,220 --> 02:37:22,300
in the foot by including the transphobia.

2944
02:37:22,620 --> 02:37:25,180
Like Trixie was clearly going through an asshole arc

2945
02:37:25,180 --> 02:37:28,980
long before transitioning ever came up or completely independent of being trans.

2946
02:37:28,980 --> 02:37:30,820
Who's saying that?

2947
02:37:30,820 --> 02:37:35,380
The first time I think people noticed anything was when Trixie got a girlfriend.

2948
02:37:36,940 --> 02:37:39,620
I wasn't one of the people that thought May was the problem.

2949
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:43,060
She didn't reveal her politics at that point.

2950
02:37:43,380 --> 02:37:47,140
But the being high 24 seven and acting like they were the first person

2951
02:37:47,140 --> 02:37:50,900
that had discovered drugs, if she's not still in that arc,

2952
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:53,340
that is the most cringe arc they've ever been on.

2953
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:57,380
And then Trixie trying to shame the PCP for not paying May's way to Radcon.

2954
02:37:57,700 --> 02:38:01,580
Weirdly yelling at Manji for going to college and belittling everyone

2955
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:04,340
that did go to college on a recorded episode for some reason.

2956
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:06,540
That was fucking weird.

2957
02:38:06,540 --> 02:38:10,500
Convincing people to move to Boston or Virginia Beach for PCPHQ.

2958
02:38:10,940 --> 02:38:14,620
Like didn't Nate and Michelle actually move for the cantant reasons?

2959
02:38:14,620 --> 02:38:19,260
And then hating Boston because it was like cold or having to take a bus.

2960
02:38:19,300 --> 02:38:20,260
What the fuck?

2961
02:38:20,260 --> 02:38:23,500
Like people moved across country and then dropping projects

2962
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:27,180
that other people were dependent on like cantant or I am games.

2963
02:38:27,740 --> 02:38:28,940
By 2020 comes around.

2964
02:38:28,940 --> 02:38:31,540
Everyone should have been rolling their eyes at Trixie coming in

2965
02:38:31,540 --> 02:38:37,340
with a new paradigm shift or abandoning projects long before the Brony lecture.

2966
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:41,020
Like the how the marketed thing or those rants.

2967
02:38:42,020 --> 02:38:45,180
Well, yeah, I mean the signs for all that's all true.

2968
02:38:45,180 --> 02:38:50,500
I think I think for my part, it was like I didn't care too much

2969
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:55,900
because I wasn't really involved and I had no stake in Trixie's career.

2970
02:38:55,940 --> 02:38:57,500
Yeah, I had no stake in it.

2971
02:38:57,500 --> 02:38:59,500
It wasn't like personally affecting me.

2972
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:03,020
There's another part, by the way, there's one.

2973
02:39:03,020 --> 02:39:04,180
There's another part, too.

2974
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:07,780
So let's just listen to that three, two, three, two, one go.

2975
02:39:08,780 --> 02:39:12,820
So yeah, feels like a full Kiwi Farms article without gender needing to come up.

2976
02:39:13,420 --> 02:39:18,300
Even with that, I'm one of the fans that found the PCP through the Digi Bro channel.

2977
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:22,140
Do you all think this was an arc of selfishness and instability?

2978
02:39:22,140 --> 02:39:25,780
Or was she always an asshole? Always an asshole. Always an asshole.

2979
02:39:27,060 --> 02:39:28,060
It was always an asshole.

2980
02:39:28,060 --> 02:39:31,660
It just took she had she had to she had to get on top.

2981
02:39:31,660 --> 02:39:33,860
She had to have like everything handed to her.

2982
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:37,220
And then once she had it, I would say as much I can be as much of an asshole

2983
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:38,620
as I want, nothing bad will happen.

2984
02:39:38,620 --> 02:39:43,100
Well, I would say always an asshole through selfishness and self importance.

2985
02:39:43,900 --> 02:39:45,100
Yeah, she just doesn't.

2986
02:39:45,100 --> 02:39:46,900
She just doesn't care.

2987
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:51,140
She just doesn't care about other people is the is the is the problem.

2988
02:39:51,620 --> 02:39:54,980
In my opinion, that's my diagnosis lack of empathy.

2989
02:39:55,300 --> 02:39:57,300
You're going to work for you once you get there.

2990
02:39:57,540 --> 02:40:00,380
Stupid golden witch, bitch, whatever it's called.

2991
02:40:01,460 --> 02:40:04,300
OK, where's Kusa, mega, you fuck?

2992
02:40:05,060 --> 02:40:06,980
Next next voicemail.

2993
02:40:06,980 --> 02:40:09,180
OK, OK, we're getting a bit into it.

2994
02:40:09,180 --> 02:40:11,780
I don't know if there's that many of these, but there's the next one is called

2995
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:13,740
Yig commenters. No, no.

2996
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:16,540
So three, two, one, go.

2997
02:40:17,180 --> 02:40:19,500
I've been I see you floored about

2998
02:40:20,660 --> 02:40:25,380
the Yig commenters being all positive on Trixie's video.

2999
02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:29,340
You know, she's just deleting all the rest.

3000
02:40:29,620 --> 02:40:31,340
That's all that's all that's going on.

3001
02:40:31,340 --> 02:40:33,460
That is true. That is true.

3002
02:40:33,820 --> 02:40:34,820
It's true.

3003
02:40:34,820 --> 02:40:38,780
But like, it's still insane that people aren't even saying those things.

3004
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:42,020
Yeah, nevertheless, there's like hundreds of a few hundred people being like,

3005
02:40:42,260 --> 02:40:47,380
thank you so much for enlightening me, illuminating for me the truth.

3006
02:40:48,020 --> 02:40:50,300
Yes, I understand. It all makes sense now.

3007
02:40:51,620 --> 02:40:53,620
I'll do anything for you, my queen.

3008
02:40:54,780 --> 02:40:56,460
Bless.

3009
02:40:56,460 --> 02:40:59,020
Anyway, anyway, it is hope.

3010
02:40:59,220 --> 02:41:01,980
Yeah, some people are just beyond help.

3011
02:41:02,020 --> 02:41:07,060
Next voicemail is called Otaku Twilight.

3012
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:10,380
Three, two, one, go.

3013
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:12,620
Macross, do you remember? Love is an important classic.

3014
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:14,460
I hope you actually watch the film.

3015
02:41:14,460 --> 02:41:17,500
Remembering love is based regardless of dumb internet beef.

3016
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:20,540
I've never I've never seen Macross.

3017
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:22,540
Cool. I had forgotten.

3018
02:41:22,540 --> 02:41:24,420
Is that what Jesus said?

3019
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:25,820
That's some.

3020
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:29,500
Yeah, because I guess because Trixie got that phrase remembering love from

3021
02:41:29,860 --> 02:41:34,220
what's what's his name, a ghost lightning who, I guess, got it from Macross.

3022
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:36,460
But I've never seen Macross.

3023
02:41:36,460 --> 02:41:38,980
Is that the voice of Jesus on that voicemail?

3024
02:41:39,540 --> 02:41:41,380
It was a voice of Jesus.

3025
02:41:41,380 --> 02:41:43,020
It's quite like that.

3026
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:43,980
Millions of sparkle.

3027
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:46,580
Probably sparkle was Jesus, you know.

3028
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:51,020
I said Jesus because Macross, like he's like, oh, Macross.

3029
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:54,940
OK.

3030
02:41:54,940 --> 02:41:55,940
Oh, fuck.

3031
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:56,940
I'm sorry.

3032
02:41:57,940 --> 02:42:01,900
Oh, Twilight is in the pony character.

3033
02:42:02,420 --> 02:42:03,380
Oh, you don't even know.

3034
02:42:03,380 --> 02:42:06,540
Yeah, it's Twilight Sparkle Sparkle.

3035
02:42:06,660 --> 02:42:07,660
There was like two.

3036
02:42:07,660 --> 02:42:10,340
You think I was that then.

3037
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:12,660
Twilight must have been thinking Twilight like Edward.

3038
02:42:12,660 --> 02:42:15,540
Yeah, that's why I said Ed McMillan, but that's the.

3039
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:20,420
Oh, you mean, you know, Jesus, like Edward Macmillan,

3040
02:42:20,420 --> 02:42:23,140
like, like, like Gish and and Meat Boy.

3041
02:42:23,140 --> 02:42:24,140
Yeah.

3042
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:26,540
From Five Nights at Freddy's.

3043
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:27,700
I don't know.

3044
02:42:27,700 --> 02:42:28,940
Next voicemail.

3045
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:32,620
Yeah, next voicemail is called Question three, two, one, go.

3046
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:36,580
All right, this one's for the Doritos English muffin guy.

3047
02:42:36,940 --> 02:42:37,900
That shit sucked.

3048
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:39,820
You must have lost your mind.

3049
02:42:39,820 --> 02:42:41,740
Oh, fuck you.

3050
02:42:41,740 --> 02:42:43,100
Do you make your bed?

3051
02:42:43,100 --> 02:42:44,700
Piece of shit.

3052
02:42:44,700 --> 02:42:48,100
He's Doritos and English muffins are fucking tasty.

3053
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:49,100
This guy's no taste.

3054
02:42:49,100 --> 02:42:50,980
From in the trash, you're talking about you're talking about

3055
02:42:50,980 --> 02:42:52,940
your your cluster punk kitchen recipe.

3056
02:42:52,940 --> 02:42:56,180
Yeah, good thing I'm here this week to defend myself, eat a, eat a dick.

3057
02:42:56,820 --> 02:43:00,980
I haven't tried it and I'm on a very strict diet as of like a week

3058
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:04,340
and as of like two weeks ago, so I'm not going to try it anytime soon.

3059
02:43:04,340 --> 02:43:07,900
But I would try it and I'm not going to knock it until I it sounds weird.

3060
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:10,300
It doesn't sound like it's any good at all.

3061
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:11,420
Sound stupid as fuck.

3062
02:43:11,420 --> 02:43:13,020
You fucking imbecile.

3063
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:16,340
However, however, I won't knock it until I try it.

3064
02:43:16,340 --> 02:43:19,620
So like maybe it only works if I make it because every time I've

3065
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:21,180
given it to someone, I prepared it.

3066
02:43:21,180 --> 02:43:22,860
I put it together and I handed it to them.

3067
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:24,180
Well, what did you do to it?

3068
02:43:24,180 --> 02:43:25,340
Do you wash his hands?

3069
02:43:25,340 --> 02:43:26,340
It's cold as grease.

3070
02:43:26,340 --> 02:43:29,220
You think you English toast English muffin butter it and then

3071
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:31,580
what you sprinkle crushed up Doritos on toast, right?

3072
02:43:31,580 --> 02:43:34,220
Well, like you put like like three or four or five or six

3073
02:43:34,220 --> 02:43:35,900
however many Doritos you think is appropriate.

3074
02:43:35,900 --> 02:43:38,780
And you just kind of, you know, pushed the two halves of the muffin together

3075
02:43:39,100 --> 02:43:41,700
and you crunch it a little, crunch it down a little bit like, you know,

3076
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:43,380
you know, like you eat it like a sandwich.

3077
02:43:43,380 --> 02:43:44,180
You eat it like a sandwich.

3078
02:43:44,180 --> 02:43:46,300
Yeah. And I've done that.

3079
02:43:46,300 --> 02:43:50,660
And I loved it and I've made it for like six or seven other people.

3080
02:43:50,980 --> 02:43:54,660
And everyone who I've given one to when they they were like a bit skeptical

3081
02:43:54,660 --> 02:43:58,580
and then they took a bite and they were like, oh, that's actually really good.

3082
02:43:58,580 --> 02:44:00,540
Damn, like all of them had that reaction.

3083
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:02,020
So I've had a pretty good success.

3084
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:05,740
Obviously, obviously someone's going to not like it because taste is like

3085
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:10,580
it's fucking subjective, like like what I want to say, like food tastes.

3086
02:44:10,740 --> 02:44:12,620
Obviously, some people are going to hate it.

3087
02:44:12,620 --> 02:44:14,700
But I don't know.

3088
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:16,220
I think it's good.

3089
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:19,220
I would try. I would try.

3090
02:44:19,220 --> 02:44:22,740
I myself prefer what sits on a bagel.

3091
02:44:24,220 --> 02:44:25,060
What's a what's it?

3092
02:44:25,060 --> 02:44:25,700
What's a what's it?

3093
02:44:25,700 --> 02:44:26,620
It's a good. What is it?

3094
02:44:26,620 --> 02:44:28,180
It's a good, a good crisp.

3095
02:44:28,180 --> 02:44:29,220
It's a cheesy puff.

3096
02:44:29,220 --> 02:44:30,220
Crisp.

3097
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:32,460
It's like a cheese puff.

3098
02:44:32,460 --> 02:44:34,260
You would just call it a cheese puff.

3099
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:35,260
Yeah. Yeah.

3100
02:44:36,940 --> 02:44:38,540
Like, like a cheeto.

3101
02:44:38,540 --> 02:44:42,700
Oh, like, like, like, like Jax, maybe.

3102
02:44:43,940 --> 02:44:44,940
I don't know.

3103
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:46,380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3104
02:44:46,380 --> 02:44:48,940
Oh, those things that are like.

3105
02:44:48,940 --> 02:44:52,060
Yeah, those, those, those, those chips that are like, yeah.

3106
02:44:52,060 --> 02:44:55,980
Cheetos, Cheetos puffed and or Jax or cheese balls or whatever.

3107
02:44:55,980 --> 02:44:56,980
Yeah. Yeah.

3108
02:44:56,980 --> 02:44:59,740
Like we had we have a different name for them in New Zealand as well.

3109
02:45:01,260 --> 02:45:02,500
I mean, those on a bagel.

3110
02:45:02,500 --> 02:45:04,020
Yeah, I can see that being good.

3111
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:06,220
Jax coming up. Jax coming up barrel.

3112
02:45:06,940 --> 02:45:08,500
I used to put a barrel.

3113
02:45:08,500 --> 02:45:10,820
Well, I used to put what sits on my sandwiches at school

3114
02:45:10,820 --> 02:45:13,100
because they they have a lot of flavor to them.

3115
02:45:13,100 --> 02:45:14,580
So they work really well as a sandwich.

3116
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:15,580
Crisp.

3117
02:45:15,700 --> 02:45:18,820
Yeah, I guess.

3118
02:45:18,860 --> 02:45:22,860
I guess I could see it.

3119
02:45:23,020 --> 02:45:23,780
And they can't.

3120
02:45:23,780 --> 02:45:26,460
Should they melt in your mouth without the wishes?

3121
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:28,020
And I say.

3122
02:45:30,700 --> 02:45:33,100
And I said, yeah, yeah.

3123
02:45:33,100 --> 02:45:35,820
Yeah. Next one is called.

3124
02:45:36,140 --> 02:45:37,220
Next one is called.

3125
02:45:37,220 --> 02:45:40,220
It's Janess three, two, one.

3126
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:42,020
Ah, what's this?

3127
02:45:42,020 --> 02:45:43,820
Sorry. Sorry.

3128
02:45:43,820 --> 02:45:45,100
Ew, is this real?

3129
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:46,780
I don't think so.

3130
02:45:46,780 --> 02:45:47,580
That's not real.

3131
02:45:47,580 --> 02:45:48,380
Look at that.

3132
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:49,700
Hold on, hold on.

3133
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:50,580
We can't continue.

3134
02:45:50,580 --> 02:45:51,740
I have to set.

3135
02:45:51,740 --> 02:45:53,220
You just remind me, Simsie, this is important.

3136
02:45:53,220 --> 02:45:55,380
I'd try it. Oh, no.

3137
02:45:55,380 --> 02:45:56,220
Where's my phone?

3138
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:59,100
I saw something fucking horrendous, and this is real.

3139
02:45:59,100 --> 02:46:00,940
I took I took this fucking photo myself.

3140
02:46:01,180 --> 02:46:02,020
Oh, I'm pulling up my phone.

3141
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:03,500
It was dark chocolate.

3142
02:46:03,500 --> 02:46:05,340
Yeah, maybe.

3143
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:06,540
I'd try it.

3144
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:08,260
You ever eat like cheese and onion crisps

3145
02:46:08,260 --> 02:46:09,540
and then had some chocolate right afterwards?

3146
02:46:09,540 --> 02:46:11,540
It's surprisingly good.

3147
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:15,500
I've sometimes had like like some dark chocolate

3148
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:18,060
and then like some salty snack.

3149
02:46:18,140 --> 02:46:21,140
Yeah, inside it and the same time or like just bread.

3150
02:46:21,220 --> 02:46:25,500
Bread, tiger bread and dark chocolate is like a great combo.

3151
02:46:25,620 --> 02:46:27,460
Tiger bread.

3152
02:46:27,460 --> 02:46:30,900
It's it's like bread with like burn melted cheese on the top.

3153
02:46:30,900 --> 02:46:32,500
Yeah.

3154
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:33,980
That kind of cheese.

3155
02:46:33,980 --> 02:46:36,940
Is it? Oh, I thought it was just like a funny

3156
02:46:38,020 --> 02:46:38,860
something or other.

3157
02:46:38,860 --> 02:46:41,220
No, I'm pretty sure it's just like over cheese.

3158
02:46:41,340 --> 02:46:42,500
I've probably said this before,

3159
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:44,860
but the pattern on this bread is much more reminiscent

3160
02:46:44,860 --> 02:46:47,540
of a giraffe than a tiger.

3161
02:46:48,340 --> 02:46:50,740
So the tiger.

3162
02:46:50,740 --> 02:46:52,220
All right, all right, look at this bullshit

3163
02:46:52,220 --> 02:46:54,660
if it'll actually copy the case.

3164
02:46:54,660 --> 02:46:56,460
Yeah.

3165
02:46:56,460 --> 02:46:59,300
Well, briefcase my fucking there,

3166
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:03,580
fucking spicy Cheetos flaming hot ice cream.

3167
02:47:03,700 --> 02:47:05,700
Why?

3168
02:47:05,700 --> 02:47:07,140
They were just sweet.

3169
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:11,180
It can't just taste like hot cheese.

3170
02:47:12,700 --> 02:47:17,060
Oh, I went to the fucking marble slab at the mall

3171
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:19,780
and they had this poster and they replaced

3172
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:24,340
Kai's banana flavor that he loves with this.

3173
02:47:25,380 --> 02:47:27,020
How dare they?

3174
02:47:27,020 --> 02:47:28,180
Did you try it?

3175
02:47:28,180 --> 02:47:32,780
No, I got chocolate with marshmallow and I want to I want to try it.

3176
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:36,940
You know, and cream are both derived from milk.

3177
02:47:37,500 --> 02:47:39,300
OK, but it's like spicy.

3178
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:41,660
It's like burning the space.

3179
02:47:41,860 --> 02:47:43,900
The idea. OK, here's what I think.

3180
02:47:43,900 --> 02:47:48,740
I think it's probably not like actually tastes like hot Cheetos.

3181
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:50,980
I think it's probably some other flavor.

3182
02:47:51,100 --> 02:47:52,780
Like it looks like it's strawberry or something,

3183
02:47:52,780 --> 02:47:54,580
but maybe it has a little bit of spiciness in it.

3184
02:47:54,580 --> 02:47:56,460
Yeah, I think it's just spicy vanilla.

3185
02:47:56,460 --> 02:47:58,780
I bet you that's what it is.

3186
02:47:58,780 --> 02:48:00,780
He's he's staring at you.

3187
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:05,620
I miss I can't I can't find rain, rain,

3188
02:48:05,620 --> 02:48:09,260
thermo, strawberry jalapeno anymore.

3189
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:10,900
That was my favorite rain flavor.

3190
02:48:10,900 --> 02:48:12,740
I like the spicy strawberry.

3191
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:14,820
You drink rain. What the hell?

3192
02:48:14,820 --> 02:48:18,300
Yeah, R.E.R.E.I.G.N.

3193
02:48:18,740 --> 02:48:23,380
It is a it is a bang like it is a bang like produced by the monster company.

3194
02:48:23,380 --> 02:48:27,260
I thought Boston was so polluted that you could taste different flavors

3195
02:48:27,260 --> 02:48:29,220
of rain depending on how heavy it was raining.

3196
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:31,940
And you were outside and opening your mouth.

3197
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:33,420
Well, since it snowed yesterday,

3198
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:36,940
Munchie was saying that he was going to make snow cones out of the snow.

3199
02:48:36,940 --> 02:48:39,860
But then someone was saying like, no, no.

3200
02:48:39,940 --> 02:48:42,380
If it if it if it snows in the city,

3201
02:48:42,380 --> 02:48:45,700
it absorbs all the pollution from the air, like from the atmosphere,

3202
02:48:45,700 --> 02:48:47,660
like it have all the pollution in it.

3203
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:48,660
Don't eat the snow.

3204
02:48:48,660 --> 02:48:50,820
Even carbon monoxide in your belly.

3205
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:53,300
Even the clean surface snow is toxic.

3206
02:48:53,420 --> 02:48:56,100
Well, I mean, I would recommend about toxic,

3207
02:48:56,100 --> 02:48:58,860
but it would definitely be a bit grimy.

3208
02:48:58,860 --> 02:49:01,300
It would be a bit unclean as I was just sitting outside.

3209
02:49:01,300 --> 02:49:02,340
I don't know. I'm entrusted.

3210
02:49:02,340 --> 02:49:04,620
That's everything. No, that's so dumb.

3211
02:49:04,620 --> 02:49:07,660
OK, I don't know about all this absorb from the from the air.

3212
02:49:07,780 --> 02:49:10,660
That does happen with rain.

3213
02:49:10,660 --> 02:49:12,780
OK, like if you but it's not.

3214
02:49:12,780 --> 02:49:15,980
But but if it's like, OK, if the air was clean,

3215
02:49:15,980 --> 02:49:18,620
then if it was just like snow, like on the ground,

3216
02:49:18,620 --> 02:49:21,900
like if it was like a foot deep, you could grab some off the top of the surface

3217
02:49:21,900 --> 02:49:23,220
and it wouldn't have it wouldn't be grimy.

3218
02:49:23,220 --> 02:49:25,060
There wouldn't be any dirt on it.

3219
02:49:25,060 --> 02:49:27,380
It would just be it would be clean from the top of the snow pile.

3220
02:49:27,380 --> 02:49:29,460
It wouldn't be dirt.

3221
02:49:29,460 --> 02:49:34,300
But the as it falls through the air, it picks up tiny particulates.

3222
02:49:34,300 --> 02:49:35,620
OK, I'm sorry.

3223
02:49:36,620 --> 02:49:39,700
If you grab if you grab fruit off off a tree, you wash it.

3224
02:49:39,700 --> 02:49:41,580
But if you wash snow, it'll melt.

3225
02:49:41,580 --> 02:49:42,540
So what can you do?

3226
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:45,980
You can't clean it, spin outdoors, a bug sat on it.

3227
02:49:45,980 --> 02:49:48,060
Probably if it's if it's really cold outside,

3228
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:50,820
you left some ice cream out there all all night and it didn't melt

3229
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:53,140
because it's really cold. Would you eat it?

3230
02:49:53,140 --> 02:49:54,580
No, same thing.

3231
02:49:54,580 --> 02:49:56,940
What? Why not?

3232
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:00,420
Well, you mean like ice cream?

3233
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:02,140
You're not what bugs get on it, Ben.

3234
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:04,540
What bugs have gotten on my snow?

3235
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:07,660
Oh, like wait, like just out.

3236
02:50:07,660 --> 02:50:10,380
Yeah, I can't believe what I'm hearing.

3237
02:50:10,380 --> 02:50:13,460
You guys are like weirded out by the thought of like eating snow off the ground.

3238
02:50:13,460 --> 02:50:15,300
No, no, I'm not.

3239
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:20,060
I eat snow, but I just think it's funny that I eat snow, but I wouldn't eat another thing.

3240
02:50:20,460 --> 02:50:23,180
OK, well, I think about like like pollution in the air

3241
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:26,540
getting into the snow as it falls is a true thing.

3242
02:50:26,660 --> 02:50:28,140
I don't know how bad it would be.

3243
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:31,140
Ice cream is full of sugar, so I'm sure it would attract pests.

3244
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:34,060
Yeah, I probably would if it just left a bear ice cream cone outside.

3245
02:50:34,060 --> 02:50:35,900
No, I would need it.

3246
02:50:35,900 --> 02:50:40,140
But like if I left it out in like a pint in like a closed pint, sure.

3247
02:50:40,460 --> 02:50:43,660
Yeah. OK, OK, whatever. OK, whatever.

3248
02:50:43,820 --> 02:50:45,620
I don't know. I'd never heard this thing.

3249
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:49,580
I'd never heard this thing about absorbing toxins from the air before, but but maybe.

3250
02:50:49,940 --> 02:50:51,420
OK, I think it would kill you.

3251
02:50:51,420 --> 02:50:53,220
But I'm sure. No, whatever.

3252
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:58,820
All right. Next voicemail is an image of Emmanuel Macron.

3253
02:50:59,300 --> 02:51:02,100
I don't know. We missed one because I posted the What's It's Oreo image.

3254
02:51:03,100 --> 02:51:04,860
Oh, you're right. You're right.

3255
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:08,340
Janice, right. Janice. OK, three, two, one, go.

3256
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:11,100
If you haven't heard the news yet,

3257
02:51:11,540 --> 02:51:14,140
Scott Pilgrim is getting an anime editor.

3258
02:51:14,140 --> 02:51:18,020
You asked this last week and the author is going to be the executive producer

3259
02:51:18,020 --> 02:51:19,500
on the project. Nice.

3260
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:25,140
This made me wonder, since your comic's art style was mainly influenced by Scott.

3261
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:26,740
The exact same question last week.

3262
02:51:26,740 --> 02:51:30,660
How would you feel if your comics were adapted into anime?

3263
02:51:31,180 --> 02:51:36,340
And how would you feel about Japanese dubbing of your own creative character?

3264
02:51:36,340 --> 02:51:37,540
No, I answered this last week.

3265
02:51:37,540 --> 02:51:43,220
Next voicemail is a next voicemail is a an image of Emmanuel Macron.

3266
02:51:43,580 --> 02:51:45,500
Oh, my God. I don't know.

3267
02:51:45,500 --> 02:51:46,540
Oh, my God.

3268
02:51:46,540 --> 02:51:50,700
Posted in the first two of them and then not reaching for.

3269
02:51:51,100 --> 02:51:52,900
Oh, this is OK.

3270
02:51:52,900 --> 02:51:54,020
This is just a bunch of stuff.

3271
02:51:54,020 --> 02:51:58,580
Emmanuel Macron said I saw I saw a good one of these

3272
02:51:58,580 --> 02:52:02,780
political compasses about I think it was JFK.

3273
02:52:02,780 --> 02:52:05,700
No, it wasn't JFK. It was FDR.

3274
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:09,060
No, was it FDR? Was it Eisenhower? I don't know.

3275
02:52:10,180 --> 02:52:12,340
Whatever. Thanks for the fucking meme.

3276
02:52:12,340 --> 02:52:15,020
I don't care. No, not reading it.

3277
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:19,140
Next voicemail is a Tumblr link.

3278
02:52:19,900 --> 02:52:21,500
Here it is.

3279
02:52:21,500 --> 02:52:22,900
Tumblr.

3280
02:52:22,900 --> 02:52:24,300
I don't know those words in here.

3281
02:52:24,300 --> 02:52:25,180
So there's nothing here.

3282
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:27,300
There's nothing here. It's a broken link.

3283
02:52:27,300 --> 02:52:27,940
All right, cool.

3284
02:52:28,300 --> 02:52:29,860
We're moving right along.

3285
02:52:29,860 --> 02:52:31,100
Use a link shortener.

3286
02:52:31,100 --> 02:52:33,220
Use a URL shortener next time voicemail.

3287
02:52:33,220 --> 02:52:36,900
Yeah, next voicemail is another image.

3288
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:39,060
It's called Improved the podcast logo.

3289
02:52:39,060 --> 02:52:42,700
This is from the freaking epic artist at the artist.

3290
02:52:42,700 --> 02:52:44,980
Freaking the freaking.

3291
02:52:48,300 --> 02:52:52,020
Fixed your logo and finally made it make good good and make sense.

3292
02:52:52,020 --> 02:52:53,500
Please use it from now on.

3293
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:55,540
Oh, OK.

3294
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:56,780
Why the fuck not?

3295
02:52:56,820 --> 02:52:59,660
I guess. Yeah, Ben said more like Ben Tate.

3296
02:52:59,660 --> 02:53:01,140
Given Tate more like Given Snake.

3297
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:02,940
Tom Oliver more like who?

3298
02:53:02,940 --> 02:53:04,580
Hey, that's my joke.

3299
02:53:04,580 --> 02:53:06,220
They stole it. Why?

3300
02:53:06,220 --> 02:53:08,020
Why did you say about me?

3301
02:53:08,020 --> 02:53:09,140
There's the text at the bottom.

3302
02:53:09,140 --> 02:53:10,780
Given Snake.

3303
02:53:10,780 --> 02:53:12,900
They called you Given Snake.

3304
02:53:12,900 --> 02:53:15,580
Given Snake. That's fair.

3305
02:53:15,580 --> 02:53:17,060
Because I got a really long neck.

3306
02:53:17,060 --> 02:53:18,620
Yeah, like Charlotte.

3307
02:53:18,620 --> 02:53:20,700
And I am entirely neck.

3308
02:53:20,700 --> 02:53:22,940
This is objectively better than our current logo.

3309
02:53:22,940 --> 02:53:24,060
That's true.

3310
02:53:24,060 --> 02:53:26,020
I remember Ben's Tate.

3311
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:28,580
You could put you could set that as the YouTube thing

3312
02:53:28,580 --> 02:53:30,980
and nobody would notice how screwed up it is.

3313
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:33,780
Honestly, maybe I just fucking will.

3314
02:53:33,780 --> 02:53:36,540
Maybe if I'm in the mood later, I will do exactly that.

3315
02:53:36,820 --> 02:53:39,700
Well, it's about on April Fool's, but then never change it back.

3316
02:53:41,820 --> 02:53:46,460
A February Fool's next next voicemail is called.

3317
02:53:47,620 --> 02:53:48,220
What's it called?

3318
02:53:48,220 --> 02:53:50,900
It's called Improving Your Intros 5000

3319
02:53:50,900 --> 02:53:53,180
percent with this one weird trick.

3320
02:53:53,180 --> 02:53:55,380
Three, two, one, go.

3321
02:53:55,420 --> 02:53:57,140
All right, PCP, here's the deal.

3322
02:53:57,140 --> 02:53:57,860
No intro, right?

3323
02:53:57,860 --> 02:53:59,180
I'm a Zoomer.

3324
02:53:59,180 --> 02:54:01,220
I grew up watching YouTubers.

3325
02:54:01,220 --> 02:54:03,660
And while I do enjoy the PCP, you know,

3326
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:07,260
there's one thing that just really piss me off about podcasts.

3327
02:54:07,620 --> 02:54:10,420
And it's the fact that you're not YouTuber enough.

3328
02:54:10,820 --> 02:54:13,540
Every time I watch, you know, a new podcast, a new video,

3329
02:54:13,780 --> 02:54:14,780
I don't know what to do.

3330
02:54:14,780 --> 02:54:17,340
You don't give me fricking instructions.

3331
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:20,020
And any viewer like me will not know what to do.

3332
02:54:20,300 --> 02:54:24,180
So from now on, I want you to have a similar intro to this,

3333
02:54:24,180 --> 02:54:26,060
what I'm about to do right now.

3334
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:31,620
What's up, PCP Nation coming back right at you again

3335
02:54:31,620 --> 02:54:34,780
with a new video, a new podcast.

3336
02:54:34,780 --> 02:54:37,940
And guys, this one is going to be crazy.

3337
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:42,420
But before you watch, remember to like, subscribe,

3338
02:54:42,660 --> 02:54:45,580
bring that bell, put on all notifications

3339
02:54:45,580 --> 02:54:47,540
so you don't miss a single upload.

3340
02:54:47,540 --> 02:54:50,340
And remember to watch the entire video

3341
02:54:50,820 --> 02:54:52,260
preferably multiple times.

3342
02:54:52,300 --> 02:54:54,340
So we get that sweet watch.

3343
02:54:54,340 --> 02:54:57,380
I want. All right, guys, we'll see you next time.

3344
02:54:57,380 --> 02:54:59,220
Just watch this video from now.

3345
02:54:59,220 --> 02:55:00,420
Very cool. Yeah.

3346
02:55:00,420 --> 02:55:02,740
I want people to know that sort of intro.

3347
02:55:02,740 --> 02:55:06,260
So the viewers will know what's what's up, what to do.

3348
02:55:06,340 --> 02:55:08,500
I want people to miss our uploads and people like.

3349
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:12,940
Can we get Eliza to put that at the beginning of the episode?

3350
02:55:13,060 --> 02:55:15,700
Just like just some guy saying, what's up, guys?

3351
02:55:15,700 --> 02:55:16,700
Welcome to a new video.

3352
02:55:16,700 --> 02:55:18,700
Some guy.

3353
02:55:18,700 --> 02:55:20,660
Sure. Why not?

3354
02:55:20,660 --> 02:55:23,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, in fact, put it at the beginning of every episode

3355
02:55:23,940 --> 02:55:25,580
from now on, so we don't have to do it.

3356
02:55:25,580 --> 02:55:27,580
I don't like.

3357
02:55:27,580 --> 02:55:31,660
I don't like the YouTube thing that has become normal.

3358
02:55:31,900 --> 02:55:35,140
It was it was like hilariously bad.

3359
02:55:35,660 --> 02:55:37,820
We the entire time and it still is.

3360
02:55:37,820 --> 02:55:39,340
But people are just used to it now.

3361
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:42,020
Dude, I fucking hate like terminal YouTube of voice.

3362
02:55:42,020 --> 02:55:44,940
I see it when I when I if I find like an obscure Minecraft video,

3363
02:55:44,940 --> 02:55:47,660
I guarantee they'll be like, oh, what's up, guys?

3364
02:55:47,660 --> 02:55:52,980
We'll go back to another Minecraft video and they just just fucking it's awful.

3365
02:55:52,980 --> 02:55:54,420
I can't understand what they're saying.

3366
02:55:54,420 --> 02:55:57,780
It's a roller coaster of of like like literally like.

3367
02:56:00,780 --> 02:56:04,100
Welcome to the one of German craft.

3368
02:56:04,700 --> 02:56:08,580
The the I don't want you to I don't want you to subscribe.

3369
02:56:08,620 --> 02:56:11,500
Here's what I want you to go to the Patreon pledge to the Patreon.

3370
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:14,420
And then I want you to go unsubscribe and unring that bell.

3371
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:17,620
So just forget that we exist and forget that you're pledged.

3372
02:56:17,700 --> 02:56:20,540
It's what happened to David Lynch to give and take instead.

3373
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:23,860
Patreon.com slash give and take.

3374
02:56:23,860 --> 02:56:26,180
Uh, it's what is this?

3375
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:31,140
It's it's David Lynch at like a weekly podcast thing where he had a funny fucking

3376
02:56:31,140 --> 02:56:34,820
YouTuber intro and he just started like every time he said it,

3377
02:56:34,820 --> 02:56:36,060
he just like made the vow.

3378
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:40,540
He drew out the vowel sounds even longer and someone compiled it.

3379
02:56:40,540 --> 02:56:44,260
And it's just like the second half of the video is just him going.

3380
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:49,620
Ooh, like just like over various videos like half a year.

3381
02:56:49,980 --> 02:56:55,020
I'm reeling a little bit from the fact that like David Lynch uploads YouTube like vlogs.

3382
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:56,580
What the hell?

3383
02:56:57,900 --> 02:57:01,060
In circle David Lynch saying what January one.

3384
02:57:02,100 --> 02:57:04,780
Ali's are the intro of the podcast should just be him going.

3385
02:57:06,140 --> 02:57:07,660
That's the intro.

3386
02:57:10,420 --> 02:57:11,420
Very nice.

3387
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:13,100
What is it?

3388
02:57:13,100 --> 02:57:15,460
What word is he saying?

3389
02:57:15,460 --> 02:57:19,100
Is he saying you to?

3390
02:57:19,100 --> 02:57:22,900
I like to believe that he just sat there for an entire year straight doing this.

3391
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:27,660
OK, I can't I can't listen to any more of this.

3392
02:57:27,660 --> 02:57:28,660
I can't stand it.

3393
02:57:28,660 --> 02:57:30,660
Thank you David Lynch.

3394
02:57:32,540 --> 02:57:35,980
Next voicemail I posted it up above is called Banana.

3395
02:57:36,380 --> 02:57:38,300
Three, two, one, go.

3396
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:42,740
Does your life have a principle or a set of principles?

3397
02:57:42,740 --> 02:57:43,340
No.

3398
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:46,940
The principle crop from Captain Underpants.

3399
02:57:46,940 --> 02:57:49,620
Fuck, how are dying?

3400
02:57:49,620 --> 02:57:53,300
I like probably do, but I couldn't explain it because I don't know how to speak.

3401
02:57:53,660 --> 02:57:55,860
I would say I like to not have a boss.

3402
02:57:55,860 --> 02:57:58,020
I like to own my work.

3403
02:57:58,020 --> 02:57:59,180
I like to own.

3404
02:57:59,180 --> 02:58:02,540
I like to own my work, I think is one of my guiding principles.

3405
02:58:03,180 --> 02:58:05,460
I guess that's a pretty good one.

3406
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:07,980
Be nice and smiley to everybody.

3407
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:12,740
If I have a ridiculous idea, no one's going to make it unless I do it.

3408
02:58:12,740 --> 02:58:15,060
So I have to. That's a good one.

3409
02:58:15,060 --> 02:58:18,100
Yeah, that's where all the voicemails came from, by the way, I'm sorry.

3410
02:58:20,260 --> 02:58:23,060
Yeah, where? Where else?

3411
02:58:23,060 --> 02:58:24,100
No one else is going to do it.

3412
02:58:24,100 --> 02:58:29,020
I had to know nobody else was going to be snakes.

3413
02:58:30,540 --> 02:58:32,900
It's true, sad, but true.

3414
02:58:32,900 --> 02:58:34,660
All right, next next one is called.

3415
02:58:34,900 --> 02:58:38,700
Next one is called Stonks.

3416
02:58:38,860 --> 02:58:41,100
OK, three, two, one, go.

3417
02:58:42,700 --> 02:58:44,060
Then it's it's happening.

3418
02:58:44,060 --> 02:58:44,580
It's happening.

3419
02:58:44,580 --> 02:58:47,340
AOC is down. It's down a whole bunch and you can buy in.

3420
02:58:47,340 --> 02:58:51,820
You can buy in with all the AOC is down and you can buy in and then it's going to moon

3421
02:58:51,820 --> 02:58:55,060
and then we're going to be fucking rich. We're all going to be rich.

3422
02:58:55,060 --> 02:58:59,580
You know, like unless it's a week later, so maybe it's down even more

3423
02:58:59,580 --> 02:59:02,500
or maybe it's already mooned and it would be too late.

3424
02:59:02,980 --> 02:59:03,820
Who the fuck knows?

3425
02:59:05,660 --> 02:59:08,300
Bitcoin, how did how did how did Bitcoin do today?

3426
02:59:08,300 --> 02:59:11,460
Yeah, it's kind of just plateauing.

3427
02:59:11,540 --> 02:59:12,580
It went big, big.

3428
02:59:12,580 --> 02:59:14,540
It went big down.

3429
02:59:14,540 --> 02:59:19,940
It went big down when Trixie premiered that new video because of that new video

3430
02:59:20,500 --> 02:59:23,100
announcing that she hates did you broke Crater?

3431
02:59:23,100 --> 02:59:26,220
No, Crater, it cratered the value of Ethereum and Bitcoin.

3432
02:59:26,540 --> 02:59:27,900
The market will never recover.

3433
02:59:27,900 --> 02:59:30,220
It has it has bumped up a little bit since then.

3434
02:59:30,220 --> 02:59:30,900
It's recovered a bit.

3435
02:59:30,900 --> 02:59:33,980
It's kind of plateauing around 38 Le Mans.

3436
02:59:34,820 --> 02:59:37,260
Damn, man, Bitcoin's fucked.

3437
02:59:37,260 --> 02:59:39,140
The coins really fucked up.

3438
02:59:39,140 --> 02:59:41,060
I really don't like it.

3439
02:59:41,060 --> 02:59:44,380
Did you watch the did you watch that line go up video?

3440
02:59:44,620 --> 02:59:45,500
Oh, yeah, I've watched that.

3441
02:59:45,500 --> 02:59:51,060
But even before that, I found these this info on the energy consumption

3442
02:59:52,180 --> 02:59:56,980
of Bitcoin, like if you're in the second worst, Bitcoin is the worst by far.

3443
02:59:57,580 --> 03:00:00,140
Yeah, I think it's something like one point five million visa

3444
03:00:00,140 --> 03:00:04,020
transactions is the equivalent energy cost of a single Bitcoin transaction.

3445
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:07,460
Bitcoin is like specifically designed to be inefficient.

3446
03:00:07,500 --> 03:00:11,260
Like it's it's supposed to it's supposed to be slow and unwieldy

3447
03:00:11,260 --> 03:00:13,620
in a way that is designed to mimic gold.

3448
03:00:14,940 --> 03:00:19,820
Yeah, but worse and all the energy comes from everyone doing repeat work.

3449
03:00:20,540 --> 03:00:22,460
Yeah, everyone trying to mine the same

3450
03:00:22,660 --> 03:00:26,220
like hundreds of people mining the same coin, but only one person actually gets it.

3451
03:00:26,220 --> 03:00:29,220
And then all the other 99 people or more who are mining that coin.

3452
03:00:29,620 --> 03:00:30,820
The energy goes in the trash.

3453
03:00:30,820 --> 03:00:31,860
It was worthless.

3454
03:00:31,860 --> 03:00:34,420
But man, this this this technology is so amazing.

3455
03:00:34,500 --> 03:00:36,700
Isn't it so isn't it so good?

3456
03:00:36,700 --> 03:00:38,540
It's it's it's great.

3457
03:00:38,540 --> 03:00:42,540
If it's great, if what you think technology is supposed to do is like

3458
03:00:42,900 --> 03:00:48,300
partition things away from the public so that someone can charge money for them.

3459
03:00:48,420 --> 03:00:51,460
Yeah, but if you think if you think if you think that's a technological

3460
03:00:51,460 --> 03:00:52,900
announcement, it's public, though, right?

3461
03:00:52,900 --> 03:00:54,340
Like it's all a public.

3462
03:00:54,340 --> 03:00:55,940
You can look you sure you can look at it.

3463
03:00:55,940 --> 03:00:56,780
Yeah, it's publicly.

3464
03:00:56,780 --> 03:01:00,540
But then it's decentralized by which I mean it's it's it's not

3465
03:01:00,580 --> 03:01:02,980
decentralized, actually.

3466
03:01:02,980 --> 03:01:03,980
It's dude, it's dude.

3467
03:01:03,980 --> 03:01:05,780
I love how decentralized NFTs are.

3468
03:01:05,780 --> 03:01:08,020
I mean, I can't wait to get my NFT show on Amazon.

3469
03:01:08,460 --> 03:01:10,500
It's it's decentralized.

3470
03:01:10,500 --> 03:01:14,620
It's decentralized right up until anyone has a dispute and then a fucking

3471
03:01:14,620 --> 03:01:18,700
coven of witches get together to decide the fate of everyone.

3472
03:01:18,700 --> 03:01:20,380
Did that stupid fucking NFT

3473
03:01:20,380 --> 03:01:21,700
cartoon ever actually come out?

3474
03:01:21,700 --> 03:01:23,900
Was it just a little 10 second clip I saw?

3475
03:01:23,900 --> 03:01:24,860
No, no, no.

3476
03:01:24,860 --> 03:01:27,740
It's like a six minute family is free NFT cartoons.

3477
03:01:27,740 --> 03:01:31,700
And Reddit family had an episode and it's like on Amazon Prime or on

3478
03:01:31,700 --> 03:01:34,180
some service or some garbage or where it's going.

3479
03:01:34,340 --> 03:01:36,620
I don't know. It's it's it's a six minutes long.

3480
03:01:36,620 --> 03:01:37,980
I didn't actually watch it.

3481
03:01:37,980 --> 03:01:39,740
I I didn't watch it.

3482
03:01:39,740 --> 03:01:42,260
I watched someone else watch it.

3483
03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:45,580
I watched I watched the dire gentleman recap it.

3484
03:01:45,740 --> 03:01:48,900
And they they didn't watch it real time.

3485
03:01:48,900 --> 03:01:50,380
So I had no idea how long it was.

3486
03:01:50,380 --> 03:01:54,020
I got the feeling that it was like 15 minutes, but maybe it's shorter than that.

3487
03:01:55,060 --> 03:01:56,260
Looks great.

3488
03:01:56,300 --> 03:01:58,180
Looks amazing.

3489
03:01:58,180 --> 03:01:59,780
I might go watch this episode.

3490
03:01:59,780 --> 03:02:01,580
Just see. I'm curious.

3491
03:02:01,580 --> 03:02:04,180
It's unless it gives the money in which case I won't.

3492
03:02:04,780 --> 03:02:07,220
It's pretty. It's pretty good.

3493
03:02:07,340 --> 03:02:10,100
It's pretty great, actually.

3494
03:02:11,100 --> 03:02:14,820
It's it's maybe slightly better than you might expect from a.

3495
03:02:14,900 --> 03:02:16,740
No, that's not even true.

3496
03:02:16,740 --> 03:02:17,380
That's not it.

3497
03:02:17,380 --> 03:02:18,820
It's going to say what?

3498
03:02:18,820 --> 03:02:19,820
Wait, what?

3499
03:02:19,820 --> 03:02:21,980
I was going to I was going to say, yeah, no, no,

3500
03:02:21,980 --> 03:02:24,260
because like just so much NFT art looks like shit.

3501
03:02:24,260 --> 03:02:26,700
And like, at least it is a card.

3502
03:02:26,700 --> 03:02:28,860
I guess it is a cartoon.

3503
03:02:28,860 --> 03:02:29,460
I mean, it's not.

3504
03:02:29,460 --> 03:02:30,780
It doesn't look good or anything.

3505
03:02:30,780 --> 03:02:33,940
But they look like I guess I guess they did make it.

3506
03:02:34,300 --> 03:02:35,420
It's it's pretty dog.

3507
03:02:35,420 --> 03:02:36,980
It's no smiling friends.

3508
03:02:36,980 --> 03:02:38,500
I'll tell you that.

3509
03:02:38,500 --> 03:02:40,260
I still I still haven't watched smiling.

3510
03:02:40,260 --> 03:02:42,900
Smiling friends is just a joy.

3511
03:02:43,300 --> 03:02:44,500
It's good. I should.

3512
03:02:44,500 --> 03:02:45,700
I should watch it.

3513
03:02:45,700 --> 03:02:47,860
It seems good.

3514
03:02:47,860 --> 03:02:50,740
All right. Next one, which was that?

3515
03:02:50,860 --> 03:02:55,220
Seventy one next voicemail is there it is.

3516
03:02:56,100 --> 03:02:57,580
And it is called.

3517
03:02:57,580 --> 03:02:58,940
Fuck, I can't print.

3518
03:02:58,940 --> 03:03:03,420
Annihilation Road to Radcon three, two, one, go.

3519
03:03:04,700 --> 03:03:06,940
Hello, Ben and Gibb. Hello, PCP.

3520
03:03:08,980 --> 03:03:13,380
I've just finished finally the copy of Road to Radcon

3521
03:03:13,380 --> 03:03:15,180
that I bought recently.

3522
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:20,340
And from it, I come away with a lesson and a question.

3523
03:03:20,780 --> 03:03:22,740
The lesson being that Ben St.

3524
03:03:22,740 --> 03:03:26,820
is a significantly better writer than Trixie is.

3525
03:03:27,540 --> 03:03:30,980
The other thing, the question is,

3526
03:03:31,620 --> 03:03:35,460
since I'm a bit of a new fan and listener of the podcast,

3527
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:38,140
who really only started listening to the episodes

3528
03:03:38,500 --> 03:03:42,460
after the great exodus, shall we call it, happened.

3529
03:03:42,740 --> 03:03:48,100
Yeah. What or whom is cold corona?

3530
03:03:48,500 --> 03:03:51,260
Is there any short form answer to this or any

3531
03:03:51,940 --> 03:03:55,380
piece of content that I can be pointed to to explain what the

3532
03:03:55,380 --> 03:04:00,020
fuck amazing because I am a bit confused.

3533
03:04:00,540 --> 03:04:03,420
Otherwise, a good wrap up on the story, Ben.

3534
03:04:04,220 --> 03:04:05,100
I've got to be honest.

3535
03:04:05,100 --> 03:04:06,900
I'm not really sure either.

3536
03:04:06,900 --> 03:04:08,460
What? Really?

3537
03:04:08,460 --> 03:04:10,780
I've never really gotten this because you haven't.

3538
03:04:10,780 --> 03:04:12,460
You haven't watched Jesse's videos.

3539
03:04:12,460 --> 03:04:13,940
So that's why. No, that's true.

3540
03:04:13,940 --> 03:04:14,740
I haven't watched the single.

3541
03:04:14,780 --> 03:04:17,500
Yeah, he's a corona is a real.

3542
03:04:18,100 --> 03:04:18,700
His videos.

3543
03:04:18,700 --> 03:04:20,540
If you don't know, if you don't know,

3544
03:04:21,180 --> 03:04:24,020
Road to Radcon, the ending of Road to Radcon,

3545
03:04:24,020 --> 03:04:29,500
basically, the entire conclusion is about is centered on cold corona.

3546
03:04:29,780 --> 03:04:31,660
It's like about him. OK.

3547
03:04:31,660 --> 03:04:35,860
Because I wrote the road to Radcon, but I haven't opened it at all.

3548
03:04:35,860 --> 03:04:37,540
OK.

3549
03:04:37,540 --> 03:04:42,540
The corona is like like Jesse's video game reviews

3550
03:04:42,900 --> 03:04:45,740
were like half like sincere video game stuff

3551
03:04:45,740 --> 03:04:49,140
and also parodies of like that guy with the glasses as content.

3552
03:04:49,340 --> 03:04:55,340
And Colt Corona was supposed to be like the stupid idiot character

3553
03:04:55,340 --> 03:04:58,540
that like reviewers often have.

3554
03:04:59,340 --> 03:05:03,220
And like things would happen like, well, I'm in this video.

3555
03:05:05,300 --> 03:05:07,700
What's going on, Jesse?

3556
03:05:07,700 --> 03:05:10,100
He had like that sort of a relationship.

3557
03:05:11,100 --> 03:05:13,500
And he's like grown beyond that.

3558
03:05:13,500 --> 03:05:19,660
He's he was like the front, like the the main character of like the horseshoe saga.

3559
03:05:20,580 --> 03:05:24,260
And he's like, yeah, he's he's in bodies.

3560
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:26,740
All of the worst traits of the Brony Frandom.

3561
03:05:27,100 --> 03:05:30,380
It's it's he's a complex guy, but he's also like really stupid.

3562
03:05:30,380 --> 03:05:31,740
He's just got a horse head.

3563
03:05:31,740 --> 03:05:33,660
He has the innocence of a child.

3564
03:05:33,660 --> 03:05:36,780
He has like a child's mind, but he's like a violent like

3565
03:05:37,780 --> 03:05:40,660
rapist, I think.

3566
03:05:40,660 --> 03:05:43,700
Now, that's Michelangelo Michelangelo.

3567
03:05:43,860 --> 03:05:45,660
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you're right.

3568
03:05:45,660 --> 03:05:47,460
Donatello. That's not a tello.

3569
03:05:47,460 --> 03:05:49,580
That's not a tello.

3570
03:05:49,580 --> 03:05:52,860
He sang that funny vapor wave song, I don't know.

3571
03:05:53,180 --> 03:05:54,620
Yeah, he's he's a Jesse.

3572
03:05:54,620 --> 03:05:58,580
He's he's Jesse wearing a horse mask, but he's a whole character unto himself.

3573
03:05:58,580 --> 03:06:02,700
OK. So yeah, that's hard to like explain

3574
03:06:02,700 --> 03:06:04,940
because I haven't really tried to explain him.

3575
03:06:04,940 --> 03:06:07,980
But yeah, I won't I won't I won't explain

3576
03:06:07,980 --> 03:06:11,300
what his role is in the ending of Road to Radcon

3577
03:06:11,580 --> 03:06:15,340
available at stcomics.com slash store dot html.

3578
03:06:15,340 --> 03:06:17,300
I won't explain his role because it would be a spoiler.

3579
03:06:17,300 --> 03:06:19,940
But it's just really funny.

3580
03:06:19,940 --> 03:06:22,740
It's just really funny to imagine like a new

3581
03:06:22,740 --> 03:06:25,860
a new PCP fan who is not familiar with all that stuff.

3582
03:06:25,860 --> 03:06:28,260
Just being like, what what is this?

3583
03:06:28,260 --> 03:06:30,660
What does this mean?

3584
03:06:31,860 --> 03:06:33,460
Good, good question, though.

3585
03:06:33,460 --> 03:06:36,020
Yeah, it is great. It makes makes me smile.

3586
03:06:36,020 --> 03:06:38,380
A life history lesson for me. Awesome.

3587
03:06:39,780 --> 03:06:43,220
I'm trying to think if I wonder if there's other

3588
03:06:43,220 --> 03:06:47,660
like stuff in the ending that like you wouldn't understand.

3589
03:06:48,500 --> 03:06:51,380
That's that's probably the big one.

3590
03:06:51,380 --> 03:06:53,580
It's still out of like.

3591
03:06:55,140 --> 03:06:56,540
Yeah, I don't know. That's probably the big one.

3592
03:06:56,540 --> 03:06:59,620
Yeah, I'm glad I'm glad you liked my ending.

3593
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:03,340
I was not very confident in my prose writing ability.

3594
03:07:03,820 --> 03:07:06,340
So I'm glad you liked it.

3595
03:07:06,340 --> 03:07:09,540
Thanks. OK, next one is called.

3596
03:07:09,540 --> 03:07:13,100
It's just called OOH. OOH post.

3597
03:07:13,460 --> 03:07:15,780
OK, three, two, one, go.

3598
03:07:16,820 --> 03:07:22,780
OOH podcast, OOH me likey make longer.

3599
03:07:25,220 --> 03:07:26,260
Well, we got so many voicemails.

3600
03:07:26,260 --> 03:07:27,580
We're going to have a really long one this time.

3601
03:07:27,620 --> 03:07:29,620
It's an epic podcast.

3602
03:07:30,740 --> 03:07:32,500
You know, wait, I'm like going

3603
03:07:32,500 --> 03:07:34,780
heading to the store in like 20 minutes, by the way.

3604
03:07:34,780 --> 03:07:36,300
Really? OK, we might.

3605
03:07:36,300 --> 03:07:37,700
Well, we'll try to we'll try to be done.

3606
03:07:37,700 --> 03:07:39,660
But I want to say about the retro radical.

3607
03:07:39,660 --> 03:07:40,620
I did. I did try.

3608
03:07:40,620 --> 03:07:42,620
I actually tried to like sort of mimic

3609
03:07:42,900 --> 03:07:45,300
Trixie's like writing style a bit.

3610
03:07:45,300 --> 03:07:46,860
I don't know how successful I was,

3611
03:07:46,860 --> 03:07:49,460
but I tried to keep the like the tone consistent.

3612
03:07:50,060 --> 03:07:52,140
It was very respect, I'm sure.

3613
03:07:52,260 --> 03:07:55,660
It felt well like a good continuation.

3614
03:07:55,660 --> 03:07:58,820
I didn't feel like, all right, I'm taking over the show now.

3615
03:07:58,820 --> 03:08:01,100
And it's me, Ben saying, completely different.

3616
03:08:01,100 --> 03:08:03,660
Like you actually finished the story.

3617
03:08:03,660 --> 03:08:05,700
It was gone.

3618
03:08:05,700 --> 03:08:07,860
No, there were there was a tone.

3619
03:08:07,860 --> 03:08:11,060
There was a tone I tried to keep the tone consistent.

3620
03:08:11,060 --> 03:08:13,220
And I tried to keep like like like she would make

3621
03:08:14,100 --> 03:08:17,300
like the way that she would sort of like make a joke that was basically just a

3622
03:08:17,300 --> 03:08:21,100
sentence like she would just make like a long alliterative sentence or something

3623
03:08:21,100 --> 03:08:23,780
or just just attack like a bunch of weird adjective.

3624
03:08:23,780 --> 03:08:28,060
I tried to like sort of duplicate that and like and copy it a bit to

3625
03:08:29,620 --> 03:08:31,820
I thought it came up pretty good.

3626
03:08:31,820 --> 03:08:35,900
OK, next one is moving right along here.

3627
03:08:36,180 --> 03:08:39,940
Next one is a trans zone from Chip Wiseman.

3628
03:08:40,060 --> 03:08:42,940
Three, two, one, go.

3629
03:08:42,940 --> 03:08:44,860
Ni hao, Ben and Gib.

3630
03:08:44,860 --> 03:08:46,540
So actually, this is just a question for Gib.

3631
03:08:46,540 --> 03:08:50,340
So, Ben, if you want to go and draw your comic or something, feel free to do that.

3632
03:08:50,740 --> 03:08:53,140
So, Gib, I have a panel working on you.

3633
03:08:53,180 --> 03:08:58,180
We're talking about Davoo's new video and how her voice is like amazing.

3634
03:08:58,340 --> 03:09:03,900
And yeah, so as a trans femoid, who is, shall we say,

3635
03:09:03,900 --> 03:09:07,540
vocally challenged myself, I was wondering if you ever got back to her

3636
03:09:07,540 --> 03:09:09,580
and found out like what she does.

3637
03:09:09,580 --> 03:09:11,580
Does she have a personal vocal trainer?

3638
03:09:11,580 --> 03:09:13,380
What exercise does she do?

3639
03:09:13,380 --> 03:09:14,380
Stuff like that.

3640
03:09:14,380 --> 03:09:16,780
Second thing in the spirit of sharing the knowledge,

3641
03:09:16,780 --> 03:09:20,740
I'd like to put this out there for anybody who is on their own trans voice journey.

3642
03:09:21,180 --> 03:09:24,380
And that is, check out the YouTube channel called Trans Voice Lessons.

3643
03:09:24,900 --> 03:09:29,220
She does a bunch of videos, mostly going into like the theory of vocal feminization,

3644
03:09:29,740 --> 03:09:32,340
like, you know, physically what's happening with your different muscles

3645
03:09:32,340 --> 03:09:34,500
and voice folds and stuff.

3646
03:09:34,940 --> 03:09:38,660
It's really interesting stuff, great for understanding what's going on.

3647
03:09:38,740 --> 03:09:41,340
But she doesn't really go into the practical element of it much,

3648
03:09:41,340 --> 03:09:43,780
like actually what to do to practice.

3649
03:09:44,140 --> 03:09:46,020
So it's not a one stop shop.

3650
03:09:46,020 --> 03:09:48,980
Anyway, thank you and have a happy Chinese New Year.

3651
03:09:49,900 --> 03:09:51,380
Trans Voice Lessons.

3652
03:09:51,380 --> 03:09:53,500
Do they help trans males as well?

3653
03:09:53,500 --> 03:09:54,700
I wonder.

3654
03:09:54,700 --> 03:09:57,140
They they definitely would live.

3655
03:09:57,140 --> 03:09:58,580
It's about theory.

3656
03:09:58,580 --> 03:10:01,500
Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know about that YouTube channel.

3657
03:10:02,420 --> 03:10:05,220
But yeah, the people try to change their voice

3658
03:10:06,380 --> 03:10:08,380
in either direction.

3659
03:10:08,380 --> 03:10:10,540
Yeah, I never talked to Davoo about that.

3660
03:10:10,540 --> 03:10:12,540
I guess I should or could.

3661
03:10:13,420 --> 03:10:15,540
But I imagine the answer is just going to be like,

3662
03:10:16,020 --> 03:10:18,220
oh, yeah, I watched some YouTube videos about it.

3663
03:10:18,700 --> 03:10:20,300
And Chip, why not?

3664
03:10:20,300 --> 03:10:23,100
Chip, why not simply ask Davoo?

3665
03:10:23,100 --> 03:10:24,540
Why ask Gib?

3666
03:10:24,540 --> 03:10:26,780
Did you ask Davoo and what did Davoo say?

3667
03:10:26,780 --> 03:10:29,180
Why not simply ask Davoo?

3668
03:10:29,180 --> 03:10:30,020
I don't know.

3669
03:10:30,020 --> 03:10:31,860
She's hard to get in contact with.

3670
03:10:31,860 --> 03:10:34,460
It sounded like she had better voice than Davoo might have, anyway.

3671
03:10:36,100 --> 03:10:38,460
Yeah, probably. Yeah, whatever.

3672
03:10:38,620 --> 03:10:41,100
I just listened to a bit of this person's voice,

3673
03:10:41,220 --> 03:10:42,260
this trans voice lessons.

3674
03:10:42,260 --> 03:10:44,260
Yeah, they got a good voice.

3675
03:10:45,140 --> 03:10:45,700
All right, next.

3676
03:10:45,700 --> 03:10:46,860
The knowledge is all there.

3677
03:10:46,900 --> 03:10:49,900
It's just like, all right, time to commit to learning.

3678
03:10:49,900 --> 03:10:51,820
I'm like, oh, it's a whole skill.

3679
03:10:51,820 --> 03:10:53,460
I don't want to do that.

3680
03:10:53,460 --> 03:10:55,340
Absolutely. That's true.

3681
03:10:55,340 --> 03:10:57,340
Next one is X minus one.

3682
03:10:57,340 --> 03:10:59,300
Three. Did you miss one?

3683
03:10:59,300 --> 03:11:00,500
Did I miss one?

3684
03:11:00,500 --> 03:11:01,780
Yeah, there's a five second.

3685
03:11:01,780 --> 03:11:02,500
Oh, sorry, sorry.

3686
03:11:02,500 --> 03:11:05,300
Yeah, go go back to the five second one is X minus one.

3687
03:11:05,380 --> 03:11:08,300
OK, three, two, one, go.

3688
03:11:08,620 --> 03:11:10,380
Next.

3689
03:11:10,860 --> 03:11:12,940
Oh, God.

3690
03:11:12,940 --> 03:11:15,940
Oh, no, it's going to be the time it's three.

3691
03:11:15,940 --> 03:11:17,100
It's three hundred.

3692
03:11:17,100 --> 03:11:19,500
I don't I don't know what I don't know what we're going to do for three.

3693
03:11:19,500 --> 03:11:22,820
We're going to we're going to yell this is Sparta really loudly.

3694
03:11:23,220 --> 03:11:25,060
I hope it's not a disappointment

3695
03:11:25,060 --> 03:11:28,140
if we don't do anything super cool because I have nothing.

3696
03:11:28,140 --> 03:11:29,260
I have nothing in mind.

3697
03:11:29,260 --> 03:11:31,340
Sorry. Sorry.

3698
03:11:31,860 --> 03:11:33,860
Don't get your hopes up.

3699
03:11:33,860 --> 03:11:36,140
OK, all guests to confirm.

3700
03:11:36,940 --> 03:11:39,540
Everybody's favorite monsters for

3701
03:11:40,540 --> 03:11:45,180
next one is next one is called Otaku Twilight two lovers again.

3702
03:11:45,500 --> 03:11:47,500
Three, two, one, go.

3703
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:48,940
Your say it's your movie three.

3704
03:11:48,940 --> 03:11:52,260
Remember, my love is a fine movie and the series is a beloved classic

3705
03:11:52,260 --> 03:11:53,500
and doesn't deserve slander.

3706
03:11:53,500 --> 03:11:55,060
Check out Discotheque's Blurry.

3707
03:11:55,060 --> 03:11:56,860
They do good preservation of classics.

3708
03:11:59,460 --> 03:12:01,740
What is this makes me like in a submarine?

3709
03:12:03,300 --> 03:12:06,940
Otaku Twilight just makes me think about friendship is witchcraft

3710
03:12:06,940 --> 03:12:11,260
and how funny Otaku Twilight was in that and how I'll never make anything

3711
03:12:11,900 --> 03:12:15,620
as even half as good in my entire life as friendship is witchcraft.

3712
03:12:15,820 --> 03:12:19,620
It is good and it holds up and I need to rewatch it for the fifth time.

3713
03:12:20,020 --> 03:12:21,580
I should I should just give up.

3714
03:12:21,580 --> 03:12:22,980
I should just give up.

3715
03:12:22,980 --> 03:12:25,980
Yeah, sit in a hole. Yeah. Yeah.

3716
03:12:25,980 --> 03:12:29,140
Yeah, I know. No, no, no, you're not supposed to agree.

3717
03:12:29,140 --> 03:12:31,180
No, I love my little pony.

3718
03:12:31,180 --> 03:12:33,660
So do I love sitting in a hole.

3719
03:12:36,180 --> 03:12:38,860
Friendship is bitchcraft.

3720
03:12:38,900 --> 03:12:40,460
Friendship is cringe.

3721
03:12:40,460 --> 03:12:41,980
Friendship is cringe.

3722
03:12:41,980 --> 03:12:45,300
Next one is called episode 300 predictions.

3723
03:12:45,740 --> 03:12:47,300
Wait, I already uploaded this one twice.

3724
03:12:47,300 --> 03:12:49,580
OK, whatever. Three, two, one, go.

3725
03:12:49,980 --> 03:12:54,020
Episode 300 starts with the original procrastinator's podcast theme.

3726
03:12:54,660 --> 03:12:57,900
Trixie has an autistic meltdown with endless jets.

3727
03:12:58,460 --> 03:13:00,620
And then they talk about it on the podcast.

3728
03:13:01,220 --> 03:13:03,300
Monkey Jones makes a grand return.

3729
03:13:04,180 --> 03:13:07,540
Cyber shell and cheesy Manfredo become full time members.

3730
03:13:08,060 --> 03:13:12,540
Tom dies comes out as transgender.

3731
03:13:12,820 --> 03:13:15,660
Known as the best girl ever.

3732
03:13:15,660 --> 03:13:18,860
Ben finally calls me back.

3733
03:13:21,540 --> 03:13:22,700
What was that last one?

3734
03:13:22,700 --> 03:13:24,940
I feel like I've heard that before.

3735
03:13:24,940 --> 03:13:26,940
Which one?

3736
03:13:26,940 --> 03:13:29,060
The whole voicemail, I feel like I've heard it before.

3737
03:13:29,180 --> 03:13:30,980
Am I crazy?

3738
03:13:30,980 --> 03:13:32,660
Did you send it?

3739
03:13:32,660 --> 03:13:34,860
I didn't send it. That's not me.

3740
03:13:35,860 --> 03:13:41,380
If we go back to the old days, we can have we can have Nate and Trixie

3741
03:13:41,380 --> 03:13:45,180
having another boring conversation about like the YouTube algorithm.

3742
03:13:45,260 --> 03:13:47,860
That those those were the good old days.

3743
03:13:47,860 --> 03:13:51,100
Bring that back, return to tradition for episode 300.

3744
03:13:52,860 --> 03:13:56,180
All right, next one is called Kyle and Funny Man.

3745
03:13:56,180 --> 03:13:58,140
Episode four, it's dark now.

3746
03:13:58,140 --> 03:14:00,220
Critical acclaim, please.

3747
03:14:00,220 --> 03:14:02,020
Three, two, one, go.

3748
03:14:02,980 --> 03:14:08,260
The show is dark now, but that's what makes it good.

3749
03:14:08,700 --> 03:14:12,140
No more funny times for Kyle and Funny Man.

3750
03:14:12,420 --> 03:14:15,820
It's dark and depressing, but that's what makes it good.

3751
03:14:16,100 --> 03:14:20,940
It's Kyle and Funny Man in space.

3752
03:14:26,020 --> 03:14:28,820
That's right. We have crossed the threshold.

3753
03:14:28,820 --> 03:14:30,020
This is what the show is now.

3754
03:14:30,020 --> 03:14:33,140
It's dark filled with pathos, deep characters,

3755
03:14:33,380 --> 03:14:36,180
and that's what the show is now. No more fucking nonsense.

3756
03:14:36,180 --> 03:14:38,180
All right, let's go.

3757
03:14:39,580 --> 03:14:41,780
Hey, hey, Funny Man.

3758
03:14:41,780 --> 03:14:44,180
How about we go on a sweet, fricking adventure?

3759
03:14:44,180 --> 03:14:46,180
I know I know the last episode was a bit dark,

3760
03:14:46,180 --> 03:14:49,300
but maybe we can be more lighthearted this episode.

3761
03:14:50,180 --> 03:14:52,580
No, I cannot.

3762
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:56,980
I'm going to go to a therapist and it's going to be one

3763
03:14:56,980 --> 03:14:58,820
entire episode where I just talked to this.

3764
03:14:59,060 --> 03:15:02,260
My wife couldn't remember and I had to wear a diaper

3765
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:04,180
to make her happy one last time.

3766
03:15:04,180 --> 03:15:06,580
And that's going to be an episode.

3767
03:15:06,580 --> 03:15:10,100
Well, I guess I can go do an episode

3768
03:15:10,100 --> 03:15:13,860
where I realized that my life has no meaning

3769
03:15:13,860 --> 03:15:15,460
because I try to have fun on my own, but I can't.

3770
03:15:15,460 --> 03:15:17,700
And I'm like, what's the deal? What is life?

3771
03:15:17,700 --> 03:15:20,340
Oh, my God. Oh, yeah.

3772
03:15:20,340 --> 03:15:23,700
And to do that, we must argue now, so I hate you.

3773
03:15:24,740 --> 03:15:26,100
Well, I hate you too, Funny Man.

3774
03:15:26,100 --> 03:15:27,380
Let's go do that.

3775
03:15:27,380 --> 03:15:28,420
And that's right, people.

3776
03:15:28,420 --> 03:15:30,820
This show is now we're going to have a huge critical claim

3777
03:15:30,820 --> 03:15:32,260
to show so fucking good. Yes, yes.

3778
03:15:33,940 --> 03:15:34,340
Okay.

3779
03:15:36,020 --> 03:15:40,740
I love how like that was almost entirely the show is talking

3780
03:15:40,740 --> 03:15:41,780
about what the show is.

3781
03:15:44,100 --> 03:15:45,780
That's just podcasting.

3782
03:15:45,780 --> 03:15:47,140
That's just podcasting.

3783
03:15:50,020 --> 03:15:52,180
That wasn't as dark as I expected.

3784
03:15:52,180 --> 03:15:53,700
It wasn't as dark as I thought it was going to be.

3785
03:15:53,700 --> 03:15:55,780
Where's the murder? Where's the tragedy?

3786
03:15:56,500 --> 03:15:59,060
Funny Man didn't even tell a joke.

3787
03:15:59,060 --> 03:15:59,540
Get out.

3788
03:16:00,820 --> 03:16:01,860
Well, the show is dark now.

3789
03:16:01,860 --> 03:16:03,140
The show is dark.

3790
03:16:03,140 --> 03:16:03,700
Funny Man.

3791
03:16:03,700 --> 03:16:04,340
It's like, no.

3792
03:16:04,340 --> 03:16:06,100
My, yeah, it should have been like,

3793
03:16:06,100 --> 03:16:07,620
my name isn't Funny Man anymore.

3794
03:16:07,620 --> 03:16:10,260
I can't see the joy in the world.

3795
03:16:10,260 --> 03:16:11,380
My name is Ma.

3796
03:16:11,380 --> 03:16:13,940
I have, I have sadness.

3797
03:16:13,940 --> 03:16:15,700
Cancer. I have depression, cancer.

3798
03:16:15,700 --> 03:16:18,740
And boy, howdy is it taking a hold in my brain.

3799
03:16:20,180 --> 03:16:23,860
And I'm getting divorced as well from you, Kyle.

3800
03:16:23,860 --> 03:16:25,220
No.

3801
03:16:26,260 --> 03:16:28,500
And here's a dagger that I'm going to throw,

3802
03:16:29,300 --> 03:16:31,140
throw into your torso.

3803
03:16:31,140 --> 03:16:31,700
Here I go.

3804
03:16:32,500 --> 03:16:33,220
No, Funny Man.

3805
03:16:33,940 --> 03:16:36,260
And I lost my wallet on the bus home.

3806
03:16:40,420 --> 03:16:42,100
Next voicemail.

3807
03:16:42,100 --> 03:16:43,220
What's the next one?

3808
03:16:43,220 --> 03:16:45,700
The next one is called Ben St.

3809
03:16:45,700 --> 03:16:48,260
gets destroyed in the marketplace of ideas.

3810
03:16:48,900 --> 03:16:50,420
Three, two, one, go.

3811
03:16:51,380 --> 03:16:52,900
What's up?

3812
03:16:52,900 --> 03:16:54,580
It's me, Dusty Dumps.

3813
03:16:54,580 --> 03:16:57,780
And I'm basically just here to do a victory lap

3814
03:16:57,780 --> 03:16:59,300
all over Ben St's corpse.

3815
03:16:59,860 --> 03:17:05,060
Because yes, Ben St may have done a sweet ass

3816
03:17:05,060 --> 03:17:06,580
lecture about Tails gets trolled.

3817
03:17:07,300 --> 03:17:08,980
He may have been the first people,

3818
03:17:08,980 --> 03:17:10,980
one of the first people in the world

3819
03:17:10,980 --> 03:17:14,260
to interview Laserbot of Tails gets trolled.

3820
03:17:14,260 --> 03:17:15,300
That video is critically under viewed.

3821
03:17:15,300 --> 03:17:16,660
And also CC as well.

3822
03:17:17,620 --> 03:17:21,220
And you might have voiced some characters

3823
03:17:21,220 --> 03:17:24,900
in the official dub, but has he named a character

3824
03:17:24,900 --> 03:17:25,620
in the comic?

3825
03:17:26,500 --> 03:17:27,140
No.

3826
03:17:27,140 --> 03:17:32,660
But I have now the character that is a troll,

3827
03:17:33,380 --> 03:17:36,900
which is a corner that appears for two pages

3828
03:17:36,900 --> 03:17:39,860
in chapter 14 has been officially named by me

3829
03:17:41,380 --> 03:17:43,940
as now a rigor mortis.

3830
03:17:44,580 --> 03:17:47,300
And you can see it on the wiki.

3831
03:17:47,300 --> 03:17:50,260
Rigor Morphis is his official name now.

3832
03:17:50,260 --> 03:17:51,940
And it's credited to me.

3833
03:17:51,940 --> 03:17:56,020
So get fucked, Ben St.

3834
03:17:56,020 --> 03:17:58,740
How do you retroactively name a character?

3835
03:18:01,940 --> 03:18:02,740
We just claim it.

3836
03:18:02,740 --> 03:18:03,700
You put a flag in it.

3837
03:18:04,980 --> 03:18:06,900
The mint is mint him on the blockchain.

3838
03:18:07,700 --> 03:18:07,940
Yeah.

3839
03:18:10,660 --> 03:18:11,620
How does I wonder?

3840
03:18:11,780 --> 03:18:14,660
What if you made an NFT of the United States of America?

3841
03:18:16,580 --> 03:18:18,420
Wonder what would be the ramifications

3842
03:18:18,420 --> 03:18:21,540
of minting, say, the entire United States of America

3843
03:18:21,540 --> 03:18:22,340
on the blockchain?

3844
03:18:23,540 --> 03:18:24,980
Dude, I don't even try that.

3845
03:18:24,980 --> 03:18:25,780
You should try it then.

3846
03:18:27,540 --> 03:18:30,340
No, think of the impact on the environment.

3847
03:18:30,340 --> 03:18:32,580
No, no, I couldn't.

3848
03:18:32,580 --> 03:18:33,860
But it would make a lot of money.

3849
03:18:33,860 --> 03:18:36,500
No, that's just something anti-NFT bro says.

3850
03:18:36,500 --> 03:18:39,060
If America gets packaged up as an NFT,

3851
03:18:39,060 --> 03:18:40,500
then I can't like pollute anymore.

3852
03:18:40,580 --> 03:18:41,380
Think about it.

3853
03:18:43,620 --> 03:18:46,100
Yeah, yeah.

3854
03:18:46,100 --> 03:18:46,660
OK.

3855
03:18:46,660 --> 03:18:50,820
Next voicemail is, it's called something.

3856
03:18:50,820 --> 03:18:51,780
Come on, load.

3857
03:18:51,780 --> 03:18:52,500
Thanks.

3858
03:18:52,500 --> 03:18:56,020
It's called YouTube swearing arc four.

3859
03:18:56,020 --> 03:18:58,020
OK, actually final this time.

3860
03:18:58,020 --> 03:18:59,300
Three, two, one, go.

3861
03:19:00,820 --> 03:19:01,140
All right.

3862
03:19:01,140 --> 03:19:04,260
Dusty dumps back again with an update

3863
03:19:04,260 --> 03:19:08,900
on the exciting YouTube censorship storyline

3864
03:19:08,980 --> 03:19:11,140
story arc that everybody loves.

3865
03:19:11,140 --> 03:19:17,300
So last episode, we said something about maybe my account

3866
03:19:17,300 --> 03:19:19,380
was too new to be able to swear on it.

3867
03:19:20,180 --> 03:19:22,980
But I was like, that surely can't be the case

3868
03:19:22,980 --> 03:19:26,980
because my account was made in like 2009 or something.

3869
03:19:29,060 --> 03:19:32,580
But you saying that made me click on my account settings

3870
03:19:33,220 --> 03:19:36,020
and I could see my location, which is Japan

3871
03:19:36,020 --> 03:19:36,900
because I live in Japan.

3872
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:38,100
What's this guy?

3873
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:43,060
And so I said, well, maybe if I try changing this,

3874
03:19:43,060 --> 03:19:44,820
I don't know, just on a whim.

3875
03:19:44,820 --> 03:19:46,820
So I changed it to the United States

3876
03:19:47,460 --> 03:19:48,980
and tried leaving a comment.

3877
03:19:48,980 --> 03:19:52,900
And lo and behold, if your location is set to United States,

3878
03:19:52,900 --> 03:19:54,100
you can't swear in comments.

3879
03:19:55,220 --> 03:19:55,540
What?

3880
03:19:56,740 --> 03:19:59,700
Why are they banning us living in Japan?

3881
03:19:59,700 --> 03:20:04,260
All Japanese people are fucking banned from commenting.

3882
03:20:04,260 --> 03:20:04,820
But like any English?

3883
03:20:04,820 --> 03:20:06,900
Saying fuck in the comments or shit

3884
03:20:06,900 --> 03:20:08,580
or any sort of swear word.

3885
03:20:08,580 --> 03:20:10,340
But if you're from the United States,

3886
03:20:10,340 --> 03:20:13,140
I guess you have the God given rights to say a fuck.

3887
03:20:13,860 --> 03:20:14,900
So that's Jeff Dates.

3888
03:20:16,180 --> 03:20:18,020
If anybody wants to swear in the comments,

3889
03:20:18,020 --> 03:20:22,340
I guess you got to make your location America or something.

3890
03:20:22,340 --> 03:20:25,300
Not true because I have a ring.

3891
03:20:25,300 --> 03:20:26,980
There's a new wrinkle to this.

3892
03:20:26,980 --> 03:20:28,420
And this is bizarre.

3893
03:20:28,500 --> 03:20:34,900
I tried to reply to a comment on the PCP channel,

3894
03:20:34,900 --> 03:20:38,580
like as the PCP account, into our own comments.

3895
03:20:38,580 --> 03:20:41,460
Some guy, some freak in the comments was like,

3896
03:20:42,420 --> 03:20:46,340
when I told the story about a Trixie defending May

3897
03:20:46,340 --> 03:20:47,940
saying that George Floyd deserved it,

3898
03:20:48,500 --> 03:20:49,700
some freak in the comments was like,

3899
03:20:49,700 --> 03:20:51,140
George Floyd did deserve it, actually.

3900
03:20:51,140 --> 03:20:54,580
And I tried to respond to them with profanity,

3901
03:20:54,580 --> 03:20:57,780
with well-deserved profanity that was completely justified

3902
03:20:57,860 --> 03:20:58,900
and would have been good.

3903
03:20:58,900 --> 03:20:59,620
And I couldn't.

3904
03:21:00,260 --> 03:21:03,060
I could not comment on my own YouTube channel.

3905
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:06,340
It deleted the comment from myself.

3906
03:21:07,540 --> 03:21:08,740
And we're definitely set to,

3907
03:21:09,460 --> 03:21:11,460
I think we're set to Nate's old address,

3908
03:21:11,460 --> 03:21:12,420
which is Cincinnati.

3909
03:21:12,420 --> 03:21:14,260
So it definitely thinks we're in America.

3910
03:21:15,700 --> 03:21:19,060
It deleted our own comment on our own podcast

3911
03:21:19,060 --> 03:21:20,740
because it had the F word in it.

3912
03:21:20,740 --> 03:21:22,580
And then I re-typed it with no swearing.

3913
03:21:23,620 --> 03:21:26,340
And I felt like I wasn't being strongly worded enough,

3914
03:21:26,900 --> 03:21:27,780
but whatever.

3915
03:21:27,780 --> 03:21:28,740
And it worked.

3916
03:21:29,700 --> 03:21:32,900
So I don't know, it's just super fun.

3917
03:21:32,900 --> 03:21:34,900
Every time I'm in my after dark account

3918
03:21:34,900 --> 03:21:36,340
and I just comment on a video

3919
03:21:36,340 --> 03:21:37,860
and I say something about come,

3920
03:21:37,860 --> 03:21:40,020
my comment doesn't show up when I refresh.

3921
03:21:40,660 --> 03:21:42,740
Yeah, that's what happened.

3922
03:21:42,740 --> 03:21:44,100
That's the same thing that happened

3923
03:21:44,100 --> 03:21:45,780
with me replying to this guy.

3924
03:21:48,180 --> 03:21:52,180
So I don't know if it's, for us,

3925
03:21:52,180 --> 03:21:53,700
being located in the United States

3926
03:21:53,700 --> 03:21:57,060
does not have any, has not done anything for it.

3927
03:21:57,060 --> 03:21:57,460
I don't know.

3928
03:21:58,100 --> 03:21:58,980
It's fucked up.

3929
03:21:58,980 --> 03:22:00,020
Criminal, what's next?

3930
03:22:00,020 --> 03:22:01,620
Swear in the comments, everybody.

3931
03:22:01,620 --> 03:22:03,540
Swear like a sailor.

3932
03:22:03,540 --> 03:22:03,860
Fuck.

3933
03:22:03,860 --> 03:22:04,100
Yeah.

3934
03:22:04,980 --> 03:22:08,420
Actually, do like YouTube shorts as comments

3935
03:22:08,420 --> 03:22:09,700
because then if it's in a video,

3936
03:22:09,700 --> 03:22:11,300
it might be harder for them to delete it.

3937
03:22:12,340 --> 03:22:15,380
Next voicemail is called Google Gobble.

3938
03:22:15,380 --> 03:22:17,060
Three, two, one, go.

3939
03:22:17,940 --> 03:22:19,940
Ben, you are absolutely right.

3940
03:22:19,940 --> 03:22:22,260
The Reddit search is fucking dog shit.

3941
03:22:22,260 --> 03:22:23,060
And you wanna know why?

3942
03:22:23,060 --> 03:22:24,020
It simply doesn't work.

3943
03:22:24,020 --> 03:22:25,300
Because they made their own search.

3944
03:22:26,340 --> 03:22:27,780
It's not powered by Google.

3945
03:22:28,500 --> 03:22:30,020
They tried to do their own shit

3946
03:22:30,020 --> 03:22:31,860
and it doesn't fucking work.

3947
03:22:31,860 --> 03:22:34,180
Just like all searches not powered by Google.

3948
03:22:34,180 --> 03:22:35,700
You know what the answer is?

3949
03:22:35,700 --> 03:22:36,980
More monopolization.

3950
03:22:38,900 --> 03:22:40,500
Individuals and companies

3951
03:22:40,500 --> 03:22:43,140
that are not part of a giant conglomerate.

3952
03:22:43,140 --> 03:22:43,700
Finally.

3953
03:22:45,300 --> 03:22:47,300
Google, Apple, Disney, Amazon,

3954
03:22:47,300 --> 03:22:49,060
Google, Apple, Disney, Amazon.

3955
03:22:50,260 --> 03:22:51,460
That was catchy.

3956
03:22:51,460 --> 03:22:52,340
That was a catchy tune.

3957
03:22:52,340 --> 03:22:53,300
I wanna make a song out of that.

3958
03:22:53,300 --> 03:22:54,660
Now I like corporations.

3959
03:22:54,660 --> 03:22:58,020
Interest on Google, Apple, Amazon, Disney,

3960
03:22:58,020 --> 03:23:00,660
Google, Apple, Amazon, Disney, Google, Apple.

3961
03:23:00,660 --> 03:23:01,940
Bass, bass, bass, bass.

3962
03:23:01,940 --> 03:23:04,580
Microsoft Activision Bethesda.

3963
03:23:04,580 --> 03:23:07,060
Bass, bass, tap, tap, tap, bass, bass, bass,

3964
03:23:07,060 --> 03:23:07,620
tap, tap, tap, tap.

3965
03:23:07,620 --> 03:23:08,740
Tap, tap, tap, tap, bass.

3966
03:23:08,740 --> 03:23:09,700
Um, there.

3967
03:23:09,700 --> 03:23:10,500
Fucking old.

3968
03:23:10,500 --> 03:23:12,900
I have to say, though, I've noticed

3969
03:23:12,900 --> 03:23:15,380
that if you use old.reddit.com,

3970
03:23:16,100 --> 03:23:17,300
you can actually still access

3971
03:23:17,300 --> 03:23:19,460
like an older version of the Reddit website.

3972
03:23:19,460 --> 03:23:20,900
And the search on that version

3973
03:23:20,900 --> 03:23:22,100
is 100 times more functional.

3974
03:23:22,180 --> 03:23:23,860
You'll actually get results.

3975
03:23:23,860 --> 03:23:25,620
If you don't do that, the results, shit.

3976
03:23:26,580 --> 03:23:28,180
I use the old, wait, do I?

3977
03:23:28,180 --> 03:23:28,740
I'm not sure.

3978
03:23:29,780 --> 03:23:32,340
In the URL, it'll say old.reddit.com.

3979
03:23:33,860 --> 03:23:36,180
Maybe I, I'm not sure.

3980
03:23:36,180 --> 03:23:36,980
I'll have to check.

3981
03:23:36,980 --> 03:23:37,540
I'll have to check.

3982
03:23:38,420 --> 03:23:39,300
Okay, that's a good tip.

3983
03:23:40,180 --> 03:23:42,500
Yeah, I found that because I use it

3984
03:23:42,500 --> 03:23:46,100
for like an NSFW Reddit page.

3985
03:23:46,100 --> 03:23:46,660
It's like the one I wanted.

3986
03:23:46,660 --> 03:23:48,820
You should use it for an NSFT.

3987
03:23:49,940 --> 03:23:51,380
Ah, shit.

3988
03:23:51,380 --> 03:23:53,220
Mint that shit, dog.

3989
03:23:53,780 --> 03:23:54,740
Okay, next one is.

3990
03:23:54,740 --> 03:23:56,420
Nice, saggy fucking titties.

3991
03:23:58,100 --> 03:23:59,460
Next one is called, did I already,

3992
03:23:59,460 --> 03:24:00,500
did I already upload the next one?

3993
03:24:00,500 --> 03:24:01,220
Yeah, I did.

3994
03:24:01,220 --> 03:24:03,940
Next one is called New Pokemon Game Spoilers.

3995
03:24:03,940 --> 03:24:05,540
Three, two, one, go.

3996
03:24:06,980 --> 03:24:08,340
It's an isekai.

3997
03:24:08,340 --> 03:24:09,380
Been stanked.

3998
03:24:09,380 --> 03:24:10,180
Give and take.

3999
03:24:10,740 --> 03:24:12,660
It's an isekai.

4000
03:24:13,300 --> 03:24:14,180
No, it's not.

4001
03:24:14,180 --> 03:24:15,540
It's a time isekai.

4002
03:24:17,060 --> 03:24:17,700
Uh, okay.

4003
03:24:17,700 --> 03:24:18,340
Did it go through a time?

4004
03:24:18,340 --> 03:24:19,140
Did it go through a time portal?

4005
03:24:19,140 --> 03:24:20,420
Did the character you play as

4006
03:24:20,420 --> 03:24:20,900
has been trying to.

4007
03:24:20,900 --> 03:24:21,700
Is it good though?

4008
03:24:21,700 --> 03:24:23,220
That's an important problem.

4009
03:24:24,260 --> 03:24:25,060
Yeah, that's cute.

4010
03:24:25,060 --> 03:24:26,100
That's cute, I guess.

4011
03:24:26,100 --> 03:24:27,540
Did you see that they retconned how

4012
03:24:27,540 --> 03:24:28,340
Pokeballs work?

4013
03:24:30,100 --> 03:24:31,220
What do they do?

4014
03:24:31,220 --> 03:24:34,580
All Pokemon have the ability to shrink naturally.

4015
03:24:34,580 --> 03:24:36,020
That's just something they can do.

4016
03:24:36,020 --> 03:24:38,340
And the Pokeball just traps them in there.

4017
03:24:38,340 --> 03:24:39,060
Like they shrink.

4018
03:24:39,060 --> 03:24:40,500
It doesn't turn them into energy or anything.

4019
03:24:40,500 --> 03:24:42,260
They could just drink and do that.

4020
03:24:43,300 --> 03:24:44,500
That's insane.

4021
03:24:44,500 --> 03:24:47,140
Okay, that's fine.

4022
03:24:47,940 --> 03:24:48,420
Whatever.

4023
03:24:48,420 --> 03:24:48,900
It's okay.

4024
03:24:49,700 --> 03:24:53,140
I mean, how else did they get them

4025
03:24:53,140 --> 03:24:54,660
into apricorn balls?

4026
03:24:55,300 --> 03:24:55,700
You know?

4027
03:24:55,700 --> 03:24:56,580
Oh, simple.

4028
03:24:56,580 --> 03:24:58,180
You turn them into atoms.

4029
03:24:58,180 --> 03:25:00,740
You record the atoms and then you recreate them every time.

4030
03:25:00,740 --> 03:25:01,300
Oh, magic.

4031
03:25:01,300 --> 03:25:02,260
It's like a teleporter.

4032
03:25:03,300 --> 03:25:04,660
That would do it, I suppose.

4033
03:25:04,660 --> 03:25:05,060
Yeah.

4034
03:25:05,060 --> 03:25:07,780
Just say it's magic because they're magical creatures

4035
03:25:07,780 --> 03:25:09,460
that shoot lightning at each other.

4036
03:25:10,100 --> 03:25:12,260
I mean, when I first...

4037
03:25:13,700 --> 03:25:16,740
Well, I think I had this idea years ago

4038
03:25:16,740 --> 03:25:18,100
and I can't remember when.

4039
03:25:18,100 --> 03:25:20,340
But the idea is that they're...

4040
03:25:20,340 --> 03:25:22,820
Pokemon are actually also digital monsters.

4041
03:25:23,700 --> 03:25:25,060
But they're not called Digimon.

4042
03:25:25,060 --> 03:25:27,700
They're just like, you know, because it's a video game.

4043
03:25:27,700 --> 03:25:28,980
But are they the champions?

4044
03:25:28,980 --> 03:25:33,540
But they don't present themselves as fake digital monsters

4045
03:25:33,540 --> 03:25:35,860
in the canon of the story, so whatever.

4046
03:25:35,860 --> 03:25:39,380
I mean, in the canon, you literally store them in a computer.

4047
03:25:39,380 --> 03:25:40,020
Yeah.

4048
03:25:40,020 --> 03:25:43,940
So it's meant in that way to parallel people

4049
03:25:43,940 --> 03:25:47,380
playing the game on their Game Boy Color in real life

4050
03:25:47,380 --> 03:25:48,740
because you go around and trade,

4051
03:25:48,740 --> 03:25:51,140
just like the people in the game in the Pokemon Center.

4052
03:25:51,140 --> 03:25:52,420
They trade Pokemon.

4053
03:25:53,460 --> 03:25:54,100
Exactly.

4054
03:25:54,100 --> 03:25:54,660
Yeah, whatever.

4055
03:25:54,660 --> 03:25:55,620
Pokemon smells.

4056
03:25:56,660 --> 03:25:57,620
Diageesis.

4057
03:25:57,620 --> 03:25:58,820
It's ARG.

4058
03:25:58,820 --> 03:26:01,060
It's not ARG, augmented reality.

4059
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:04,660
So then the next question, I think this person's confused

4060
03:26:04,660 --> 03:26:05,620
because the question is called

4061
03:26:05,620 --> 03:26:09,220
the question on everyone's mind next week when Gibbon visits.

4062
03:26:09,220 --> 03:26:11,060
I don't think you're visiting anywhere next week.

4063
03:26:11,860 --> 03:26:12,500
So...

4064
03:26:12,500 --> 03:26:12,820
No.

4065
03:26:13,460 --> 03:26:15,140
Okay, three, two, one, go.

4066
03:26:17,860 --> 03:26:20,500
So, like, you're going to fuck?

4067
03:26:21,380 --> 03:26:22,420
You're going to fuck.

4068
03:26:23,620 --> 03:26:26,180
This guy must be a bit behind because, like,

4069
03:26:26,900 --> 03:26:29,140
you canceled your trip, like, several weeks ago.

4070
03:26:29,860 --> 03:26:33,540
I mean, I didn't talk about my trip until it was canceled.

4071
03:26:33,540 --> 03:26:34,180
Exactly.

4072
03:26:34,180 --> 03:26:35,220
You brought it up to sales.

4073
03:26:35,220 --> 03:26:37,540
Maybe they assumed that it was just, like, delayed a week.

4074
03:26:37,540 --> 03:26:38,420
And when you, like,

4075
03:26:38,420 --> 03:26:38,900
No, no.

4076
03:26:38,900 --> 03:26:40,900
When your COVID test came back and you were fine,

4077
03:26:40,900 --> 03:26:42,020
they just assumed you were going.

4078
03:26:42,660 --> 03:26:43,300
No, no, no.

4079
03:26:43,300 --> 03:26:44,740
I'm going to go in the summer.

4080
03:26:44,740 --> 03:26:47,060
I have the cost of the ticket.

4081
03:26:48,180 --> 03:26:50,100
Totally refunded, completely.

4082
03:26:50,100 --> 03:26:53,620
And I can use that cost to buy a new ticket at a different time

4083
03:26:53,620 --> 03:26:54,340
in the year.

4084
03:26:54,340 --> 03:26:54,660
So...

4085
03:26:54,660 --> 03:26:57,060
Clearly this person hasn't played the PCP dating sound.

4086
03:26:57,860 --> 03:26:58,420
Clearly.

4087
03:26:59,140 --> 03:27:00,740
Also, we have about 10 more.

4088
03:27:00,740 --> 03:27:03,060
So we're getting down there, in voicemails.

4089
03:27:03,060 --> 03:27:03,940
My dinner's ready.

4090
03:27:03,940 --> 03:27:05,220
I want to go and eat.

4091
03:27:06,180 --> 03:27:06,900
Okay, okay.

4092
03:27:06,900 --> 03:27:07,700
We're almost there.

4093
03:27:07,700 --> 03:27:08,180
Speed run.

4094
03:27:08,180 --> 03:27:11,540
Next one is called Let's Talk About Race You Lib Tards.

4095
03:27:11,540 --> 03:27:14,900
This is at beatmyassatlike.drum.

4096
03:27:15,780 --> 03:27:17,300
Three, two, one, go.

4097
03:27:18,660 --> 03:27:22,420
Lib Tards like Ben keeps saying it like there is only one race.

4098
03:27:22,420 --> 03:27:23,380
The human race.

4099
03:27:23,940 --> 03:27:25,220
Bah, bitch.

4100
03:27:25,220 --> 03:27:26,580
What about NASCAR?

4101
03:27:27,940 --> 03:27:28,980
What about what?

4102
03:27:28,980 --> 03:27:29,460
NASCAR.

4103
03:27:29,460 --> 03:27:30,580
What about NASCAR?

4104
03:27:31,140 --> 03:27:31,620
What?

4105
03:27:31,620 --> 03:27:32,020
Oh, that is what's going on.

4106
03:27:32,020 --> 03:27:34,100
Yeah, well, they drive around and they...

4107
03:27:34,100 --> 03:27:36,900
Yeah, well, what about Formula One, huh?

4108
03:27:37,540 --> 03:27:39,140
The better race, the master race.

4109
03:27:39,140 --> 03:27:40,020
What about Formula One?

4110
03:27:40,020 --> 03:27:42,340
Well, I got a race gone out of here.

4111
03:27:42,340 --> 03:27:44,100
It's time for me to leave.

4112
03:27:44,500 --> 03:27:46,340
Vroom, vroom, goodbye.

4113
03:27:46,340 --> 03:27:48,580
You guys have a good podcast.

4114
03:27:48,580 --> 03:27:49,940
Will you actually leave it?

4115
03:27:49,940 --> 03:27:51,060
I'm literally leaving now.

4116
03:27:51,620 --> 03:27:51,860
Okay.

4117
03:27:51,860 --> 03:27:52,740
Okay, goodbye.

4118
03:27:52,740 --> 03:27:53,620
See you, beautiful.

4119
03:27:54,500 --> 03:27:55,220
All right, well.

4120
03:27:55,860 --> 03:27:56,580
See ya.

4121
03:27:56,580 --> 03:27:56,980
But...

4122
03:27:58,900 --> 03:27:59,460
What a cringe.

4123
03:27:59,460 --> 03:28:00,020
Cringe.

4124
03:28:00,020 --> 03:28:00,420
Couldn't he...

4125
03:28:00,420 --> 03:28:02,660
Couldn't hang it out for the last nine voicemails.

4126
03:28:02,660 --> 03:28:03,300
Yeah, fuck.

4127
03:28:04,260 --> 03:28:04,740
Yeah, fuck.

4128
03:28:04,740 --> 03:28:04,980
Okay.

4129
03:28:06,180 --> 03:28:06,980
Good riddance.

4130
03:28:06,980 --> 03:28:08,180
Okay, next one is...

4131
03:28:08,180 --> 03:28:11,460
Next one is called May Lover At Trad.Wife.

4132
03:28:11,460 --> 03:28:11,940
Oh, no.

4133
03:28:12,340 --> 03:28:16,660
Also called rampantatmisoginous.ben.

4134
03:28:16,660 --> 03:28:19,220
So, you know, take your pick.

4135
03:28:19,220 --> 03:28:20,420
Three, two, one, go.

4136
03:28:21,540 --> 03:28:24,420
So, that was pretty funny timing with Trixie's

4137
03:28:24,420 --> 03:28:26,900
I Hate Digit Broke video, huh?

4138
03:28:26,900 --> 03:28:29,460
One week she's explaining how she likes Riley

4139
03:28:29,460 --> 03:28:31,540
because he's a pathetic bottom feeder.

4140
03:28:31,540 --> 03:28:34,500
Willing, May, begging to gravel at her feet,

4141
03:28:34,500 --> 03:28:37,060
licking her soles in parentheses and wash.

4142
03:28:37,060 --> 03:28:37,460
Nodding.

4143
03:28:37,460 --> 03:28:39,620
For the meager crumbs of clouds she made grand.

4144
03:28:39,620 --> 03:28:40,100
I'm nodding.

4145
03:28:40,100 --> 03:28:41,940
Next week it goes bust.

4146
03:28:41,940 --> 03:28:44,500
That's what I'd call an epically my moment.

4147
03:28:44,500 --> 03:28:47,700
Also, Ben, on the last episode you kept insisting

4148
03:28:47,700 --> 03:28:49,780
that Trixie must remember all of the things

4149
03:28:49,780 --> 03:28:51,540
that caused you two to fall out.

4150
03:28:51,540 --> 03:28:51,860
Not all of them.

4151
03:28:51,860 --> 03:28:53,460
And she must be lying when she's saying

4152
03:28:53,460 --> 03:28:55,620
that she doesn't know why you hate her.

4153
03:28:55,620 --> 03:28:57,700
But have you considered that she simply suffered

4154
03:28:57,700 --> 03:29:00,500
too much cognitive decline from smoking way too much?

4155
03:29:00,500 --> 03:29:01,540
Epic 420.

4156
03:29:01,540 --> 03:29:03,220
Your motherfucking boba-booy gang,

4157
03:29:03,220 --> 03:29:04,020
we do remember.

4158
03:29:04,020 --> 03:29:05,220
You hear that?

4159
03:29:05,220 --> 03:29:07,220
Or your brain is just working overtime

4160
03:29:07,220 --> 03:29:09,300
bending reality into something that allows her

4161
03:29:09,300 --> 03:29:10,580
to sleep that night?

4162
03:29:10,580 --> 03:29:12,900
Got aloof of pissing everything and everyone away

4163
03:29:12,900 --> 03:29:15,700
for what amounted to a couple of unwatchable vlogs

4164
03:29:15,700 --> 03:29:16,740
after all.

4165
03:29:16,740 --> 03:29:17,860
Front aloof?

4166
03:29:17,860 --> 03:29:19,540
More like frontal cope?

4167
03:29:19,540 --> 03:29:20,980
Ha ha ha.

4168
03:29:20,980 --> 03:29:23,460
Anyways, the Ig Arc seems to be nearing its end,

4169
03:29:23,460 --> 03:29:25,940
but we never learned where the fuck Bird came from.

4170
03:29:25,940 --> 03:29:27,940
How did they meet in what kind of black male

4171
03:29:27,940 --> 03:29:29,860
does Trixie have on him to make him stay with her?

4172
03:29:30,820 --> 03:29:32,980
I know it's the answer to some of these.

4173
03:29:32,980 --> 03:29:37,940
I know that Bird is just a big dick show lover.

4174
03:29:38,660 --> 03:29:40,580
Bird is just an obsessed dick show fan

4175
03:29:40,580 --> 03:29:42,100
and they met at a dick show thing.

4176
03:29:42,740 --> 03:29:43,540
That's that's it.

4177
03:29:45,460 --> 03:29:46,020
Cool.

4178
03:29:46,020 --> 03:29:48,740
Yeah, the cognitive decline weed.

4179
03:29:48,740 --> 03:29:50,340
Yeah, that's all probably somewhat true,

4180
03:29:50,340 --> 03:29:52,100
but she must remember some of it.

4181
03:29:52,100 --> 03:29:53,220
She must remember some of it.

4182
03:29:53,860 --> 03:29:55,220
There I feel like there was one other thing.

4183
03:29:55,860 --> 03:29:57,220
Okay, the Yig thing.

4184
03:29:59,300 --> 03:30:02,420
I saw something Trixie says.

4185
03:30:03,060 --> 03:30:05,460
I don't I don't think in Trixie's mind

4186
03:30:05,460 --> 03:30:07,540
that Riley quitting means that Yig is over.

4187
03:30:08,420 --> 03:30:11,700
She just thinks like Yig is just what she calls the channel now.

4188
03:30:11,700 --> 03:30:13,140
Yeah, it's a studio of two people.

4189
03:30:14,660 --> 03:30:16,820
Well, one I mean, Bird doesn't do anything.

4190
03:30:16,820 --> 03:30:18,500
So it's one person now.

4191
03:30:18,500 --> 03:30:18,820
Yeah.

4192
03:30:20,100 --> 03:30:24,420
So yeah, I think she would not say,

4193
03:30:24,420 --> 03:30:25,860
okay, well, just because Riley's gone,

4194
03:30:25,860 --> 03:30:27,300
it's not Yig anymore.

4195
03:30:27,300 --> 03:30:28,420
Like it's still Yig.

4196
03:30:28,420 --> 03:30:30,180
Although it is funny that in that video,

4197
03:30:30,180 --> 03:30:31,220
in the I Hate Didgeridoo video,

4198
03:30:31,220 --> 03:30:33,460
she did talk about like how important Riley was

4199
03:30:33,460 --> 03:30:34,900
and how they were like doing stuff together

4200
03:30:34,900 --> 03:30:36,340
and then he quit like three days later.

4201
03:30:36,900 --> 03:30:37,700
This is pretty good.

4202
03:30:37,700 --> 03:30:38,500
It's pretty good.

4203
03:30:39,300 --> 03:30:40,180
Next one is called...

4204
03:30:40,180 --> 03:30:41,700
Oh, by the way, I just want to say

4205
03:30:41,700 --> 03:30:43,940
that that AI voice was really good.

4206
03:30:43,940 --> 03:30:44,500
It's good.

4207
03:30:44,500 --> 03:30:44,900
It was pretty good.

4208
03:30:44,900 --> 03:30:45,380
That's great.

4209
03:30:45,380 --> 03:30:48,020
It reminded me of Mandy from Billion Mandy.

4210
03:30:48,020 --> 03:30:49,620
I don't know actually what it is though.

4211
03:30:50,580 --> 03:30:52,900
I'm not, hmm, maybe.

4212
03:30:54,100 --> 03:30:55,060
Next one is called...

4213
03:30:56,020 --> 03:30:57,220
Wait, what number was that?

4214
03:30:57,860 --> 03:31:00,180
We need 86.

4215
03:31:00,180 --> 03:31:02,020
Okay, this one is called For Your Cons...

4216
03:31:04,100 --> 03:31:05,140
No, stop, stop.

4217
03:31:05,620 --> 03:31:07,220
It started playing for me.

4218
03:31:07,220 --> 03:31:08,820
Okay, For Your Consideration.

4219
03:31:08,820 --> 03:31:10,420
Three, two, one, go.

4220
03:31:11,700 --> 03:31:12,820
Long tick stall.

4221
03:31:12,820 --> 03:31:15,460
LDS in short is a method of intercourse

4222
03:31:15,460 --> 03:31:17,620
where the rhythm is slow but deep in thorough.

4223
03:31:17,620 --> 03:31:19,060
It is most effective with a long penis,

4224
03:31:19,060 --> 03:31:20,740
preferably inches or more.

4225
03:31:20,740 --> 03:31:22,580
The penis is inserted into the vagina

4226
03:31:22,580 --> 03:31:24,980
all the way in using a slow, smooth stroke.

4227
03:31:24,980 --> 03:31:26,180
You pull out slowly as well,

4228
03:31:26,180 --> 03:31:27,700
right until the head of the penis

4229
03:31:27,700 --> 03:31:30,340
is about to fall out and then you sink back in slow.

4230
03:31:30,340 --> 03:31:31,300
Rinse, repeat.

4231
03:31:31,300 --> 03:31:32,420
This is a slow stroke.

4232
03:31:32,500 --> 03:31:34,020
You pull out and then you sink back in slow.

4233
03:31:34,020 --> 03:31:34,900
Rinse, repeat.

4234
03:31:34,900 --> 03:31:36,340
This allows the female to feel

4235
03:31:36,340 --> 03:31:37,780
every inch of your long dick.

4236
03:31:37,780 --> 03:31:39,300
It also increases effectiveness

4237
03:31:39,300 --> 03:31:40,340
by rotating your hips

4238
03:31:40,340 --> 03:31:42,580
and doing a stir the coffee motion with your stroke.

4239
03:31:42,580 --> 03:31:44,260
Long dicking is only possible

4240
03:31:44,260 --> 03:31:45,940
when the man is in a dominant position

4241
03:31:45,940 --> 03:31:47,780
where he can control the stroke missionary,

4242
03:31:47,780 --> 03:31:49,620
to argue, or lasebone sideways,

4243
03:31:49,620 --> 03:31:51,220
playing on and be in matching your stroke

4244
03:31:51,220 --> 03:31:52,500
to the bass line of the song

4245
03:31:52,500 --> 03:31:54,260
also increases effectiveness.

4246
03:31:54,260 --> 03:31:55,940
Be aware of the side effects though.

4247
03:31:55,940 --> 03:31:56,980
While long dicking a woman

4248
03:31:56,980 --> 03:31:58,420
can greatly increase your chances

4249
03:31:58,420 --> 03:31:59,700
of getting breakfast in the morning,

4250
03:31:59,700 --> 03:32:01,300
it can also take your relationship

4251
03:32:01,300 --> 03:32:02,260
to a whole other level

4252
03:32:02,260 --> 03:32:03,460
that you may not want to take.

4253
03:32:03,460 --> 03:32:05,860
Unfortunately, that is not a concern for a week.

4254
03:32:05,860 --> 03:32:07,860
Limp-wristed be de-mails like Benjamin H.

4255
03:32:07,860 --> 03:32:09,460
Say who haven't worked out in over a month.

4256
03:32:10,580 --> 03:32:10,900
No.

4257
03:32:14,020 --> 03:32:15,380
It's true.

4258
03:32:15,380 --> 03:32:16,180
What a wild voice.

4259
03:32:18,900 --> 03:32:21,300
Is that meant to be Ben Shapiro's voice?

4260
03:32:21,300 --> 03:32:25,540
I think definitely, definitely Ben Shapiro calling me out

4261
03:32:25,540 --> 03:32:26,980
for not lifting for a month.

4262
03:32:28,740 --> 03:32:29,540
Ben is Ben.

4263
03:32:30,180 --> 03:32:31,460
It has been, I think, yeah,

4264
03:32:31,460 --> 03:32:32,980
it has been now over a month now.

4265
03:32:32,980 --> 03:32:33,540
It's a perfect punchline.

4266
03:32:33,540 --> 03:32:36,100
Because I got COVID at the end of December,

4267
03:32:36,100 --> 03:32:38,020
so that's pathetic.

4268
03:32:38,020 --> 03:32:38,980
Pathetic, Ben.

4269
03:32:40,580 --> 03:32:43,540
Next one is called Am I a Pet?

4270
03:32:43,540 --> 03:32:44,740
Three, two, one, go.

4271
03:32:46,100 --> 03:32:48,740
My cat's litter box is across from my desk

4272
03:32:48,740 --> 03:32:50,980
and every time he takes a shit, he looks at me.

4273
03:32:50,980 --> 03:32:52,580
Yes, yes, your cat owes you.

4274
03:32:52,580 --> 03:32:53,460
Ha, ha, ha.

4275
03:32:53,460 --> 03:32:54,900
Who's really in charge?

4276
03:32:54,900 --> 03:32:58,740
He commands me for food when it's his time to eat.

4277
03:32:59,620 --> 03:33:02,740
And in the mornings, he tells me when my turn

4278
03:33:02,740 --> 03:33:03,940
with the bed is over.

4279
03:33:06,260 --> 03:33:07,380
Am I a pet?

4280
03:33:07,380 --> 03:33:08,260
Just get rid of your cat.

4281
03:33:08,260 --> 03:33:09,060
Just get rid of your cat.

4282
03:33:09,060 --> 03:33:09,700
Just throw it out.

4283
03:33:09,700 --> 03:33:10,580
Just throw it out the window.

4284
03:33:10,580 --> 03:33:12,900
Just drop a frying pan in your cat and see what happens.

4285
03:33:12,900 --> 03:33:16,020
Just, just, it's simple as that.

4286
03:33:16,020 --> 03:33:16,580
Simple as that.

4287
03:33:16,580 --> 03:33:17,780
You ever try it?

4288
03:33:17,780 --> 03:33:19,620
Don't knock it, don't knock it till you try it.

4289
03:33:21,300 --> 03:33:21,940
Okay.

4290
03:33:21,940 --> 03:33:24,900
Next one is called Keggs Therapy Session.

4291
03:33:24,900 --> 03:33:26,500
Three, two, one, go.

4292
03:33:26,580 --> 03:33:32,020
So Keggs Standard, what brings you here today?

4293
03:33:32,900 --> 03:33:34,980
It's about my character, Dr. Wolfe.

4294
03:33:34,980 --> 03:33:37,220
People around here call me Keggs Standard,

4295
03:33:37,220 --> 03:33:39,300
but Keggs is just the character I'm playing.

4296
03:33:39,860 --> 03:33:41,940
What exactly are you talking about?

4297
03:33:41,940 --> 03:33:44,420
It's like a Stephen Colbert situation,

4298
03:33:44,420 --> 03:33:46,420
where Colbert played a right wing dipshit

4299
03:33:46,420 --> 03:33:48,660
when he was really a left wing dipshit.

4300
03:33:48,660 --> 03:33:50,500
It's the same for me and Keggs.

4301
03:33:50,500 --> 03:33:52,340
Even though Keggs is eerily similar to me,

4302
03:33:52,340 --> 03:33:54,420
he's an entirely fictionalized character.

4303
03:33:55,140 --> 03:33:58,340
I wonder, who am I talking to in this therapy session?

4304
03:33:58,340 --> 03:34:01,380
Is it Nate or am I talking to Keggs Standard?

4305
03:34:01,380 --> 03:34:03,140
You're talking to Best Guy ever.

4306
03:34:03,140 --> 03:34:04,740
Who is Best Guy ever?

4307
03:34:04,740 --> 03:34:06,500
Is that also a character you're playing?

4308
03:34:07,140 --> 03:34:09,220
Yeah, Best Guy ever is a character.

4309
03:34:09,220 --> 03:34:11,860
He's almost entirely identical to me,

4310
03:34:11,860 --> 03:34:13,860
right down to the laboratory in worldview.

4311
03:34:13,860 --> 03:34:14,500
A lot.

4312
03:34:14,500 --> 03:34:17,060
I see, perhaps people are confused

4313
03:34:17,060 --> 03:34:19,700
because Best Guy ever and Nate are so similar.

4314
03:34:19,700 --> 03:34:21,620
I get where you're coming from.

4315
03:34:21,620 --> 03:34:22,740
I don't know if you know this,

4316
03:34:22,740 --> 03:34:25,140
but Dr. Wolfe is a character I play.

4317
03:34:25,140 --> 03:34:28,020
In real life, I'm a certified accountant.

4318
03:34:28,020 --> 03:34:29,380
I'm not a therapist.

4319
03:34:29,380 --> 03:34:31,140
But still, people look up to me

4320
03:34:31,140 --> 03:34:33,700
because I have years of wisdom that they don't have.

4321
03:34:33,700 --> 03:34:35,300
That's a really good point.

4322
03:34:35,300 --> 03:34:37,380
I guess I have a ways to go.

4323
03:34:37,380 --> 03:34:38,580
I'm out of here.

4324
03:34:38,580 --> 03:34:40,340
I have a hot date with Abley Jack.

4325
03:34:43,220 --> 03:34:44,180
It's good to be back.

4326
03:34:48,020 --> 03:34:49,060
That was very good.

4327
03:34:49,060 --> 03:34:50,020
It's so eerie.

4328
03:34:50,020 --> 03:34:52,340
It's so eerie that it sounds like

4329
03:34:52,420 --> 03:34:53,620
the voice.

4330
03:34:53,620 --> 03:34:55,860
Yeah, I mean, it's obviously not.

4331
03:34:55,860 --> 03:35:00,980
But then there's like a few brief little bits

4332
03:35:00,980 --> 03:35:02,900
where it's like, oh yeah, that's Nate.

4333
03:35:02,900 --> 03:35:03,380
Of course.

4334
03:35:03,380 --> 03:35:04,980
Yeah, I'm the best guy ever.

4335
03:35:04,980 --> 03:35:05,940
That one's a good one.

4336
03:35:07,620 --> 03:35:07,940
No.

4337
03:35:07,940 --> 03:35:08,580
Like in some words,

4338
03:35:08,580 --> 03:35:10,260
some words just sound like he said them,

4339
03:35:10,260 --> 03:35:11,700
like kegs sound like he said it.

4340
03:35:13,220 --> 03:35:15,140
But like, kegstund.

4341
03:35:16,260 --> 03:35:17,540
Kegstund.

4342
03:35:17,540 --> 03:35:18,260
Kegstund.

4343
03:35:20,020 --> 03:35:22,180
It's just characters within characters.

4344
03:35:22,260 --> 03:35:24,260
Nothing is real anymore.

4345
03:35:25,300 --> 03:35:29,700
You could make fake weagwis with a nice AI voice.

4346
03:35:29,700 --> 03:35:30,420
Make a hole.

4347
03:35:30,420 --> 03:35:33,780
Nate should just, you should use that bot

4348
03:35:33,780 --> 03:35:36,100
and he should just like feed all his past script

4349
03:35:36,100 --> 03:35:38,020
weagwis scripts through like an AI thing

4350
03:35:38,020 --> 03:35:40,100
and just generate new ones.

4351
03:35:42,340 --> 03:35:44,980
OK, next one we're getting down there

4352
03:35:44,980 --> 03:35:49,220
is called PCP TPC logo.

4353
03:35:49,220 --> 03:35:51,700
I guess this is a hot topic this week.

4354
03:35:52,180 --> 03:35:53,540
Three, two, one, go.

4355
03:35:54,260 --> 03:35:57,700
In episode 282, Ben wondered why the PCP logo

4356
03:35:57,700 --> 03:36:00,740
had a scribbled over page of the vapors in the background.

4357
03:36:00,740 --> 03:36:03,780
And I believe that's because the vape is fucking sucks.

4358
03:36:06,900 --> 03:36:09,540
No, no, come on.

4359
03:36:13,860 --> 03:36:16,260
OK, next one is called.

4360
03:36:16,980 --> 03:36:20,180
Trixie explains a very intellectual joke,

4361
03:36:20,180 --> 03:36:22,340
parentheses, she's brain dead.

4362
03:36:22,980 --> 03:36:25,220
Three, three, two, one, go.

4363
03:36:26,660 --> 03:36:28,180
So the first lyrics here,

4364
03:36:28,180 --> 03:36:31,620
you're playing Minecraft in a cave looking for diamonds.

4365
03:36:31,620 --> 03:36:32,500
That's funny.

4366
03:36:32,500 --> 03:36:35,460
I'm in the same cave looking for minors

4367
03:36:35,460 --> 03:36:38,100
because my sexual attraction to minors is major.

4368
03:36:38,740 --> 03:36:41,700
Can't even play hopscotch without popping a rager.

4369
03:36:42,660 --> 03:36:44,900
Now these lyrics in particular,

4370
03:36:44,900 --> 03:36:47,700
I think are obviously meant to be funny.

4371
03:36:47,700 --> 03:36:50,900
Oh, this is the Mr. Girl album, the referential.

4372
03:36:50,900 --> 03:36:54,100
They have word play, you know, he's looking for minors.

4373
03:36:55,140 --> 03:36:58,980
You could imply that he's talking about minors, people who mine,

4374
03:36:58,980 --> 03:37:02,500
you know, but because it's Minecraft in particular,

4375
03:37:04,100 --> 03:37:06,820
which is known to have a very young fan base,

4376
03:37:07,460 --> 03:37:10,180
it's like, OK, that seems to be the implication.

4377
03:37:10,820 --> 03:37:13,220
And then, you know, saying my sexual attraction

4378
03:37:13,220 --> 03:37:15,860
to minors is major is like.

4379
03:37:16,420 --> 03:37:18,660
Why is she just explaining the joke?

4380
03:37:18,660 --> 03:37:22,660
Don't have a comparison to majors, you know, if we're talking about.

4381
03:37:22,660 --> 03:37:23,700
Oh, my God.

4382
03:37:23,700 --> 03:37:26,180
So it only makes sense if he's talking about children.

4383
03:37:26,180 --> 03:37:27,940
So that's where you start to go.

4384
03:37:27,940 --> 03:37:30,340
Oh, and then can't even play hopscotch

4385
03:37:30,340 --> 03:37:32,900
without popping a rager is obviously a joke.

4386
03:37:32,900 --> 03:37:36,820
So it's humorous, but any very in your face

4387
03:37:37,860 --> 03:37:42,260
and, you know, calling yourself a fucking pedophile kind of way.

4388
03:37:43,460 --> 03:37:44,340
No kidding.

4389
03:37:46,020 --> 03:37:50,420
I can't believe that's real.

4390
03:37:50,420 --> 03:37:50,820
What?

4391
03:37:50,820 --> 03:37:51,620
You have that?

4392
03:37:51,620 --> 03:37:53,060
What was the context of that?

4393
03:37:53,060 --> 03:37:55,700
Why was she explaining an obvious joke?

4394
03:37:56,420 --> 03:37:59,220
It's I can't believe she had to explain that.

4395
03:37:59,780 --> 03:38:00,180
It is.

4396
03:38:00,180 --> 03:38:03,540
It's like it's like, OK, well, the chicken,

4397
03:38:03,540 --> 03:38:04,980
when you ask why it crossed the road,

4398
03:38:04,980 --> 03:38:08,420
but then the answer is you say cross the road.

4399
03:38:08,420 --> 03:38:11,060
And it's like, oh, I wasn't expecting that because it was obvious.

4400
03:38:11,620 --> 03:38:12,740
Like it's that level.

4401
03:38:12,740 --> 03:38:14,980
That's from the reviewed.

4402
03:38:16,260 --> 03:38:20,180
Mr. Girl is some guy who thinks it's really funny

4403
03:38:20,180 --> 03:38:21,620
to just say he's a pedophile.

4404
03:38:21,620 --> 03:38:22,500
And that's his whole thing.

4405
03:38:22,500 --> 03:38:24,740
And also he hates trans people, but never mind that.

4406
03:38:25,780 --> 03:38:28,100
And they did a review of his album.

4407
03:38:28,980 --> 03:38:32,340
Yeeg reviewed his album and loved it, like gushed over it.

4408
03:38:32,340 --> 03:38:34,660
They can't get enough of this fucking freak.

4409
03:38:35,780 --> 03:38:36,020
Yeah.

4410
03:38:36,020 --> 03:38:38,660
So this is the review of that album.

4411
03:38:38,660 --> 03:38:41,380
So great review content.

4412
03:38:42,180 --> 03:38:47,060
Guys, it's funny because when he says I'm a minor,

4413
03:38:47,060 --> 03:38:49,780
when he says I'm a minor, he's looking for minors,

4414
03:38:49,780 --> 03:38:54,020
but not in the way that you might think where it's mining,

4415
03:38:54,020 --> 03:38:56,660
like minecraft, he means it.

4416
03:38:57,940 --> 03:39:00,180
It's a homonym, you see, for another word,

4417
03:39:00,180 --> 03:39:02,820
M-I-N-O-R, meaning a person of underage.

4418
03:39:02,820 --> 03:39:07,060
It is not legal to have sexual intercourse with them.

4419
03:39:07,060 --> 03:39:09,860
Nevertheless, he implies that that is what he wants to do.

4420
03:39:09,860 --> 03:39:14,660
The humor you see comes from the suggestion that he is a pedophile.

4421
03:39:17,140 --> 03:39:19,620
Very, very droll, very droll.

4422
03:39:20,260 --> 03:39:20,820
I have one.

4423
03:39:21,460 --> 03:39:23,140
All right, this is great.

4424
03:39:23,140 --> 03:39:24,580
I have one comment to say.

4425
03:39:25,460 --> 03:39:28,820
She made a video, she released a video about Diddy Kong racing.

4426
03:39:28,820 --> 03:39:30,180
It got like 3,000 views.

4427
03:39:30,180 --> 03:39:30,980
Nobody watched it.

4428
03:39:32,340 --> 03:39:35,460
It was obviously meant, it was very obviously

4429
03:39:35,460 --> 03:39:37,700
like her trying to do a Hazel video.

4430
03:39:37,700 --> 03:39:38,980
It was very clear.

4431
03:39:38,980 --> 03:39:42,340
Someone in the chat said, this is just like Hazel.

4432
03:39:42,980 --> 03:39:46,420
And she said, no, this is not like Hazel.

4433
03:39:46,420 --> 03:39:49,540
This is me attempting to do Civvie, Civvie 11.

4434
03:39:50,740 --> 03:39:52,660
And I don't know if you've ever seen Civvie 11,

4435
03:39:52,660 --> 03:39:56,100
but Civvie 11, he's like a comedy guy.

4436
03:39:56,100 --> 03:39:58,820
He does, he does game, let's play.

4437
03:39:58,820 --> 03:40:02,420
He does like commentary, plays through a game and comments on it,

4438
03:40:02,420 --> 03:40:03,460
but he like lampoons it.

4439
03:40:03,460 --> 03:40:04,660
He's a comedy guy.

4440
03:40:04,660 --> 03:40:06,420
Her video is like obviously not.

4441
03:40:06,420 --> 03:40:08,580
There was no comedy and no jokes at all.

4442
03:40:08,580 --> 03:40:11,460
And it was, and it's like, it was really weird.

4443
03:40:11,460 --> 03:40:13,860
Like you could just admit you're doing Hazel.

4444
03:40:14,980 --> 03:40:16,180
Why, why pretend?

4445
03:40:16,180 --> 03:40:18,500
No, I'm this, no, actually, I'm pretending.

4446
03:40:18,500 --> 03:40:22,420
I'm trying to rip off this other guy, but like it's not.

4447
03:40:22,420 --> 03:40:22,820
I don't know.

4448
03:40:22,820 --> 03:40:25,060
It was, if you don't, I don't know.

4449
03:40:25,060 --> 03:40:28,980
The con, you maybe have to know, if you're familiar with Civvie.

4450
03:40:28,980 --> 03:40:31,780
And if you're familiar with Civvie and you heard her say,

4451
03:40:31,780 --> 03:40:34,500
no, this, this is my attempt at a Civvie style video.

4452
03:40:34,500 --> 03:40:36,340
You would just be like, it's obviously not.

4453
03:40:36,340 --> 03:40:38,900
Like if there's no, there's no similarity other than the fact

4454
03:40:38,900 --> 03:40:40,260
that you're talking about a game.

4455
03:40:40,260 --> 03:40:44,740
It reminded me of, it reminded me of when somebody asked,

4456
03:40:44,740 --> 03:40:47,620
people said, people accused Chris Chan of,

4457
03:40:47,620 --> 03:40:49,300
they were saying, Sonichu is a rip-off.

4458
03:40:49,860 --> 03:40:52,740
It's a rip-off because you, here, you just,

4459
03:40:52,740 --> 03:40:54,420
you just mashed together Sonic and Pikachu.

4460
03:40:54,420 --> 03:40:56,820
Even the name, the name is just Sonic and Pikachu

4461
03:40:56,820 --> 03:40:58,180
mashed together into Sonichu.

4462
03:40:58,180 --> 03:41:00,820
And Chris Chan said, no, no, no, you fool.

4463
03:41:00,820 --> 03:41:05,060
You see actually the name Sonichu comes from the,

4464
03:41:05,060 --> 03:41:09,380
the Japanese name for Sonic, Sonichu, you see.

4465
03:41:09,380 --> 03:41:10,580
So, aha, I gotcha.

4466
03:41:11,220 --> 03:41:12,260
And it's like, shut up.

4467
03:41:12,260 --> 03:41:13,220
What are you talking about?

4468
03:41:14,020 --> 03:41:14,580
Why?

4469
03:41:14,580 --> 03:41:15,380
Why are you lying?

4470
03:41:16,260 --> 03:41:17,620
Literally, why lie?

4471
03:41:17,620 --> 03:41:18,660
I don't know, whatever.

4472
03:41:20,900 --> 03:41:22,020
Anyway, great voicemail.

4473
03:41:22,020 --> 03:41:22,740
I loved it.

4474
03:41:22,740 --> 03:41:23,380
Pretty good.

4475
03:41:24,500 --> 03:41:24,740
Yeah.

4476
03:41:25,380 --> 03:41:29,620
Next one is Baby in a Blender Emotional.

4477
03:41:30,340 --> 03:41:32,180
Oh, this is a, this is a Vokeru link.

4478
03:41:33,700 --> 03:41:34,180
Here it is.

4479
03:41:35,060 --> 03:41:39,380
Three, two, one, go.

4480
03:42:05,380 --> 03:42:11,380
Baby in a Blender Emotional.

4481
03:42:11,380 --> 03:42:13,060
It really, it really liked that little

4482
03:42:13,060 --> 03:42:15,940
Carlos Santana riff in the middle there.

4483
03:42:15,940 --> 03:42:16,500
Holy moly.

4484
03:42:21,380 --> 03:42:21,860
Good one.

4485
03:42:22,500 --> 03:42:28,580
Next one is called Rod Serling, coming of 300.

4486
03:42:28,580 --> 03:42:30,180
Three, two, one, go.

4487
03:42:35,620 --> 03:42:38,980
Imagine if you will, the Procrastinator's podcast,

4488
03:42:38,980 --> 03:42:40,740
episode three, double O.

4489
03:42:40,740 --> 03:42:41,620
I don't want to.

4490
03:42:41,620 --> 03:42:42,580
Everyone is here.

4491
03:42:43,220 --> 03:42:47,460
Davoo, Tom, Simsie, Cybershell, Oblivionfall.

4492
03:42:47,460 --> 03:42:50,100
It's like a goddamn multiverse fighting game,

4493
03:42:50,100 --> 03:42:53,220
except without the concerning community presence of minors.

4494
03:42:53,940 --> 03:42:55,460
Gave us excited to record.

4495
03:42:55,460 --> 03:42:56,900
Which kind of minors do you mean, though?

4496
03:42:57,460 --> 03:42:58,980
Any of his many guests yet.

4497
03:42:59,700 --> 03:43:02,820
But wait, was there not a prophecy?

4498
03:43:02,900 --> 03:43:05,380
A wording that implied that he was coming?

4499
03:43:06,180 --> 03:43:08,580
Joining the call to the horror of everyone

4500
03:43:09,140 --> 03:43:11,220
is Nate the Body Saint Himself.

4501
03:43:11,220 --> 03:43:11,940
The Body.

4502
03:43:11,940 --> 03:43:13,780
The video goes live the next week,

4503
03:43:13,780 --> 03:43:15,380
and what they all feared was true.

4504
03:43:16,100 --> 03:43:16,980
No, Nate.

4505
03:43:16,980 --> 03:43:17,700
Yes, watch.

4506
03:43:18,420 --> 03:43:21,300
Zero likes and zero views.

4507
03:43:21,300 --> 03:43:21,540
No.

4508
03:43:23,700 --> 03:43:25,140
Horrifying.

4509
03:43:27,300 --> 03:43:28,980
Worst fate I cannot imagine.

4510
03:43:30,020 --> 03:43:31,540
Yeah, not gonna happen, bro.

4511
03:43:32,500 --> 03:43:35,540
Twilight Zone episode where a YouTuber

4512
03:43:35,540 --> 03:43:36,980
enters the Twilight Zone,

4513
03:43:36,980 --> 03:43:40,020
but the only difference is all their videos

4514
03:43:40,020 --> 03:43:41,220
just get zero views.

4515
03:43:42,260 --> 03:43:43,300
And they go, ah.

4516
03:43:44,660 --> 03:43:46,100
They keep gaining subscribers,

4517
03:43:46,100 --> 03:43:47,700
getting less views every day.

4518
03:43:47,700 --> 03:43:48,420
It doesn't make any sense.

4519
03:43:48,420 --> 03:43:49,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4520
03:43:50,020 --> 03:43:52,260
It's like everyone's talking about their videos.

4521
03:43:52,260 --> 03:43:54,580
Everyone's like talking about them on 4chan and stuff.

4522
03:43:54,580 --> 03:43:55,780
They got a Kiwi Farms thread.

4523
03:43:55,780 --> 03:43:56,660
Everyone's talking about them,

4524
03:43:56,660 --> 03:43:57,620
but no views.

4525
03:43:57,620 --> 03:43:58,660
Nobody's watching.

4526
03:43:58,660 --> 03:43:59,300
No views.

4527
03:43:59,300 --> 03:44:01,140
How does anyone know about it?

4528
03:44:01,140 --> 03:44:02,580
They're talking about it,

4529
03:44:02,580 --> 03:44:04,500
and it's like, if they're talking about it,

4530
03:44:04,500 --> 03:44:05,940
like it's a completely different video.

4531
03:44:05,940 --> 03:44:07,780
They're just saying things that weren't in there,

4532
03:44:07,780 --> 03:44:08,820
and you're just like, no.

4533
03:44:08,820 --> 03:44:10,260
No, that's not what my video was.

4534
03:44:10,260 --> 03:44:11,860
And their Patreon starts draining money

4535
03:44:11,860 --> 03:44:13,300
from them instead of giving it to them.

4536
03:44:14,820 --> 03:44:15,140
Yeah.

4537
03:44:17,220 --> 03:44:20,740
Next one is called, is this today?

4538
03:44:20,740 --> 03:44:22,180
Okay, next one is called I Did It.

4539
03:44:22,740 --> 03:44:23,780
We've got three more.

4540
03:44:23,780 --> 03:44:24,740
I Did It.

4541
03:44:24,740 --> 03:44:26,180
Three, two, one, go.

4542
03:44:31,540 --> 03:44:43,700
What is it?

4543
03:44:43,700 --> 03:44:44,580
Hello, comrades.

4544
03:44:45,220 --> 03:44:46,580
Nikolai found vodka.

4545
03:44:46,580 --> 03:44:47,700
Now, Nikolai, okay.

4546
03:44:48,340 --> 03:44:49,060
You just want,

4547
03:44:49,060 --> 03:44:50,660
Nikolai just wanted to let you know

4548
03:44:50,660 --> 03:44:52,820
that Nikolai considered you all comrades.

4549
03:44:52,820 --> 03:44:53,380
Oh, cool.

4550
03:44:53,380 --> 03:44:53,780
Thanks, com.

4551
03:44:53,780 --> 03:44:55,540
Even if you are a dirty capitalist.

4552
03:44:56,580 --> 03:44:57,940
Thanks, comrade.

4553
03:44:57,940 --> 03:44:59,460
Thanks, comrade Nikolai.

4554
03:45:00,340 --> 03:45:01,460
Thank you.

4555
03:45:01,460 --> 03:45:02,260
I love you.

4556
03:45:02,980 --> 03:45:05,940
That's the worst Russian action I've ever heard in my life.

4557
03:45:06,740 --> 03:45:08,580
Don't invade Ukraine, please.

4558
03:45:08,580 --> 03:45:09,140
Yeah, don't.

4559
03:45:09,140 --> 03:45:09,220
Okay.

4560
03:45:10,340 --> 03:45:11,780
I don't think you should do that.

4561
03:45:11,780 --> 03:45:12,900
I think that would be bad.

4562
03:45:14,180 --> 03:45:14,900
In my opinion.

4563
03:45:16,100 --> 03:45:18,900
The Ukraine has UK in it,

4564
03:45:18,900 --> 03:45:21,540
and that reminds me of my country where I live,

4565
03:45:21,540 --> 03:45:22,660
and that's scary.

4566
03:45:22,660 --> 03:45:25,780
And how would you like it if Russia invaded your country?

4567
03:45:25,780 --> 03:45:27,700
Oh, I would be so sad.

4568
03:45:28,260 --> 03:45:31,940
Yeah, you better, you better watch it.

4569
03:45:32,580 --> 03:45:34,020
Next, next one is called

4570
03:45:34,740 --> 03:45:36,660
Wong-Chan is back.

4571
03:45:36,660 --> 03:45:38,180
Three, two, one, go.

4572
03:45:48,260 --> 03:45:50,340
Flo, it is Wong-Chan.

4573
03:45:50,340 --> 03:45:51,540
I'm doing good.

4574
03:45:51,540 --> 03:45:52,100
Thank you.

4575
03:45:52,100 --> 03:45:52,660
How are you?

4576
03:45:55,060 --> 03:45:56,340
What the fuck was the point of that?

4577
03:45:56,340 --> 03:45:57,460
Yeah.

4578
03:45:57,460 --> 03:46:00,180
It's just the point is to be a racist caricature,

4579
03:46:00,180 --> 03:46:01,060
and then say hello.

4580
03:46:01,060 --> 03:46:01,460
All right, yeah.

4581
03:46:02,740 --> 03:46:03,940
And then say hi.

4582
03:46:03,940 --> 03:46:04,500
I'm doing good.

4583
03:46:04,500 --> 03:46:05,220
Thanks, Wong-Chan.

4584
03:46:05,220 --> 03:46:05,700
How are you?

4585
03:46:06,660 --> 03:46:09,380
Yeah, Wong-Chan, you know, I'm sorry,

4586
03:46:09,380 --> 03:46:12,100
I'm sorry that God made you like this

4587
03:46:12,100 --> 03:46:14,260
as such a racist caricature of your own race.

4588
03:46:14,260 --> 03:46:15,460
You know, it's not your fault.

4589
03:46:15,460 --> 03:46:17,940
You didn't, you didn't choose to be like this.

4590
03:46:19,300 --> 03:46:21,460
And why would I judge, and how can I judge you for that?

4591
03:46:23,620 --> 03:46:23,780
God bless.

4592
03:46:23,780 --> 03:46:25,140
Next voicemail.

4593
03:46:25,220 --> 03:46:25,860
God bless.

4594
03:46:27,380 --> 03:46:28,660
Happy Chinese New Year,

4595
03:46:29,380 --> 03:46:32,500
Mahal, Ni Hao, Happy Chinese New Year, Wong-Chan.

4596
03:46:33,940 --> 03:46:34,740
Last voicemail.

4597
03:46:35,460 --> 03:46:37,140
This is breaking news.

4598
03:46:37,140 --> 03:46:38,420
It's called breaking news.

4599
03:46:38,420 --> 03:46:40,100
Three, two, one, go.

4600
03:46:41,060 --> 03:46:43,060
Guys, guys, breaking news.

4601
03:46:45,700 --> 03:46:47,540
No, fucking Riley said that.

4602
03:46:47,540 --> 03:46:49,700
Fucking void gazers is canceled.

4603
03:46:49,700 --> 03:46:50,100
What?

4604
03:46:50,100 --> 03:46:50,500
That's true.

4605
03:46:50,500 --> 03:46:52,020
Also episode 300.

4606
03:46:52,580 --> 03:46:53,300
Have Trixie.

4607
03:46:53,300 --> 03:46:54,740
No, have Riley on.

4608
03:46:55,140 --> 03:46:57,220
Yeah, yeah.

4609
03:46:57,220 --> 03:46:59,300
This guy's brain's going a mile a minute.

4610
03:47:00,100 --> 03:47:02,500
He sounded like ABGN at the last we go, yeah.

4611
03:47:05,060 --> 03:47:07,700
Riley on the procrastinator's podcast.

4612
03:47:09,860 --> 03:47:10,420
Can we get him?

4613
03:47:10,420 --> 03:47:11,860
Can we, can we afford him?

4614
03:47:11,860 --> 03:47:13,060
I don't know if we can afford him.

4615
03:47:14,260 --> 03:47:16,900
He listened to the last episode, he was mad.

4616
03:47:16,900 --> 03:47:19,380
He was, he was, he was mauled tweeting about it on Twitter.

4617
03:47:19,380 --> 03:47:21,540
He gets to produce the next episode.

4618
03:47:21,540 --> 03:47:22,180
That's good enough.

4619
03:47:22,180 --> 03:47:24,340
We can let him produce the next episode.

4620
03:47:26,100 --> 03:47:26,820
I guess that's it.

4621
03:47:26,820 --> 03:47:27,620
That was the last voicemail.

4622
03:47:27,620 --> 03:47:28,020
We're done.

4623
03:47:28,020 --> 03:47:28,340
That'll do.

4624
03:47:28,340 --> 03:47:28,820
We did it.

4625
03:47:29,620 --> 03:47:30,820
That will do.

4626
03:47:30,820 --> 03:47:31,300
I'm ready.

4627
03:47:31,780 --> 03:47:33,300
I'm ready to call it.

4628
03:47:33,300 --> 03:47:36,020
I'm ready to fucking eat because I'm a fat boy.

4629
03:47:36,020 --> 03:47:36,820
I gotta go pee.

4630
03:47:36,820 --> 03:47:37,940
I gotta go pee to stuff my tummy.

4631
03:47:38,740 --> 03:47:41,300
I peed once during and I got to do it again.

4632
03:47:41,300 --> 03:47:41,540
Wow.

4633
03:47:41,540 --> 03:47:44,580
Because I'm drinking lots of delicious sparkling water.

4634
03:47:44,580 --> 03:47:45,540
Stay hydrated.

4635
03:47:45,540 --> 03:47:46,420
It's good for your kidneys.

4636
03:47:46,420 --> 03:47:47,140
Perfect.

4637
03:47:47,140 --> 03:47:47,460
Yes.

4638
03:47:48,900 --> 03:47:49,140
Okay.

4639
03:47:49,940 --> 03:47:50,580
Oh, good.

I have announcements to make, but not yet.

4661
03:48:36,100 --> 03:48:36,580
Not yet.

4662
03:48:37,380 --> 03:48:38,980

03:48:42,180 --> 03:48:42,820
All right, shut up.

4667
03:48:43,700 --> 03:48:44,180
That's it.

4668
03:48:44,180 --> 03:48:44,980
That's the end.

4669
03:48:44,980 --> 03:48:46,100
