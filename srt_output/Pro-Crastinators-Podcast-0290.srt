1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Son of a bitch.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Wibbity-wobbity-wee.

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's The Pro Crastinators.

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Uh, canned intro.

12
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay.

13
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, what are we talking about today?

14
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Canned intro?

15
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Canned intro.

16
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You can put an actual, you can put an actual canned intro, you're just gonna say that.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Uh, I'm sure Eleazar will, uh, cut in one of the many, many canned intros.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You know, actually, we actually recorded every Pro Crastinators podcast like four years ago.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We had a big session, we recorded every segment we could ever need.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We predicted like news and stuff that would probably happen.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We recorded different versions for different alternate futures, and we said, you know,

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
whenever this inevitable historical thing happens, just throw that segment in, mix and

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
mash them up Eleazar, create episodes in the future.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And so that's just, pull one of the many hilarious intro jokes that I made, insert that in there

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
at the beginning instead of me saying canned intro, which would be a really, really embarrassing

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
way for an episode to begin.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No, no, no.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here's the canned intro.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm gonna record it, and then you put that at the beginning.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Wibbity-wobbity-wee.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's the Pro Crastinators.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Another banger.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Another banger in the bag.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Another banger with mash.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So good.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
People love it.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They can't get enough.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
They can't get enough, and that's why, that's why we make the big bucks.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's why we make the big podcast money.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's why we're a bunch of coked up New Yorkers with the podcast.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hey, Ben.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In case you were wondering why that's the case.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What the fuck?

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,800
What the fuck indeed?

49
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
What the fuck indeed?

50
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,600
I was saying a minute ago, before we started recording, that I have to keep it a bit short

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:14,100
today because basically, as soon as the podcast ends, I have to run over to Munchy Kazzie's

52
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,000
house for Friendsgiving.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, yes.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have to get there early because I have several dishes.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I have several dishes I am bringing that have to be prepared on site for that.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Turkey brains and all that.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will tell you, I have some secret dishes.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have one, bacon wrapped Brussels sprouts, a classic, but they can't carry them over

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
there.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They get cold immediately.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Last night, I prepared them.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,800
I bought the sprouts at the local bazaar, at the Russian bazaar, and an old Russian lady,

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,000
as I'm picking Brussels sprouts out of the thing, she turns to me and she says, like,

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
oh, very good.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Those are very good.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,500
You like those?

68
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
These are very good.

69
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I love these.

70
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I'm going to make them for a late Thanksgiving, I said.

71
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
She said, you cook?

72
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Oh, you cook?

73
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I said, yes, a little bit.

74
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,500
She seemed a little bit like, oh, what did she walk away?

75
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
You do not strike me as the type to cook.

76
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
You look like a slob.

77
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
You look like a disgusting.

78
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:44,500
You're pajama pants, and you look like a fucking idiot.

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Those are great.

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:54,500
My favorite of their many desserts from their fine Russian dessert menu, the same display

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,500
case where I tasted bird's milk, which Mage told me about so many years ago.

82
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
If you remember our conversation about bird's milk, they have it there.

83
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,500
They've also got dulce de leche waffle cake, which I really like.

84
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
So I'm bringing that.

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
And then the third thing I'm bringing, I'm going to tell you this because this episode

86
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,500
won't be published until after I've already gone, is one time Anthony Munchie-Lol was

87
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,500
walking through there and he noticed something that he found really funny, which was a freezer

88
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,500
display containing something called, something he described as Siberian ravioli.

89
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
And he thought Siberian ravioli sounded really good.

90
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
I went back and I looked for it.

91
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Turns out it's not Siberian ravioli.

92
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
It was Siberian dumplings.

93
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
But I mean tomato, tomato.

94
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,500
So I'm also bringing, I'm also bringing Siberian dumplings.

95
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
What is the, what is the filling of a Siberian dumpling?

96
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I think it said it's like, it's like veal, it's like veal pork chicken.

97
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Siberian tiger.

98
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,500
I think it's just some, it's just little, they do look like ravioli.

99
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:06,500
They're just little, little round, little round ravioli things with like a veal pork mash inside.

100
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I don't know.

101
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Probably pretty good.

102
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Just got to boil those in a pot.

103
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Sounds good.

104
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
That's going to be pretty funny.

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Everyone's going to be like, whoa, the long prophesized Siberian ravioli.

106
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Hell yeah.

107
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Hell yeah.

108
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
So I can't be late.

109
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
I can't be late for that, obviously.

110
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Yeah.

111
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,500
We had, I had actual Thanksgiving.

112
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
My parents house posted on Twitter.

113
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Last week I said, my dad got COVID.

114
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Or at least he tested positive for it.

115
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
This week I just posted a picture of me at Thanksgiving.

116
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
He is testing negative.

117
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
He's fine.

118
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Very relieved about that.

119
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,500
I did, I did take the opportunity to hit up the Patreon.

120
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,500
No, no, no, the procrastinators teespring.

121
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Yes.

122
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
And buy him an I have COVID shirt.

123
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Eleazar, please post this.

124
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Please, I'll just get, I'll get the tweet.

125
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I'll grab the tweet for you.

126
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Here's my, here's my dad.

127
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Yeah, I saw that image and the I have COVID shirt.

128
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,500
It took me a while to remember that that was this shirt that we sell.

129
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Yeah, of course.

130
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
It's so normal and boring, but it's like, it's perfect.

131
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Because nobody would think you have to be into a obscure podcast.

132
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Yes, exactly.

133
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
To have a shirt like this.

134
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Link in the description, right?

135
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
We have a link in the description.

136
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
We have something.

137
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,500
We have like a teespring like something or other merchandise.

138
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
We have a page.

139
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Yeah.

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,500
If you want to have your very own, be cool like my dad and have your very own.

141
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
I have COVID shirt.

142
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
It's so, it's so like dumb.

143
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
I love it.

144
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Yeah.

145
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,500
I was like on it genuinely when my dad was like tested positive.

146
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,500
I rubbed my hands together and I said, yes, a marketing opportunity has presented itself.

147
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
And here it is.

148
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
It's paying off.

149
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
What did you think of it when you gave it to him?

150
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:23,500
He, you know, I sent it to him a few, like a few days before it arrived.

151
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
And then I didn't look at my phone the day that it did arrive.

152
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
So I didn't, I don't see his like immediate reaction.

153
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,500
But he, when I met, when I saw him for Thanksgiving and talked about it, he seemed very amused by it.

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
And I was like, you know, okay, good.

155
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
I'm glad for that.

156
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Yeah.

157
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
It's certainly a good shirt to wear if you had recovered from it.

158
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I think if, if you had got it and then you died after, if you died of it, I wouldn't personally, I wouldn't want to be buried in it.

159
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
It's not that good a joke.

160
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
No, but never.

161
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
No, no, but it's close.

162
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
No, I want to be, I want to be buried in something really funny.

163
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
You know, not just a little funny.

164
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Like dog shit.

165
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Yes.

166
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Yes.

167
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Exactly.

168
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Looking at my Twitter replies.

169
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
How mad should I be?

170
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Very.

171
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Okay.

172
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
That's fine.

173
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
That's good.

174
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Oh yeah, you don't have Thanksgiving.

175
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
They didn't invent Thanksgiving over there.

176
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
And it hasn't figured out how to do it yet.

177
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
That was an American invention.

178
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Yes.

179
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Yes.

180
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I mean, you don't have Guy Fawkes night though.

181
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
So.

182
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
No, we don't have Guy Fawkes day or night.

183
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,500
I was just going to say, everyone complains about Turkey and it's, you know what, they're all, they're all pluses.

184
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
It's fine.

185
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Everyone says, oh, Turkey's bad.

186
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Nobody eats Turkey except on Thanksgiving.

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
And the reason is because it's not actually any good.

188
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
It's just a tradition, but it's not actually a good meat.

189
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
It's fine.

190
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
It's totally fine.

191
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,500
I think in terms of like poultry, if it counts as poultry.

192
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Yeah.

193
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
It's, it is like chicken is the best.

194
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
And then it's like Turkey and duck afterwards.

195
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
That's a bit too fatty, I feel.

196
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
I like, I like duck a lot.

197
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,500
I mean, we just, you just, you know, nobody, nobody eats sliced Turkey.

198
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,500
I eat, I eat turkey sandwiches all the time and buy cold cuts.

199
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
It's great.

200
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Turkey curry is good as well.

201
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:47,500
That's a, that's a good, like a, like a Christmas, a Christmas like leftovers thing is to get like the Turkey that you didn't eat and make a curry out of it.

202
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
That's really interesting.

203
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
I mean, we had, we have Turkey, Turkey, Turkey at Thanksgiving.

204
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,500
We make Turkey sandwiches, Turkey sandwiches with like stuffing and cranberry sauce on them.

205
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Traditional like leftover.

206
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
We do that as well at Christmas.

207
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
It's really just the same thing.

208
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
That's funny.

209
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
That was so funny about it.

210
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Well, I guess curry in general in America is like less.

211
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
I think we just don't, I think we just don't make curry that much.

212
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Yeah.

213
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I never, I never had curry.

214
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,500
It's the heavy Indian influence and the, the, I guess, all that stuff.

215
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I guess so.

216
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,500
I saw them eat curry in anime and I thought like, I thought it was like a funny foreign food.

217
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Fucking weird.

218
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Yeah.

219
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
That was the only my exposure.

220
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Fucking animation.

221
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Love it.

222
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,500
When now to eat this, this little Prince Curry brand that's too spicy and fully cool.

223
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,500
I was like, hmm, I can't possibly relate to this, whatever there's going on here.

224
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
This doesn't make any sense.

225
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,500
I have had like a Japanese curry before, like from, I don't know, like a Chinese restaurant.

226
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
They have like, oh, all sorts of things.

227
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
You can do Korean, we can do Chinese and Japanese.

228
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
And they have a Japanese curry and it's like very different from an Indian curry.

229
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Hmm.

230
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Yeah.

231
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Definitely why, but like the spices used are different, I guess.

232
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I've gotten like a curry mix, like a block that you break into pieces and you sort of,

233
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
you cook in the pot to like season it.

234
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
The brand I've usually get is called Golden and I think it's Japanese.

235
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:22,500
And the thing about Golden Curry is that it comes in various spicy levels, like mild to medium to hot to very hot.

236
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
And they're all not spicy at all.

237
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
They're all total bullshit.

238
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
It's sad.

239
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
It's a bit of a discipline.

240
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I wanted that little Prince experience.

241
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
The curry being too spicy.

242
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm wondering, do you, could you even get like a curry takeaway in America if you wanted one?

243
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
You would have to go to an Indian restaurant, I think.

244
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Well, well, of course, but like, how many are there?

245
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Are there like one or two in the whole of Boston or something?

246
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
I mean, in the whole of Boston, I'm sure there's quite a few.

247
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,500
There's probably like one Indian place like in my neighborhood.

248
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Right.

249
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
I don't know, I don't know where.

250
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
I mean, they're around.

251
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
They're not super common.

252
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
They're less common than Chinese.

253
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I would wonder if the Americanization has taken effect on Indian restaurants and if it's different from UK Indian restaurants.

254
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Because there's a lot of really good Indian restaurants in the UK.

255
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Hmm.

256
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
I like me a fucking madras.

257
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
I don't even know what that is.

258
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
A fucking phall.

259
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Kitchy a tori.

260
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
There's all sorts of words that I've heard in passing.

261
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
A phall, itchy a tori.

262
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
No, a phall.

263
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
The phall is like an F-A-A-L.

264
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Oh, I don't know what that.

265
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
A really hot curry.

266
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I don't know what that is either.

267
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,500
You would order like, oh, a lamb or a chicken and then the name of the spice, the sauce.

268
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,500
So like a madras is a pretty hot, pretty spicy.

269
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
I like that one.

270
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I actually had Indian food.

271
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Last time I had Indian food was for Crack's birthday, which was like two months ago, six weeks ago, something like that.

272
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Yeah, I know.

273
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
What do I know?

274
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I know mango lassi.

275
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I know naan.

276
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I know tandoori.

277
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Naan, yep.

278
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I might know one or two others.

279
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Tikka masala, of course.

280
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Tikka masala.

281
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Yeah, the tikka, I think it's the tikka that means like a drier sauce.

282
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
It's not like a creamy sauce.

283
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
It's like a sort of marinated in...

284
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Like a rub.

285
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I think that's what that means.

287
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Like some sauces are nice and dry or like sort of oily and some are like really creamy.

288
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Live for a creamy sauce, if you know what I'm saying.

289
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,500
I was saying, I think I was maybe talking to...

290
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,500
I think I was maybe talking to Kazi about this because I remember telling someone, we were talking about eating slop.

291
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
And I said, the best slop you can get...

292
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I was like, you never been to an Indian restaurant?

293
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
They got some great slop there.

294
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Because half the time when I order something in an Indian restaurant, it comes in a side bowl and it's some sort of unrecognizable slop.

295
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
But you put it on your rice and it's delicious.

296
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,500
They all look the same except maybe slightly different colors.

297
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Sometimes it's a little greener and sometimes it's a little redder.

298
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,500
But either way, you slop on your rice and you mix it in and it's great.

299
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Were they talking about being slop sensitive?

300
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Slop sensitive.

301
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
That does ring a bell.

302
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
That's something they've said before.

303
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
I don't know whether that means they like slop or like...

304
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Have they said slops?

305
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Blah.

306
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
It's funny.

307
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
I feel like I am slop sensitive.

308
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,500
If there's too much slop, if it's too sloppy and you could move it around with a spoon

309
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,500
and it goes... or something, then I'm like, oh, oh no.

310
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
I don't want to put that in my mouth, even if it is good.

311
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
I do.

312
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I need some texture, some crunch, some...

313
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I'll take your leftover slop.

314
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
No, what I'll do.

315
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Here's a tip, like a fucking cooking tip, like I know what I'm talking about.

316
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,500
You get like, this is not so much an Indian thing, but you get like a chili con carne.

317
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Maybe it's too sloppy.

318
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Maybe it's too much slop in there.

319
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Classic problem.

320
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
You got your chili con carne, but it's too sloppy.

321
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
It's too sloppy.

322
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Black and white footage of a housewife like picking up a spoon full of it and like shaking

323
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
all over the place and like it's flopping over the sides of the spoon.

324
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I can't hold it in.

325
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,500
There's not enough meat, there's not enough kidney beans or like rice to soak it up.

326
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
So it's like, ah, it's just slop.

327
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Get some Doritos, crunch them up, throw them in.

328
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,500
You could probably use any corn tortilla, right?

329
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Yeah.

330
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
It's really good.

332
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
That sounds pretty good actually.

333
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I like, I like, I think, no, I'm not slop sensitive.

334
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,500
I actually think my favorite thing to eat is a slop.

335
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Mashed potatoes I would call a particularly viscous kind of slop.

336
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
I would say that's...

337
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
You would not call that sloppy?

338
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I would not call it sloppy because it can stand on its own.

339
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
It's like a, it's an independent food.

340
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,500
It can, it can make, you can make a mountain out of, if you can make a mountain out of

341
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
a food, it's not sloppy.

342
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Okay, okay.

343
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,500
But anything that I can just, anything that I can just literally shovel into my mouth,

344
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,500
like dig it with a spoon and shovel it in, put the plate up to my mouth and open my mouth

345
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
and just push volumes of the food into my, my waiting mom.

346
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Yeah, the way that every anime character eats when they don't want to actually animate

347
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
the eating in the show.

348
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Yeah, yeah.

349
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Just like, oh, I open mouth and I'm finished.

350
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
I'm going to go be a shonen battle.

351
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Not even, not even move my teeth, not do any chewing.

352
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Just push, use the spoon to push food to the back of my mouth to my continually working,

353
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
you know, tonsils and, and uvula.

354
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,500
You know what I, in the back just glugging it down the tube.

355
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Just chug, chug that slop.

356
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Chug the slop.

357
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
That's what I like to do.

358
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
You know what I think?

359
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,500
I'm thinking, I'm thinking 2022, we're having slops giving.

360
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Only slops.

361
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,500
We're going to do, we're going to do like a radcon, but like a new version of radcon,

362
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
new branding.

363
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,500
And the only thing we're going to do is do slop streams.

364
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,500
We're going to stream making and then eating slop.

365
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Yes.

366
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
And we're going to have a slop side.

367
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,500
We're going to have a slop, a suggest a slop, uh, uh, like mailing anonymous tip, tip section.

368
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Send us your slop.

369
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Show us your slop.

370
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Do.

371
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
All right.

372
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Obviously you wouldn't know.

373
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I don't know why I started saying, do you remember?

374
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Like, cause this is a British thing.

375
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Do you, uh, dick and dumb in the bungalow, right?

376
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
That sounded racist.

377
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
No, no.

378
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Dick and dumb in dick and dumb in the bungalow.

379
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Dick and dumb in the bungalow.

380
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Okay.

381
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Two, um, TV presenters, comedian duo.

382
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Uh,

383
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
No, I've never heard of this.

384
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Yeah.

385
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Of course.

386
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,500
It's, it's very, it's obscure to everyone except British kids.

387
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Okay.

388
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Only British kids would understand.

389
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
And like two thousand nineties.

390
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Dude, dude, give remember, remember the Mohegan son.

391
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Remember, remember, uh, uh, uh,

392
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Oh, I gotta pretend I know.

393
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Um, yeah, sure.

394
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
It pays to play.

395
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,500
You can play every night in a city by the sea.

396
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,500
You can play every day surrounded by luxury.

397
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Step back in time.

398
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Come along to the new, new Port Grand.

399
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Oh, you wouldn't know about,

400
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
you wouldn't know about Newport Grand Radio jingle.

401
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
That's specifically to specifically the,

402
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
the Southern Massachusetts Providence area.

403
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Sounds like an idiot would like that.

404
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
And remember,

405
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
it's like sister radio jingle for a casino that they,

406
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
that is around here.

407
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Uh, anyway, yes.

408
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Yeah.

409
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
So, so Dick and Dom in the bungalow, uh, it's,

410
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
it was like a, it was a Saturday morning.

411
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Like I can't even describe, but like children.

412
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,500
There was like, it was like a game show and like just a chaos show.

413
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Dick and Dom, um, they had like, uh, you know, wacky, like, uh,

414
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Wait, was this on the radio?

415
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
No, no, no, it was on, on TV.

416
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Okay.

417
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
So Saturday morning show, they would,

418
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
they would be wacky presenters and they would have cartoons play

419
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,500
and they would be in this, um, Pee Wee's big adventure,

420
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
not Pee Wee's big event.

421
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Who's Pee Wee?

422
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
I know Pee Wee's Playhouse.

423
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Pee Wee's Playhouse.

424
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
So Pee Wee's Playhouse-esque house.

425
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
And they would have a bunch of kids who are rowdy as fuck.

426
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
It's the most rowdy thing you've ever seen.

427
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Um, they were thrashing.

428
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
They would, they would often be really badly behaved

429
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
and throw things and scream.

430
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
And it was a nightmare, but it was great

431
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
because as a kid, you would, you wished you were there.

432
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Um,

433
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Absolutely.

434
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
And at the end of every show, they would have like a fun-

435
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
At the end of Evangelion.

436
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
At the end of every show, they would have the muck fight.

437
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
What would they call it?

438
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
They had creamy muck muck.

439
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
This is what they call it.

440
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Was it muck bang?

441
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Did they call it the muck bang?

442
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
No.

443
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
They had buckets of like custard and, and slime and slop

444
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
and various, various gross things.

445
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
And they would have like a slime, a slop fight.

446
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
And they would throw buckets of creamy muck muck

447
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
all over the place and slime would dunk

448
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
and the kids would throw it at the cameraman

449
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
and, and Dick and Don would throw it at each other

450
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,500
and all the kids and they'd be like screaming.

451
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
It was the coolest thing ever.

452
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
I love that shit.

453
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
We should do that.

454
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,500
We should do, we should do Ben and Gib in Da Bungalow.

455
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
We should get a bungalow.

456
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Ben and Gib in Da Bungalow's Creamy Muck Muck Battle.

457
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Is that the title of the episode?

458
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm thinking we got an episode title right there.

459
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
We gotta do it.

460
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I think there's a bunch of episodes on, on YouTube.

461
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,500
They had, it was, it was like two hours from like 9 a.m. to 11.

462
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Where they would just, they would do,

463
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,500
they would have this fun game, a segment where they would,

464
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
it would be called Bogies.

465
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Bogies being like, um...

466
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Like boogers?

467
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Boogers, yeah.

468
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Gross.

469
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
It's the British word for booger.

470
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,500
I remember because when Hermione sticks her wand up the troll's nose.

471
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Troll bogies.

472
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
They say troll bogies, yeah.

473
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Yes, that's why golf is really funny,

474
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
because they have bogies in it.

475
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
That's right.

476
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I don't know what they are, but I know that they're there.

477
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
It's when you go one over par or something.

478
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Oh, okay.

479
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
I was, damn, I was gonna write something.

480
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I just had a thing I was gonna write on my things to bring up in conversation list,

481
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
but I forgot.

482
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,500
But it's okay, because Ben and Gibbin to bungalow and the creamy muck muck battle is better.

483
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
So, okay.

484
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Um, yeah, yeah.

485
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Bogies, where they, the two of them would go into a place that's usually supposed to be quiet,

486
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,500
like a library, or like a public place that's like, people are just doing things,

487
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,500
and they would candid camera, like secret hidden camera be there,

488
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,500
and they would have, they would play bogies, which was a game that caught on,

489
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
and that I have played with my brothers.

490
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Did they invent the game or?

491
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
They invented the game.

492
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,500
The game is that you have to say bogies out loud, one after the other,

493
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
and the second person has to say it louder than the previous one.

494
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Oh, I know, wait, I know this game.

495
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Wait, there's no way they invented it.

496
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Maybe it's called something else.

497
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Maybe they didn't invent it.

498
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
I don't know, but that was the thing.

499
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
I remember a lot.

500
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Obviously I didn't.

501
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
No, the version I've heard is you have to say sex.

502
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,500
You have to say sex as loud as you dare to say it in a library.

503
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
That's crude and rude.

504
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
That's not good.

505
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Saying bogies is better because it's like, people don't really know how to react

506
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
to bogies being said very loudly.

507
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
It's sort of like, it's innocuous enough that people aren't going to tell you off,

508
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
but they're going to give you a weird look, and they do this.

509
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
A lot of weird looks when you play that game, I would imagine.

510
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,500
That is a game I've definitely played multiple times with my brothers in an art museum,

511
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,500
or just a place where it's quiet and it's awkward,

512
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,500
and it would be like, wouldn't it be really fucked if we said bogies?

513
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
If we did the bogies game.

514
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
It would be so fucked up.

515
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
It would be so fucked.

516
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Memories.

517
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Was that, so that was like live when you were a kid?

518
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
That was going on back then.

519
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Yes.

520
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow.

521
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Da Bungalow.

522
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:15,500
It reminds me of, I don't know, there were various live action shows on Nickelodeon

523
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
that had cartoon segments in them.

524
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
What was that?

525
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
What was that one?

526
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
How fuck?

527
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Was it, there was one with like a puppet called Bonesy.

528
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Do you ever see that one?

529
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
I don't know.

530
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Oh jeez.

531
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
It wasn't salute your shorts.

532
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Hold on.

533
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Bonesy puppets.

534
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
They had the underpants dance.

535
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,500
It was, it was, because underpants, you know, why fronts?

536
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
You put some underpants on your head.

537
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Why fronts?

538
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Like, like briefs?

539
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Briefs?

540
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Is that not a term?

541
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Why fronts?

542
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
I've never, I've never heard them called why fronts.

543
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
I think I've heard that before.

544
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
I've never said it before, but yeah.

545
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
You put underpants on your head and you dance.

546
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Wienerville.

547
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Wienerville is the show I'm thinking of.

548
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Like the dark?

549
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,500
No, probably like, like a hot dog.

550
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Like, like this, like the snack.

551
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Anyway, okay, whatever.

552
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
That's a different show.

553
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Eddie, continue.

554
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
I didn't have anything else.

555
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
I was just sort of remembering the underpants dance.

556
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,500
But how did we even, how did we even, did we get here from COVID?

557
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Oh, everything comes from COVID.

558
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
It all comes back.

559
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
COVID's the great new thing.

560
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
The hot new trend.

561
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
It's pretty big.

562
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Oh, I want to ask you.

563
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Did you hear about the new variant, the Omicron?

564
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Yeah, I've been seeing Omicron on Twitter.

565
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,500
You know, the, I think, was the last variant, I think was Lambda,

566
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
and that one kind of didn't go anywhere.

567
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,500
That one sort of just, nobody really cared about it after a while.

568
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Yeah, it didn't, it wasn't very, it wasn't viral success.

569
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
No, no, that one didn't catch on.

570
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,500
So, I mean, hoping Omicron is the same, but I mean, I guess we'll see.

571
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
You know, because the news is like, they found a new variant.

572
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Oh, is it vaccine resistant?

573
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,500
Oh, is it like, you know, does it circumvent the human immune system?

574
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,500
I looked at the articles and it's all just like, there's something new.

575
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Scientists are unknowing, they don't know anything, but we should be scared, maybe.

576
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:43,500
It's like, I'll wait, I'll wait until it's actually, you know, some.

577
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I'll wait until the article says like, yes, the Omicron variant is coming to your,

578
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
is coming for your children and it is vaccine resistant

579
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,500
and it does circumvent the human immune system and it will fuck you.

580
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Then I'll be like, shit, but not until then.

581
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,500
I care obviously about like, the fact that new variants are still happening,

582
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:12,500
but in the short term, I just care about it not being a problem until after I have visited in January.

583
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Yeah, I saw, I saw there were some like South African travel restrictions

584
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:24,500
and I thought, wouldn't it be really funny if like, they put some new travel bans on the UK

585
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
like right before Gib was gonna come visit, like again.

586
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,500
I just want to fucking hang out.

587
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I know, I know.

588
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Well, no use worrying about it.

589
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Yeah, if it happens, it happens and hopefully I can get a refund, but whatever.

590
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Fucking sucks.

591
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,500
Dude, did you know this COVID virus is bad and I don't like it?

592
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Nah, nah, it's like less than 1% fatality rate though.

593
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Oh, that's lucky.

594
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
That's good.

595
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,500
In fact, that's better than it not existing.

596
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,500
It's like a cold, you know.

597
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,500
And as we all know, it gets cold in the winter, so it's really just part of nature.

598
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:18,500
I looked, I heard my dad tested positive and I was like, I was like, oh fuck, how scared should I be?

599
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
And I looked it up and like, I looked at the stats.

600
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,500
I looked at the stats for his age bracket.

601
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Stop me if I did, if I talked about this last episode.

602
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
I don't think you did.

603
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Okay, well I looked up stats for his age, I looked at the survival rate for his age bracket.

604
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,500
And the survival rate for his age bracket was like 1 in 20.

605
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
And I was like, that's not great.

606
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,500
But then I was like, okay, but there are mitigating factors here.

607
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,500
He's at the young end of his age bracket, like he's just barely in the like 60 plus.

608
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
It's like 60 to 80, right?

609
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,500
So like an 80 year old is going to be a lot less likely to survive than a 60 year old.

610
00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:02,500
And also he's double vaccinated and also he's got no underlying conditions that are like respiratory in nature, et cetera, et cetera.

611
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,500
And I was like, okay, so I mean, he's probably actually much more likely to survive than merely 1 in 20.

612
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:21,500
So like, you know, but still, you know, if I had like a 5% or a 1% chance of dying, you know, that's still very upsetting, you know.

613
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,500
I've rolled, I've rolled the 20 sided dies and gotten a 1 before.

614
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,500
So, you know, it's not good.

615
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:37,500
But it's like, okay, I think it might, I think it might have been a false positive though, because he like, he said he didn't have like any symptoms at all.

616
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
And it seemed it was gone in like a week.

617
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:45,500
So maybe it was a false positive or maybe it was just like, he just barely had it or something.

618
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
I don't know.

619
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,500
It all worked out.

620
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
We'll never know.

621
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Omicron, I don't know.

622
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Yeah, they haven't actually found any positive statements.

623
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:05,500
They must probably think that maybe it's bad because it's like become very prominent in South Africa or something.

624
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Yeah, there's a bunch of African countries that are like on the red list because of it.

625
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,500
That must make them think it's probably a pretty bad variant, but I guess we'll see.

626
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,500
I don't know how these things work with regards to like information dispersal.

627
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Yeah, like journalists.

628
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,500
I mean, I would have to see like, well, I mean, is there some other reason that may like a new variant could have done it in these countries?

629
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Like were those countries like extremely relaxed about their, you know, about their like,

630
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Well, a new variant can come about for reasons of like people not being vaccinated enough and stuff.

631
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,500
It's really just like how bad the variant is because variants are always going to happen

632
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,500
as long as the virus is still alive and able to like reproduce through people.

633
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,500
I mean, a new variant, new variants are inevitable, but like...

634
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,500
A scary new variant is like, I don't know if that's this yet.

635
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,500
If one becomes like the dominant variant, then it makes you think like,

636
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,500
okay, well, this one must behave differently.

637
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Maybe this one behaves differently in a way that is like, okay, it gets around the vaccine or it does something.

638
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:28,500
The thing that I'm thinking though, this may be just like random speculation, not scientist disclaimer.

639
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
This is medical advice.

640
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,500
No, but like the fact that it's coming up in South Africa,

641
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,500
I'm not totally sure how the vaccine situation is in South Africa,

642
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,500
but like a lot of the wealthier nations are hoarding vaccines.

643
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
They're not really giving them out freely.

644
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
So I have a hunch that it's a new variant.

645
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,500
South Africa is one of the more wealthy countries in Africa, I think, right?

646
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Yeah, yeah, but I would be more scared if a very heavily vaccinated country came up with a new variant

647
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,500
because that would imply that the vaccine is not effective against stopping that,

648
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
or like it evolved to counter the vaccine or something like that.

649
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,500
I have no, like, it's just a guess, but I feel like coming from South Africa,

650
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,500
it's probably going to be the vaccines that we already have will do most of the work in stopping it.

651
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Still, we've got to be careful of course.

652
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Yeah, one would hope.

653
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Yeah, I'm not going to like drop my guard because I think that,

654
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,500
but it's just sort of like it's not making me lose sleep, I guess.

655
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Wow, so the percentage of the population fully vaccinated in the United States,

656
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
it's not even 60%.

657
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
That's embarrassing.

658
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Actually, let me see if I can UK.

659
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:53,500
South Africa, I'm looking up South Africa.

660
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Come on, I was looking at the wrong graph.

661
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,500
The percentage in South Africa is...

662
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,500
What, was there so backwards in African, that South Africa?

663
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,500
I bet theirs is like, I bet theirs is a pathetic 60%.

664
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Oh, fuck.

665
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Oh, 24%.

666
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Okay, that's not great.

667
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Yeah, it's really just a case of money.

668
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I thought South Africa was pretty westernized, pretty first world,

669
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,500
like it's just parts of it that are heavily infrastructureed.

670
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
I don't know.

671
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
I hardly know anything about South Africa.

672
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Yeah, I don't know what they have in terms of like the world stage,

673
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,500
like markets and trade and stuff.

674
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
I don't know how wealthy they would be.

675
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Yeah, well, so yeah, it's only 24%.

676
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,500
So, I mean, okay, that's not great.

677
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
That could explain something.

678
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,500
I'm looking at the fucking vaccination rates.

679
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Oh, God, there's not a single number.

680
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,500
It's just like a big list of information.

681
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
I don't want information, I want quick facts.

682
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Well, I do see some articles here, run from the Wall Street Journal

683
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,500
that says, Omicron variant highlights risks of low vaccination rates in poor countries.

684
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Washington Post says, Omicron variant symptom of vaccine inequities.

685
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Yeah, so seems like these people are saying like, yeah, it's because the vaccine isn't.

686
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:35,500
It's almost like sharing the vaccine with everyone would mutually benefit all of it, every country.

687
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:44,500
It really annoys me that there's going around like, oh, get your booster shot on top of the second half of the vaccine.

688
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Get your booster shot now, because we have the ability to just give third shots in the UK.

689
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Don't do that, please just send vaccines to everywhere.

690
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,500
That's why variants exist, that they're constantly being made.

691
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,500
But they're not the same shots, right?

692
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Like a booster shot is not the same thing.

693
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Or maybe it is, I have no idea.

694
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:21,500
But the fact is, resources being spent on a third booster, a third jab, that is largely unnecessary as far as I know.

695
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Maybe it's for very vulnerable people need it, but I don't know.

696
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Actually, I hate to burst your bubble, but actually I was disappointed to see that the resistance rate actually drops off fairly precipitously.

697
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:50,500
You're like 90-something percent protected from becoming seriously ill with COVID if you're double vaccinated, but six months later it drops to 50% and it just keeps dropping.

698
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
So it does do something.

699
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,500
I mean, you're right that distributing resources evenly is probably better.

700
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:02,500
I want my booster shot, and I think I just became eligible for it.

701
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:12,500
They said I had to wait six months since my second shot, and I got my second shot on May 26th, and it's the 28th today, so I just became eligible two days ago.

702
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,500
So I should go get that, I guess.

703
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
I mean, since they got them.

704
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,500
Yeah, well whatever.

705
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
I guess I'll get mine.

706
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,500
If I get a text from the government saying, hey, get your fucking jab, you idiot, and I'm like fine.

707
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
I'll do what you say.

708
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
God.

709
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,500
It's free, so I guess why not, but I still frown about it.

710
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Mr. Big Government, I love the state.

711
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
I love Big Government.

712
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,500
I will do anything to support my queen.

713
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:54,500
As a Democrat, I am slavishly devoted to the state and Big Government, yes.

714
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
I will do.

715
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:05,500
I do pray to Dr. Fauci, my little Fauci shrine every single night.

716
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Whole pocket Fauci.

717
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Whole pocket Fauci.

718
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,500
I did look up, what is the UK vaccination rate?

719
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I tried to find it.

720
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,500
I think it was 50 million people, more than 50 million.

721
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,500
I thought you were going to say 90%, and I was going to get mad.

722
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I found it almost 9 in 10 of those aged 12 or over having had a single jab and 8 in 10 having had a second.

723
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Fully vaccinated according to Google, it's 68.9%.

724
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:43,500
You guys have about 9% more than we do, so that's embarrassing.

725
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,500
This thing on the BBC is saying 8 in 10, that's 80%.

726
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
That seems...

727
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
For both jabs?

728
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
For both.

729
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Yeah, that's different than what this Google graph is telling me.

730
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Well, I'd assume it's more likely the lower number.

731
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
That's fair.

732
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,500
There are quite a few vaccine idiots in the UK as well.

733
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,500
The United States is a whole, just under 60.

734
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
UK, just under 70.

735
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Massachusetts though, 70.8%.

736
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,500
I read a little Twitter thread.

737
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
I may have mentioned this because it made me happy.

738
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,500
I read a little Twitter thread where a European guy was saying like,

739
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Hey, Americans, tell me what state you live in and I'll tell you what Europeans think about your state.

740
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:44,500
And I scrolled down to find Massachusetts and he was like,

741
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
I think we like Massachusetts.

742
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:52,500
I think Massachusetts is sort of like a little pocket of Europe over in America.

743
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Thumbs up.

744
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
And I was like, yes, fuck yeah.

745
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
I hate my fellow Americans.

746
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
I hate my fellow men.

747
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,500
It does feel very similar, especially in how cold it is sometimes.

748
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
That's true.

749
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,500
New England has worse.

750
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Okay.

751
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,500
My understanding from things that I've read is that New England has worse weather than Europe,

752
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,500
even though much of Europe is further north and it's because of like the Gulf Stream,

753
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,500
like European weather, like a little bit more moderate.

754
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Whereas in New England, we get like really cold winters and like really hot summers.

755
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
The UK.

756
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,500
You wouldn't think we get hot summers because of how north we are, but we do.

757
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,500
We hit 100 degrees once in a while.

758
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Yeah.

759
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Fahrenheit.

760
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,500
The Gulf Stream is what stops the UK from literally being like an ice block.

761
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Oh shit.

762
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,500
You there?

763
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Yes, I spoke.

764
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Sorry, headphones fell out, but I caught it.

765
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
I need a better cord.

766
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
You mother fucker.

767
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
It's always something.

768
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,500
You just need to get an ear trumpet or something.

769
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Yeah.

770
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,500
What were we talking about?

771
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
Vaccines.

772
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
I love it.

773
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Here's for something I was going to say.

774
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Have you heard that the queen is in a cocoon and she is going into a new state?

775
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Yes.

776
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,500
I saw those bizarre headlines saying she's entering a new phase.

777
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,500
A new phase, whatever the fuck that means.

778
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,500
It's definitely like they're trying very hard to be truthful, but not to say she's dying

779
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,500
because that's what else could it really be referring to if she's in the hospital

780
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,500
and she's going into a new phase where it's a good phase.

781
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
We won't see her for months.

782
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
It's just a new phase.

783
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
It's just a new phase.

784
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
She comes out.

785
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,500
She's got like a goth makeup and earrings.

786
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Was it coronavirus related?

787
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
No, no.

788
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,500
I think she's just very, very, very old.

789
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,500
And now her husband is dead.

790
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,500
So her emotional rock is gone and now she's like, fuck it.

791
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
I just want to die and I'm like, yeah.

792
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Yeah, true though.

793
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Same though.

794
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I also want you to die.

795
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,500
I did see those.

796
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
I felt nothing.

797
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,500
I feel nothing about the Queen.

798
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:38,500
She had like a place in my understanding of what my country is.

799
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,500
It's like, oh, the Queen's cool because she's got crowns and stuff.

800
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,500
And now I'm like, why does she have crowns and I don't?

801
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
The fuck.

802
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Childhood is thinking the Queen's cool because she wears a crown.

803
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Adulthood is wondering, where's my crown?

804
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
Exactly.

805
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Yeah, yeah.

806
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Hell yeah.

807
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:03,500
So I'd be interested when she dies of what happens.

808
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
What ceremonies are they going to do?

809
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
How many trumpets are they going to do?

810
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Do they blow?

811
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,500
I think they blow, they like let smoke out of like the tower, right?

812
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,500
They like white, like black smoke when she dies.

813
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,500
That's the pope thing.

814
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,500
And then the council convenes and they vote on the new queen

815
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
and then they put white smoke out, right?

816
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
No?

817
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
No.

818
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Okay.

819
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,500
It's going to be Prince Charles will be the crowned the king,

820
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
which will be interesting, I guess.

821
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,500
So God save the king, we're going to have to say.

822
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Is he the one that married that American woman?

823
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
No, no, no, no.

824
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,500
That's his son, Prince Harry.

825
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Oh, Harry's the one that wore that Nazi Halloween costume, right?

826
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
But what?

827
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
I swear, he swear he did.

828
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,500
Prince Andrew, the weird sex guy.

829
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Weird sex guy.

830
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
Dude, I want that guy to be king.

831
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
Please make the weird sex guy king.

832
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Prince Andrew is like a friend of Epstein,

833
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,500
sort of like weird controversy, motherfucker.

834
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
But Prince Harry.

835
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Really?

836
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Prince Harry.

837
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,500
No, it was Prince Harry apologizes for Nazi costume.

838
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
I mean, it was when he was like a kid.

839
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Yeah.

840
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,500
Why do you do it, huh?

841
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Okay, so Harry is the son of Charles, right?

842
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,500
Charles, yes.

843
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Charles was married to Princess Diana, I think.

844
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
And now, and then he married someone else.

845
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,500
After Princess Diana died in a very funny accident.

846
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,500
It was really funny.

847
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Wait, wait, wait.

848
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
We're still asking about it.

849
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,500
No, no, this is the lady who I was thinking of.

850
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she was born in America,

851
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,500
so people said she could technically run for president.

852
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Like, Prince Charles's wife could run for president.

853
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,500
And I think some fucking, like,

854
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,500
kaha of warrenite psychopaths were being like,

855
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,500
oh my god, the queen of England should run for president

856
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
so we could finally have a woman of color.

857
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Because she's like, I don't know, like half Lebanese

858
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,500
or some shit, I don't know.

859
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
What are they?

860
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Is she like the only woman of color that they've ever heard of?

861
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Any woman who could in any way be described as not white

862
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,500
would do, put that on, put that butt on the seat

863
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,500
in the Oval Office and they'll go,

864
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,500
and they'll go, progress.

865
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,500
They'll say yes, queen, because she'll literally be a queen.

866
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,500
They will say they will elect Crown Queen,

867
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Meghan Markle as a president of America,

868
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,500
and they'll literally say yes, queen,

869
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,500
and then they'll be like, we did it.

870
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,500
And then I'll forget about politics again.

871
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,500
It's just very funny.

872
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,500
But yes, this is the woman I was thinking of

873
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,500
because I saw interviews with her earlier this year

874
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,500
or last year, they had some kind of PR kerfuffle

875
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,500
where they had an interview with Oprah or something

876
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
and they said some weird shit,

877
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
some weird, unrelatable rich person shit.

878
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Yeah, I can't remember exactly.

879
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,500
The thing with Harry and Meghan

880
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,500
is that they've left the royal duties of the royal family

881
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,500
and Harry will, I think, he's given up his heir

882
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:23,500
to throne-ness and he doesn't have to go to royal events

883
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,500
and smile and wave anymore because he didn't want to do that.

884
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,500
He's living in the spotlight your whole life, I guess.

885
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
He's the rogue prince.

886
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
What a badass.

887
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,500
But he's still super rich and fuck that guy.

888
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Of course, yeah.

889
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,500
He said some shit about like,

890
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,500
sorry, he's like, sorry, I got canceled,

891
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,500
but no, I'm not racist or anything, so fuck you.

892
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
Uncancel me, please.

893
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
I don't remember something like that.

894
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
It looks like such a lazy costume.

895
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
I'm looking at an image and it's just a t-shirt

896
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
with the it printed on it.

897
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Yeah, I mean, he looks like he's like 16.

898
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Yeah.

899
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
What a fuck.

900
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:16,500
Charles, the son, the son headline, Charles Rages at Nazi Harry.

901
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,500
In doghouse at a high grove after huge row,

902
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,500
ordered to pay private visit to Auschwitz.

903
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Son, son to punish you for dressing up as a Nazi for Halloween.

904
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
I'm putting you, I'm gassing you.

905
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,500
You can see what it's like.

906
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Uh, based.

907
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
Crazy.

908
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
Yeah, royals are insane.

909
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,500
The only reason people like them is because the media says,

910
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
look at how cool they are and everyone's like, yeah.

911
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
Well, it's because...

912
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Because they're cool and rich and impressive.

913
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,500
That makes me cool and rich and impressive

914
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
by being associated with them by country.

915
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:58,500
There's a great little comic by a little Twitter artist I follow.

916
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,500
They're called Red and Black Salamander.

917
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,500
Wait, wait, wait.

918
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Is it 9mm?

919
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,500
Their Twitter at is 9mm ballpoint.

920
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
They're called Red and Black Salamander,

921
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
and they have a comic they did.

922
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,500
It's like a big top hat capitalist guy in a castle

923
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,500
being like, look how rich I am.

924
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,500
And then all the peasants are all like, where's ours?

925
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
What about us?

926
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
And then the second panel is,

927
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,500
he just draws a line in the ground around them all.

928
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
And then he goes, look how rich we are.

929
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
And they all go, hey, yeah.

930
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,500
And they have guns and they're defending the border.

931
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
LaMalle, pretty good.

932
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Point made.

933
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Shit, what was I going to say about that?

934
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,500
About being Harry, being some rich guy?

935
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,500
Oh, we know that the reason they like the Royals,

936
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,500
we know from CGP Grey is because they technically generate

937
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,500
tourist revenue.

938
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
They're actually good for the economy.

939
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,500
And we know from Sean that that isn't necessarily true.

940
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Yeah, yeah.

941
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,500
That was the first big like, oh my God, CGP Grey's flawed.

942
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,500
Wow.

943
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
CGP Grey said something that was a little cringe?

944
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
And then more recently...

945
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,500
What else has he said that I believe but that was cringe?

946
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Oh no!

947
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Yeah, more recently, I don't know who it was,

948
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:33,500
but one of the many popular city infrastructure YouTubers

949
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,500
was talking, was doing like a CGP Grey's take

950
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,500
on self-driving cars being the way of solving traffic is dumb.

951
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
And here's why that's dumb.

952
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,500
Yeah, I've seen his video about self-driving cars.

953
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,500
And it's like, no, don't use cars.

954
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
Fuck cars, more trains.

955
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,500
Like he sort of missed the obvious solution.

956
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
Yeah, that's...

957
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,500
Yeah.

958
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,500
And on my corner of Twitter, everybody loves trains.

959
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,500
So, at the time I remember thinking like,

960
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
you know what he was saying made a lot of sense,

961
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
but yeah, now I'm more...

962
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,500
I've never liked cars and like politics,

963
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,500
politics, right, have leaned me even further into the position of like,

964
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,500
it's not just a me thing, fuck cars, cars are a social ill actually.

965
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,500
A public transit and rail is like, it's actually just better.

966
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,500
It would be better if more people used it.

967
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:40,500
And also if more cities were built to accommodate people using it.

968
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:45,500
Because I've also seen a lot of stuff about like how cities in America,

969
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:50,500
certain cities are built for the car and to such a point that there's

970
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
almost nothing but roads.

971
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Like everything is so spread out because of the amount of roads they need to build.

972
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,500
A lot of cities, especially smaller cities, are just not walkable at all.

973
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,500
Yeah, you're basically expected to have a car to get anywhere.

974
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
It was always weird.

975
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:13,500
Like when I first came to Virginia for Radcon 1 and I saw how flat everything is.

976
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Virginia sucks.

977
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,500
I hated living in Virginia and in hindsight I think this is why.

978
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,500
It's not a place built for foot traffic.

979
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Even like Richmond, there's no subway system in Richmond or in Virginia Beach proper.

980
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
You have to have a car.

981
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Yeah.

982
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
Or you're fucked.

983
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,500
It was very like, oh, are we going somewhere?

984
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,500
Well, there's only two cars.

985
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,500
So if people are out in their cars, you have to stay at the house.

986
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:52,500
I didn't really have anywhere to go regardless, but it was weird.

987
00:50:52,500 --> 00:51:04,500
Not to harp on it or anything, but when Trixie moved to Boston, she had a bad time for a number of reasons,

988
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:11,500
but among them was that she was like, oh, my friends live here.

989
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
We'll be doing stuff.

990
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
But then in practice, she never left her house.

991
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
She never took the subway.

992
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,500
And part of that, I think, was just that she grew up in Virginia.

993
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
She was in a car family.

994
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Her dad was like the BMW dealer, gave her BMWs and stuff.

995
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,500
And living in Virginia, you got to use the car.

996
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:38,500
So she was not open to the possibility of subway transit.

997
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:46,500
I remember talking about it being like driving in Boston and finding a parking space that's not expensive was a nightmare.

998
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,500
It does suck.

999
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,500
It is a nightmare.

1000
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,500
Yeah, that's good.

1001
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,500
I'm glad it's a nightmare because it means people will use the train more.

1002
00:51:53,500 --> 00:52:02,500
But there are alternatives, but she did not take to those alternatives, which I think is pretty cringe.

1003
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:09,500
But in her mild defense, she did live way down south in Braintree,

1004
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:16,500
almost as far out of Boston as you can be and still technically be on the subway.

1005
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:23,500
Yeah, it still would have been a bit of a hassle to get the train, to get the bus and the train into the subway.

1006
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:31,500
I'm going to estimate walking to the bus stop, taking the bus to a red line stop,

1007
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,500
and then taking the red line into the city probably would have taken her at least 45 minutes.

1008
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:43,500
So a bit obnoxious, but doable.

1009
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,500
But she never even tried.

1010
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:52,500
She did not even know that buses came near her house that would take you to the subway.

1011
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,500
I had to inform her.

1012
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,500
She was like, how are you getting home?

1013
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,500
And I looked it up on my phone.

1014
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,500
A bus comes just a few blocks down from here, and she was like, what?

1015
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
But the buses come here?

1016
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,500
I was like, yeah, they come almost everywhere.

1017
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Walkability, highly valued.

1018
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,500
My dad's a car guy.

1019
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,500
I'm not a car guy.

1020
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,500
I don't like him.

1021
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,500
And now I have political reasons.

1022
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,500
Now it's not just a me thing.

1023
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
Now it's personal.

1024
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
Yeah.

1025
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:33,500
I've never had a car or done my license in order to be able to drive.

1026
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,500
I don't have a few lessons, but I've always been like, why?

1027
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
People are not getting their fucking driver's license.

1028
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,500
Whatever.

1029
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,500
I guess I should do that.

1030
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,500
But I never needed it.

1031
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,500
There's a train to anywhere in London.

1032
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
Yeah.

1033
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
And there's a bus to anywhere local.

1034
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,500
It's really easy to get around.

1035
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
Yeah, that's fair.

1036
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Kazi never got their driver's license, and I think for the same reason, they just take the subway everywhere.

1037
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:08,500
But then Michelle also has never gotten her license, but she doesn't take the subway.

1038
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,500
So what's she thinking?

1039
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,500
Wait, yeah, she lives in Virginia now, right?

1040
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,500
Well, it was in Cincinnati, which I don't think has a subway system.

1041
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,500
And now she's in Virginia Beach, which definitely does not have a subway system.

1042
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:27,500
Not like a robust one at all, not one that actually gets you around.

1043
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,500
She lived in Hawaii, didn't she initially?

1044
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,500
Where you also a place where you need to drive everywhere.

1045
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,500
I've heard people say that about Hawaii, that you have to drive everywhere.

1046
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,500
There's definitely no subway in Hawaii.

1047
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Maybe there's some rail.

1048
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
Maybe there's some light rail here and there.

1049
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,500
I don't even know.

1050
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,500
Can you like hike through the jungle?

1051
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,500
I mean, it's a small island, but it's not that small.

1052
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,500
It's not like you can just...

1053
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
You can have a Pokemon journey adventure.

1054
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
Can you just walk halfway?

1055
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,500
Can you just walk across Honolulu?

1056
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,500
Wait, is the main island called Hawaii?

1057
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,500
I don't know.

1058
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,500
The major city of Hawaii is Honolulu.

1059
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:16,500
The main island is either called Hawaii, it's also, or it's called Honolulu.

1060
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,500
I don't know.

1061
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:29,500
I think the largest one would maybe take the better part of an entire day

1062
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,500
if you walked straight through it in a straight line.

1063
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,500
But maybe I'm stupid and I don't know actually how big it is.

1064
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:42,500
Well, I mean, it's mountainous terrain, so it would not be a straight shot.

1065
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:51,500
Walking through the middle of it, I think, would be quite difficult terrain to walk through.

1066
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,500
I'm just trying to find a scale map here.

1067
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,500
How many miles across is it?

1068
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,500
This is such a simple thing, I'm asking you, Google.

1069
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,500
Why will you not...

1070
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,500
Okay, it's like 50 miles.

1071
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:13,500
It's like 50 to maybe like 75 miles across, depending on how.

1072
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,500
So yeah, you could walk 50 miles in a day.

1073
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,500
It would be a hard day's walk, but you could do it.

1074
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,500
But not like across a mountain.

1075
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:29,500
Maybe if you walked all day along the beach, you could get like most of the way across one of its edges.

1076
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
Hawaii or Volcano?

1077
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Yeah, yeah, I'm just looking at it.

1078
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,500
Funny.

1079
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,500
Oh, yes, I was right.

1080
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
The main island is called Hawaii.

1081
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
I was right, I'm a genius.

1082
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
Okay, Honolulu is a different island.

1083
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
Oahu and...

1084
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
Kauai?

1085
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
So kauai.

1086
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,500
It's so kauai.

1087
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,500
Kauai and puai.

1088
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:59,500
Crazy, those crazy natives with their crazy gobbledy cook.

1089
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:05,500
Hawaii means family.

1090
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
Does it?

1091
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,500
No.

1092
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
Wait, that's the Lilo and Stitch thing, right?

1093
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Yeah.

1094
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,500
Lilo and Stitch means family.

1095
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Remember that.

1096
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Okay, I will.

1097
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
Thanks.

1098
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,500
Let's see.

1099
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Let's see.

1100
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,500
There's something on my list here.

1101
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:37,500
I guess it doesn't really need mentioning, but the podcast has officially ended.

1102
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,500
This was on my list.

1103
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:45,500
I saw this mentioned in my discord and I was like...

1104
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
It's a shame.

1105
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
My first feeling is like, oh, that's too bad.

1106
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,500
My second feeling is about time.

1107
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,500
It's been like most of a year since there's been one.

1108
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,500
Has it really been more like six months?

1109
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,500
I think so.

1110
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:14,500
I recently saw a screenshot of Mumki doing his one-piece videos and he had the running tally of days since the last podcast.

1111
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:19,500
And the last time I saw it was at like 240 days.

1112
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,500
We were going for the full 365.

1113
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
I don't really have a statement about it.

1114
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
How do you feel about it?

1115
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,500
I think it was obvious that we didn't want to do the show anymore.

1116
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,500
Sure, yeah.

1117
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,500
So I was like, yeah, let's just make it official.

1118
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,500
In the very back of my head I've been like, if Nate came to me, this is in the back of my head,

1119
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,500
I was always like, if Nate came to me and said, hey, do you want to do some more podcast?

1120
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
I'll be like, yes.

1121
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,500
But the fact that he came to me and said, I haven't been wanting to do.

1122
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
And I was like, yeah, me neither.

1123
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:07,500
It's sort of like, if one of us wanted to do it, I think the other would have.

1124
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,500
But if neither of us want to do it, why even pretend?

1125
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,500
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

1126
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,500
Well, it's a shame.

1127
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,500
Yeah, I mean, it's just talking about One Piece.

1128
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,500
I love One Piece still.

1129
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
I still read it.

1130
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,500
Damn, I never fulfilled the prophecy.

1131
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:39,500
I said that one day I would catch up with One Piece and be a guest on Potycast and I never did.

1132
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
I had a little thing planned.

1133
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,500
I was going to draw a new face bubble for myself.

1134
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,500
I was going to draw a little...

1135
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:58,500
My idea for when I guessed it on the Potycast was I was going to draw a little attached boat to the main boat.

1136
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,500
That would be like a little Hawkeye-Meahawk raft.

1137
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,500
Oh, yeah.

1138
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,500
That would be my little side boat.

1139
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,500
And my little speech bubble would come out of that little side boat.

1140
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:18,500
You know, one thing I always had in my head when I would listen to One Piece music on my MP3 player occasionally

1141
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:24,500
was like, what if we animated an episode of One Piece?

1142
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:29,500
But it was me and Nate, our characters, our sonas and our boat.

1143
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:38,500
And it would be like the way that a complicated battle part of an arc on Skype or Water 7 or whatever,

1144
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:43,500
they'd have the little faces on a map and they'd show where they're going and be like,

1145
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:49,500
oh, Nate's doing this over here with his sword and then Gibbs over here shooting.

1146
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,500
And then there's a battle going on.

1147
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,500
It's like, what if I just made One Piece but for the Potycast?

1148
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
It would never happen in a million years.

1149
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,500
You're not fighting battles on the Potycast.

1150
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
No, we're just sailing.

1151
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,500
We're just talking about the comic.

1152
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:13,500
I always like the idea of having the big epic battle scene or implying that and the big epic stuff,

1153
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,500
but not having to build it up.

1154
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
I don't want to write the beginning.

1155
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,500
I want to write the middle.

1156
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:25,500
I just want to write the big thing where they're like, oh, that's so fucking, so much blood.

1157
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,500
He punched him so hard that he's dead.

1158
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
That's so fucking cool.

1159
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:44,500
I've been working on the big final moment of Phantom's Revenge this past week.

1160
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:49,500
I've been making assets for the final form of the final boss.

1161
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:54,500
And it's taken me a long time, but it's really coming together.

1162
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,500
I'm finally at the state.

1163
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:06,500
It's not all drawn, but I started putting sprites into the game and making objects out of them and programming them so that they move.

1164
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:11,500
The final boss is a big object with a bunch.

1165
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
It has a couple of little parts that move.

1166
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:22,500
I've animated a little sequence where one part slots into place and then another part slots into place and then another part slots into place.

1167
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,500
It's not timed for anything.

1168
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:29,500
It needs a little bit of finesse, but it's moving in the right general way.

1169
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,500
And I'm like, yeah, that's pretty good.

1170
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,500
Yeah, it's looking pretty good.

1171
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,500
That's very cool.

1172
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
It's very exciting.

1173
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:45,500
I was describing the plot of Phantom's Revenge to my mom in the car on the way to the train station.

1174
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,500
Oh my god.

1175
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,500
How could you possibly have done that?

1176
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Well, I can't say it because it would spoil it.

1177
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,500
Oh, right.

1178
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,500
I thought you meant from the beginning of life.

1179
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,500
So there's this internet, I guess a LOL cow.

1180
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:07,500
Well, a LOL cow is that you would explain Chris Chan and everything.

1181
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:14,500
That would be a very difficult thing to do.

1182
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,500
No, I just kept it to the plot of the game itself.

1183
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,500
She asked me like, wait, is this about your pony?

1184
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,500
And I'm like, yes, yes, he's back.

1185
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,500
It's this big moment.

1186
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,500
Yes, mom, he must have his revenge.

1187
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,500
It's the only way.

1188
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,500
And then I described your pony.

1189
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
This is funny.

1190
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,500
Say what?

1191
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,500
No, it's just funny.

1192
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,500
This is the idea of your mother knowing about Phantom Horn.

1193
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,500
She does.

1194
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,500
She knows about Phantom Horn.

1195
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,500
And I had to explain to her why it was necessary for him to take his revenge

1196
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,500
and how he intends to do it.

1197
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,500
You see, all this blood.

1198
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,500
You needed it to be on the floor.

1199
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:02,500
There's so much blood, yes.

1200
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,500
I told her, I was like, yeah, at some point in development,

1201
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,500
I decided to make it really gruesome.

1202
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,500
And I told her about cutting the enemies in half

1203
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,500
and like the bloods playing everywhere and splattering

1204
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,500
and dripping down the walls and stuff.

1205
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:19,500
And maybe this is stupid.

1206
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,500
Maybe this is the stupid thing to feel anything about.

1207
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,500
Maybe this is just obvious, but there's something really satisfying

1208
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,500
that the game is called Phantom's Revenge.

1209
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,500
And it is like, literally that's what it is.

1210
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Like the process of playing the game is Phantom taking his revenge,

1211
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:43,500
step bit by bit, and there's something about the name of the thing

1212
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,500
is also the thing itself that I'm like, I don't know,

1213
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,500
it's something really satisfying thinking about it.

1214
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Man, I'm building the scene.

1215
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,500
I'm building the scene right now that I've been envisioning

1216
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,500
for more than a year.

1217
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,500
Maybe not more than a year, just about a year.

1218
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,500
Wait, no, almost two years.

1219
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,500
Phantom 4 was like a year and three quarters ago.

1220
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,500
2020 March or 2020, I mean.

1221
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,500
So yeah, almost two years.

1222
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Going on two years, I've had this scene in my head.

1223
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,500
Man, I've been working on, shit,

1224
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,500
I've been working on Phantom's Revenge longer

1225
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,500
than I was ever drawing Slime and Punishment.

1226
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,500
That sucks.

1227
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,500
What a nightmare.

1228
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,500
It's a whole different level of work to make the game.

1229
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,500
It is, but it's still just one moment.

1230
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,500
Well, that's not one moment.

1231
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
I would say that the story of Phantom's Revenge

1232
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,500
comprises what I probably would have called

1233
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,500
an arc of Slime and Punishment.

1234
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,500
And I'm sure I could have drawn it much faster

1235
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,500
than I have made it a video game.

1236
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,500
But I mean, as I'm saying this out loud, like duh,

1237
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,500
like of course I could have, right?

1238
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,500
So it's fine, never mind.

1239
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,500
I talk myself out of being upset.

1240
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,500
Yeah.

1241
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,500
What the hell?

1242
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,500
That's going pretty good.

1243
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:15,500
If it's called Revenge, can you Venge?

1244
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:21,500
Let's check out our old friend UrbanDictionary.com.

1245
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:25,500
Urban, Urban Dictionary.

1246
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:31,500
Let's look up Revenge.

1247
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
Okay, Revenge.

1248
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:37,500
One of the best Minecraft parodies of all time.

1249
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,500
Man, I just listened to Revenge by Captain Sparkles

1250
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,500
for 10 hours straight.

1251
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,500
Best 10 hours ever.

1252
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,500
Second definition.

1253
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:52,500
The sweetest joy next to getting pussy.

1254
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,500
I see.

1255
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:02,500
So, okay, let's try a real dictionary.

1256
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,500
Venge or Avenge, from the old French,

1257
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,500
vengir, revenge, avenge, punish.

1258
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:13,500
So to, so to, so to Venge means to get revenge.

1259
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,500
And so revenge is re-revenge.

1260
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,500
Yeah, but what's...

1261
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Is to give revenge back.

1262
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:25,500
Revenge and Avenge are the same.

1263
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,500
To get revenge against somebody and to avenge somebody.

1264
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,500
Just avenge is just the verb, right?

1265
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:38,500
No, you can revenge as a verb.

1266
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:43,500
You can revenge yourself on someone,

1267
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:49,500
but you avenge someone else.

1268
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:55,500
Like you can avenge yourself or you can avenge your father on a guy.

1269
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:01,500
But you take revenge for your father on the guy.

1270
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,500
Oh, okay.

1271
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:09,500
So, vengir is old French and that comes from the Latin vindicare.

1272
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,500
Is this like...

1273
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,500
Venge comes from...

1274
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,500
Yes, it has to be.

1275
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,500
It's damn it.

1276
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:21,500
The same Latin root, if parallel evolved,

1277
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,500
one way to become English and then another way through Greek

1278
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,500
to become a different English word.

1279
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,500
Lamal.

1280
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,500
Well, I mean, English is just borrowing all sorts of things from Latin.

1281
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,500
This is just like...

1282
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,500
Was it F and P?

1283
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:42,500
I think there's a Jan Measley video about how F and P are the same letter.

1284
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,500
They came from the same Greek letter.

1285
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,500
But they went through two different evolutionary paths.

1286
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,500
And one stayed in the English dictionary,

1287
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,500
English language and the other one didn't,

1288
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,500
but then we needed a new sound,

1289
01:08:54,500 --> 01:09:00,500
so we borrowed it back from a different language that evolved it in a different way.

1290
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,500
Great, great shit.

1291
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,500
Wacky.

1292
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
Wacky as hell.

1293
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,500
I type in vindicare and I get Warhammer 40k.

1294
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,500
They looked up some funny words.

1295
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,500
Some funny words?

1296
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,500
They didn't name...

1297
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
They were thesaurus-ing?

1298
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,500
They were thesaurus-ing.

1299
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,500
We need our thing that is a guy who kills

1300
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,500
to have a very good name that is historical.

1301
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,500
I mean, that's...

1302
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,500
Let's us do some googling.

1303
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,500
That's the imperial aesthetic right there.

1304
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,500
Yeah.

1305
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,500
I found this image.

1306
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,500
I found this helpful diagram.

1307
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,500
Avenge or revenge?

1308
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:44,500
To avenge is to get payback for the inflicted party.

1309
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,500
To revenge.

1310
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,500
To get payback as the inflicted party.

1311
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:52,500
This is for killing my brother versus this is for ruining my life.

1312
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,500
So in case you're...

1313
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,500
In case you were wondering...

1314
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,500
In case you were wondering...

1315
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Yeah, fuck you.

1316
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,500
Fuck.

1317
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,500
I wonder if you could build a different word

1318
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,500
that has vengeance on the end of it.

1319
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,500
It means to get payback for no reason.

1320
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,500
This is to...

1321
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:17,500
To avenge is to kill yourself for harming somebody else.

1322
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
Prevenge is when you fight...

1323
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,500
You throw the first punch.

1324
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,500
They didn't even do anything.

1325
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
Mmm.

1326
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:31,500
To avenge is to kill yourself for something you did to yourself.

1327
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,500
You flip it.

1328
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,500
You flip it turnways, right?

1329
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,500
I'm about to open one right now.

1330
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,500
Yeah.

1331
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:46,500
Good fucking job, English speakers of the past.

1332
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,500
You have served us well.

1333
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,500
I had something...

1334
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,500
Oh, I had...

1335
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:00,500
Let me tell you about a little bit of a crisis that I had.

1336
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,500
I went home for Thanksgiving.

1337
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,500
The TV was on.

1338
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,500
We watched...

1339
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,500
Shit, it's not the Colbert Report.

1340
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,500
Colbert is on The Daily Show now?

1341
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,500
Or The Late Show?

1342
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,500
Colbert is Good Morning America?

1343
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,500
I don't know.

1344
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,500
Colbert does a talk show now, just like a normal talk show.

1345
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,500
And he said stuff, right?

1346
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,500
I was listening to Colbert do this, you know,

1347
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:28,500
do this broad liberal comedy.

1348
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,500
And I felt a bash for a moment.

1349
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,500
I felt a bash for a moment because I realized

1350
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,500
that all the opinions he was espousing

1351
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,500
were very similar to mine.

1352
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,500
He had the similar takes on all of the things,

1353
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,500
on many things that I do.

1354
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:49,500
I was a bit surprised to see that he was just openly like

1355
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,500
I disagree with the Rittenhouse, you know,

1356
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,500
verdict and all that.

1357
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,500
I thought that was more...

1358
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,500
I thought that was something that more liberals

1359
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,500
were like, yeah, I kind of get it.

1360
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,500
But no.

1361
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,500
So I guess the mainstream liberal opinion

1362
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,500
is that Rittenhouse bad.

1363
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,500
I guess in other things, vaccines good.

1364
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,500
He said Elon Musk bad.

1365
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,500
And I was like, okay, okay.

1366
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,500
Anyway, I felt a...

1367
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,500
I felt a pang of like, oh no, am I a lib?

1368
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,500
Am I a lib?

1369
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,500
Am I a fucking Democrat?

1370
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,500
And then I said no.

1371
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,500
And I said no, no, no, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

1372
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:38,500
Maybe Steven Colbert has like a based writer or something.

1373
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:42,500
I may agree with the mainstream media on certain things,

1374
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,500
but the difference between me and them is that

1375
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,500
they are annoyed about things.

1376
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,500
They're annoyed about some things.

1377
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,500
But I want beheadings.

1378
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,500
That's what separates me from the animals.

1379
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,500
What separates you from the Democrats

1380
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
is that you are phantom horn

1381
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500
and you're gonna get your revenge.

1382
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,500
Yeah, exactly.

1383
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
Exactly.

1384
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,500
Speaking of exactly,

1385
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,500
someone mentioned in the comments that

1386
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,500
I think last week we nominated Rod Serling

1387
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,500
for the voice grail.

1388
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,500
And someone wrote it in the comments like,

1389
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,500
you guys nominated Applejack?

1390
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,500
They didn't say Applejack, they said some funny character.

1391
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
And I think they were talking about Applejack.

1392
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,500
They were like, you nominated some other funny character

1393
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,500
for the voice grail.

1394
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,500
And you have not updated the spreadsheet.

1395
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,500
You have not updated the spreadsheet.

1396
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,500
There's a spreadsheet?

1397
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,500
Well, they mentioned, here, the comment is,

1398
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,500
yeah, this is Prince Isolation,

1399
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:52,500
who I happen to know just bought a copy of Road to Radcon

1400
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,500
with you can too, listener.

1401
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,500
DM me on Discord.

1402
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,500
Follow my pinned tweet on Twitter

1403
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,500
to buy your own copy of Road to Radcon.

1404
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,500
I've got more than 50 copies left.

1405
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,500
Anyway, they got theirs.

1406
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,500
They said, speaking of the voice grail,

1407
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,500
wasn't there some funny character that was supposed to be

1408
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,500
added to that some episodes ago, like a Kirby or Yoshi voice

1409
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,500
or something? I'm pretty sure it was Applejack.

1410
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,500
I feel like I never saw them get added to the Google doc

1411
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,500
in the description.

1412
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,500
Yeah, I remember there is a Google doc.

1413
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,500
I didn't... Oh, no, here it is.

1414
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,500
Yeah, under the voice mail link.

1415
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,500
Yeah, voice grail, voice jail.

1416
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,500
Yes, here it is.

1417
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,500
Am I logged in?

1418
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,500
Can I edit this?

1419
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:39,500
No, I would have to log in as the procrastinators.

1420
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,500
So I will.

1421
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,500
I'm going to do this right now.

1422
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,500
Who updates that, though?

1423
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,500
I didn't even know we had it.

1424
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,500
Nobody has updated it in a while.

1425
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,500
But like who did?

1426
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,500
Were you making it?

1427
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,500
At some point, I definitely did.

1428
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,500
Okay.

1429
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,500
Here's the list, the list right now.

1430
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,500
Well, I'll just...

1431
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,500
I'm going to add Applejack.

1432
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,500
I don't even remember the last time I actually updated those.

1433
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,500
I feel like we went a long time without adding anyone

1434
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,500
to voice grail or voice jail.

1435
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,500
There might have been someone

1436
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,500
who we did put in jail,

1437
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,500
but that I forgot.

1438
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,500
So if I forgot anyone...

1439
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,500
Let me know in the comments if I'm missing anyone

1440
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,500
who should be in voice grail or voice jail.

1441
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,500
We need to hire a jailer and a grailer.

1442
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,500
A jailer and a grailer.

1443
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,500
Keep track.

1444
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,500
Well, MarinPan already does...

1445
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,500
He's already basically

1446
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,500
that for the Minecraft server.

1447
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,500
So maybe he could take up

1448
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,500
PCP Gailer,

1449
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,500
I guess it pronounced jailer.

1450
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,500
Duties as well.

1451
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,500
Alright, so here is the list

1452
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,500
as it currently stands.

1453
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,500
Although, some of these...

1454
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,500
Okay.

1455
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,500
Oh no, no, no.

1456
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,500
There were some people who got freed from voice jail

1457
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,500
ages and ages ago

1458
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,500
as part of the...

1459
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,500
The Bail.

1460
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,500
The Bail Fund.

1461
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,500
Was it the George Floyd thing

1462
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,500
or was it before that?

1463
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,500
No, it was the riots.

1464
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,500
It was that time.

1465
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,500
Yes, it was the Voice Bail Fund.

1466
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,500
The Voice Bail Fund did get a few of them out,

1467
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,500
but it didn't get everyone out.

1468
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,500
I'm pretty sure that Lost Tape Archive

1469
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,500
and Loll Pussies But Here Eating With Spoons,

1470
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,500
who I believe was

1471
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,500
an alias of Teen CP,

1472
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,500
and maybe a few...

1473
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,500
Maybe all of these, actually.

1474
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,500
I think all of these were on the Bail list,

1475
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,500
but they didn't all get bailed.

1476
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,500
Only a few of them did, so...

1477
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,500
There we go.

1478
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,500
In case you were wondering...

1479
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,500
Good ol' racist forestgump.

1480
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,500
Just sitting pretty,

1481
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,500
anointed in the realm of the voice grail,

1482
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,500
as he deserves.

1483
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,500
Classic character.

1484
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,500
Yes.

1485
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,500
I remember Margar.

1486
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,500
What have they been doing?

1487
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,500
Well, not making voice mails.

1488
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,500
And good riddance, because apparently,

1489
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,500
they ended up in jail, so they must've done some...

1490
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,500
I remember them just being kind of boring.

1491
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,500
I remember...

1492
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,500
Was it just that they were making too many

1493
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,500
and they were too long? Did we just complain about that?

1494
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,500
Something like that.

1495
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,500
We snapped.

1496
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,500
I think Margar made pretty decent voice mails,

1497
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,500
and I thought they were good,

1498
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,500
but then I think...

1499
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,500
I think they got too big for their britches.

1500
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,500
And I was like, I've had enough.

1501
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,500
I've had enough of you die.

1502
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,500
Wait.

1503
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,500
Yeah.

1504
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,500
What about

1505
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,500
Errorari with the

1506
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,500
Prepare for the Bear and all that?

1507
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,500
Were they never grailed?

1508
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,500
I don't think...

1509
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,500
I mean, they might've been and I could've forgotten.

1510
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,500
I don't think we...

1511
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,500
I think they should get a voice grail at this point.

1512
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,500
Those were really fun.

1513
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,500
You know, that's fair.

1514
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,500
Yeah, I...

1515
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,500
They started to get a little weird and, like, confusing,

1516
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,500
but I really liked the first one.

1517
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,500
I didn't think they were weird and confusing.

1518
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,500
Well, but I thought that they...

1519
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,500
I thought that they had...

1520
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,500
I thought that they had...

1521
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,500
She had done everything you could do with them, basically.

1522
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,500
They were kind of starting to get repetitive,

1523
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:43,500
but, okay, I'm okay with, like, a retroactive voice grailing

1524
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
for...

1525
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,500
Well, I mean, I know that they're Errorari,

1526
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:51,500
but did they make the voice calls under a different name?

1527
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,500
Did they make the voice calls under...

1528
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,500
They had a poetic title.

1529
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,500
Prepare for the Bear.

1530
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,500
I think it's...

1531
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,500
The Bear Minimum?

1532
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,500
All right.

1533
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,500
Should I just... Should I put her in as Errorari

1534
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,500
or prepare for Bear?

1535
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,500
Prepare for Bear, because that's what it started as.

1536
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,500
Prepare for Bear.

1537
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,500
Okay, here we go.

1538
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,500
All right, that makes sense.

1539
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,500
A retroactive grailing.

1540
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,500
Because I think we just forgot about the grail for a while,

1541
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,500
but, you know, it's an integral part of PCP lore.

1542
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,500
Yes.

1543
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,500
Yeah, commenters, if there's anyone missing

1544
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,500
who should be here, let me know.

1545
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,500
But that's all I can remember at the moment.

1546
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,500
All right. Well, I'm glad that sorted out.

1547
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,500
Yeah.

1548
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,500
Well, I guess I got nothing else to talk about.

1549
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,500
Speaking of voicemails, do you want to get to voicemails?

1550
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:56,500
I had two things on my Talk About list,

1551
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,500
and both of these are things that I forgot to talk about

1552
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:04,500
last week, and that just stayed on the list since then,

1553
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,500
so I got to mention them, because they're on my list.

1554
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,500
I have to do it.

1555
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,500
Grilling cheese.

1556
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,500
There's cheese you can grill.

1557
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,500
It's great.

1558
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,500
Wow. That's it.

1559
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,500
It's called halloumi.

1560
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,500
It's Greek, I think.

1561
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,500
Oh, is that like the white, like, rubbery...

1562
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,500
not rubbery, but like wobbly sort of...

1563
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,500
It's a bit rubbery.

1564
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,500
I mean, it's a very firm cheese.

1565
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,500
Yeah, I think I've had some of that before.

1566
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,500
You grill it?

1567
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:41,500
It's really good to have like a halloumi salami.

1568
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,500
Halloumi salami.

1569
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,500
Halloumi salami, what a wonderful phrase.

1570
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,500
Like, you could have that as like a thing with like a,

1571
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,500
I don't know, a bread stick.

1572
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,500
I'm trying to think of when I've eaten it before.

1573
01:20:54,500 --> 01:21:00,500
I think I've seen it where my dad had like a Italian,

1574
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,500
like he had the Italian flag.

1575
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,500
Halloumi made up the white part,

1576
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,500
and then there was like pepperoni,

1577
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
or salami is the red part, and then,

1578
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,500
oh no, tomatoes is the red part,

1579
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,500
and then something else is the green part,

1580
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,500
and I forget what that was.

1581
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,500
Basil?

1582
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,500
No, it was something that you could pick up a piece of it

1583
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,500
and eat it.

1584
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,500
Gosh, could be so many things.

1585
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,500
Cucumber?

1586
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,500
I don't know.

1587
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,500
No, it would be Italian.

1588
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,500
I can't remember.

1589
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,500
What do they have that's green in Italy?

1590
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:32,500
Halloumi's is like...

1591
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,500
Marijuana, oh, marijuana.

1592
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,500
Yes, marijuana pizza.

1593
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,500
A huge flag of marijuana, yes.

1594
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:43,500
Do you imagine fucking a marijuana pizza?

1595
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:47,500
There's no doubt at all that people have done it,

1596
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,500
100%.

1597
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,500
I've never had it cold.

1598
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:58,500
I've only ever eaten it pan-fried,

1599
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,500
and it gets stringy and chewy,

1600
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,500
much like a mozzarella stick, almost.

1601
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,500
It gets a little soft, but doesn't fall apart.

1602
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,500
You can eat it with your fingers.

1603
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,500
It's so good.

1604
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,500
It's one of my new favorites

1605
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,500
that I've been buying from Aldi.

1606
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,500
My other thing is I bought a bunch of...

1607
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,500
I was looking at other stores.

1608
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,500
I've talked about Seltzer,

1609
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,500
buying every different brand of Seltzer water I can find.

1610
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,500
I was looking at Hannaford,

1611
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,500
and they had a bunch of Keto ice creams.

1612
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,500
They have different brands of Keto ice creams

1613
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,500
than I usually get.

1614
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,500
I usually get the Aldi kind.

1615
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,500
It's called Sunday Shop is the brand.

1616
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:38,500
This one had a more recognizable brand

1617
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,500
called Halo Top,

1618
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,500
and I was like, base.

1619
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,500
So I ordered a bunch.

1620
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,500
I ordered five pints of different flavors

1621
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,500
of Keto ice cream from Halo Top.

1622
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,500
And they all suck.

1623
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,500
They're all bad.

1624
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,500
Five pints, you say.

1625
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,500
Five pints.

1626
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,500
They're all bad.

1627
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
The thing about the Halo Top Keto

1628
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,500
is that they're all very fluffy

1629
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,500
in a way that I dislike.

1630
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
It sort of is like eating...

1631
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,500
It's a little bit more like eating

1632
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,500
like a cool whip

1633
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,500
than it is like ice cream.

1634
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,500
Fluffy.

1635
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,500
My first thought is that it's like...

1636
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,500
when you go to make a snowball

1637
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,500
and it's powdery instead of sticky,

1638
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,500
it's not...

1639
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,500
It's just sort of unsatisfying.

1640
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,500
Yeah, it just doesn't...

1641
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,500
It's not...

1642
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,500
It's fluffy.

1643
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,500
It's not creamy.

1644
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,500
It's not creamy like you want ice cream to be.

1645
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,500
It's just kind of...

1646
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,500
airy, spongy.

1647
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,500
Like it's okay.

1648
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,500
Like cool whip is fine,

1649
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,500
but it's not the optimal ice cream experience.

1650
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,500
It's not indulgent.

1651
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,500
It's not like...

1652
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,500
Yeah.

1653
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,500
Like...

1654
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,500
It's hard.

1655
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
It's like a...

1656
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500
It's not sloppy enough.

1657
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,500
I mean fluffy is fine.

1658
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,500
Like fluffy is fine for what it is.

1659
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,500
It's just not the consistency I'm looking for

1660
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,500
when I dig into a pint.

1661
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
So I was like...

1662
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,500
It has better macros.

1663
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,500
Like it has less...

1664
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,500
It has even fewer carbs

1665
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,500
and more fat

1666
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,500
than the Sunday Shop reign.

1667
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,500
Which is good.

1668
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,500
Which is what you want.

1669
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,500
But it just doesn't taste good

1670
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,500
and I don't want to eat it.

1671
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,500
So what's the point?

1672
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,500
Nothing.

1673
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,500
Okay.

1674
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,500
Yeah.

1675
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,500
I had to touch on my groceries list here

1676
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,500
so everybody knows what I've been snacking on.

1677
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,500
Although I'm not keto right now

1678
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:29,500
because I mean, you know,

1679
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,500
I had to do Thanksgiving

1680
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,500
and now I got friendsgiving today.

1681
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,500
So like...

1682
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,500
I was like, fuck it.

1683
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
Fuck it for the weekend.

1684
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,500
Whatever.

1685
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,500
I'll get back on it.

1686
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,500
I'll get back on it until Christmas after this.

1687
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,500
Okay.

1688
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,500
That's all I got.

1689
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,500
You want to do voicemails?

1690
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,500
Yeah.

1691
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,500
All right.

1692
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,500
Okay.

1693
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,500
I think the last one last week

1694
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,500
was Rod Surling the crypto zone.

1695
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,500
So I think the first one this week

1696
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,500
is called Trixie?

1697
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,500
Question mark, question mark?

1698
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,500
You ready?

1699
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,500
I am getting to the thing.

1700
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,500
Yes.

1701
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,500
I'm ready.

1702
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,500
All right.

1703
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,500
Three, two, one, go.

1704
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:13,500
Who is this Trixie you keep it happening about?

1705
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
Surely you're not talking about me.

1706
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,500
The great and powerful Trixie.

1707
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,500
I trained all my life to earn that title.

1708
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,500
What did she ever do to become a witch?

1709
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,500
Golden witch.

1710
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,500
What does that even mean?

1711
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,500
What's so gold about her?

1712
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,500
You've got to be kidding.

1713
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,500
Trixie the pony is getting uppity.

1714
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,500
Gold.

1715
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,500
Oh, demon souls.

1716
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,500
Gold.

1717
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,500
It's corrupt.

1718
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,500
It's evil.

1719
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,500
Trixie the golden witch.

1720
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,500
She spins gold into whatever else she's selling.

1721
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,500
She spins gold into what is it?

1722
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,500
Into Yip Studio.

1723
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,500
Lol.

1724
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,500
It's the opposite.

1725
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,500
It's not Cinderella.

1726
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,500
Who is it that spins flax into gold?

1727
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,500
I'm thinking of not Rapunzel.

1728
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,500
Sleeping Beauty who could spin her hair

1729
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,500
into gold or something.

1730
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,500
It's the girl in the Rumpelstiltskin.

1731
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,500
What is her...

1732
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,500
I think she doesn't have a name.

1733
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,500
She's just the miller's daughter

1734
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,500
who can spin flax into gold.

1735
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,500
Or straw.

1736
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,500
And a straw into gold?

1737
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,500
Okay, Wikipedia says it's straw.

1738
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,500
Whatever.

1739
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,500
Some versions make the miller's daughter blonde

1740
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,500
and describe the straw into gold claim as a careless boast.

1741
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,500
The miller makes it but the way his daughter's straw-like blonde hair

1742
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,500
takes on a gold-like luster when sunshine strikes it.

1743
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,500
Uh, okay.

1744
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,500
Whatever.

1745
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,500
Weird thing to say about your daughter.

1746
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,500
Yes.

1747
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,500
I guess it makes sense.

1748
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,500
I guess it's not that weird.

1749
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:53,500
Yes, but Trixie the golden witch.

1750
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,500
Her magical spell is that she turns gold

1751
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,500
into something that is not valuable.

1752
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,500
Yeah, yeah.

1753
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,500
Into Rap.

1754
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,500
Into Rap.

1755
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,500
Into Bitcoin.

1756
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,500
Into...

1757
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:10,500
Yes, she spins gold into NFTs.

1758
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:13,500
Have you been seeing her NFT takes?

1759
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,500
I've seen a few of them.

1760
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,500
They are predictably embarrassing, but whatever.

1761
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,500
She is very...

1762
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,500
She said as much in that one tweet where she was like,

1763
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:30,500
What if I minted the asterisk war sucks series as an NFT and sold it?

1764
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,500
What would happen?

1765
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,500
What would be the consequences of such a thing?

1766
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,500
Well, someone would...

1767
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,500
You might, in theory, get a bit of money if you sold it

1768
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:47,500
and someone else would get a digital receipt on the Ethereum blockchain

1769
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,500
saying you bought the asterisk war series

1770
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,500
and that is the end of what would happen.

1771
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,500
She's clearly thinking.

1772
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,500
She's clearly thinking, hmm, how can I monetize this?

1773
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,500
This NFT thing.

1774
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,500
Yeah, yeah.

1775
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,500
Stone toss made two and a half million dollars

1776
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,500
or whatever, selling flurks.

1777
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,500
Hmm.

1778
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,500
How can I pull a...

1779
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,500
How can I, Trixie the Golden Witch, pull a stone toss

1780
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:17,500
and make $200,000 to buy an RV or a truck

1781
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,500
or whatever it was that she wants these days?

1782
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,500
Always thinking.

1783
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,500
Always thinking.

1784
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,500
Okay.

1785
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:29,500
Next one is called Virgin Crypto vs Chad's Stocks.

1786
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:32,500
Three, two, one, go.

1787
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:37,500
Ben, why don't you just, like, buy fucking stocks or something?

1788
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:41,500
Like, you can literally get dividends from them.

1789
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,500
You don't even have to sell them.

1790
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,500
Like, you'll get paid for owning a stock.

1791
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,500
It's fucking awesome.

1792
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,500
That is true.

1793
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,500
I find that people have told me this before

1794
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,500
and I...

1795
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:55,500
Am I just stupid for not doing that?

1796
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,500
I mean, the stocks can devalue,

1797
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,500
but, like, you still just get dividends for having them.

1798
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:06,500
I've had, like, a few stocks on this trading app that I got.

1799
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:09,500
And I'm like, oh, wow.

1800
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,500
Fucking Green Energy UK.

1801
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,500
They're Wind Farm Energy.

1802
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
And, like, I believe in that.

1803
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,500
I'll put some money in.

1804
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:20,500
And it has consistently gone down in value.

1805
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,500
I put in 20 pounds.

1806
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,500
It's nothing.

1807
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,500
I was just sort of, like, interested in trying it out.

1808
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:28,500
But I still get dividends of, like, 25 cents every so often.

1809
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,500
Minerva double-cast when she was on.

1810
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,500
She said, fuck, what was the kind of stock that she...

1811
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,500
Was it, like, a market index fund?

1812
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:44,500
I think she said was, like, the most stable stock that, like, only go up.

1813
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,500
I think that was it.

1814
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,500
And I don't know.

1815
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:53,500
At least I have the moral high ground for investing stocks into Green Energy.

1816
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:57,500
I feel good about that, even though it's not really worth much.

1817
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,500
But that's kind of the point of it, is, like, if you believe in a thing,

1818
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:06,500
you buy stocks and so that they have money or something.

1819
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:12,500
The money you put in becomes, like, some sort of a...

1820
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,500
It's some sort of a good thing for the Green Energy.

1821
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,500
And that's all that matters.

1822
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:22,500
Or, I mean, you could make money doing it, I mean, optimally.

1823
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:24,500
Well, sure.

1824
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,500
One would hope. One would hope.

1825
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,500
Yeah.

1826
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:31,500
But, like, the way to make money is, like, to put it into Tesla or something.

1827
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:36,500
Well, yeah, something you think will go up.

1828
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,500
Chicken nuggets.

1829
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:44,500
I mean, like Bitcoin, Tesla go up, but it can also go down.

1830
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,500
Bitcoin has been going down a bit recently,

1831
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:52,500
although it could just be what they call consolidation before another spike.

1832
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,500
Who knows?

1833
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:59,500
I feel like the Bitcoin really is, like, a chump thing.

1834
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,500
It's just stocks, but worse.

1835
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,500
Yeah.

1836
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:08,500
Because you could lose all your money with a stock, I don't know.

1837
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,500
Yeah.

1838
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
It's the same, but you still get paid.

1839
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,500
You get paid, like, interest for having it, kind of.

1840
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:19,500
You know, like, the ideal investor who bought Bitcoin early, I mean, indeed,

1841
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:25,500
they have their investment has grown a lot, and they've made a lot of money doing it.

1842
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,500
I mean, it's kind of the same as buying a stock before it blows up.

1843
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:35,500
If you invested in Disney before Disney was big or whatever strange thing it would be.

1844
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:40,500
I'm saying, yeah, people definitely have made money buying, for instance, Bitcoin.

1845
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:46,500
But, you know, that doesn't guarantee, that does not guarantee this is the critical error

1846
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:50,500
that some people make in assessing the value of crypto.

1847
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:55,500
That does not guarantee that it will continue to be the case that, like, an investment in

1848
01:31:55,500 --> 01:32:01,500
Bitcoin will, you know, quintuple in the course of, like, two years or whatever.

1849
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:06,500
But, and I was, I talked a bit about, like, crypto and NFTs.

1850
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,500
Oh, yeah, another coal bearer.

1851
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:16,500
Just, like, I guess it's just standard liberal normal opinion to just think NFTs bad.

1852
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,500
Good for them, I guess.

1853
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:26,500
Yes, I mean, it's definitely good that it's laughable on a somewhat mass appeal way.

1854
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,500
I was a bit gutted, not gutted.

1855
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:39,500
I was a bit like, hmm, to be like, hmm, I do share a lot of opinions with this mainstream media democrat.

1856
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:49,500
So, I guess I kind of see, I guess I kind of see where the far right psychopaths are coming from

1857
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:56,500
when they call people like me, you know, libs and democrats and don't distinguish any further than that.

1858
01:32:56,500 --> 01:33:04,500
Yes, from a skewed enough perspective, I could see why I'm the same to them.

1859
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:08,500
And I'll just have to reckon with that.

1860
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,500
Anyway, were we talking about stocks?

1861
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,500
I am a fool.

1862
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:18,500
This voicemailer, yes, I actually am a fool for not having my money invested in something.

1863
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:26,500
I have been, in the last year or two, I have been thinking about where to invest my money,

1864
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:30,500
and I just haven't come to any final conclusions about it.

1865
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:36,500
I should have probably, it should be in something, instead of just sitting in fucking Bank of America

1866
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:42,500
making fucking 0.5 APY or whatever dog shit they give me.

1867
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:46,500
So, maybe I should just get something.

1868
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:52,500
I want it to be liquid, I want it to be somewhat liquid, but also I want it to be making at least some returns.

1869
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:58,500
This is the conundrum, I guess.

1870
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:04,500
It's confusing, I definitely need to look into it a lot more, because at the moment I know barely anything.

1871
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:11,500
Like they say that one of the most secure assets you can buy is government debt, government bonds.

1872
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:20,500
I mean, nothing is ever 100% certain in life, but it is as virtual a certainty as anything is in investing

1873
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:27,500
that the United States dollar will continue to be roughly as valuable as it is.

1874
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:31,500
The United States will not default on their debts.

1875
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:43,500
I looked into bonds, and I was like, okay, maybe I could put some of my money, maybe a fifth of my money into bonds.

1876
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:48,500
I wouldn't have it for five years, but five years down the line I would get it back.

1877
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:55,500
And I was gutted to see that the return on that is only a few percent.

1878
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:06,500
I was like, really? I basically just give you my money and I don't have it for years, and I get it back and the gain is like three percent?

1879
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:12,500
I was expecting it to be like ten, at least. This doesn't seem like a lot.

1880
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:19,500
I mean, I suppose it's better than it's slowly losing value by just sitting in a bank.

1881
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,500
Right?

1882
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:23,500
Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah, that is true.

1883
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:31,500
It may be worth that just to offset if you're not planning on spending that large amount of money all at once or in the near future.

1884
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:38,500
I thought I could get better than that, but I don't know, maybe that's the best I can get.

1885
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:46,500
I was disappointed with those figures, but I don't know.

1886
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:57,500
I've looked into it a bit. I should have looked into it more, because I should have figured out something to do with my money by now, and I haven't, because I'm stupid.

1887
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:02,500
Okay, next voicemail is also called Trixie, this time with no question marks.

1888
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:07,500
Three, two, one, go.

1889
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:13,500
Hey Ben, Trixie posted her, what's your favorite videos on my shitty channel?

1890
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:20,500
And the top vote of comment said, oh, you mean all the ones you, you private it, you fucking idiot, lol.

1891
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,500
By the way, you're gay.

1892
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:28,500
Lol.

1893
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:33,500
Yeah, I think I saw that she posted that.

1894
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:43,500
Yeah, it's like, which of my videos, which of my videos do you wish I didn't deprive it?

1895
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:50,500
And I guess the idea is she wants to deprive it, the private ones.

1896
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:59,500
Which like, fucking duh, of course you should do that. Of course you shouldn't have privated those videos in the first place.

1897
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:09,500
Obviously it fucked your channel. Obviously it was always going to fuck your channel, and everyone could have told you that, which I did tell you that, but you did it anyway.

1898
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:24,500
So like, obviously yes, but also like, man, fuck the people that like, fuck people like Tarbuck Transom or someone who, the people that worked on the archive to archive, when, you know, when she was like, yeah, I'm de-listing all my videos, they're all going private.

1899
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:33,500
And then people spent like months, like, you know, finding everything and making sure it was all archived, so it wouldn't be lost as she was like, destroying it.

1900
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:43,500
And then to, you know, six months later be like, just kidding, actually, that cost me some money, so I know I made you guys do all that, but like, I'm just, I'll probably start putting it back.

1901
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:54,500
What do you guys want me to put back? All the stuff that I arbitrarily like took from you and like destroyed, like, which ones do you want me to just like, hit the cancel button and just undo that on?

1902
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,500
Just let me know in the comments. Okay, bye.

1903
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:59,500
Man, you factured goodwill.

1904
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:04,500
Oh, it's such a good thing that you're doing, you're bringing us back all of these things that you took away.

1905
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:08,500
Thank you for giving those videos that I like that you took away for us for no reason.

1906
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:20,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Artificial scarcity. This is the NFT thing. I've realized, okay, people have all these weird claims about NFTs and like the power, right?

1907
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:29,500
People say, oh, environmental concerns. Oh, it's hurting the environment. Oh, it uses too much power. And then NFT bros go, no, it doesn't. It just doesn't.

1908
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:44,500
And I'm like, okay, if you say so. So, I don't know. I don't know. I can't really argue the environmental point. People that don't like NFTs say it uses tons of energy.

1909
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:53,500
People that like NFTs say it doesn't. So, I don't know. But it doesn't matter because what I really hate about NFTs is not that.

1910
01:38:53,500 --> 01:39:07,500
That is an incidental reason that I hate them. I hate them just for what they are and for what they represent, which is, yeah, they're artificial scarcity imposed on the digital realm.

1911
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:18,500
Tom had a tweet recently where he said like, he said like, he said like blockchain tech technology is good, but just NFTs as they currently exist are bad.

1912
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:28,500
And I was like, no, I don't think so. I think the blockchain is just inherently bad. The blockchain just exists to create digital scarcity where none existed before.

1913
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:45,500
The blockchain is just a tool for, yeah, for that. It's just a new way to create digital records that are more indelible than ever before.

1914
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:51,500
And I genuinely think that's nothing but bad. I generally don't think anything good can come from it.

1915
01:39:51,500 --> 01:40:02,500
I think people when they say that they're only talking about the currency side of it. I don't really know too much about what the blockchain literally is.

1916
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:19,500
The fact that it can prove that a certain IP address or person owns a thingy, which is allowed NFTs to exist, that's stupid because NFTs are like art trading, but in a way that is not necessary because it's digital.

1917
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:31,500
But currency is a little different, I guess, if that's the technology it's using to prove that somebody has currency so that you can't just copy paste money and pay for it.

1918
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:38,500
It's necessary for the digital currency to have legitimacy of any level.

1919
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:44,500
I still think it's bad. I think cryptocurrency is just bad. It's just a more...

1920
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:49,500
I like the idea.

1921
01:40:49,500 --> 01:41:08,500
It's money, which is bad, but it's a more concrete, it's an even less malleable concept of money. It's a more rigid, indelible, concrete form of money, which is just worse.

1922
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:29,500
The people, I think, the sentiment I understand of government and freedom, and what if we had a currency that was separate from the wins of the government, who sometimes are people we try to elect the other person and we got this piece of shit.

1923
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:43,500
So I get the sentiment behind it, but it's sort of like the root cause of the problem is money as a concept itself rather than who controls what the currency is valued at or whatever.

1924
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:54,500
People think that by having Bitcoin, problems that are money related will be solved, but that's not really how the problems come from.

1925
01:41:54,500 --> 01:42:06,500
It's still just money. It's just money, but more... it's just money, but less fluid as a concept and less evenly distributed, and just worse.

1926
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:13,500
It's just money again, and worse in some ways, in my opinion.

1927
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:23,500
I've yet to see anything good that the blockchain can do at all, and I don't think there is anything, but maybe...

1928
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:39,500
The blockchain is a... I've yet to see a very solid argument for the technology of the blockchain in the digital space, or in life in general.

1929
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:52,500
Here's what I think. I feel like the blockchain is a solution. It's not a solution to anything. It's a solution to its own problems.

1930
01:42:52,500 --> 01:43:06,500
There was no... I guess if the problem is like, how can I get in on the ground floor of owning a new currency that will perhaps become the dominant currency one day?

1931
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:12,500
Blockchain is a great solution to that, or Bitcoin may have been a great solution to that, and it has worked out pretty well.

1932
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:20,500
If your problem is how can I avoid paying taxes, then yeah, I guess the blockchain is a solution to that, but it's not a solution to any real problem.

1933
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:31,500
It's an individual solution to a problem that is global, I guess, in many countries.

1934
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:52,500
People sometimes, particularly brain dead evangelists, talk about Bitcoin as though, literally as though, if only every person in the world had just invested in some Bitcoin, you know, 10 years ago,

1935
01:43:52,500 --> 01:44:03,500
then now everyone would be rich because everyone would have, because Bitcoin went up, number go up, and so everyone would have more money and be wealthier.

1936
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:16,500
They talk about it as though that were the case. Bitcoin solves poverty by allowing anyone to buy it and number go up and become rich, and if you didn't do that, it's your own fault.

1937
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:26,500
So yes, there are still poor people, but all of those people who are poor, now they deserve it because they didn't buy in, so now it's actually good.

1938
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:30,500
Yeah, it's just the same again.

1939
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,500
Yes, it is.

1940
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:39,500
What if we could become the kings? What if we could become the royals instead of the ones that are already in power?

1941
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,500
What if Biden had a little accident?

1942
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,500
What if, fuck you, I got mine? What about that?

1943
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:51,500
That is, that is attempting off, that does merit further consideration.

1944
01:44:51,500 --> 01:45:00,500
Hmm, haven't thought about getting mine, whether anyone else does or not, but it's, that's, there's a theory.

1945
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:06,500
Okay, next voicemail is Son of Marowak. Are you ready?

1946
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:07,500
Yep.

1947
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:12,500
Three, two, one, go.

1948
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:17,500
So I'm just going to throw out an idea for a guest.

1949
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:23,500
How about try getting the Gaming Brit, Shea May, and or B-mask.

1950
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:33,500
I know you've had the Gaming Brit on once before, and I know that the three of them are pretty damn good friends, so I figure if you can get one, maybe you can get the other two.

1951
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:42,500
I know that Gaming Brit is a pretty busy guy, so maybe you wouldn't be able to get him, but maybe just throw it out as a, as an ask.

1952
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:45,500
Like, can any of them make it to the podcast?

1953
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:49,500
Like, it'd be pretty cool to hear all three of them on one podcast.

1954
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,500
If not, just throwing it out there.

1955
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:59,500
You can call me a super, super, pooper, scooper for even suggesting it, but I just thought I'd throw it out there.

1956
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:02,500
Did we have, did we have the Gaming Brit on?

1957
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:10,500
The Gaming Brit was on because Nate was, like, kind of associates, like associating with him or something.

1958
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,500
They were talking, because Nate's not on.

1959
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:17,500
I don't think the Gaming Brit would pay attention or say yes to anything like that.

1960
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:20,500
I don't know, I don't really know much about the Gaming Brit.

1961
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,500
I do like Shea May.

1962
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,500
I'm in Shea's...

1963
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:26,500
Is Shea May the Scottish guy?

1964
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,500
Uh, yes, yes.

1965
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,500
The Seven Hour Pokemon.

1966
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,500
Yeah, yeah, that guy.

1967
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,500
Okay.

1968
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,500
I like him.

1969
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,500
I'm in his Discord server.

1970
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,500
I've barely talked in there, but I'm in there.

1971
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,500
I probably could ask him.

1972
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,500
I don't know if he'd be interested.

1973
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:47,500
But I would like to have him on if he wanted to come on, for sure.

1974
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:50,500
Yeah, man.

1975
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,500
And I don't know who Beemask is.

1976
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,500
I've never heard of that person.

1977
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,500
Sorry, Beemask.

1978
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,500
It's good.

1979
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,500
Shea May's a good suggestion.

1980
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,500
I'd like to maybe talk to him.

1981
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,500
I mean, he seems cool.

1982
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:09,500
Next voicemail is called VVV321GO.

1983
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:13,500
They're conditioning our kids with Pokemon.

1984
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:17,500
I was playing the game, minding my own business,

1985
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:24,500
and I found Shellos, Gastryjohn, the Slug Pokemon,

1986
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:33,500
and the Underground Yerks, the Slugs in the Underground.

1987
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:39,500
They're conditioning our kids to think it's okay for these Slugs to be in the Underground.

1988
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:42,500
They'll think they're friendly.

1989
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:47,500
Put their balls on them, let them inside them.

1990
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,500
We're not safe.

1991
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:53,500
They're already among us.

1992
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:56,500
Slugs are just Yerk propaganda.

1993
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:59,500
Sluggo.

1994
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:02,500
It's just like Karl Pilkington said.

1995
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:04,500
We've already got snails.

1996
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:05,500
What do we need Slugs for?

1997
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,500
They're just redundant.

1998
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,500
They're homeless, Ben.

1999
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:10,500
They're just Yerk propaganda.

2000
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,500
They shouldn't be here.

2001
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:13,500
Yeah, they're homeless.

2002
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,500
They're homeless.

2003
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:15,500
They deserve it.

2004
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,500
We need to eradicate them.

2005
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:20,500
We need to offer up our bodies as hosts.

2006
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,500
No, not in my backyard.

2007
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,500
Not in my backyard.

2008
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:30,500
That's not in my brain hole.

2009
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,500
Gotta kick them out.

2010
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,500
Gotta send them on their way.

2011
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:36,500
Gotta put down benches that they can't sleep on.

2012
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,500
Gotta put spikes under the underpass.

2013
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,500
Don't let them set up shops.

2014
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,500
Salt the earth.

2015
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:43,500
Salt the benches.

2016
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,500
Salt everywhere.

2017
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:47,500
I eat salted every meal just for this reason.

2018
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,500
They can't get in me.

2019
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:52,500
They can't get in me because I'm too salty.

2020
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,500
VVV, thanks for the warning.

2021
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,500
Everyone needs to be aware.

2022
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,500
This is a growing problem in our society.

2023
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,500
Slug awareness.

2024
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,500
Raise it.

2025
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:08,500
Next question is which former PCP member do you miss the most?

2026
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,500
What do you think?

2027
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,500
None of them.

2028
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:16,500
None of them?

2029
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,500
Define miss.

2030
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:22,500
Chris still speak to Munchy.

2031
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:28,500
Yeah, I wouldn't pick Munchy because I still speak to him pretty regularly.

2032
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:32,500
So for me, if that weren't the case, I would probably say Munchy.

2033
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:38,500
But since it's not, I don't miss him.

2034
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:42,500
I guess I would say Nate because it makes me sad

2035
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:49,500
that he doesn't seem to care about stuff that me and him used to care about.

2036
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,500
Yeah.

2037
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:52,500
He's the one.

2038
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,500
Yeah, that makes me the saddest.

2039
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:57,500
Obviously I don't miss Trixie.

2040
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:04,500
Tom is sort of around, I guess.

2041
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:09,500
Yeah, I'd like Tom to be around more.

2042
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,500
I wouldn't mind it if Tom were around more.

2043
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:17,500
But you know, he's so busy with Saber Spark 64.

2044
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:20,500
It's just so...

2045
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:23,500
It was just the fact that he's doing that.

2046
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,500
I don't know.

2047
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:32,500
I mean, I guess he was already not very around.

2048
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,500
Yeah, Nate makes me sad.

2049
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:39,500
I don't understand what happens with him.

2050
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:42,500
I don't know.

2051
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:45,500
I guess that's my answer.

2052
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:57,500
Okay, next one is a YouTube link with a timestamp Kotaku One Piece Worldseeker with Tim Rogers.

2053
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,500
How old is this video?

2054
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,500
So I'm a cop killer now.

2055
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:02,500
Oh, he said it.

2056
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,500
My mom told me I would never be a cop killer.

2057
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:05,500
She was wrong.

2058
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:08,500
Why would your mom tell you you'd never be a cop killer?

2059
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:12,500
What a terrible thing to say to your son.

2060
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,500
Son, you'll never be a cop killer.

2061
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,500
You'll be a juvie for life.

2062
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:18,500
You'll never get enough slime to enlist.

2063
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:20,500
No, mom.

2064
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:22,500
Fuck slime core.

2065
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:25,500
I don't want to live in the rat race anymore.

2066
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:30,500
I'm going to study the blade just like my hero Phantom Horn.

2067
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:35,500
That's what people will say after they see him coolly take his revenge.

2068
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,500
Like a fucking sick fuck.

2069
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:45,500
Okay, well, I guess thanks for the...

2070
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,500
Can we play that?

2071
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:51,500
Will we get copyright struck if we put that clip in the episode?

2072
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:54,500
It's just Tim Rogers playing a One Piece Worldseeker and saying,

2073
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,500
I'm a cop killer now because he killed a Marine.

2074
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:59,500
Yeah, that's fine.

2075
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,500
Yeah.

2076
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,500
Put the link in the description.

2077
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,500
People can watch for themselves.

2078
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,500
Link in the description with the timestamp.

2079
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,500
1007.

2080
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,500
Next one.

2081
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,500
The PCP is now the dick show, except good.

2082
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,500
Let's go.

2083
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,500
Three, two, one, go.

2084
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:20,500
Yeah, welcome to drama.

2085
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,500
You want drama, you need drama.

2086
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:23,500
You got it.

2087
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,500
It's the Dick Cressinator Showcast.

2088
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,500
Where Trixie is the new Maddux.

2089
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:30,500
Coming live from whatever apartment I happened to have found myself in.

2090
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,500
I'm your host, Ben Sainte.

2091
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:36,500
The 905-patreon-dollar-man.

2092
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:40,500
And he was always my actual wholesome counterpart, Gib.

2093
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,500
Yeah.

2094
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,500
Is he just like me?

2095
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,500
He's just like me for real.

2096
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,500
This guy should take over the podcast.

2097
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,500
He's doing a better job.

2098
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,500
He's a better us than we are.

2099
01:52:52,500 --> 01:53:00,500
Yeah, the Maddux parallel is there.

2100
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,500
She made that...

2101
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:06,500
She made that sub-stack post that was like...

2102
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,500
The way she phrased it was...

2103
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,500
The way she phrased it is like,

2104
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:12,500
I'm through being a bitch online.

2105
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,500
Like, I'm gonna be nice.

2106
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:16,500
I've decided to be nice.

2107
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:18,500
I don't really talk about that.

2108
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:21,500
I think we talked about it a little.

2109
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,500
But the real meaning of it was,

2110
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:25,500
I got owned,

2111
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:28,500
I tried to attack the PCP,

2112
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:31,500
and I just got ridiculed and made them a bunch of money doing it,

2113
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:33,500
and I'm humiliated.

2114
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,500
So I'm not going to do that anymore.

2115
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,500
So I feel like she may...

2116
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,500
She has probably learned her lesson

2117
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,500
and will probably avoid drama,

2118
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,500
which is too bad.

2119
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:47,500
But I would suggest harassing her online

2120
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,500
and goading her into some sort of response.

2121
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,500
I said this before.

2122
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:52,500
I'll say it again.

2123
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:54,500
I don't care.

2124
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,500
I don't fucking care.

2125
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,500
God, could you imagine

2126
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:00,500
if there was a lawsuit,

2127
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,500
a libel, or whatever?

2128
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,500
Okay, well, I mean...

2129
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:05,500
I don't even deal with that.

2130
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:08,500
I mean harassment in the way that is like...

2131
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:09,500
Just like...

2132
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,500
You call it harassment if you're like a pussy,

2133
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:14,500
and it's just like someone says something mean to you on Twitter

2134
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:16,500
and you cry about it instead of just blocking them.

2135
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,500
That's what kind of harassment I'm talking about.

2136
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,500
Also, the illegal kind.

2137
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:24,500
That I can't say that I'm talking about.

2138
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,500
No.

2139
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:30,500
The cool kind.

2140
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,500
I feel like Trixie is not dumb enough

2141
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:34,500
to do exactly what Maddox did.

2142
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,500
But at this point, it's getting closer to possible.

2143
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,500
Yeah.

2144
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,500
Yeah, like...

2145
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:45,500
I mean, Maddox really did take it to a new level.

2146
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,500
It was unbelievable.

2147
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:48,500
It was unbelievable.

2148
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:51,500
Yeah, Trixie has not been quite that stupid.

2149
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:52,500
But like...

2150
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,500
I mean, she's made some pretty...

2151
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:58,500
I mean, the Who Are These podcast was a huge backfire.

2152
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:01,500
So, I mean, the parallel is there, for sure,

2153
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,500
if you want it.

2154
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,500
Does that make me the Dick Masterson in this situation?

2155
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,500
Well, I...

2156
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,500
Well, I hope not.

2157
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,500
But whatever.

2158
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,500
Leftist Dick Masterson.

2159
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,500
Can we...

2160
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:17,500
Oh man, I don't know.

2161
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,500
I don't want to talk too much about it.

2162
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:22,500
Can we just talk about how...

2163
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,500
Can we...

2164
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:27,500
It just really stands out to me that Dick

2165
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,500
and everyone in the Dick sphere now

2166
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,500
is just all about Stone Toss.

2167
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,500
Like, they all love Stone Toss.

2168
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,500
And they like pay him money.

2169
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:36,500
Yeah, they love Stone Toss.

2170
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,500
They pay him money.

2171
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,500
They buy his flerks.

2172
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:41,500
They think he's great.

2173
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:42,500
They think he's a free speech worker.

2174
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,500
Even the one...

2175
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:46,500
Man, I know I didn't really like Vito.

2176
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:48,500
But like...

2177
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:49,500
Yeah, Vito is also...

2178
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,500
He calls himself a liberal.

2179
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:52,500
But he's all about Stone Toss.

2180
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,500
He's got the Stone Toss NFT.

2181
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:56,500
He loves Ethan Ralph's got one.

2182
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,500
Dick's got one.

2183
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:00,500
Ricky Burrick's got one.

2184
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,500
Everyone in that fucking scene.

2185
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:04,500
They're just...

2186
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,500
They're just all about this Nazi.

2187
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:06,500
They're just all about this Nazi.

2188
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,500
And Trixie is like, I want one.

2189
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:10,500
He's not Trixie begging for one, right?

2190
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:12,500
Oh, no, I did see that.

2191
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,500
Trixie wants a flerk too.

2192
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:16,500
It's like prose.

2193
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:18,500
Come on.

2194
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:20,500
It wasn't obvious enough already, right?

2195
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:23,500
They obviously wouldn't believe somebody saying that

2196
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:26,500
Stone Toss is a Nazi or has like...

2197
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:28,500
They would say, nah, it's just a joke.

2198
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:30,500
They would say no, it's just a joke.

2199
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:31,500
And it's like...

2200
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:34,500
Because of that, they see no problem with anything at all

2201
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,500
associated with Stone Toss.

2202
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,500
I don't know.

2203
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,500
I don't have to sit here and explain.

2204
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:41,500
Sure, yeah, it's a joke.

2205
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,500
It's a joke.

2206
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:43,500
It's a comic.

2207
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,500
And the punchline is you laugh at it because like,

2208
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,500
oh, yeah, it's true.

2209
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,500
The Jews really are, you know,

2210
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,500
subverting Western civilization

2211
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,500
by encouraging miscegenation between blacks and whites.

2212
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:54,500
Yeah.

2213
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:55,500
So it is funny, actually.

2214
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,500
But it's just...

2215
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:57,500
Because it's just a joke.

2216
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:59,500
The punchline is that it's true, but it's just a joke.

2217
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,500
I saw someone...

2218
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,500
It was not that comic.

2219
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:03,500
It was a...

2220
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,500
I think it was one about trans-suicide rates or something.

2221
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:07,500
And it was a...

2222
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,500
A 23rd...

2223
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:09,500
Someone was saying to Ricky Berwick,

2224
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,500
like, don't you know Stone Toss is a Nazi?

2225
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,500
And Ricky Berwick was like, this is a joke.

2226
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,500
And he made a weird face.

2227
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:16,500
And then...

2228
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,500
He said, bro, it's a comic.

2229
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:19,500
You're just a joke.

2230
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:20,500
He said...

2231
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:22,500
No, he said, bro, that's a comic.

2232
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:23,500
It's satire.

2233
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,500
Like, bro, it's three panels.

2234
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:28,500
It's three panels.

2235
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,500
Anything you think...

2236
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,500
Therefore, it's satire.

2237
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,500
Anything you think it's saying,

2238
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,500
it's automatically saying the opposite.

2239
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,500
Because it's three images in a sequence.

2240
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,500
That's just how it works.

2241
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:40,500
And then...

2242
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,500
And then Stone Toss replies.

2243
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:45,500
And he replies to Ricky.

2244
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:48,500
And he's like, yeah, exactly.

2245
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:49,500
And also...

2246
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:51,500
And the reason...

2247
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:52,500
And the reason...

2248
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:53,500
The proof that it's satire...

2249
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,500
Is that these people are doing...

2250
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:59,500
You know, the people complaining about me...

2251
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:01,500
The people complaining that I say this

2252
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,500
are just proving the point, right?

2253
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:05,500
So, like, yeah.

2254
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,500
And they're just...

2255
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:07,500
He agrees.

2256
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:08,500
Yes, it is satire.

2257
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:12,500
And see, here's proof that what I'm saying is literally true.

2258
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:13,500
And not a joke.

2259
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:17,500
So...

2260
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:18,500
Yeah, there's...

2261
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:21,500
Yeah, I don't think they know what satire is.

2262
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:22,500
I think it's just...

2263
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:23,500
They think it means comedy,

2264
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:25,500
but like a different way of saying it.

2265
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,500
Yeah.

2266
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:28,500
It's...

2267
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:29,500
There's...

2268
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:30,500
I mean, I don't know.

2269
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:32,500
There's...

2270
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:34,500
As far as I'm concerned, there's no defending it.

2271
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:37,500
The it's satire defences doesn't make any sense.

2272
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:41,500
It falls apart immediately if you think about it.

2273
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,500
It's just cope.

2274
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:43,500
They just...

2275
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:44,500
They just want...

2276
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:45,500
This Nazi is popular,

2277
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:46,500
and they just want to...

2278
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,500
They just want to be his friend.

2279
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:48,500
That's literally it.

2280
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:49,500
That's literally all there is to it.

2281
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:52,500
And it's disgusting.

2282
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:53,500
It's really disgusting.

2283
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:55,500
People you might think would know better.

2284
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:56,500
Like, I didn't think...

2285
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:58,500
Like, I didn't like Vito.

2286
01:58:58,500 --> 01:58:59,500
I didn't think of him...

2287
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:00,500
I didn't think of him as a Nazi,

2288
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:03,500
but like, he's a super pro stone toss.

2289
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:05,500
So like, what am I to...

2290
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,500
What am I to make of this?

2291
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:09,500
Trixie, you would think, you know, sucks,

2292
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:10,500
but not a Nazi,

2293
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:12,500
but she really wants a flirk.

2294
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,500
She really wants a stone-tough NFT.

2295
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:16,500
I don't like it.

2296
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:17,500
I really don't like it.

2297
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,500
I'm not surprised in the slightest,

2298
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:21,500
but yeah, it sucks as well.

2299
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:25,500
Yeah, it's particularly obnoxious,

2300
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:26,500
even more so than usual.

2301
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:28,500
Yeah.

2302
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:30,500
Next voicemail?

2303
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:32,500
Yep.

2304
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:33,500
The next one is called,

2305
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:41,500
I'm very behind of the podcast,

2306
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,500
but your conversation for like a month ago about 60s anime

2307
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:45,500
reminded me of a really cool part of anime history.

2308
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,500
So there's a huge influx of foreign films in Japan

2309
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,500
after World War II through the end of the 1950s,

2310
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:50,500
bolstered by the backlog of films

2311
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,500
that didn't make it over previously due to the war.

2312
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:53,500
Many of these were Disney classics

2313
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:54,500
and they set the expectation

2314
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:56,500
for what animation should be in Japan,

2315
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,500
but made it hard for domestic animation to compete.

2316
01:59:58,500 --> 01:59:59,500
That's part of why Tesco was so important,

2317
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:01,500
because while Toya was trying to be the Disney of Japan,

2318
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:02,500
like with the film Gibwatched,

2319
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:04,500
Tesco pioneered the opposite approach

2320
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:05,500
and found every single shortcut

2321
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,500
you could possibly take to make it feasible

2322
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:08,500
to produce a weekly TV series like Astro Boy,

2323
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:11,500
which set the stage for TV anime in general going forward.

2324
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:13,500
Director Kisaburo Sugi criticized him

2325
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:14,500
for taking so many shortcuts

2326
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:16,500
by telling him that it wasn't even animation,

2327
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:17,500
to which Tesco literally responded,

2328
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:20,500
yeah, it's not animation, it's anime.

2329
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:23,500
I knew this.

2330
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:26,500
Did he coin the phrase anime?

2331
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:29,500
Like to shorten it,

2332
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:30,500
because it's not fully animation?

2333
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:32,500
I didn't, I don't know, maybe.

2334
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:34,500
Or is that literally just the word that he had for it?

2335
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:35,500
I don't know, that's interesting.

2336
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:38,500
Yeah, you know, that's a good question.

2337
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:43,500
It's kind of like Tesco was the Hanna-Barbera,

2338
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:48,500
or the fucking, the less animated shows

2339
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:50,500
of like Top Cat and Yogi Bear

2340
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:52,500
that reused backgrounds

2341
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:54,500
and were very cheap to make.

2342
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:55,500
Yeah.

2343
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:57,500
They're completely contrasted with the Disney stuff

2344
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,500
and the Tom and Jerry to an extent,

2345
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:02,500
which were doing a lot more lavish

2346
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,500
on ones and stuff like that.

2347
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:08,500
Yeah, I've said before that like, yeah,

2348
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:12,500
Tesco's big innovation was like,

2349
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:14,500
yeah, we want to make animation,

2350
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:18,500
but like how can we make the most animation

2351
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:20,500
the cheapest we possibly can?

2352
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:21,500
How can we do it?

2353
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:23,500
What's the easiest way we can do it?

2354
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:25,500
And it worked.

2355
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,500
And I mean, that's cool.

2356
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:30,500
That's cool and valid, and I respect it.

2357
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:34,500
I've always wanted to go and read all of Tesco's manga.

2358
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,500
There's a lot of it.

2359
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:36,500
But there's so much.

2360
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:37,500
There's so much.

2361
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:38,500
There's so much.

2362
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:40,500
I've gotten through quite a bit of Astro Boy,

2363
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:43,500
which is really good, really fun to read.

2364
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:47,500
Very expressive and like cutesy,

2365
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:49,500
but also like subject matters

2366
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:51,500
does not match the cuteness of it whatsoever,

2367
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:53,500
so it's great.

2368
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:58,500
I have not read any Tesco.

2369
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:01,500
I don't think I've seen any of his stuff.

2370
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:04,500
He's great at like setting a panel up,

2371
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:07,500
like filling a panel with interesting bits

2372
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,500
and comedy stuff.

2373
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:13,500
He's what you might call a mangaka.

2374
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:15,500
Whoa, really?

2375
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:17,500
In this day and age?

2376
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,500
Well, of the 60s?

2377
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:22,500
Yeah, I see, I see.

2378
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:28,500
All right, next voicemail is a preti patel?

2379
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:29,500
Preti patel?

2380
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:31,500
Three, two, one, go.

2381
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:37,500
How much longer do you think the PCP is going to last?

2382
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:41,500
Well, I see no reason why it can't continue indefinitely

2383
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,500
in its current state.

2384
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:47,500
It'll end when I'm dead and buried

2385
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:50,500
unless Ben decides to continue it alone.

2386
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,500
If I would...

2387
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,500
I would hope I wouldn't have to continue it alone.

2388
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:01,500
I probably would continue it alone if I had to.

2389
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:04,500
I would just make it the Ben podcast.

2390
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:07,500
That's why I live, that's why I stay alive.

2391
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:10,500
To prevent that.

2392
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,500
This is my one reason.

2393
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:15,500
Yeah, I mean, that's my answer.

2394
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:17,500
I'm not stopping.

2395
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:19,500
Why would I stop?

2396
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:21,500
Yes.

2397
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,500
You can't fucking stop me.

2398
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,500
I know you all want to.

2399
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:27,500
You're all just listening to the day where I finally give up,

2400
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:29,500
but it's not happening.

2401
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:31,500
Next voice...

2402
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:33,500
I've got to pay spin.

2403
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:35,500
Let me just try and...

2404
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:40,500
Have you considered changing the episode release frequency?

2405
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:43,500
It feels like you're struggling to come up with stuff to talk about every week.

2406
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:45,500
Yeah, I've considered it,

2407
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:48,500
but we still talk for two hours a week.

2408
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:50,500
We're not that thin.

2409
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:54,500
People complain about mere two-hour podcasts.

2410
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:57,500
They want the four hours, they want the five hours.

2411
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:02,500
It's not that easy to do all the time.

2412
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:04,500
I think it's just like...

2413
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:07,500
It's been a run of a few weeks of us not having much to talk about,

2414
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:10,500
mostly because, for me, on my side,

2415
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:14,500
is that I'm hard working on a single thing that I can't talk about.

2416
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:17,500
So much of my time is devoted to that.

2417
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:19,500
It's the same for me.

2418
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:25,500
Yeah, I think I am in a bit of a spell where I'm not doing very much other than that.

2419
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:28,500
And yet, we still talk for hours a week about it.

2420
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:29,500
I think that if...

2421
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:32,500
I have thought about it, like, in theory,

2422
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:34,500
it's like, hmm, is there really that much to talk about?

2423
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:38,500
Do we really have to do it for every week?

2424
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:43,500
But in practice, I think if we did it bi-weekly,

2425
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:46,500
I think there would just be less podcast.

2426
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:48,500
I don't think we would get...

2427
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:54,500
I don't think it would be more densely populated with, I don't know, ideas or whatever.

2428
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:57,500
I think there would just be less of it.

2429
02:04:57,500 --> 02:05:02,500
So, I mean, you know, if that's what you want, is that what you want?

2430
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:04,500
You sick fuck?

2431
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:06,500
Yeah, I don't know.

2432
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:07,500
Yes.

2433
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:08,500
Yes, yes.

2434
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:10,500
Next one is an image.

2435
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:12,500
What do we got?

2436
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:13,500
Okay.

2437
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:14,500
Gipcore.

2438
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:15,500
Gipcore.

2439
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:16,500
And I'm looking.

2440
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:19,500
We got Batman and Pyraman.

2441
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:20,500
We got Berserk.

2442
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:25,500
We got the red and blue Pokemon Manga, I assume.

2443
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:27,500
Is that... that's what that is?

2444
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:28,500
I'm not sure which...

2445
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,500
The one piece?

2446
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:30,500
I'm not sure which one that is.

2447
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,500
The Pokemon Adventure...

2448
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:34,500
Pokemon Adventures Manga,

2449
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:36,500
which I've talked about loving before.

2450
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:37,500
I think that's what that is.

2451
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:38,500
That's different.

2452
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:41,500
The one that I read was the one that's like Pikachu Boogaloo?

2453
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:42,500
No.

2454
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:44,500
This is a different one.

2455
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:49,500
The one that I had was the one with the really monstrous Pokemon, which is awesome.

2456
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:55,500
Yeah, this one came out with the game before the anime, before Ash Ketchum or anything.

2457
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:57,500
So, the character's name is red.

2458
02:05:57,500 --> 02:05:58,500
Is this the one?

2459
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,500
His rival is blue.

2460
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:03,500
Is there a Clefairy?

2461
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:05,500
Sure, in Pokemon.

2462
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:09,500
Okay, I feel like there was an early Manga.

2463
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:14,500
Because Clefairy was going to be the starter at some point in development,

2464
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:16,500
and then they changed it to Pikachu.

2465
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:19,500
And I think I read that there was some early Manga

2466
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:22,500
that still has a prominent Clefairy.

2467
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,500
I don't know about that, maybe.

2468
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:32,500
The one I read was like his main boy was Poliwirl,

2469
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:34,500
and he got a Pikachu at some point.

2470
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:39,500
Yeah, I think that is the one I'm thinking of.

2471
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:41,500
Okay, so yeah, I think it is.

2472
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:43,500
Yeah, I understand.

2473
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:49,500
We got One Piece, we got Vriska from Homestuck.

2474
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:51,500
Not Homestuck, just Vriska.

2475
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:53,500
Just Vriska.

2476
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:58,500
We got Dark Cloud, we got Scott Pilgrim, and we got Adventure Time.

2477
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:01,500
And I would like to say that this is exactly right.

2478
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:03,500
This is all a gift core.

2479
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:05,500
I have not made this image.

2480
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:09,500
Somebody just remembers things I have said I liked and put them in a thing.

2481
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:12,500
True, absolutely true, very true indeed.

2482
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,500
Good job.

2483
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:17,500
I love all of this.

2484
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,500
You know, Bayman and Pyraman?

2485
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:23,500
I don't even remember you ever talking about those guys.

2486
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:25,500
I know who they are.

2487
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:27,500
I think I may have talked about it because I got into,

2488
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:32,500
I rewatched it sort of recently.

2489
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:37,500
It's like a little animated show on YouTube with Batman and Pyraman.

2490
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:40,500
And they're just sort of like, well, what are we going to do, Batman?

2491
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:42,500
I come over to the house with best friends.

2492
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:45,500
It's like silly.

2493
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:49,500
They befriend a pumpkin.

2494
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:52,500
And it's just a pumpkin, but it actually is a person.

2495
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:59,500
It's turned into a whole lot of Adventure Time-esque shenanigans that grow.

2496
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:06,500
Like every stupid thing that happens in every episode stays as a thing that is canon to the world.

2497
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:12,500
And then it sort of builds over at times to things that can exist in this world.

2498
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:18,500
Portals that open up to different places or places that exist that they can go back to and things can come from.

2499
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:19,500
It's great.

2500
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:22,500
Go watch the entirety of Batman and Pyraman.

2501
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:23,500
So on YouTube.

2502
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:27,500
I didn't know that it had continuity.

2503
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:32,500
Yeah, it's really good.

2504
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:35,500
I wouldn't have put, I know you like Berserk.

2505
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:39,500
I wouldn't have picked it as a give-core thing.

2506
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:42,500
Well, it's my edgy side.

2507
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:47,500
It's the, you know, I love Berserk.

2508
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:50,500
Almost more than one piece, I think.

2509
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,500
Fair.

2510
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:55,500
Something, I mean, I've read the entirety of it.

2511
02:08:55,500 --> 02:09:02,500
And I will read any new parts drawn by the assistance of Kentaro Mura.

2512
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:05,500
I wouldn't have picked Scott Pilgrim for you.

2513
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:12,500
I don't remember you talking that much about Scott Pilgrim or Adventure Time for that matter.

2514
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:16,500
I mean, maybe they guessed, but it's very true.

2515
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:17,500
I love Scott Pilgrim.

2516
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:23,500
I have the little black and white comic on my shelf.

2517
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:25,500
I always wanted to get the physical books.

2518
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:27,500
I never got them.

2519
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:32,500
Maybe I should at some point when I have a nicer room to put books in.

2520
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:35,500
Next one is called Just Jacking It.

2521
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:38,500
Three, two, one, go.

2522
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,500
Hey, Ben.

2523
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:44,500
Have you ever, or I guess give two.

2524
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:47,500
Have y'all ever tried semen retention?

2525
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:50,500
No.

2526
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:52,500
No.

2527
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:54,500
Next question.

2528
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:57,500
What does that mean, just not coming?

2529
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:00,500
Yeah, is that no, not?

2530
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:03,500
It might be semen retention.

2531
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:07,500
A way to, like, minimize ejaculation.

2532
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:11,500
Okay, it is the practice of avoiding ejaculation.

2533
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:14,500
So it's just no fat.

2534
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:17,500
Or you can learn how to orgasm without ejaculating.

2535
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:20,500
Oh.

2536
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:22,500
Why?

2537
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:24,500
That sounds awful.

2538
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:33,500
I mean, there's less mess, I suppose, but that seems like a weird thing to do to your body.

2539
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:40,500
I found an article on Healthline about semen retention, and it's like, okay, what are the purported benefits?

2540
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:45,500
And then it gives a list of mental, physical, and spiritual benefits.

2541
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,500
Thanks, healthline.com.

2542
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,500
And then the very next one.

2543
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:51,500
Is there any research to support this?

2544
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:56,500
It's a complicated, multifaceted topic, and research is lacking.

2545
02:10:56,500 --> 02:11:00,500
Not having enough research doesn't mean all claims are false, though.

2546
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:09,500
So, like, just because we don't know that it does any of these things doesn't mean that it necessarily doesn't give spiritual benefit.

2547
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:13,500
It's not evidence of lack.

2548
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:15,500
Yeah, yeah.

2549
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:16,500
That's dumb.

2550
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:17,500
Healthline.com, what the fuck?

2551
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:19,500
Thanks, healthline.

2552
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:24,500
Someone, you should be ashamed of yourself.

2553
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:28,500
Next voicemail is called Hot Take.

2554
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:31,500
Three, two, one, go.

2555
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:36,500
Ben, I got a hot, hot, hot take for you.

2556
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:37,500
Go on.

2557
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:40,500
It's bad to say the n-word.

2558
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:45,500
Yeah, yeah, I probably shouldn't have said it that one time.

2559
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:47,500
And all those other times also.

2560
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:49,500
I'm sorry.

2561
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:52,500
I'm sorry.

2562
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:56,500
I'm being, oh, oh, so you, oh, what, you're going to cancel me?

2563
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,500
Oh, oh, so now I'm being canceled?

2564
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:01,500
Oh, what about my free speech?

2565
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:02,500
I'm being censored.

2566
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:04,500
I'm being censored by the woke mob.

2567
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:05,500
What am I being?

2568
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:06,500
What am I being?

2569
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:07,500
What am I being?

2570
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:09,500
Tucker, Tucker Carlson, please save me.

2571
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:10,500
Please have me on your show.

2572
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:14,500
Just because I'm white.

2573
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:17,500
Just, they hate me just because I'm white.

2574
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:18,500
And I said the n-word.

2575
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:20,500
But just because I'm white, they don't like me anymore.

2576
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:23,500
And that's racism.

2577
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:28,500
I go around to the high school and I say to the children,

2578
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:29,500
I'm okay.

2579
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:30,500
I'm cool.

2580
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:32,500
I'm on a podcast.

2581
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:35,500
What are you doing?

2582
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:37,500
I can't be canceled.

2583
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:41,500
I can't be in the wrong because I got a podcast.

2584
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:42,500
I got, I got a comic.

2585
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:44,500
I got things.

2586
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:47,500
The, the, I'm better than you at everything.

2587
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:54,500
The, all I'm saying, all I'm saying is that this voicemail telling me

2588
02:12:54,500 --> 02:13:00,500
that it's bad to say the n-word just because I'm white is the real racism.

2589
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:02,500
And some, and some, and something must be done.

2590
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:07,500
We need a solution, a final solution for people like this.

2591
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:08,500
No.

2592
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:10,500
For people like this voicemail.

2593
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:14,500
This antifa, this antifa, this antifa thug that sent me this voicemail,

2594
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:18,500
that threatened my life implicitly with this voicemail.

2595
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:20,500
I know that they would kill me in a second.

2596
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,500
They would, they would, they would, they would, they would,

2597
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:23,500
they would Rosenbaum my ass.

2598
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:25,500
They would pull a knife on me and then pull a gun on me

2599
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:27,500
and start killing me in the middle of the street.

2600
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:31,500
Just because I showed up to a place of, to defend a place of business

2601
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:35,500
with my legally acquired firearm.

2602
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:37,500
And that's fucked up.

2603
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:38,500
Okay.

2604
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:39,500
I think we're mixing things.

2605
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:40,500
Yes.

2606
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:41,500
We're sorry.

2607
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:45,500
We lost, we lost the plot.

2608
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:50,500
Next voicemail is another fucking external link.

2609
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:56,500
So let's go, let's go see it.

2610
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,500
Okay.

2611
02:13:58,500 --> 02:13:59,500
It's called.

2612
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:01,500
Asking the real questions.

2613
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:02,500
Yes.

2614
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:04,500
Three, two, one, go.

2615
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:08,500
Everybody asks, how can you have a rad con without Conrad?

2616
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:13,500
But nobody asks, how can you have a procrastinate or is podcast without Nate?

2617
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:15,500
Oh, true.

2618
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:16,500
True.

2619
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:19,500
That's a real, that's a real dunk.

2620
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:24,500
Did you know that procrastinators is actually Nate Bestman spelled backwards?

2621
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:25,500
Think about it.

2622
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:27,500
I will not.

2623
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:29,500
And I will just assume you're correct.

2624
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:30,500
Yeah.

2625
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:31,500
I'd rather not.

2626
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:32,500
It's better this way.

2627
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:36,500
Next voicemail is called Infinite Jest and Orville the Duck.

2628
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:39,500
Three, two, one, go.

2629
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:40,500
Okay.

2630
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:41,500
Two things.

2631
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:45,500
One, Ben, you mentioned how reading Infinite Jest for you was an annoying experience

2632
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:48,500
because I have to keep looking at the full notes.

2633
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:53,500
I argued that the procrastinators podcast is the Infinite Jest of podcasts because

2634
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:57,500
they're always mentioning some drama from 100 episodes back.

2635
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:58,500
Yeah.

2636
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:03,500
Or some episode from Golden Girls or something in the description or the comments.

2637
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:07,500
And it's an active listening experience.

2638
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:08,500
Exactly.

2639
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:10,500
Give you a British.

2640
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:13,500
I just found out about Orville the Duck.

2641
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:16,500
And they were talking about puppets in the last episode.

2642
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:19,500
What the fuck's up with Orville the Duck?

2643
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:20,500
Orville.

2644
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,500
Why does the duck have depression?

2645
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:26,500
And why does the duck want to kill himself so much?

2646
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:29,500
And why does it wear diapers?

2647
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:30,500
It's a baby.

2648
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:32,500
Why does the baby have depression?

2649
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:33,500
It's like Gafford.

2650
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:34,500
Why does Gafford read Mondays?

2651
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:35,500
He doesn't have to walk.

2652
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:41,500
Why does a baby wants to put a bullet in his head so fucking much?

2653
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:42,500
It's a baby.

2654
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:47,500
Why do people hate Orville so much?

2655
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:50,500
What is it?

2656
02:15:50,500 --> 02:15:54,500
Are you familiar with Orville the Duck?

2657
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:57,500
I think I have seen...

2658
02:15:57,500 --> 02:15:59,500
This is not Ring of Bell.

2659
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:00,500
I've seen him before.

2660
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:04,500
But I don't think it was on the internet.

2661
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:06,500
It's like look at this fucked up duck.

2662
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:09,500
Oh Keith Harris dead at 67.

2663
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:14,500
Ventriloquist who gave the world Orville the Duck dies of cancer.

2664
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:17,500
I guess he's a depressed baby duck.

2665
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:19,500
He does have a big diaper.

2666
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:20,500
Damn.

2667
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:24,500
I bet he could fit a lot of doodoo in that diaper.

2668
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:25,500
Just think about it.

2669
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:26,500
Just think of all the possibilities.

2670
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:28,500
That's a big ass diaper.

2671
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:30,500
A lot of high capacity.

2672
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:38,500
And it's doubly fucked because Keith Harris puts his hand up there.

2673
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:39,500
Oh yeah.

2674
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:40,500
All day.

2675
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:41,500
Oh god.

2676
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:44,500
You can't do that with an underage dummy.

2677
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:47,500
They're not old enough to consent to be puppeted.

2678
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:53,500
I've never heard of Orville the Duck as an English thing.

2679
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:54,500
I thought it was something else.

2680
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:56,500
I've heard the name.

2681
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:58,500
But I've never seen him before.

2682
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:04,500
So I don't know what the fuck is up with this.

2683
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:06,500
Cuddles the monkey.

2684
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:07,500
Bubbles?

2685
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:08,500
Cuddles the monkey.

2686
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:09,500
Cuddles.

2687
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:10,500
Let me google that.

2688
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:11,500
Okay.

2689
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:15,500
There's no images on Wikipedia.

2690
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:16,500
Cuddles the monkey.

2691
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:17,500
Okay.

2692
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:20,500
It's the same dude, different character.

2693
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:22,500
Was it Keith Harris?

2694
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:23,500
Yeah.

2695
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:26,500
I've never heard of Keith Harris.

2696
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:30,500
Is he any relation to Kamala?

2697
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:31,500
Yes.

2698
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:32,500
Yes.

2699
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:33,500
Man.

2700
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:34,500
Ventriloquist.

2701
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:36,500
Man.

2702
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:38,500
Ventriloquist is sort of strange.

2703
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,500
It is strange.

2704
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:42,500
That duck is so weird.

2705
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,500
He's got like a huge head.

2706
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:46,500
He's puffy cheeks.

2707
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,500
Real dump.

2708
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:49,500
Dumpass.

2709
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:50,500
Real dump of a duck.

2710
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:51,500
Dumpass.

2711
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:52,500
Real dump.

2712
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:56,500
The dump truck baby ass.

2713
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:00,500
Imagine twerking with an ass like that with a huge diaper.

2714
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:03,500
Full of huge duck doo doo.

2715
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:05,500
Just think about it.

2716
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:07,500
I don't want to think about it.

2717
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:08,500
Just keep thinking.

2718
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:09,500
Picture it.

2719
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:10,500
Imagine it.

2720
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:12,500
Clear your mind of all thoughts.

2721
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:13,500
All sensation.

2722
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:14,500
Breathe in.

2723
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:15,500
I can't.

2724
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:16,500
There's the duck there.

2725
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:17,500
Focus on your breathing.

2726
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:24,500
And then if something, your mind is like a still, your mind is like a still pool of water.

2727
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:29,500
If any thought disturbs it, take that thought and throw it away.

2728
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:31,500
Pluck it out and throw it out of your mind.

2729
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:33,500
Your mind is still.

2730
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:35,500
Focus on your breathing.

2731
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:39,500
Now, imagine Orville the duck's huge dump truck ass.

2732
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:44,500
His diaper overflowing with liquid duck shit.

2733
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:46,500
Just do it.

2734
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:47,500
Just do it.

2735
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:48,500
Just do it.

2736
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:49,500
Just do it.

2737
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:50,500
Do it.

2738
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:51,500
Do it.

2739
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:52,500
Do it.

2740
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:53,500
Do it.

2741
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:54,500
Do it.

2742
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:55,500
Do it.

2743
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:56,500
Do it.

2744
02:18:56,500 --> 02:18:57,500
Do it.

2745
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:58,500
Do it.

2746
02:18:58,500 --> 02:18:59,500
Do it.

2747
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:03,500
We brought it back to slopp in the final inning.

2748
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:05,500
Okay.

2749
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:06,500
Meditation over.

2750
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:07,500
Back to reality.

2751
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:13,500
When I snap my fingers, you will come back to reality and stop imagining the duck.

2752
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:15,500
But I can't.

2753
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:16,500
Oh, but I didn't snap him.

2754
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:17,500
I'm not going to snap him.

2755
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:19,500
Oh no.

2756
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:20,500
Fuck you.

2757
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:21,500
It's just on loop.

2758
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:25,500
You're trapped in the mind dungeon.

2759
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:32,700
Next voicemail is called hang on. You gotta get back to the old speed pipe.

2760
02:19:32,700 --> 02:19:37,180
I just gotta put the thing on there. There we go. What? It's the Among Us twerk. Oh,

2761
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:45,740
yes. That's the one. That's the one. Next voicemail is called, oh man, look at them go.

2762
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:55,180
Woo. Next voicemail is called member grpj. You know? I do. Well, you know what?

2763
02:19:55,180 --> 02:20:05,260
I'll answer this. Okay, three, two, one, go. Do you both have green screens? Because if you

2764
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:12,060
both have green screens, you guys could record an episode of grpj. A good reason to play

2765
02:20:12,940 --> 02:20:20,860
grpj. I'm sure a lot of people favorite ever PCP content.

2766
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:29,260
You know, funny, I guess, yeah, two people with green screens could

2767
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:34,060
do it, record themselves separately and then pretend they were in the same room.

2768
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:43,180
Yeah. I actually did just randomly decide to rewatch or listen to in the background. The,

2769
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:47,820
yeah, the Lisa grpj that I was on that we did at Radcon too.

2770
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:56,700
There was a pretty good video. I guess the one thing that I spend most of the time,

2771
02:20:56,700 --> 02:21:00,220
I take every opportunity that I can to just gush about how much I love

2772
02:21:00,220 --> 02:21:05,100
the story. We tried breaking down the topics into like, we talk about the graphics, we talk

2773
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:08,860
about the gameplay, we talk about the story, but I keep coming back to how much I love Brad

2774
02:21:08,860 --> 02:21:15,740
as a character and just the arc. And I can't, I just can't resist, I can't help myself, but just

2775
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:22,860
keep going back to that well. I mean, it is really good. What a great game. That's a pretty good

2776
02:21:22,860 --> 02:21:28,220
video. That's a good, that's a good, that's a good video. Check that out on the Hippocrite channel

2777
02:21:28,220 --> 02:21:36,140
if you haven't seen it viewers. Yeah, check out all of my gaming reviewer backlog if you've never

2778
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:43,020
heard of that somehow. Imagine being like someone who found the PCP in like 2020 and like has never

2779
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:50,220
heard of Hippocrite. That, I mean, it's not that unlikely. There might be like super popular,

2780
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:55,100
except for a few videos that got like, like hundreds of thousands of views, which is pretty epic.

2781
02:21:55,100 --> 02:22:02,140
Yeah. The old, I don't know, I feel like you'd have to, I feel like there's not that many like

2782
02:22:02,140 --> 02:22:10,140
new PCP heads. Might be a handful though. That's definitely a few. Yeah. Okay, next one. I think

2783
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:21,340
this is the last one is NNN week zero. Three, two, one, go. Damn it. I'm sorry, everyone. I feel like

2784
02:22:21,340 --> 02:22:26,460
I let you all down. I thought I was free of temptation, but then Nate made an announcement

2785
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:41,580
in the pod to use cord. And I was back in. Oh, no, no, no, no, yes, watch. No. It was so close.

2786
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:49,900
I only had only had two days left. This is this is why this is why I have to carry the torch. You

2787
02:22:49,900 --> 02:22:55,340
couldn't, you couldn't, this is why you shouldn't end the podcast. This is why you were, this is why

2788
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:59,900
you don't understand. This is why for almost a year, you pretended that the podcast wasn't

2789
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:05,180
canceled. It was so that this guy wouldn't kill himself during No Nate November this month.

2790
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:13,500
I did the ultimate No Nate November and canceled the podcast. Yeah, true. From now on. I was sticking

2791
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:19,900
too hard to it. You were like, man, No Nate November has so many physical, mental, and

2792
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:26,940
spiritual benefits. Why don't I, why don't I do this all year long? Hmm. It's the, it's the only way.

2793
02:23:27,580 --> 02:23:32,300
The only solution. The only way. No more podcasts. Pull that plug. Gotta shoot that bridge. Pull that

2794
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:38,860
trigger. Yeah. You know, death is the ultimate No Nate November. When do you think about it?

2795
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:44,140
No more. Never see Nate again. No more anything again. No more Nate.

2796
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:55,260
Okay. That's all the voicemails. Yeah, that's it. We did it. Hooray. Hooray.

2797
02:23:58,380 --> 02:24:05,420
I will briefly mention that my secret project is I mentioned on Twitter weeks away, weeks away. So

2798
02:24:05,420 --> 02:24:11,660
maybe second or third week of December, it should be something I can say, hey, look at this.

2799
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:15,980
Wow, really? I definitely want it. I definitely want it out before the end of the year. And I

2800
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:23,180
think it's possible. I wish I could say that mine was that Phantom's Revenge was two weeks away,

2801
02:24:23,180 --> 02:24:30,700
but I just, yeah. I don't know how close you are, but you have been talking occasionally about like,

2802
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:38,140
oh, it's going to take longer than I thought. Again. I always, it has felt like it's been almost

2803
02:24:38,140 --> 02:24:45,020
done for like eight months. So I don't know. Yeah. I mean, I might be wrong as well, but

2804
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:53,420
hopefully not. Hopefully not. Fuck. And then I can finally pretend, stop pretending not to know

2805
02:24:53,420 --> 02:25:02,700
what it is. Yes. I have seen very little of it. So I'm, it's mostly theoretical in my mind. I've seen

2806
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:10,700
a little bit. Yeah. But yeah, that's very hype. That's very exciting. I can't wait. Looking forward

2807
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:18,860
to it. Send us a message at speakpipe.com slash PCB voicemail if you want to potentially get

2808
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:24,540
a send to the voice grail or get thrown in voice jail depending on how well you perform.

2809
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:32,220
And patron us. Give us money at patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

2810
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:40,060
Not for any reason, just because it's the right thing to do. Yes. Anything else?

2811
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:47,900
Nope. I think that's it. And you know what? We, I'm in good time. I'm in good time to make it over

2812
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:58,460
to cook my brussel sprouts. Yeah. That, that time to spare. Okay. See you next week, everybody.

2813
02:25:58,460 --> 02:26:08,460
Thanks for listening and stay out of trouble. Bye. Bye. You can stay in trouble. Don't worry about

2814
02:26:08,460 --> 02:26:10,540
them.
