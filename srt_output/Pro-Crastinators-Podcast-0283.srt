00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I guess this is the start of the podcast. Hello. I think it's another one of these. It's another drum roll please.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Solo Bencast. Welcome everyone to the Pro Crastinators Podcast. No guests this week. I didn't set anything up. Gibb was gonna show up, I think, but she has, I guess, internet outages.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Her internet provider is just black out right now or something. Tom is unavailable, both scheduling-wise, but mostly emotionally.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's just me, I guess. I'm the only one that showed up again, so we got another one of these. And this time it's not even funny. It's not even noteworthy.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Bencast 2. They did this gimmick already. What a fucking joke. So, for your benefit and mine, I will do you the mercy of just getting this dang thing over with.

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm just ripping the Band-Aid off, so we can all just get on with our day. We can get in, get out, say we did it, fulfill our mutual contractual obligations, and be on our way.

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Anything else to ham and haw about before I get down to business? Do I even have any business? No. I didn't do much this week. I have been continuing to work on The Lord of Ghosts' comic.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, some. I was. It was derailed. It was derailed a bit. I think last week- I feel like I always say this, but I hope I'm not repeating myself because one week just blends right into the other. Time is just a flat circle.

10
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think last week I said I was worried about my kidney. I was worried about back pain. So, I think it was this week, so I think this week I went to the doctor. I scheduled a doctor's appointment.

11
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Right? That was this week. That didn't happen last week, right? I wasn't telling the oblivion fall that, oh, the time I went to the doctor, right?

12
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No. No. Surely. Surely not. Wait a second. I can find out.

13
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, I did. No, I fucking did. It was October 1st. It was October 1st that I went and got the urine test. Time is a flat circle. Okay, I already talked about it. Good thing I checked. Sorry.

14
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Next item on the agenda. There is none. I hung out with Kauff from RFCK, came to visit and hang out at the Munchie Kazi house. That was pretty fun. It was very hung over.

15
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, and that actually leads me to another item. This was separate. This was way more hung over than I was from Kazi's birthday, which was what I was complaining about last week.

16
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It was so hung over after one particular day of that, that the next day I found I was too sick to work. I couldn't focus on drawing Lord of Ghosts, which led me to lose my momentum and spend the next two or three days just being like, eh, I don't want to do it.

17
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I kind of just didn't do anything. And that was kind of my week. Not entirely, but somewhat. So, you know, big shit head energy on me this week. A lot of poo. No, egg on my face. Shit head. Egg on your face. Not shit on my face, but also that.

18
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Lord of Ghosts is about half done. I think it was probably almost the same as last week. I probably only spent like two days, one and change days working on it this week. I think I can get it done this week, and that'll be pretty cool.

19
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you want to know more about the stuff I've been doing, if you want to hear me ramble about the shit that I do, that I have been up to, you can always go to patreon.com.

20
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've been saying where I just released a catch up episode of the bent of the, I guess I call it the Q&A, the Q&A slash update podcast, I guess is what I call it, in which I accept questions, which I answered, but I also give a general update about just what's going on in my life.

21
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And I had not done that for a while. I had let several months go by. Usually I keep that to about 45 minutes under an hour, so this time I did a big catch up one where I talked about moving and I talked about, I don't even remember.

22
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I had a whole list of things that I had to go over my calendar. I had to go through emails and stuff and been like, what was I talking, what was I doing, what was I even doing like three months ago?

23
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was like, oh, some of it was different, some of it was just frustratingly the same.

24
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The only other thing I can think of that is of note at all that I did this week is that Kazzy got a, what do you call it, got their submission, except for like, okay, I don't know if many cities do this, but probably some do, but in Boston there are these electrical boxes that stick out of the sidewalk,

25
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and a lot of them have like paintings on it, like from local artists. Well, Kazzy got a design accepted to be on one of those, and they have started the process of drawing it on, so I went with them one day.

26
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They had a whole multi-day project, but I went with them yesterday and we hung out and it was already primed. They had to prime it with primer, and then the paint is going on after that.

27
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But before the final paint layer goes on, we had to lay, we had to pencil line lay in like a grid on it, so Kazzy could, you know, accurately transfer the design onto the thing.

28
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So we spent like the afternoon like drawing the pencil lines in and like measuring very carefully and like getting it all perfect and then they went and did a pencil sketch over it and then that was pretty fun.

29
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So that should be funny, that should be funny and cool.

30
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I would love to keep rambling, I would love to keep rambling, but I have less than usual to say about my week this week.

31
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I have been very, I just kind of bled into the last week and I've been very, very, I've been alternatingly sick or depressed or lazy for much of it, so, you know, they can't all be winners, they can't all be winners, but that's life.

32
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And so, oh, if you don't like it, what are you, anti-life? What do you hate life?

33
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can say that about literally anything, literally anything that anyone ever criticizes you for. Here's the hot tip, here's the hot tip.

34
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Anytime anyone criticizes you for anything, you just go, well, that's life, man. What do you hate life? Easy.

35
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's the new, it's the new I'm just being cool. I did it. Iconic.

36
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
God, what am I, like five minutes in? Yeah, like seven minutes into this thing and it's already time to go to voicemails, baby.

37
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You should have, life should have come at me faster this week, I'm sorry.

38
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Life should have given me more, more shit to talk about on the podcast, but it didn't. You just got to deal with that.

39
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let me get, let me get, let me get my folder. Here we go.

40
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It starts with number three, seven, four. It's annoying because, yeah, they have the, I save them in order, but sometimes the download times are different.

41
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So the times that my computer organizes them into are sometimes different by time downloaded, as opposed to in, they're not quite in numerical order.

42
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And sometimes they get, sometimes they get, sometimes they get a little mixed up, sometimes they get just a little bit mixed up with that.

43
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So anyway, this first one is called three, seven, four, six.

44
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ah, found it. It is called Master Time Thief Speculative.

45
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't know what that means, but here we go. Three, two, one, go.

46
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What if we could be sneaky time criminals, right? What if we went into the future, which is right now?

47
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And we saw something, a media that we liked, maybe a video or a song or a whole video game.

48
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And we just took it back into the past and we just pretended like we made it. We made it our own.

49
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And whoa, what would you take? What would you do? You sneaky time criminals? What would you make money off of it?

50
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Or would you be famous for your effort and your hard work and your vision that wasn't really yours? Oh, what would you do?

51
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, I guess, yeah, I wouldn't care about being famous for like, oh, he wrote like a classical masterpiece or something, or he made a great work of art.

52
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I wouldn't care about that if like, I didn't really make it because like, okay, I'm famous for something that I didn't actually do.

53
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So like, what do I feel good about that? Not really.

54
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So I guess, I guess what I would do is I would try to find the boring answer.

55
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I think I would just try to probably bring back like scientific advancements and just things that like would generally be like good for humanity.

56
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think I would just bring them back and then, you know, I go into the future and I bring back, you know, I mean, bring back the cure for AIDS or whatever.

57
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I bring back the cure for homosexuality, aka Chris Chan's blood from the future, right?

58
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I bring that back and, you know, I can't feel like, oh yeah, I invented the cure for AIDS or whatever.

59
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But I can be like, well, I did a genuine good to humanity by bringing it back and giving it to people and giving access to it before they would have otherwise had it.

60
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And then I could, and then I could feel genuinely like I did something worth, worth, uh, uh, adulating.

61
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So yeah, sorry if it's a boring answer.

62
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Boring answer is I would do good for my fellow man.

63
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Sorry, it sucks.

64
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I wouldn't care about bringing back like artistic masterpieces.

65
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Who fucking cares?

66
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They'll be appreciated in their own time.

67
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So I don't feel like, I don't think the world would be any better if I went and, like, the next, the next, a blockbuster movie that comes out, you know, 15 years from now.

68
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And I bring it back so everyone now can appreciate it.

69
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't think that, I don't think the world is any better for that.

70
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Um, uh, if anything, they got to enjoy, maybe they got to enjoy it earlier, but like, you know, they would have just enjoyed it later.

71
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Like, it's a net, net neutral.

72
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Um, next one is master, no, that's not it.

73
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Uh, next one is a heartfelt plea.

74
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Let me find it here.

75
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes, three, seven, four, seven, a heartfelt plea.

76
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Three, two, one, go.

77
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Remember guys, when the podcast is angry Jesse, man?

78
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Angry yellow? It ain't yellow, he said.

79
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
After those days.

81
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Fucking, fucking Jesse.

82
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Uh, I, I just, uh, you know, not, not to be too, not to be, not to be too, not to speak ill of the dead or anything, but one thing that always really bugged me was how, yeah, he would,

83
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
there's, there's basically no denying, but yeah, he would definitely put on this exaggerated ang, angry character.

84
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He would put on this, this ranting, raving, shouting persona.

85
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Haha, funny man, funny angry man.

86
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And then in the same, in the same breath, be like, oh, everyone, everyone talks about me like I'm angry or something.

87
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody really understands me.

88
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm not, I'm not really like that.

89
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And like, it's like, yeah, obviously you're not, but also like that many times that is the character you project and like, what, what do you think is going to happen?

90
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What do you, what do you think they're going to know you as if that's the fucking character you project?

91
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Uh, a little, he's a little bit like, I don't know.

92
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Uh, funny shit.

93
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Uh, next one is, oh my God, it's a fucking Imgir post.

94
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
God help us. Here we go.

95
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Dude, if you like, okay, it's cheesy, it's, I guess this is cheesy Manfredo, not depicted in his classical, his classical style.

96
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Uh, dude, if you like his classical clown, Sona, if you like Marvel and Star Wars, you'll love Villainverse.

97
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The, why is it 799.95, the price is a metaphor for capitalism.

98
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Sometimes a metaphor is just distinct indistinguishable from the real thing.

99
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And then me over there in the background selling, is this supposed to be me at mice selling my copies of the Vapors books with Endless War in the background?

100
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I mean, it's pretty much exactly how it was only it was outdoors.

101
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So, I mean, I don't know, good drawing, I mean, I guess it's just true.

102
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I guess this drawing is just true, and I can only appreciate, I can only appreciate the great truth of our world that it expresses.

103
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Uh, very nice.

104
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Next one is called Ben Saint is cooler than Radcon.

105
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Three, three, seven, four, nine.

106
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Uh, here we go.

107
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Ben Saint is cooler than Radcon.

108
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, we'll just see about that, won't we?

109
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Three, two, one, go.

110
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Ben Gibb, Tom Commwin.

111
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Ben Gibb, Tom Commwin?

112
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Ben Gibb, Tom Commwin.

113
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Ben Gibb, Tom Commwin.

114
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Ben.

115
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Gives.

116
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Tom.

117
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Communism.

118
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Will.

119
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Win.

120
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, I see.

121
00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You're saying that I need to distribute my wealth to Tom in order to create a classless moneyless society in which the dictatorship of the proletariat dismantles the bourgeoisie.

122
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
the bourgeoisie. Well, well, isn't that so easy for you to say? Why don't you give all

123
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,920
your money away, Mr. Communist man? Capitalism? Socialism is with no house. Well, well, you

124
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:24,640
Rube, I have, I have, I know how to handle these objections, and I can, by simply ignoring

125
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:35,440
them. Not today, Satan. Next one is called, oh dear, next one is called Lollicon Enjoyer.

126
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,560
Okay. Three, two, one, go.

127
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,920
Kids are automatically more interesting than anyone your own age.

128
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,200
No. What do you mean by that?

129
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,120
Wait, who is that saying, what do you mean by that? Who said, what do you mean by that?

130
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,960
Um, kids, kids are automatically more interesting than anyone your own age.

131
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,680
I mean, that's, I mean, it's a truly bizarre thing to say.

132
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,080
It's truly bizarre thing to say, but I'm sure if challenged on it, she would just say,

133
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,840
I was kidding, or it was satire, or some stupid shit. So like, why, why even think about it for

134
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,600
even a second? Why even, why even think about what she means when like, the answer is nothing.

135
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:33,680
The answer is always nothing. Next, next one is called, it's Janess. Okay. I gotta find three,

136
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,400
seven, five, one. Here we go. Three, two, one, go.

137
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,000
Isn't it great how all the radcon forwards are nearly out? This gives me so much hope for

138
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,880
radcon five, at least late 2022. Speaking of which, I mean, I have a couple of stretch goal

139
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,640
ideas for the eventual kickstarter. I'll tell you how to stream for those who likes Ben St.

140
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:08,400
Cineboy. Also, those who pay a certain amount gets to vote on a poll for which games the PCP

141
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,040
will stream at radcon five. These were the ideas I thought of so far. Is that anything else you

142
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,880
would suggest? Post these down in the comments, and I'll click a like on them.

143
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,800
Yeah, right. I've said this before, a hypothetical radcon five, which would

144
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,400
definitely, which would certainly look a lot different than previous radcons, obviously.

145
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:41,040
No plans at the moment for one, but you never know. The last,

146
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:49,200
oh, I guess I should mention, I might as well mention one last time that the road to radcon

147
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,920
books, I think orders have pretty much stopped trickling in. I think I'm ready to be like,

148
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,160
okay, done. That's all I'm gonna get, and I'm gonna send it off to Prince. So probably this

149
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,520
week, maybe like this weekend as this comes out. So like, if you're hearing this, it's not

150
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,720
quite too late, but it's all, it's gonna be too late, like tomorrow.

151
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,520
Some fucking construction work's going on. Oh, yeah, I guess that's, yeah, there's been this,

152
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,400
all this week, there's been a backhoe fucking like digging up the parking lot behind my house,

153
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,320
my fucking rat infest, rat and raccoon infested parking lot.

154
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,320
It's, you know, it's been a bit annoying, it's been a bit annoying, but I haven't been spending

155
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,680
that much time in the house, or as much as usual, so it hasn't been a big deal. Not that it would

156
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,160
be a big deal anyway, it's just a little, it's just a little noise, whatever. Anyway, road to

157
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,240
radcon, I'm making the order, I'm calling it. So if you want that, it's really now or never,

158
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,680
and then I will, I will be, I will maybe be making the final print probably like

159
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:03,200
tomorrow after you hear this, so. But yes, it's good that that's done. I've said this before,

160
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,920
the last thing to do is the dogen, which is Being Drawn by Edward D. Al at Wolfheart on Twitter.

161
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,080
And it is in the process of being drawn, I think it should be done this month.

162
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,760
I mean, some, I don't even, might even not even be that far away. I haven't, I haven't talked to him

163
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,920
in a little bit about it. I, I hope he's been working diligently. And the last thing is the OVA,

164
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,840
which I believe Nate will be editing. I hope, I hope Nate will get around to editing shortly

165
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:43,600
after that. And I think that's it. Oh, in the music video, the Brad going, there was a Brad

166
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:51,200
going has music video to go with the, the song. And I think that's it. I might be forgetting

167
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,080
something. I don't think I am. Anyway, I don't know. Yes. At a hypothetical ride con three.

168
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,720
Yeah, we would probably do many of the same things before where, you know, you, if you're,

169
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,000
if you're, if you pledge, you got to pick the game we stream, you know, that's, that's just a

170
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,600
pretty classic, pretty classic stream move. I hope you can hear the voices of these people,

171
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,000
these fucking, these, these darn, these, these working blue collar workers out my fucking window.

172
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,600
But they're, but they're South Boston accents. God help us all.

173
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,440
I mean, yeah, I don't have any, I don't really have any specific ideas.

174
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,600
Uh, they would probably be everything we did at previous ones. We would try to do all the

175
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,600
same things that we could with, you know, whoever ended up going being there. And maybe we would

176
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
think of some more that would go with any theme we thought of, but I don't know what the theme would

177
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,320
be. So I'm sorry, I don't, I don't really have any ideas, but we would think we would think of

178
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:06,800
something. LeMau. Next voicemail is called the Ballad of Ben St and Trixie. Where, where was I?

179
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,080
It's, it's, it's three, seven, five, two, found it. Okay.

180
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,120
Ballad of Ben St and Trixie. Well, let's hear it. Three, two, one, go.

181
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,240
Ben St.

182
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,120
I really think that she and I could be friends, but by the way, I think you're attracted.

183
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,680
Yes. Ben losing me now. Here's his room. We're going to be doing some thing, things together,

184
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:40,000
you know what I'm saying? You are a freaking freak and a moron, a low IQ subhuman troglodyte.

185
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,520
I hate you.

186
00:23:50,480 --> 00:24:02,000
I mean, what can I say, but the funny, funny, funny shit.

187
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,160
I'll briefly mention a funny, funny dumb shit that Trixie did this week. Number one,

188
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,600
making that tweet about, because Chappelle made that comedy special where he says he's on Team

189
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:27,360
Turf, a fucking Trixie making the, the genius tweet of like, I haven't seen it, but Netflix

190
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,040
better keep it up because it would be censorship if like the most famous comedian in the fucking

191
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:40,000
world didn't get his Netflix special. I haven't seen it, but I have free speech and you gotta

192
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,720
keep it up, even if it hates me, even if it's hate speech against me. That's just how bad I

193
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,240
want people to fucking like me and think that I'm not one of those bad trans. I mean, that's how

194
00:24:52,240 --> 00:25:02,400
much I believe in free speech. Solidarity. Next, wait, and the other one was getting engaged

195
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,480
to Bird, lol. I saw they had their fucking like trashy got proposed at a concert with like a

196
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,200
ring pop ring. Very funny, very cute. I think I remember the last time, remember the last time

197
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:30,320
she got engaged? Lamal. Here we go again. I feel like the comedy is, is clear and I don't have to

198
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:38,720
explain any further. Next one is called, oh god, we're on a, we're on a kick, I guess. It's called

199
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,320
A Message From Riley. Here we go. Three, two, one, go.

200
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,680
Man, that fucking shit with the hanging chads sucks. That shit with the fucking man.

201
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:09,280
I, I know it's maybe a little, you know, it's a bit maybe, sorry if this is a, if this is a democrat

202
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:18,480
thing to say, but we probably would be in a much, much better position as a society if, if fucking,

203
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,800
if they had just done the recounts as they should have done and just, you know,

204
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,720
George and, and Al Gore had been the duly elected president as he legitimately should have been,

205
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,920
but republicans stole it because they just have no honor or fair play or they will, they will just

206
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:46,880
cheat to get whatever they want and like half the time it works. Next voicemail is called and then

207
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,760
the, and then the, and then 9-11 happened and then like the whole, like we probably, we maybe just

208
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,240
wouldn't even have had the Afghan, I mean maybe we would have, wouldn't have been the same. It wouldn't

209
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,920
have gone down like it did genuinely. Also, also climate's really bad right now and Gore was big

210
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:09,840
on climate. So like, you know, I'm pretty, pretty undeniable, pretty undeniable failure there on

211
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:19,200
the part of American quote unquote democracy. Anyway, next voicemail is called, well it's also

212
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:28,000
called Riley, so let's, let's just get into that, shall we? There it is. Three, two, one, go.

213
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,280
What's up, fuckers? It's me, Riley. I love you. And now that the dust has settled, I think we can

214
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:44,160
all agree that trial of the golden niche is the greatest mixtape of all time. It's me, Riley.

215
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,720
Thank you. Have I ever, have I mentioned before that Riley you sound so much like,

216
00:27:52,080 --> 00:28:00,240
you sound so much like, uh, like, uh, like, uh, Colt Corona. You sound who's Colt, Colt Corona,

217
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:08,320
who's fate, by the way, you will learn in the pages of Road to Radcon available,

218
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,040
still available for a very limited time from me. You gotta send me Ben St. Money and then

219
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,920
you get the book. You gotta fucking message me on Discord or Twitter DMs or whatever. It's the only

220
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:32,800
way. It's the only way. Um, next voicemail is called, um, only new PCP is able to do this.

221
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,840
I'm gonna upload it here. One, one weird trick discovered by the PCP. Podcasters hate them.

222
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Okay. Only new PCP is able to do this. Three, two, one, go.

223
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,840
PCP Wandering Sun. There's a manga for it and there's a complete anime for it. This is capable

224
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:01,120
of the future. Make the doubters in shambles, in shambles. PCP Wandering Suncast. Wandering Sun

225
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:10,480
Oh, I'm, I've heard of this. Is it, is it a trans thing? Is it about, like, is it about, like, a

226
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:19,360
gender exploration? Uh, what's the, what's the word I'm looking for? Character study? Uh, maybe, uh,

227
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:28,320
Bill Dung's Roman, perhaps? Uh, yeah, looking, looking briefly at the Wikipedia page. Yes,

228
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:36,480
it is what I'm thinking of. Um, I guess, I guess I could read it. I probably won't.

229
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:46,640
But anything's possible. Uh, next voicemail is called, why would I read manga? Why would I read

230
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,520
manga when I can, when I could be churning credit cards? Give me a fucking break. Um,

231
00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:01,840
uh, sorry, shit, shit, shit, fuck, shit, fuck, I lost my place. Uh, next one is called,

232
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,800
oh, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a fast upload.

233
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,960
Oh, here it is. It's called What Happened to the PCP Wiki, and I feel like I know what it's gonna

234
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,560
say, but let's listen to it anyway. Three, two, one, go. My guess is that the guy managing it

235
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,760
looked at all the pages and went, oh no, it will take weeks of work to retcon all the pronouns

236
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,120
and dead names. And I am a fat American who sits on his couch and smokes weed all day. I can't be

237
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,560
doing work. So he private it and made it a secret club for his discord friends. The same thing will

238
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:42,080
happen to the PCP episodes after Twitter pressure's been enough. Save them onto your hard drive if

239
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:52,240
you value them. Um, I don't know if that is specifically the reason. I mean, I, I know you,

240
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:01,600
it's possible. It's, it's possible that there was some, okay, I say, I say this, I say this as a

241
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:09,840
specific insult to the kind of person who is so brain dead that like they still like or respect

242
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,720
Trixie in any way at all. Like people like that are like, oh, you can't say Digi. That's a dead name.

243
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,760
You can't, you can't say Digi. Digi is a dead name. Uh, no, first of all, no, it's a screen name.

244
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:33,280
Second of all, shut the hell up. Shut the fuck up. Uh, uh, uh, I, while, while in a, while in a

245
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:39,040
perfect world, while in a perfect world, I feel like, yeah, sure, you go through the whole PCP

246
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,440
wiki, you change all the pronouns and you update it. But like if the PCP is not wiki, wiki was not

247
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,880
updating anymore. Okay, that's in, in, it may, it may have been a pronoun thing, but it may not

248
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,760
have been. And I don't know if it was, I still don't agree with it because I either way, whether

249
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,600
that was the thing or not, if it's not updating anymore, this is, this is, this is so stupid.

250
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,080
The idea that like, wait a minute, the thing, the thing changed. The thing is not how it was then.

251
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,680
So my record of how it was then must be destroyed because it is too, because it no longer reflect,

252
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:26,800
reflects present day truth. Like, what do you think a fucking record is, dude? What, what,

253
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,680
what do you do any, what do you write anything for? What do you, what do you record anything for?

254
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,200
If like, the moment, the moment that the circumstances change, you're like, I must destroy

255
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:45,360
the record of how it was. The record must be expunged. Like, deranged, deranged. Oh, geez.

256
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,880
Hello. Oh, wait, I gotta, I gotta filter your voice through my, through my headsets.

257
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,920
Um, well, geez, I'm like, I'm like halfway through voicemails, dude.

258
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, uh, well, okay, I guess I'll go then.

259
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,600
I mean, you, yeah, I guess you, I mean, you don't have to. No, you know what's

260
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,920
day, I mean, you're here. Um, uh, here we go, changing to speaker output, yeah.

261
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,480
Uh, how many more do I, do I even have? Um, I have,

262
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:27,040
I have like, I have like, I have like 10 left. So, well, all right, pause, pause on the voicemails,

263
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,920
pause on the voicemails. Gib, what's up?

264
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:39,600
Uh, well, I don't know. Uh, the fucking, all right, the reason I'm an hour late,

265
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,320
55 minutes late is because the internet was fucked and that's, it made me mad,

266
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,000
but it's just sort of working now for no reason. I didn't do anything.

267
00:33:51,840 --> 00:34:02,480
So that's nice. Uh, well, uh, the, the procrastinators podcast, patreon.com

268
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:09,840
slash the procrastinators. Uh, we have a bonus episode. Oh, I've set, uh, I'm stupid. I said the

269
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,240
bonus episode was going to be out by the time the last one came out and then I didn't, I forgot to,

270
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,440
but I forgot to post it. Uh, but I will post it. I will post it like two day. I will post it two

271
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,240
day. So it should be fine. It should be fine. Don't be mad at me. Nobody get mad.

272
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,400
Uh, people have been sending me messages being like, Ben, please put the, the audio on,

273
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,360
on Spotify and like, I don't know what to tell those people because I don't do that.

274
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,000
I don't, I don't know how Spotify works or, or like Apple podcasts or whatever.

275
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,440
I don't do anything except, I don't even usually upload it to YouTube myself. Occasionally I do,

276
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,280
but yeah, I don't, I don't even know how to use those other ones. Uh, but like, I think we're

277
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,520
missing, I think we're missing a few on like Spotify. Uh, but I don't, I don't have, I don't

278
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,120
know what to do about that. Anyway. Okay. So internet, internet problems.

279
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,240
Yeah. Internet problems. I mean, it's just, who cares to talk about that? It's just one of those

280
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,880
things that sucks for everyone all the time. Um, but what I wanted to talk about was my

281
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:24,080
Clarissa Gunsmoke comic is out. I think I talked about it being out, uh, but before it was out,

282
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,680
but now it is. And now the next chapter will probably be out by the time you're listening

283
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:35,120
to this as well. Give and take dot site. Wait, pinned tweet. How many chapters did you make for

284
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:42,160
the original run, the original, uh, uh, Tezuka challenge? For the, for the Tezuka challenge,

285
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:49,680
uh, because it was a hashtag Tezuka challenge on YouTube. Um, fucking 50 pages was the maximum.

286
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,560
And so I sketched out the story that I had written for it and it came out to be more than 50

287
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,000
pages. So I was like, okay, I'll cut it off at this point here, send that in. I drew all 50 pages

288
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,680
and I'm currently shading and like neatening and tidying them up to release. Uh, in terms of like

289
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,440
how many chapters that is, I guess it varies because I wasn't thinking of them as in terms of

290
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,440
chapters. I was thinking of it in terms of a one shot submission. So I don't really know. The

291
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,640
chapters will be at different lengths. This new one is like 13 pages, but the one after is 17 pages.

292
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:38,160
13? Just sort of, sort of choosing the points. How long was the first one? 20. Okay, okay, okay, I got it.

293
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,960
And then, and then on the, uh, the Photoshop file with all the sketches on it, there are still

294
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:56,960
yet as of un-drawn 32 or 36 new pages that I could do, which I didn't submit to the Tezuka

295
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,440
thing. So nobody has seen those except unless you watched the live streams where it happened live.

296
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,480
But yeah, that's like, that's like another three chapters or another two chapters or something.

297
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,160
Oh my, so some of this, some of it is new. It has not been shown before.

298
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:24,880
Yes, if you had gone to the Art Street website where I had submitted the original Japanese

299
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:35,360
version, uh, that's 50 pages. If you paid the 700, 420 yen and there's the 50, but then there's

300
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,840
beyond that 36 other pages, and that's not, it's still not done after that. I would still

301
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,120
need to sketch the rest of the story. So there's plenty. There's plenty of Clarissa.

302
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,360
Yes, I, I have not yet, I have not yet gone and peeped it, but I will.

303
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,200
You fucker.

304
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,480
Yeah, yeah, I am. I'm a big fucker. I am a big fuck.

305
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,480
Um, yeah, I think I should really, I think I mentioned this before. I will, I will probably be,

306
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,760
I should get around to posting those, those vaporettes from Vapors 2 on my Patreon. Maybe

307
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,040
I'll do that today as well. I have a, I have a bunch of like housekeeping things to do and

308
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,200
yeah, posting the bonus episode is one. Yeah, I was thinking about this yesterday, posting the

309
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:31,280
vapors, the vaporettes on Patreon is another one. I realized that my taxes are due. I forgot

310
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:38,720
that I extended my tax deadline to October 15th and now, now I have to like scramble to do my

311
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,320
taxes really quick and I think it will all have been for naught because I will probably just be like,

312
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:52,400
well, I don't have anything to change. I'll just click done and be like, well, why didn't I just do it?

313
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,320
Why didn't I just do it before? But oh, but oh well.

314
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,360
That's the, that's the choice I made. But I gotta fucking, I gotta fucking go over all my finances

315
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:09,440
one more time and, and, and do all the numbers and be like, that's a business expense. That's a

316
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,080
business expense. New bedsheets, that's a business expense. That's a paddling. That's a paddling.

317
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,400
Uh, I gotta do that this week.

318
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,560
Speaking of finances, I am, I was like, I was, oh, the Lord of Ghost plushes.

319
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,080
They said they're ready to ship. Please give us the money.

320
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,200
Give. That's what I did.

321
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,560
Give. Okay. I just remembered.

322
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,440
Mm hmm.

323
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,760
Sorry. Sorry if I interrupted, but I just remembered.

324
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,520
Someone, I think it was, I think it was Steve that proposed this to me the other day and it's

325
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:58,320
actually sounded like it might be a great idea. And it was that like, okay, you said that like,

326
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:05,520
your, you said that your shipping cost, your shipping costs to America are like insane.

327
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:13,760
So what if, what if you sent, what if you sent, had some of the original like, like product

328
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,560
just sent directly to me and like, I would handle, I, and like, I would do, and like, I could do

329
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:27,440
like postage to America, to American backers. I would want, I would want like some nominal fee,

330
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,760
like for, for like to send them out, but like, it might, if it, if it might save like $5 a package

331
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,160
on postage, maybe you could pay me like, like $2 or $3 for one that I send. And then it would

332
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:47,280
save, it would save money overall. That might work aside for, except for the fact that like,

333
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,680
everyone who's getting a plush is also getting the comics and some other stuff.

334
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,520
Yeah. So I would need to get the comics all sent to me.

335
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,400
And would you need to do that?

336
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:07,600
Well, I guess I, I, I had it all like planned out my head, like I, for the plush ones, I could get

337
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:14,960
this particular size box and that would be enough for everything. It's also a little late because

338
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:25,600
they're already on their way. I see, I see. Well, okay, think about it. If, if I do, if by doing

339
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,560
something like that, we could save some money. If we could save some money, that would be nice.

340
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm trying to think of how it would work because like, I'll have all of the things.

341
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:42,480
Yeah. And the, if I send them direct, like to send them to you would be to send them to

342
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,040
America anyway. So like, would I really even save anything?

343
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:53,280
Yeah, I guess that's true. I mean, it might, it might cost cheaper to send them all in bulk

344
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,200
to me in one bulk thing, like possibly, I guess I was thinking that like,

345
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,560
like when you, when like the plushes were, were shipped, you could just maybe tell them like,

346
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,760
yeah, just send like, you know, 25% of them to you in the UK. And then the other, like,

347
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,560
however many to meet, just like tell the distributor, like don't send them direct to me,

348
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,920
send like split, split the order between two destiny. And yeah, it probably would cost more

349
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,280
to ship them to me, but probably less overall. I don't know, maybe.

350
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,720
I would have to ask them, I guess. I don't really, I feel like they've got them all in

351
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,520
like a box and they're just sending the box. Think about, think about if any, any money

352
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,040
could be saved this way. And if it could, I'm more than happy to help with it.

353
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,080
It would definitely be good if we had planned it beforehand.

354
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,760
To have like, like a UK and a US base for these things. That would be epic, actually.

355
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,040
I mean, it kind of sounds like, it kind of sounds like maybe we still could,

356
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,040
like if they haven't, if they haven't shipped them yet.

357
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,520
I will ask them, I will email and say, have you shipped them? Because I feel like,

358
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,760
because I sent the second half of the invoice already.

359
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,520
Okay. Okay. So then they, I don't have like a tracking number though, so maybe they haven't.

360
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,920
It's possible. Just, just, I don't know, think about it. So think about it.

361
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,040
Steve just like mentioned that to me the other day and I was like, wait a minute.

362
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,360
It just, it's just crazy enough to work, perhaps. Okay. Well, now I've, now I've,

363
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,800
I've almost forgot about that, but yeah, I'm glad I related to you.

364
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,800
Uh, what were you saying?

365
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,400
Yeah. Yeah. The, so I was thinking, because you've been talking about like credit,

366
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,840
crunchery. Yeah, churning, churning.

367
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,200
Can I get a card? Can I do that? And I'm like, I don't really know how to do it. It's confusing.

368
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,720
Building credit history.

369
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,600
I saw that I could pay them through PayPal and there was like PayPal credit and I'm like,

370
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,560
does that, is that good? Because like building credit,

371
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,360
surely you can transfer credit from a thing to something else. Surely that's just a number,

372
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:22,560
right? I, I don't, I don't know if, if PayPal credit works the exact same way.

373
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,760
It might not. I was assuming it would probably be a little different.

374
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,120
But I was thinking, I have the money to like pay it back immediately. So what's the harm?

375
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:37,200
So I got PayPal credit purchased through and that's like a couple hundred, six hundred

376
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:46,160
pounds. I, I am not, I am not sure, I am not sure if PayPal credit builds it like a, like a credit

377
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:55,200
score history. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure. It's certainly something. So what's, what's,

378
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,480
what's the benefit? What's the benefit of PayPal credit? I don't know. I just,

379
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,920
see the word credit. They see the word credit and they say, you need that if you want to buy a house.

380
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,920
I'm like, dang, that's a, that's a house I could buy in the future. Credit, huh?

381
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,360
PayPal's not a credit card company. I don't know. They are a company though. They are a,

382
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,040
they are a company. They don't have card involved, but they don't have card involved. Gee whiz.

383
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,680
They sure move money around. I don't know. You know what? I have no idea. I have no idea.

384
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,720
I'll, I'll keep you posted on the, what the fuck the point of it is. Keep me posted. Yeah, okay, cool.

385
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,480
Whether I made like a completely, like no, no losses, but no point either. Sort of

386
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:52,320
Purchase. Keep me updated on if your credit score skyrockets. Uh, sure, sure, sure. I have been,

387
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,840
I have been, I have been cash, I have been cashing in my, my benefits. I just cashed in,

388
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:06,160
I just cashed in my, my Citibank 200 reward. I cashed in my, my say, my Capital One 200 reward.

389
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,600
I cashed in my, my other Citibank, no, no. One of my Citibanks I still have to cash in,

390
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:18,400
but I think I've cashed in like 300. Like, no, I've cashed in three of my four $200 rewards.

391
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,800
Uh, I've got like most of a fourth, and now I'm like,

392
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,720
I earned this. I, I were, I, I built this. I built this castle, this sand castle for myself.

393
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,560
You did all of that extra, like, extraneous bullshit with bank stuff.

394
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,360
I've been talking about this for months. I've technically labored over that extra money.

395
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:47,760
I sure did. Probably, probably more than I would have had to labor to make like $800

396
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:56,000
in like, you know, how much was that? How many, okay, $15 an hour, $800 is

397
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,560
53 hours. I'm going to say, I'm going to say, yeah, I probably put in more, more work,

398
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:12,720
more time than that, just on like, well, well, I don't know, because it was spread over such a

399
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:19,200
long time. I don't know if it would add up to be more than 50 hours or maybe, but I don't care.

400
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,440
It's about the satisfaction of a job well done. Do the, do you get credit for the, the churning,

401
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,760
or is that just money you're getting? Like, like the bonuses? The bonuses are just, are just money.

402
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:39,120
The bonuses are just money. I don't, I don't really care about getting credit. Like, I don't,

403
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,880
I don't really care that I like, about like, how much like my credit limit is. Like, I've not,

404
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,880
I don't, I don't use my credit limit. It's just about, it's just about, it's just about the bonuses

405
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,680
for me. It's just about the bonuses and about, and about maintaining my, my, my credit history,

406
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,360
my credit score. That's, that's the, that's, that's what it's all about.

407
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,280
What was, what was I, what was I talking about? I have no idea. Well, oh,

408
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:19,120
I joined so late. Oh, yeah. Doing voicemails, I guess. Do you want to listen to a voicemail?

409
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,000
Uh, well, how long does the PCP, we go in like an hour?

410
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:32,880
About 45 minutes. Wow. Yeah, we might have an under two hour episode this week. Oh my god.

411
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,040
If you, if you can believe it. Uh, well, let's see if there's any, is there any padding in my head

412
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:46,960
I can use? There were, there were no, there were no voicemails yet that like, specifically requested

413
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,320
your, you respond to them or anything. So I don't feel the need to be like, oh, let's go back over

414
00:48:52,320 --> 00:49:00,160
this one with you or anything. Yeah, I don't know. Mostly I've been like, working hard,

415
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:06,480
doing the Clarissa thing, getting distractions out of my brain with cold turkey, and it's all been

416
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,680
going all very nice. And the weekend is like, you know, designated don't work time. So like,

417
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:20,240
based, I've been drawing a whatever tober, which is a drawing of Rui. I've been drawing.

418
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:28,160
I'm a drew, I'm drawing, I'm drawing. I'm drawing. Yes, whatever tober, whatever tober.

419
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:35,440
Whatever tober has been fun. It's just like, it's like a feeling of accomplishment, even though

420
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,400
there is no actual accomplishment. I'm just making an image and posting it.

421
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:49,920
You set yourself a completely arbitrary and like, what's the word? The word is

422
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,640
not negligible, and it's like a trivially easy set of requirements to meet,

423
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,920
and then you meet them and you're like, yeah. Yeah, I'm so fucking whatever.

424
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:13,200
Nice. It's like, while all the people are out there challenging themselves and

425
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,360
testing their limits and learning by doing all of their art techniques, I'm out here making

426
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,920
content on Twitter. And I'm outperforming them every time.

427
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:33,680
These suckers, these suckers. Yeah. You know what they say, quality is the enemy of

428
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:45,520
content. Quantant. Quantant, yes. Crack into another seltzer. Another seltzer over here.

429
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:55,760
Yeah, I don't know. I don't do... I haven't done... I don't do anything. I have never done...

430
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:02,000
I don't think I've ever stuck to a tober challenge or any challenge ever, in fact.

431
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:11,840
I get annoyed by them. Part of the whatever tober is that I haven't completed any of those

432
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:19,920
challenges, those specific challenges. I guess I did the Igmovoa tour did years ago,

433
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:28,560
making a fucking hypocrite video every day. Yeah. That was cool. But a drawing,

434
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,600
Inktober, never bothered with it. I always get bored. I always feel like my...

435
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,280
It feels bad to do a drawing that is not quite as good as the drawing from Friday,

436
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:46,160
two days ago. Oh, you know what? I'm getting bad. I should give up. But if the point is to be whatever,

437
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,400
then it's easier. I just wanted to see if I could actually get to the end.

438
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,280
That's my challenge. Could I stick with such a pointless thing?

439
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,360
Time will tell. Well, damn, I can't...

440
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,280
Shit. I can't believe it's... I can't believe we're 10 days into October already. Fuck. I think I

441
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:21,040
started... I think I started working on The Lord of Ghosts. I switched gears to working on The Lord

442
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:32,800
of Ghosts at the end of... I think maybe on the September 23rd or 24th. It's been almost...

443
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,400
It's been over two weeks. I've only got five pages done.

444
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,360
I mean, they're good-looking pages from what I've seen.

445
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,680
I'm pretty proud of them, especially that last one. That last one took me... I mean, honestly,

446
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,560
it's not even worth... It's not even a brag to say that that last page took me a long time,

447
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:02,320
took me several days of working on it. That just means that I planned it out poorly,

448
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:09,120
and I just didn't... That's a failure of planning on my part. It's not that it's such a masterpiece.

449
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:15,520
I spent days laboring. I mean, I did, but not because it's a masterpiece. Working hard, not smart.

450
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,560
I was working... Yes. Yes. It was working hard, not smart.

451
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:26,720
I can't imagine working on an image or even a comic page for more than a day. I guess that shows

452
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,600
my patience level, why my comics look the way they do.

453
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:44,720
I do have... I think patience is something that I do have. If I were a Naruto,

454
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:55,360
every Naruto has their own little thing. Neji Naruto has that he can see weird shit,

455
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:02,000
and Sakura Naruto has that she's super strong, and Sasuke Naruto has that he's good at everything.

456
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:11,040
Naruto Naruto is that he's got really high chakra limit, and all his abilities are things

457
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:16,640
that you just need a shit ton of raw chakra to do that nobody else can do.

458
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,880
I think patience is one of the things. I have just a shit ton of patience,

459
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,480
and not much else, but I can do things that other people can't do because I'm

460
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,680
just willing to throw any amount of time at doing it, and not care.

461
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,680
Incredible.

462
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:44,320
Yeah, and on the one hand, that's how I got Vapor's One done. That's how I'm getting

463
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:50,880
Phantom's Revenge done, so that's all good. But then on the other hand, on the other hand,

464
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:59,280
you also spend 750 hours playing Noida by the same token, so it's truly a blessing and a curse.

465
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,000
What were you going to say?

466
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,920
I was just wondering if you know how long the Vapor's One took you to draw from beginning

467
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,560
to finished published product.

468
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:16,080
Yeah, I think I spent like six months working on it, which is not very good. It's not a very good

469
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:26,480
rate. I mean, it's only like 40 pages, so I wasn't working like eight hours a day,

470
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:36,160
five days a week on it or anything. But it took me, I think, around six months.

471
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:49,200
Generally, my page draw time tends to hover around. Sometimes a page will be really fast,

472
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,480
and I'll be really lucky and easy, but most of the time, drawing a comic page tends to take me

473
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:06,080
around six to ten hours of actual sitting down and drawing time. Sometimes a page will be very

474
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:12,080
complicated or I'll get stuck on something, and it'll take me much longer, but six to ten

475
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:20,880
hours is pretty average. I'll average it around and say eight. But eight hours, which is not good.

476
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:27,600
That's not a good rate to be making commercial comics work, if I'm being honest.

477
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:37,120
But if it was like eight hours times, I think it's more than 40, but I'll just call it 4045.

478
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:49,760
Okay, that's 360 hours. So if I was working a nine to five job, 40 hours a week would be nine

479
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:56,240
weeks. So that's about nine weeks worth of dedicated nose to the grindstone work.

480
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,280
So that's about three, that would be three, no, two and a half months, two months in change.

481
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,560
But it took me six months to do it, but I wasn't working on it every day,

482
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,760
nine to five or anything. So I guess that's not a complete disaster.

483
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:21,360
I just, I wish I had some of that, that patience, because like,

484
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:28,960
in times when I have forced myself to go over a drawing when I like, I could put it out now.

485
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,600
I was like, no, I should go over it again. I should maybe do another layer, better line art or

486
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:42,880
something. When I do spend the time, the drawings are so much better. This is, which is why I know

487
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,240
like my skill level is higher than it actually appears to people.

488
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:55,200
It's, yeah, I mean, I mean, it takes time to make something look just the way you wanted to.

489
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,880
Yeah, I mean, I think that's why like my pages take so long. It's because I'm like,

490
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:08,160
you know, I'm like, I'm like, I'm redrawing and redrawing and redrawing like a pose until it looks

491
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,520
right or like a hand until it looks like a hand should look or whatever.

492
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,440
Yeah, it just sort of demoralizes me a little bit when it's like, oh, I drew this,

493
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,280
I did the line art. I'm like, this just doesn't look good. I need to delete it. Oh my God,

494
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,680
all that progress, all that time gone, the grade ever closer.

495
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:34,160
Yeah, I think I've gotten, I've gotten more, I've gotten more efficient though, to the point that

496
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:39,840
like if I, you know, if I spent like maybe 10 minutes sketching a hand and then I think it

497
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:45,520
looks wrong, I don't really care that much about, well, I lost the 10 minutes. Eh, well, I lose,

498
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:53,120
I lose, I lost more than that, you know, already this morning, because I like, you know,

499
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:58,880
accidentally put on a YouTube video and like zoned out for an hour watching a blind Castlevania

500
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,280
Symphony of the Night speedrun or whatever. So, so what's another 10 minutes? Ah, fuck it,

501
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,080
you know. Yeah, true, true.

502
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,840
You know, I've already, you know, I've already lost 10 minutes. Oh, I lost an hour because

503
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,080
that panel came out like shit, eh, whatever. I've already lost, you know, 33 years of my life,

504
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:22,240
just totally into the void, nothing to show for it. Eh, what's another hour? You know what I'm saying?

505
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:31,200
Ain't that the truth? It is, it is, it is the truth. You can't escape it.

506
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:42,400
All I wish, all I wish is that my comics will exist, so that before I turn to dust and bones,

507
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,920
hopefully it'll happen. Well, well, it's, it's possible. It's, it's not impossible.

508
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:58,240
It's just not gonna look like Berserk, it's just gonna look like what I draw, but that's okay.

509
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,000
Yeah, but I mean, not, not, most, most things can't look like Berserk.

510
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,920
And that's, and that's, and that's okay. I don't even, I don't even care. I don't even want my

511
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,640
shit to look like Berserk. I would, I would rather, I prefer, I prefer the look of like Scott

512
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:21,600
Pilgrim to the look of Berserk if I'm being, if I'm being honest. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's a taste

513
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:30,320
thing. I just feel like there's a certain sort of feeling reading a Berserk, like double page,

514
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:37,920
beautifully rendered, or whatever you would call it, draw an image of like 200 horsemen.

515
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:45,280
And it's like, oh, it's real, they're real, they're really there. And they're charging into battle.

516
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,760
That's true. So good. That's true. But like, if I were to do the same thing,

517
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,720
I would draw two horses at the front and then a bunch of squiggles to imply horses. And it would

518
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:03,280
be cool, but you wouldn't really feel it quite as much. I mean, Miura, you know, you say that,

519
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:10,000
but like Miura is doing the same thing. Like every manga guy is like, you know, is fudging it a

520
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:17,120
little bit and taking, taking as many shortcuts as they know how to take. Yeah, I mean, Miura didn't

521
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:22,160
take that many. I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure if you I'm sure if you zoomed in real close on the

522
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,400
on like the background horsemen, you'd be like, oh, this guy kind of he's sort of even barely,

523
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,080
like barely has a face or whatever, you know, I think it's it's well, obviously there's some,

524
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,680
but like it's like, if you use a sliding scale of like how much of the horses in this panel are

525
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:42,480
fudged, it would be a lot less than your average person. Most people wouldn't even draw that many

526
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,680
horses. I mean, show the camera like, we don't need to show that many of them that close.

527
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:54,960
It's too much. Well, Miura was too many lines. Miura was, you know, obviously a very, a very

528
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:04,000
detail oriented artist, kind of his thing, I guess. And that's, and that's fine. And that's fine,

529
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
if that's what you're into. If you're, if you're that sick, if I could, if I could make Berserk,

530
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,840
but it's actually one piece, but it's actually Homestuck, but it's actually Scott Pilgrim,

531
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:22,080
then I will have made my comic. Anything less, I disavow. Anything less than I would say,

532
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,840
ah, it sucks, and I would burn it alive. That's not my real, that's not my vision.

533
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:37,440
Spit on it. Spit on it. But aside, that aside, I am very happy with Clarissa so far. It's,

534
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:44,080
it's looking pretty good for what I was, for what, for what, for how quickly I drew it at the time.

535
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,160
I'm not really going over it too much and like redoing bits. There's a few bits where it's like,

536
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:56,400
this looks so bad and it wouldn't take much time to redraw. So I'm like redrawing a face here and

537
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:03,760
there or an arm. But mostly it's how it was. There are some, there are some panels in,

538
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:11,520
there are a few panels in my old comics that like kind of look bad. And like maybe, I think,

539
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,440
sometimes I think like maybe if I ever continue them, would I go back and redraw them? And I,

540
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:22,640
I want to say probably, I want to say probably no. Like the purist in me wants to say no,

541
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:28,320
that's how it was. It should never be changed. But I'm specifically thinking of a couple of

542
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:36,320
panels in The Champion of Damien where like his, his eyes, I drew his eye like really huge and it

543
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:42,480
looks a little bizarre in one or two places. And looking back, I'm like, that's bizarre. And maybe

544
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:52,480
it should be changed if I ever return to this story. But I don't know. A lot of people thought,

545
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,960
a lot of people thought, I tried to give Agatha kind of like a frilly, like a frilly like, like

546
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:06,080
poofy, like poofy shoulder sort of, not like a princess dress, but you know, kind of like a

547
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:13,440
fancy-ish dress. And a lot of people, a lot of people read what I tried to draw as like frills,

548
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,320
as like lacy frills. A lot of people read them as like, ragged tatters and thought she was wearing

549
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:29,760
like a potato sack, which is a little embarrassing. That's kind of a fuck up on my part. But what can

550
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,360
you do? You know, it's just part of the charm. Let's just let's just call it part of the charm,

551
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:45,120
I guess. Lemau. Wait, wait, wait. I read a really interesting thing about minting the coin. It was

552
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:50,000
like a, it's like an American government like politics. There's some weird fucking stupid thing

553
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:58,480
happening with like Congress. And it may come to pass that Biden has to just be like,

554
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:06,880
okay, well, we're just going to mint a platinum coin and declare it worth a billion dollars and

555
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:15,200
pay our own debt to ourselves with it. And that's the debt solution. And it's really funny. It's

556
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:21,920
really funny. How in the fuck does that solve any problem though? Okay, the way that it works.

557
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:30,560
Congress approves a budget. And then the president, the executive branch, borrows the money

558
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:36,800
to pay for the budget that Congress approved. That's how it works in most countries. But in

559
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:43,680
America, there's another step where, okay, then the president has to request that Congress approves

560
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:50,080
a budget. The president requests to borrow the money. And then Congress then has to approve,

561
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:57,680
yes, you can borrow that money to pay the budget that we approved. So basically what's going on is

562
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:04,560
Congress approved a budget and Biden is trying to, Biden needs to borrow the money to pay,

563
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:09,280
to spend that on the budget. But there's a thing called the debt ceiling where like there's some,

564
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,480
there's some clause, there's some provision where like federal debt cannot exceed a certain amount

565
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,680
or a certain, you know, proportion of something, right? And like we're at that limit. And the

566
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:26,800
thing about it is that that sounds really bad. Like you think that debt is bad, but it's actually

567
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:32,080
not. It's actually like fine and normal and it is not causing any problems. Other countries have

568
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:37,600
like a way higher debt to GDP ratio than America has and they're not having any problems. It doesn't

569
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:44,080
cause any problems. So America is not in any kind of debt crisis. We've technically hit what we have

570
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:52,160
defined as our debt ceiling. So Biden is sort of not allowed to borrow the money that he was told to

571
01:06:52,160 --> 01:07:02,320
borrow to, you know, execute on the budget. So basically the idea is like, well, this is an

572
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:07,520
intractable situation that Congress has put me in. Congress basically needs to vote to raise the

573
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:13,840
debt ceiling in order for me to do what they told me to do. And the thing about the debt,

574
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:20,400
like because naively, the debt ceiling sounds like a bad, like if you're hitting the debt ceiling,

575
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:27,680
you think that's bad because debt is bad, right? Well, not really. But it sounds bad. And so all

576
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,640
politicians use it as like a gotcha. Like if they, if they'll point it that whoever is they're running

577
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:37,040
against and they'll be like, that guy voted to raise the debt ceiling, that guy voted to increase

578
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:43,280
the national debt. And like, yes, they did. Because of course they did. Everybody does.

579
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:50,560
Everybody knows that you have to continually increase the debt ceiling. It's ever everybody

580
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:54,640
point everybody points at everyone else and says, you did it, you raised the debt, you raised the

581
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,040
debt. And then the time comes where it's like, well, we got to raise the debt, should we raise the

582
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,320
debt and everyone goes, yeah, I guess we should raise the debt, I guess we got to raise the debt,

583
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:10,320
right? Everyone knows this. But Republicans, Republicans are like, well, Republicans will

584
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:15,920
actually like, they will actually vote not to raise the debt, they will use it as leverage

585
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:22,080
to be like, if you don't, if you don't accept our agenda, we will as a bloc vote not to increase

586
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:28,240
the debt ceiling, it will destroy the economy, it will destabilize the United States dollar,

587
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:33,760
it will be a complete global catastrophe, but we'll just fucking do it, because we don't give a

588
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:40,000
fuck. They'll fucking do it. So, and like, that's what they're doing, they're basically saying,

589
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:47,200
we'll, we will Biden, no, fuck you, we're going to vote to destabilize the entire economy

590
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:56,320
and destabilize the dollar, the dollar itself, the fucking bedrock of like, everything.

591
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,000
We're going to, we're going to fuck it just because we don't like you and we don't want to do your

592
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,920
budget. Well, what they want, what they want is for, they know that the debt ceiling has to rise,

593
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,720
but they don't want to do it. They want Democrats to do it all by themselves so they can point at

594
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:19,520
them and go, the Democrats just keep raising the debt, the Democrats raise that even more,

595
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,280
they're spend, they're spendocrats, they're, they're, they're, where is it coming from,

596
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:26,720
how are we going to pay for it? How are we going to pay for it? Oh, they're borrowing against your

597
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:39,120
future or whatever. That's what they want. And so, so basically the answer is, if Biden just

598
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:44,880
mints this coin, because he has the power to just, there's a clause that's like, the executive branch

599
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:52,000
can, from time to time, just mint platinum bullion worth whatever they say they're worth,

600
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,440
and it's, and it's, and they just can't, so what he can do is he can just make a platinum coin and

601
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:03,840
say, this is worth a trillion dollars, and I'm giving it to myself to pay the debt. And then

602
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:11,120
there's a trillion dollars less debt. And the thing is, it doesn't even, it doesn't actually

603
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:17,680
do anything. It doesn't, like it's not money in circulation. It doesn't contribute to inflation.

604
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,760
It doesn't actually have any negative. What it, what it is, is like a stupid and arbitrary solution

605
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:30,320
to an equally stupid and arbitrary problem. And I genuinely hope that he mints the fucking coin,

606
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,200
because it's really funny. And the whole thing is bullshit anyway. So like, whatever.

607
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:44,400
That's pretty wacky. Yeah. Yeah. There are, there are maybe other ways that he could argue his way

608
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,600
around it and that he wouldn't have to do the silly, funny. Yeah, mint, mint the fucking

609
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,400
trillion dollar coin. Literally, literally the plot of a Simpsons episode is when they made the

610
01:10:54,400 --> 01:11:01,040
trillion dollar bill. But he's just gonna fucking do it. I hope he fucking does it.

611
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:09,120
The question I guess I would have is why does the debt not be a bad thing? Why is it always

612
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:14,560
normal to raise it and it doesn't change anything and it's just normal? It's because that's a more

613
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,760
complicated question, I guess. Yeah, it is. It's complicated. I can't give you like a full rundown.

614
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:27,520
But like, basically the debt that we owe is not like a, it's, it's, it's in, it's in the form of

615
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:35,440
like, it's mostly in the form of like bonds to United States citizens that are like payable

616
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:45,360
at regular intervals. Like, it's not like we're not like, we're not even close to defaulting

617
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:51,040
on New Orleans. Like, we have the spending capacity, we have the GDP to meet all of our

618
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:56,400
debt obligations, you know, at the contractually appointed times, right? Like, you know, people

619
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:01,760
buy bonds where it's like, okay, they'll, they'll basically, they loan the government some money.

620
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:07,040
They're essentially, they're essentially buying American debt and then, you know, they will in,

621
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:12,000
in, you know, five years or whatever, they will give the debt back and for owning the debt, you

622
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,120
know, they will get some amount of interest on their investment. And like, we don't have it,

623
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:22,240
it would, it would be a huge problem. Okay. And the thing is, it would be a massive problem

624
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:28,240
if America, if suddenly we couldn't, you know, make good on our bonds, if like America, American

625
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:33,520
debt is basically like the most secure asset in the world. It is, it is basically a zero risk

626
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:44,240
investment to buy like an American bond, a debt bond. And to, so, but, and we're, and we're not

627
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:50,080
in any, in any risk of failing to, to fulfill those. If, however, if we don't raise the debt ceiling

628
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:58,400
and we don't approve the budget, then suddenly we might not be able to fulfill those, those bonds.

629
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:05,120
And then it suddenly, the most stable investment in the world, the most stable asset in the world

630
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:11,760
would suddenly become destabilized and like, and, and, and, you know, all of a sudden because,

631
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:17,360
because there was suddenly like a greater element of risk involved, you know, suddenly the interest

632
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:23,840
rates on, the interest rates on, on American bonds would, would have to skyrocket to accommodate,

633
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,280
to accommodate that increased risk. And, and suddenly America would just have way less money

634
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,960
available from borrowing because it would just be way more expensive for them to borrow because

635
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:40,080
they're, because their debt would be a higher risk asset. So it's, it's actually way more dangerous

636
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:46,720
to not increase the debt is like the long and short in the, in this case. Apparently this almost

637
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,520
happened like with Obama, like they base, there was kind of the same situation and Obama was

638
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:57,840
considering minting the coin, but he didn't, he didn't end up having to do it. But maybe this time.

639
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:06,800
It's, it's, it's basically just, it's, it's literally just him give, basically like, give it,

640
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:13,600
writing himself a little permission slip to do the thing that he, that he was already was told to do.

641
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:19,520
The other possibility that like he might have to resort to is like if there might have to be

642
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:26,080
like a, like a legal or like constitutional argument that like the constitution both demands that I,

643
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:35,040
you know, the, the, the constitution both demands that I fulfill the congressional budget and also

644
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:40,160
that I not, that I, you know, not exceed the debt limit. But, you know, these are two mutually

645
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:45,120
exclusive things that are both, you know, congressionally and constitutionally demanded of me.

646
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,920
Therefore, it's sort of an open legal question over like, which would be the less constitutional

647
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,960
thing to do. So you could make the argument that like, well, I nevertheless have to exceed the

648
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:04,320
debt limit because you told me to, right? Yeah, I really, I really fucking thought this was like

649
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,920
interesting. And I made me laugh. And I was like, just fucking do it. Just fucking do it. It literally

650
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:17,840
wouldn't do anything. Yeah. Yeah. The coin is funny. I, it's hard for me to wrap my head around the

651
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:29,040
other things. Just like the slime corp coin. Yes. We should add the, the, the, the trillion, the

652
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,760
trillion dollar slime coin. It's, it's, it's worth a trillion PC pennies.

653
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:42,640
We, you know, we have the, we have the executive authority to just, you know, to mint a bullion

654
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:48,480
of any kind we like and, you know, declare its value in PC pennies to be whatever we want from

655
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:55,200
time to time. This, this bottle cap, this bottle cap here, this is actually worth a, this is actually

656
01:15:55,200 --> 01:16:01,920
worth a quintillion PC pennies. Man, what a shit currency PC pennies must be. I'm going to throw it

657
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,320
against the mic. There, you just heard, you just heard it hit the microphone. That was a trillion

658
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:13,920
PC pennies down the fucking drain. Okay. That's, that's my, that's my spiel about the, about minting

659
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:24,480
the coin. Hey, Gib. Oh, she left. She left the call. I feel like I can safely assume

660
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,520
that this is a, that this is an internet blackout thing. Gib, you back?

661
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:36,320
I'm back. I'm using my hotspot now. I fucking, I don't know how much tater I have, but uh,

662
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,280
it should be fine. We're not going to go four hours from here.

663
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,400
I was just about to play the next voicemail.

664
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:51,440
Okay. Well, have you posted it? No, I just posted it right now. I'm posting it right now. It is

665
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:59,040
called, it's in, it's in general, like it's called funny bug story. Three, two, one, go.

666
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,880
When I was training at my job, I had two layers of shirts, one that had my uniform and a white

667
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,520
undershirt. I decided to go on a break since I had the time and I took off my shirt, was wearing

668
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,720
the white undershirt and I felt a weird little like scratching or like poke inside my shirt.

669
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,720
So I take it out and I'm like, huh, you know, maybe a rock up in there. So I take out the rock

670
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:24,800
and the rock just gets up and flies away. And then I realized that rock was actually a bee

671
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:32,080
and my shoulder started hurting. No, saddened. You got stung. How do you get stung and not notice

672
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:38,560
it until later? Wouldn't it hurt when you got stung? I think if you feel like a pitching

673
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,200
thing, but you're not really imagining there being bugs near you, you just sort of assume

674
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:49,680
your clothes are catching on you somehow. Yeah, yeah, that sounds reasonable.

675
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,840
That's the worst realization where you're like, it's sort of like a weird thing.

676
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:03,120
Then giant spider drops to the ground is like, oh no, he was laying eggs in my brain.

677
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:13,680
Oh yeah, many such cases. Yeah, I mean, I hate, I really hate, I sure do hate finding bugs on

678
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:20,560
myself and I definitely hate when I get stung by bees. I think I've ever been stung by a bee.

679
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:27,520
I definitely got stung when I was a kid. I got a bee sting as a kid, I think. It's been a while.

680
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:37,920
I should try it again sometime. It was pretty sick. The next one is called actual drawcast idea

681
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:43,440
voicemail characters. There's no content to that. It's zero, okay.

682
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:52,160
To drawing the voicemail characters? That's, I mean, we didn't, no, we didn't do that.

683
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:59,440
We never did that. For a PCP voice, for a PCP drawcast, that is actually a pretty solid idea.

684
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,240
Maybe. I can't really think of what they look like. What does a nightfucker look like?

685
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:11,920
What does, I know what the pig looks like. Well, that's the challenge. Well, that's the challenge.

686
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:21,680
We did get fan art in one, somebody sent, I'm sorry, was it never paint? I think never paint

687
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:26,960
drew a bunch of the nightfucker, the league of nightfuckers. That was the first time I had seen

688
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:36,560
them rendered and they were really fucking weird looking and shit. It's weird. There's so many

689
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:42,560
different nightfuckers that I completely have forgotten all of them. They're all just oblivion

690
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:51,200
fall, like putting words together and being like, I'm this thing. I'm has a nose for a penis,

691
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:58,960
man. Oh, I tried to fuck, but the nose between my legs won't go into pussy. Now how could I

692
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:07,920
fuck, Nate? And that's the character. That was a great impression. I thought they were in

693
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:18,480
the room with me. They are. Turn around. And also, they don't have a penis, they just have a nose,

694
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:26,800
so they can't do anything. They can sniff. They can sniff. True. Gross. Man, if you had a nose

695
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:34,320
between your legs, all you'd be smelling was like your thigh sweat all the time. Yeah, you'd be

696
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:46,720
smelling your taint, your anus. Yeah. Would piss come out your nose? Trills. I'm going to say,

697
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:53,280
yeah, we're also going to come out. Oh, god. So you'd be smelling urine the entire time

698
01:20:54,240 --> 01:21:04,720
unless you cleaned it out all the time. Yes. Man, this guy sucks. Man, this guy sucks. Hey,

699
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:15,280
fuck you nose for a penis, man. Try harder next time. All right, next voicemail is called,

700
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:21,360
I should have uploaded this one, is called sober pride worldwide. Here it goes. Okay,

701
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:28,960
three, two, one, go. There's so many drunk people in the voicemails and on the podcast lately.

702
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:39,760
What? It's pathetic, really. Dab, dab, dab. You're sober pride. It's nice to get drunk every so often.

703
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:47,840
I was not drunk on the podcast. I was hungover. This is a high school baby child who doesn't

704
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:54,480
understand. I was hungover on the podcast. Have a little schnapps. Why don't you? I was not drunk.

705
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:00,880
Have a little schnapps, underage child, school child. Yeah, why do you think you're such a big

706
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:07,360
man? Why don't you try? Why don't you try drinking some milk on the rocks? Yeah, yeah, and then come

707
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:12,800
back to me when you're fucking stupid and wasted and you can't even fucking stand up straight and

708
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:19,120
you're puking everywhere. Then we'll see who's cooler. You don't really want to be sober in a

709
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:30,400
world like this where things is fucked up. I know, right? I have to drink all this big bottle of wine

710
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:37,680
because I have to review land before time 18 and it's going to take so much alcohol to get

711
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:44,240
through the process of reviewing this movie. But I have to do it for some reason.

712
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:52,720
Is that a, did Jenny Nicholson do that? I don't know if she did it. I mean, a lot of

713
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:58,400
YouTubers do the thing where like, oh, I don't want to, I don't want to review this movie,

714
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,360
so I got to do it. Oh, no, I mean like the land before time, the dinosaurs or something.

715
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:09,440
Oh, well, she did do a land before time retrospective video. But yeah, that is a funny thing like,

716
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:16,560
oh, I don't want to review this, but I'm going to review this. I'm going to review it. Don't review

717
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:23,520
it. It's so bad. I'm going to review it though. I have to do it. We all understand the social

718
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:29,600
contract here. I make videos, you watch my videos, you want me to do it. I remember it so you don't

719
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:35,280
have to. And I don't have to do it, but I got to pretend that I have to do it. And I'm going to make

720
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:43,040
a big bit out of it because I got to make this video longer. So let me just take my little

721
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:49,600
prop wine bottle and then go glug glug glug and then I go, and then I go, oh no. This game sucks,

722
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:57,120
except it's actually fine, but I hate making a video about it. Anyway, anyway, pledge to my

723
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:04,960
Patreon to support me making more videos like this. I hate you and goodbye. Basically, I mean,

724
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:10,480
that's basically, that's capitalism, I guess. It's really like a metaphor for capitalism.

725
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:20,800
And by a metaphor, I mean, it is literally just the thing. Next voicemail. You're like,

726
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:26,400
we're getting down there. Next voicemail. You look at, instead of like the classic like,

727
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:31,840
oh, what are you doing in my review? You look into the mirror. What am I doing in my review?

728
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:41,440
What am I doing in my review? You have like, you have like, you have like face blindness or

729
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:45,440
something and you look in the mirror and you don't recognize yourself and you go, what are you do?

730
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,720
Who are you? Why are you in my review? Wait, whose review is mine?

731
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:57,280
Who am I and what, who am I and what am I doing in someone's review?

732
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,720
The repeat that I just watched. That's an indie RPG in the making.

733
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:10,960
Oh, what? The protagonist, and that's an indie RPG in the making of somebody trying to figure out

734
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:19,120
why they're in someone else's review. Oh, no, I was just eating, I was just eating at my favorite

735
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:26,000
local cafe and I fell through a rift and now I keep showing up in all these YouTube videos

736
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:32,560
and there's all these ponies everywhere. There's a dark, there's gotta be some kind of dark,

737
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:38,320
some dark intelligence is behind all this. I can't believe I got isekite into a review.

738
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:46,400
And now I gotta review it. Oh my god, wait, it's like you assemble your party and your party is

739
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:52,160
you have a knockoff nostalgia critic, you meet a knockoff nostalgia critic because you're in

740
01:25:52,160 --> 01:26:02,560
his review and then you meet a barely animated MLP Pony Maker model and that's your next party

741
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:09,200
member. Who else would join you on your quest? The more I'm thinking about this, the more this

742
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:16,240
is actually a good idea. It is kind of a funny idea for what am I doing? You could literally

743
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:21,600
give it like a light novel title that's like what am I doing in this YouTuber's

744
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:31,600
video review or whatever. Honestly, I think it's a workable idea, it's a saleable idea

745
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:39,440
that I would buy. Nobody steal it, I'm gonna make that. No one steal it, no one steal it.

746
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:48,960
Um, next, oh I already uploaded the next one, it is called Ben Saint question mark, 3, 2, 1, go.

747
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:56,640
Ben, did you listen to the Anamorphine Time episode with the voicemails with Mr. Chris

748
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:04,240
crying yet? Because I have proved how much harder I could shitpost. Um, shit. Well, I'm glad you

749
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:09,760
took them up on the offer to leave a voicemail. No, I have not, I have, I am behind on my Anamorphine

750
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:16,000
Time. I think I'm, I'm gonna tell you exactly how many episodes I am behind. I'm like, I think I'm

751
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:23,280
maybe like four episodes behind, one, two. Yes, I am exactly four episodes behind on my

752
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:30,400
Anamorphine, wait a minute. Oh no, it's six episodes now, two more have come out since then.

753
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:39,280
Oops. Gotta get on that content, gotta consume. They gotta, I need them, I need them to stop,

754
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:45,040
I need them to start wasting more content so that I stop falling so far behind. I would

755
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:50,000
really appreciate it if they could be less efficient about with their content creation process.

756
01:27:50,960 --> 01:28:03,440
Uh, thanks. Next voicemail is called 61, it is called More Like Ben Taint. Three, two, one, go.

757
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,760
Leave Nate and Tyler alone, they're good boys, they're good boys.

758
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:28,320
Uh, next, next one is called, next one is called I Am Serious. Okay, three, two, one, go.

759
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:35,520
How do y'all deal with the existential dread of dying alone because nobody likes you?

760
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,200
I don't care if nobody likes me, I just don't want to die.

761
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:48,160
That's not entirely true. Obviously I want people to like me, but dying, period, dying in any way,

762
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:55,280
is almost equally terrifying to dying alone. It's like the difference is marginal.

763
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,200
I think that they're more upset that they're gonna be living alone.

764
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,600
Yeah, I agree. Because death will just happen.

765
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:10,240
Yeah, dying alone, you just either way, you're dead. Yeah, say what you mean.

766
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,880
It's living alone that is the, that is the annoying part. You know, if you like,

767
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,200
if you like camaraderie and all that shit.

768
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,520
You just gotta be epic.

769
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,160
Easy peasy.

770
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:31,280
Have you tried being epic voicemailer? No, didn't think so. Didn't think so. You gotta be,

771
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:35,680
you gotta be disrupting, right? You gotta be making moves. You gotta be disrupting,

772
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:43,440
like Elon Musk. Wait a minute, wait a minute, I have, I have, I have terrible news. Oh God.

773
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,160
Elon Musk is joining the PCP.

774
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:58,800
Oh God, don't, I'm sad to report, I'm sad to report that Bitcoin has made a significant,

775
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:07,680
a significant rebound and has gone up back up to 55. I am so sad. Let me just vent.

776
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:14,960
I was watching it. I was watching it plummet. I was watching it fall. It had fallen down from

777
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:20,800
over 50 and it was basically hovering around like 40, 42. And I was like, ha ha, fuck Bitcoin.

778
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,600
Fuck the blockchain. And then, and then I briefly entertained the like,

779
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,240
maybe I should buy the dip. I was like, maybe I should buy the dip right now.

780
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:36,560
Then I was like, no, I think it's gonna keep going down. No, I'm not gonna buy the dip. Well,

781
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:42,560
if I had bought the dip when I was thinking of buying the dip, I would have made like 35%

782
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:50,400
back. I would have made 35% in like a week. It would have been huge. But I didn't. So,

783
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:58,560
you know, what I'm saying is that lesson learned and you should always go all in on any stupid

784
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:04,320
investment idea that crossed your head. Anytime you think, anytime you're wondering, should I buy

785
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,800
this? You already know the answer. The answer is always yes. And you should buy double of it of

786
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,760
whatever you're considering about. Because then you'll get that's the only way. It's the only way.

787
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:20,800
It's the only way. Ben, you said that every single time when you bought, and it didn't work out

788
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:27,920
afterwards. It didn't work. It mean it, it, it wasn't a disaster. It didn't, it didn't,

789
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,800
okay, but it, but if I had done it this time, but if I had, but if I had done it this time,

790
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:38,320
it would have been amazing. Think about it, right? Would have been great. Yeah, life is a bunch of

791
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:48,960
wood of shit. Well, I mean, so I guess we, so, so, so we agree. So we agree. I should, I should

792
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:55,280
have bought Bitcoin. So we agree. I should have bought the dip. I was going to buy in if it went

793
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,400
like crashing down to nothing. But it wouldn't do that. So I'm just sort of like not interested.

794
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:06,400
I knew I could at any moment like, Oh, well, it's down now. It could go back up. It could go back

795
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:12,640
down. I feel I wanted to go really far down. I wanted to crash and go into the negative actually.

796
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:16,960
I thought it was, I thought it was going to go, I thought it was going to dip much further than it,

797
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,120
then it ended up dipping. I mean, it could still, it could still dip again. I don't know. I,

798
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:26,720
I'm feeling, I'm feeling a little bit of that pain of like maybe in like 2010, you were thinking

799
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:30,480
like, maybe I should buy this Bitcoin thing I've been hearing about. I'm feeling a little bit of

800
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:35,120
that pain looking at this because I, I looked at it. I looked at it when it was 42 and I was like,

801
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:40,720
maybe I should buy the dip. Nah, fuck it. And now we're looking at it's 55. Like, oh, God.

802
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:46,080
I mean, the dips, the dips are only ever going to, it seems like the dips are just going to keep

803
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:52,480
getting higher. Like the dips aren't dipping hard enough. That's why I'm just like, I can't really

804
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:58,000
feel what you are describing is, but you're describing a bullish attitude. You're, you're

805
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:05,120
bullish on Bitcoin. Me? So you should buy, you should, so you should buy. No, right now.

806
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,240
Well, you just said, you said that you said the dips keep getting higher. You said the

807
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:13,440
dips keep dipping less. Which is why, which is why it's like, doesn't mean you think it's going up.

808
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,600
Well, yeah, over a long period of time, like at the beginning of the year,

809
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:22,320
it had a bit of a, well, if you think it's going up, you should buy, you should buy it.

810
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,600
Yeah, but then I, if I feel like I should buy it, I shouldn't have sold it ever.

811
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:33,920
I mean, and I feel like, you know what? I fucked around too many times and made too many mistakes.

812
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:41,840
I don't care anymore. I'm leaving the money on the table. I'm doing it. Not, not, not buying in

813
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:46,800
can be a mistake as well. This was my logic last time. Like if it goes to the moon, it will have

814
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:53,680
been a mistake not to have bought in. I don't know. I mean, I hate to even consider it because

815
01:33:54,400 --> 01:34:02,080
at the end of the day, it is all, it is all a scam. It is all a scam and a, any pyramid scheme.

816
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:08,480
That's true. But never, never, I can't help but wonder, yeah, but what if I could, what if I could

817
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:14,320
sneakily be one of the, one of the few that does end up making some money? What if I could kind of

818
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:20,080
sneak some, some sneaky profit out of it? Like, like, like, like a few people get to do. What if I

819
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:26,160
could be one of them? What if I could be at the top of the pyramid? What if, what if I could

820
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:31,680
position myself atop the hierarchy and oppress those below me instead of the other way around?

821
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:42,320
You have to admit, he's got a point. He's got a point. And the point is the, the point of like a knife

822
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:48,480
and he's going to stab us. Maybe. He's going to stab us all down on below him. Maybe, maybe, maybe

823
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:54,240
there isn't, maybe it actually, I don't want to flatten all hierarchies. Maybe I want to,

824
01:34:54,800 --> 01:35:00,160
maybe I actually want the hierarchies to be even more pronounced as long as I'm on top of them.

825
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:06,800
Maybe that's even better for me. Wow. So smart. Wow. I didn't even think of that before.

826
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:10,480
Before I was just doing it for no reason.

827
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:24,320
Next, next voicemail. This is a, is this the last voicemail? It's almost the last voicemail.

828
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:33,440
Um, next one is called Tom clickbait. Three, two, one, go.

829
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:41,280
The PCP of the week I came along and I see the thumbnails of back pain and I think to myself,

830
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:51,200
yes, a Tom episode. Ben, you can't take Tom's brand like that. If, if Tom had been there,

831
01:35:51,200 --> 01:36:00,320
I feel certain that my piddly little back concern would have been scoffed at, laughed out of the

832
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:08,480
room for the, for the, for the, for the trifling nonsense that it is. That's why you, you had

833
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:13,680
people sent around to Tom's to break his back even more so that he couldn't be on, be on the episode.

834
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:19,440
Because I don't want him stealing my thunder on this one. I got a, I got a minor health complaint

835
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:26,240
to make a whole fucking PCP episode about God damn it. And we can't have no, we can have no

836
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:35,680
disruptions to the status quo. Anyway, yes, sorry, sorry, sorry to clickbait you like that.

837
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:44,080
The, oh wait, there's, there's one more. Okay. The next voicemail is, it's a, it's a go, it's a

838
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:48,800
go fund me link. And I know what, I know what go fund me it is, but I will play the voicemail.

839
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:54,080
There's the, there's the audio. Okay. Three, two, one, go.

840
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,960
I guess probably already did this, but just in case you didn't, just a friendly reminder,

841
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:04,160
please shout out that go fund me that Ethan made for Acro to help her move out of her shitty home.

842
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:10,640
Yes. True. True. This is a, I'll post the link right here. I'll put, we'll put the link

843
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:17,920
in the description. This is, this is a, this is a friend, friend of a friend of the show.

844
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:27,440
Acro is, is a trans girl who has had to, had to vacate her, her house on, on short notice

845
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:33,120
and is scrambling to like figure out like how to like move across the country and such.

846
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:39,520
And it's a, we have a fundraiser going, it's gone pretty well and it's, it's, it's, it's gotten

847
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:46,800
made pretty big progress towards their, their goal in like the last couple of days. So

848
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:56,480
check, check it out if you want to help out with that. She is friends with, with Munchie and,

849
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:02,560
and Kazzie and those, and those people and they are, they're looking at, they, oh really? And

850
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:07,600
they're, they're well looking out for it. Which is nice. They're like arm retrieval alumni. Yeah.

851
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,440
Oh, that's true. That's true. They were on arm retrieval. Wait, they were on arm retrieval?

852
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,120
They weren't on arm retrieval, but they did fan out for it. And I talked to them a lot.

853
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:23,200
And I guess she did, you know, we're like tight and all that. So this is, this is a,

854
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:30,240
this is a sad situation. It's an abusive household basically. And they're a little too young to

855
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:39,120
like just move out. So they're, they're struggling. Many such cases. Sad, sad stuff. Yes. Uh, I,

856
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:46,480
there, I, I, I, I, I donated a little bit. Um, a little bit of my, a little bit of my pocket

857
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:56,400
change. Uh, give it a look. Give it a look. Uh, um, link in the description. Um, okay, that's it.

858
01:38:56,400 --> 01:39:01,360
That was the last voicemail. And it's been, what, we're like an hour? We're not even,

859
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:09,120
we're not even an hour and a half. This is what, what is this? What is this? 2017?

860
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:16,320
Dan, was there ever a PCP that short when there was like six people?

861
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:22,880
Yeah. They, they used to, they used to be that short, like a lot of the time, even when we had more people.

862
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:30,880
Unbelievable. I think that I actually don't believe it. I can't believe that such a large

863
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:36,880
amount of people talking so much, so loudly could not reach two hours plus.

864
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:42,720
I, I, let's, let's, let's, let's investigate this. Let's, let's look at the, the oldest episodes

865
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:47,840
and see, um, let's work by oldest.

866
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:57,520
Yeah. Episode two, hour 16, episode three, less than an hour. Uh, episode nine, hour eight minutes.

867
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,840
Episode 12, 43 minutes.

868
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:07,600
What the fuck? Yeah, they were, they were, they were like, they were semi-regularly under an hour.

869
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:13,520
Man. It's mind-blowing. It's mind-boggling.

870
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:19,200
Episode, episode 26, internet upbringing. We were, we did two and a half hours. We must have been like,

871
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:26,880
really earning our keep today. Damn. What a death. That was rough. Man, I'm, I'm pooped.

872
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:32,400
Over two hours. This is, they'll, nobody's going to listen to this. Uh, and nobody did. Oh wait, no.

873
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:37,680
Uh, 20, 21, 21,000 people did. So it was okay.

874
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:54,560
Anyway. Yeah. I don't know. Any, any last, any last words before it's fucking coitans? It's coitans for you?

875
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:01,440
Uh, well yes. Go check out the Clarissa Gunsmoke comic on Gibbentake.site.

876
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:07,680
Link in description. Uh, also please check out that GoFundMe. Give a little, give a little money

877
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:14,960
to, to Acro. Uh, you know, a small amount doesn't matter. Homelessness, homelessness is bad.

878
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:23,200
It sure is. It's bad. Especially when you had no, uh, way to avoid it happening to you suddenly. Uh, it's very,

879
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:29,760
it's fucked right now. It's not good. It's not good. Uh, true.

880
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:38,240
Um, I'm, anything else? I guess we're, I guess we're, I'm fucking done. I'm fucking done. Uh,

881
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:46,560
okay. We'll start. No, no, you know what? I'm going to reframe. You're, you're welcome for the short

882
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:52,000
episode. You're welcome for the short episode, viewers. I don't, you know, I don't want to,

883
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,480
I don't want to waste your time. I don't want to bullshit you. We just get in, get out.

884
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:02,800
No, this is, this is a tactic. Wham, bam, wham, bam. Thank you, ma'am. Get your daily dose. It's a tactic to,

885
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:08,960
to make them yearning for more, wanting more, to, to be pining. They're, they're so used to, to these

886
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,720
like huge episodes. They need to, they need to remember what it used to be like without the

887
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:19,120
PCP. They, without hours and hours of entertainment for me. They, they will, they will, they will

888
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:24,000
finish listening to this, this pitifully short hour and a half long Procrastination podcast

889
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,480
episode and they will say, oh, I need my fix. It wasn't enough. And they will have no choice,

890
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:35,440
but to go to patreon.com slash the Procrastinators and pledge their $5 to get access to the latest

891
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:41,840
bonus episode, the fun fact challenge. And finally, finally, they will know

892
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:47,280
all the things that we know. They will know the funnest facts. They will know the funnest facts

893
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:55,120
and be able to reference them in the future. They will have the secret knowledge that we possess.

894
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:03,360
If they have the courage, that is. Okay. I guess that's the end of the fucking show.

895
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:08,160
Good, goodbye, everyone. And I'll see you next time.

896
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,680
I just copied you. I just, I'm just a fucking copycat. I just hear things that I repeat them.

897
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:23,760
Take it. Take it. It's yours. Thanks. And I took it from you. You was going towards the audience

898
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:28,240
and I took it. It's mine. No, it's mine. It's mine. Wait, are we still, are we still,

899
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:39,520
is this still the episode or do we? Goodbye. Goodbye, later.
