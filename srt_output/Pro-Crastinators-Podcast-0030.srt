00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Hi everybody, and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm your host, Digibro, for the evening.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:20,200
I've got my usual suspects, Nate the best guy ever, Omedetou, Okaasama, uh, what, congratulations mother, is that what you said?

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,200
Yeah, that's what I said, I'm a Jess.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:29,200
I've got, I've got, Endless Jess with me, yeah, yeah, yeah. Patreon.com slash Ben Saint.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
Hmm, hello.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:41,200
And we have a very special guest today, a fellow YouTuber whom all of us sort of became acquainted with and fans of at the same time in the last couple of months.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Mr. Mumkey Jones.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Oh, konnichiwa, I can speak Japanese too.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,200
That sounded like a Spanish accent to me.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Well, that was a great, that was a great snob impression.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Whoa.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:23,200
We've invited Mumkey aboard, Mumkey said that he, he told me I'd be most interested in talking about politics or Elliot Roger, and I thought, let's talk, let's talk about empathy and how so much of the problems in our society are a result of people not understanding one another and, and just sort of, I guess that's really it.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Mumkey, I want you to introduce us to this concept sort of as you did in your Elliot Roger video.

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,200
You have this 30 minute analysis of why Elliot Roger did what he did.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,200
For those who don't know, Elliot Roger is the guy who, I don't know.

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Elliot Roger is the supreme gentleman.

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Yeah, that's right.

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Elliot Roger is the boy who dared to do what the rest of us were too cowardly to do.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,200
You know, you laugh, you laugh guy, but, but, but, but he's a beautiful boy.

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
With a tortured soul.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,200
I, I agree, I agree.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
All right, let's move on.

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Yeah, Mumkey, explain to us what's the deal with Elliot Roger.

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Okay, so to start off, I think it's important to distinguish the difference between sympathy and empathy because I think why people are scared to empathize is that they're confusing it with the definition of sympathy.

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,200
To empathize with somebody is just to be able to put yourself into their position mentally.

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,200
You're not making a judgment call saying what they did was right or wrong.

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,200
You're just saying, I can see their point of view and that's completely different from sympathy, which is where you're putting a judgment call on it.

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
So in the case, go ahead.

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Oh, I was just going to say, I'm reminded of what Aristotle said that the mark of an educated mind is the ability to understand another's perspective without having it yourself.

30
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:52,200
And that's actually one of the biggest problems we have politically is that people just want to put out their talking points and not try to understand other people's agendas and all that.

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
But we're not going to get political, I think.

32
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
So the story with Elliot Roger.

33
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Feel free. We don't give a fuck on this show.

34
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Bernie, I still love you. I'll never forget.

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:12,200
We've got about 10 minutes before this podcast degenerates like all of them, the complete frothing madness.

36
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
So you can say whatever you want. It doesn't matter.

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Okay.

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,200
So the story of Elliot Roger. I did an audiobook reading on my channel, Mumki Jones.

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,200
And there was a lot of discussion in the comments of people relating to Elliot because he was a very lonely boy growing up.

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
He had trouble making friends. He couldn't interact with the opposite sex at all.

41
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,200
He was addicted to World of Warcraft and it impacted him very much on a social level.

42
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,200
So there are people who were expressing in the comments of those videos that they could relate to him on those levels.

43
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:53,200
But the problem is that a lot of them also expressed fear for relating to Elliot Roger in a public sphere because of the potential judgments that would be cast upon them

44
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,200
for even talking about themselves and a murderer in the same sentence.

45
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,200
So it's like this fear of empathizing with somebody who did something bad, which that shouldn't be a fear at all because

46
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Elliot Roger is an example of a person that we should be able to learn from.

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:19,200
And when we halt the conversation with this fear, we're not doing anything to prevent the next Elliot Roger from happening.

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I had seen Elliot's videos before I listened to the audiobook.

49
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,200
That considers them a personal education tool.

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:42,200
They're obviously very hard to watch, not even just in the context of what they are, but just because you can tell that the guy in them is putting up this front and he's trying to act cool.

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,200
It's sort of embarrassing.

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,200
It's cringey in a conventional sense of the word.

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
It makes me really cringe.

54
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:59,200
But the reason it makes me cringe is because I can see him being like, hmm, I, the supreme gentleman, you know, I am a powerful God-like man.

55
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
I forget what he said.

56
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,200
But hearing him say those things, you know, those are thoughts that I've had and those are, I used to feel like that.

57
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,200
You know, like there's been times in my life when I might have said things very similar to that.

58
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I definitely said things.

59
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Not so much about the supreme gentleman, but I legitimately thought I was a God when I was like 17.

60
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:28,200
It's like when I first learned, when I first learned about like spirituality and stuff and like the idea that like you get from the universe, whatever you put into it, I was like, I can control everything.

61
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
My fate is in my command, you know.

62
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Did you, have you listened to the audiobook?

63
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
No, I have not.

64
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Did you know that Elliot became obsessed with that idea and tried to will himself to win the lottery and spend thousands and thousands of dollars?

65
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Did he like, did he read the secret or something?

66
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
He did read the secret.

67
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,200
That's the one book he specifically talks about is the secret.

68
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Oh God.

69
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Ben, remember when Grace came up to us and was like, guys, you have to read the secret?

70
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Well, now I'm glad I didn't because I would have been a fucking murderer.

71
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Thank you, Grace.

72
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
You need to ban the secret.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
The secret is causing all these mass shootings.

74
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
You need the secret control.

75
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Well, the thing is my, like, the reason I know that book-

76
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Every page is blank except for it says the secret is kill everybody.

77
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
The reason I know that book specifically is that my dad is actually a huge fan of that book.

78
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Like, he totally believes in like that, you know, whatever, like if you put good energy into the universe and good energy will come back to you.

79
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,200
And like, to me, I think really the secret, it's just the exact same thing as religion, which is just-

80
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Right, right.

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,200
You can't have confidence in yourself, so you have confidence in something higher than you.

82
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Even though really all you're doing is just being confident and that makes things happen for you.

83
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Like, that's all you need.

84
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Right, that's exactly what it is.

85
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,200
All you need to do is, like, believe that you can get things and then that will trick you into being able to get things.

86
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
It has nothing to do with the universe at large.

87
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
It's just, just be confident.

88
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Well, it's like, it's like, if you're thinking about something, that you say something that you want, you know, if it's on your mind all the time,

89
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:01,200
the inevitable consequence of that is going to be you taking, like, taking action, you know, relating to it.

90
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Right, so in that way, your thoughts do, you know, bring things into existence, but it, you know, through your action.

91
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
It's not magical.

92
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Or like, some weird spiritual fucking string theory particle effect.

93
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Yeah.

94
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
You know, not-

95
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Quantum collapse.

96
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Not to cast shade on my dad and his beliefs or anything.

97
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
I just think it's all really goofy to me.

98
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Like, I'm just like, you're just, I mean, you're just a hard worker.

99
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
That's why you get everything you want, you know?

100
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Yeah, yeah.

101
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:38,200
But, but anyways, yeah, with Elliot Roger, like, because I think what made his case so famous was that he was literally a 4chaner, right?

102
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Like, uh, Bumky, am I correct on that?

103
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,200
He was definitely on BB.com, the bodybuilding website, and then some other website.

104
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Oh my god.

105
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,200
We don't know for sure that he ever posted to 4chan, but there are a lot of speculation about it.

106
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Oh, okay.

107
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Right, because I remember when, when the event happened, like, when he shot all those people, I remember 4chan, like, not shutting up about how he

108
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
was one of us, you know?

109
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
That's just because he's so one of us.

110
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
He clearly, he clearly is.

111
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
He talks about how he loved, he loved Pokemon as a kid.

112
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
He talks about playing World of Warcraft.

113
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
He is totally one of us.

114
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Well, and also just his beliefs are, like, varied slash pole, right?

115
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Like, he's sort of anti-women.

116
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Well, specifically for women, yeah, I mean, that's kind of his...

117
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,200
So, like, you know, when it happened, everyone was kind of like, he's one of us.

118
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:35,200
And to me, it was like, you know, I've got experience watching shows like Welcome to the NHK or, like, you know, different stories that make people feel that way,

119
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:43,200
where they're like, this, this reminds, or even Evangelion, you know, where it's like, when you look at Shinji Ikari and he kind of reminds you of all the

120
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:51,200
fucked up times of your teenage life, you know, like, I think that's what Elliot Roger makes people think about, because it is real.

121
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
It's, you know, it's, it's not like...

122
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
How do I put it?

123
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
It's not a real pain, you know?

124
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,200
He was in serious agony every part of his day, and it doesn't matter that, like, he was fed well, he had a house, he had money.

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:11,200
None of that touched the higher level of the Maslow's hierarchy that he was completely unable to get anything he needed from, you know?

126
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Isn't that like a verbatim quote from Monkey's review?

127
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Yes, it is.

128
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Look, just because I mentioned Maslow's hierarchy doesn't mean I'm fucking...

129
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
It was, it was a well put, it was a well put, alright?

130
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Just because I mentioned the same thing in the same exact context.

131
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,200
That's, that's, that's stupid.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:38,200
You know, I think it is important to try and have empathy for people like Elliot Roger, but no matter how much I try, I don't think I can.

133
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Oh, fuck off, dude.

134
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:51,200
The more that I learned about it, no, because I watch his dumb little videos, and I just can't help but think that he's another bitter, pathetic, little sociopathic, four-channer piece of shit loser...

135
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Yeah, just like me, dude, just like me.

136
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:02,200
And who I really have empathy for is all the people in his life who had to deal with him for 22 years before he finally went off the deep end.

137
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
He should have killed, he should have killed people and killed himself.

138
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
It would have been worth the sacrifice to get him off the face of the planet. Please do.

139
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,200
That kind of relates to what I said at the very beginning, the difference between empathy and sympathy.

140
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Empathy is a skill where you are able to mentally put yourself into his position.

141
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Sympathy, I think, is what you're talking about, where you feel sorry for...

142
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Oh, no, I'm the best at empathy. Don't get me wrong. I can empathize with anyone in the world.

143
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:33,200
You know, I do empathize with him in one way, and that is the desire to commit violence and kill a lot of people.

144
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,200
That's one thing that I can deeply empathize with, and I think about every single day of my life.

145
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,200
In that aspect, that's a way in which he is a perfect human being who was right.

146
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:52,200
You know, I feel very much like one of the people commenting on Mumki's videos, and just the people who are...

147
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm a big four-channer myself. When I watch Mumki's video and just hear all the things read through Elliot's book,

148
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,200
I feel a massive correlation with my life and the experiences I've had.

149
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Not being able to get the things I want, the frustration, the way...

150
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
You know, just the way that things feel like they've tilted, like, it used to be able...

151
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
You could just grab a bitch, drag her back to your cave, rape her. That was the best.

152
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
You know, we need to go back to those days.

153
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,200
But, you know, I wish Elliot had lived to see the last episode of Steven Universe,

154
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
because he really just needs to take a moment.

155
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
You know, I'm serious, because the problem was...

156
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Oh, you mean the most recent episode.

157
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Yeah, the problem with Elliot was that a lot of us do this, too.

158
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Mindful education.

159
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
That's right. Mindful education. We focus too much.

160
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,200
We obsess over the things that have gone wrong in our lives that, you know, aren't going the way we want them.

161
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,200
And we can get... And I'm not really saying that just trying to think differently would immediately correct the problem,

162
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
but it's a matter of perspective.

163
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
And if you can, you know, change your attitude about...

164
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Just like, if Elliot had focused on being proactive about doing stuff,

165
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
and of course, like, yes, that's his whole problem, he couldn't be.

166
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
He was kind of, you know, damaged in however way to be like this.

167
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
If he had had just a slightly different perspective, he could have done things differently.

168
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I feel so bad, because he didn't deserve what happened.

169
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Elliot's observations about men and women are not necessarily wrong all the time.

170
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,200
It's just that he lacked perspective on them.

171
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,200
That reminds me of the time that I solved the gun control debate

172
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
and didn't tell anybody, because I figured out the answer

173
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,200
and I realized the world was too stupid to hear it and no one would listen.

174
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Are you going to tell it to us, or are you going to keep it?

175
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Yeah, sure, I'll tell you.

176
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,200
No, keep it. Keep the secret. I don't want gun control solved.

177
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
This is the secret volume, too, right now.

178
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Okay, let's see it. What's the secret?

179
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Well, so it's like, the way to prevent, like, another Elliot Roger type of mass shooting

180
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
is two steps.

181
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Step one is sex education, and step two is autism genocide.

182
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Wait, can I touch it?

183
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
We don't be dead!

184
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Yeah, we're all on the spectrum!

185
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
We're all on the fucking spectrum!

186
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
I really don't believe that.

187
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I believe that. I completely believe that.

188
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
I think that's complete bullshit.

189
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
That's like saying we're all on the broken leg spectrum.

190
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Well, what if I don't have it?

191
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Wait, what are you saying?

192
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
You think the autistic spectrum is bullshit?

193
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
No.

194
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I think that the idea that everyone is on it is bullshit.

195
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,200
For the record, Jesse, we're all on the spectrum is literally a joke catchphrase I made up.

196
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
That's...

197
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,200
No, it's not a joke, it's true.

198
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I've heard people say that.

199
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Everybody displays behaviors that categorize autism.

200
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Everybody does it.

201
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Yeah, that's the thing.

202
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
It's... I mean, everyone displays...

203
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
It's kind of like saying we're all on the death spectrum.

204
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Yes, it's true, but unless you're like...

205
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Boy, are we.

206
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
But you don't describe someone as like...

207
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
You know that cheeky joke people say when someone's like,

208
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm dying, and someone's like,

209
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
well, you're always dying.

210
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
It's like, yeah, but fuck off, that guy's dying.

211
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Okay, okay, but seriously, remember that.

212
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Yeah, we're all on the spectrum, but some people are autistic.

213
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Here's a thing...

214
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
There's like a difference.

215
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Here's a thing I did years ago.

216
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Look, I just...

217
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Lines on the sand, it's all just lines on the sand.

218
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Hang on, okay.

219
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Because remember, Jesse, years ago when you made your ModPie video,

220
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,200
and I did all this massive amount of research just desperately trying to debunk the fact

221
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,200
that ModPie from My Little Pony was in fact autistic.

222
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
And you couldn't because I was right.

223
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,200
The point is, I did the actual research involved.

224
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,200
I read the actual American Standard Psychology, whatever it is, DSL3 or whatever,

225
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,200
to look at the traits, and all it is is a list of exemplified traits

226
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,200
or exerted traits of the individual.

227
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
So like if you have trouble talking to people...

228
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
It's a list of traits of an annoying asshole.

229
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
And when someone has a lot of those traits, we used to call them an annoying asshole.

230
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,200
But the thing is, everyone in the psychological community has decided to call it autistic

231
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
and treat it like an illness when really it's just being an annoying asshole.

232
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I agree. I agree.

233
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
And we should put them in jail. We should put them in some kind of concentration camp somewhere.

234
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I agree that the term is basically useless, and I don't like it,

235
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,200
but I'm just saying that the problem is the words that we're using to describe it.

236
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
I mean, I don't even know why we're talking about this right now.

237
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
We're just having a fucking word debate.

238
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
I want to go out on about it.

239
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
We're trying to add a price with autism.

240
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
But it got derailed.

241
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Wait, wait, let me touch on the first thing you said on how to prevent these kinds of things.

242
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Jesse, sex education. You're close there.

243
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
You're close there.

244
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,200
But what we actually need instead of sex education, we have sex education.

245
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
What we need is dating education.

246
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
That's what I was going to say.

247
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Let me finish. As laid out in fucking...

248
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Let me finish!

249
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
You can't interrupt me before I get a chance to elaborate.

250
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,200
As laid out by Christian Weston Chandler in the pages of Sonichu,

251
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,200
where he details a specific...

252
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,200
It's so badly that you have to make Jesse fucking lose his shit.

253
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,200
He details the plan for how we need to give Sonichu's a dating education

254
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
so they can learn to fucking flirt with each other and have sex by the third date.

255
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Okay, I'm sorry, Jesse. I sincerely apologize.

256
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
God damn it.

257
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,200
And if we took people like Christian and put them in a special place

258
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,200
with Lego blocks and fucking where they could be amongst themselves

259
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
and learn to socialize with people of their own kind,

260
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
then we could maybe reintroduce them to society one day.

261
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I agree with that.

262
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I agree with that because one of the biggest problems with Chris

263
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
is that he was never institutionalized or given special education.

264
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Right.

265
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
But if the problem you're trying to solve is gun control,

266
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,200
so your solution to gun control is sex education and autism destruction.

267
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Well, no, it's because it's going back to what you said in your video,

268
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,200
where like the debate is always between ban guns or get more mental health treatment

269
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,200
and the true answer is that none of those are really going to be effective

270
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
because you just can't, you're always going to have people like Elliot.

271
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Which is kind of monkey's point, you can't do much about it.

272
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Yeah.

273
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,200
But what I'm saying is like look at the specific case of Elliot or people like Elliot.

274
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Elliot hated women because he didn't understand women

275
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
and he didn't know how to get laid.

276
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
And because sex education is such a fucking joke,

277
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
no one teaches us those things.

278
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
If you go to like the red pill subreddit and see like how bitter

279
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
most people on there are.

280
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Yeah.

281
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Everybody on the red pill.

282
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Like I used to go there a long time ago,

283
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
but eventually I...

284
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,200
But eventually, you know, you go there, everyone's mad there

285
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
because everyone on there is a beginner.

286
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
They're all angry young men who don't understand this yet.

287
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,200
And when they finally figure it out, they stop going on there.

288
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
That's why it seems like everyone on there who has a crazy misogynist.

289
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Would be going on a forum for beginning on how to get women.

290
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Yeah, if you're there it means you have a problem.

291
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Right.

292
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Yeah, so what we just got to do is, you know,

293
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,200
when we see a fucking kid who is a retarded weirdo

294
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
who can't get with women,

295
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
we got to fucking slap him around a bit and say,

296
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
this is how you fucking talk to women.

297
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
This is how you be a functioning person.

298
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Stop being an autist and then he won't end up killing you.

299
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I'm a big believer in corporal punishment.

300
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,200
I think it needs to have a strong place in society.

301
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,200
There needs to be physical ramifications for being annoying,

302
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
being dumb and wasting my time.

303
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I want to get into all this because I, you know,

304
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
by virtue of my career, I've met a lot of autistic people,

305
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
especially Chris, especially Matt.

306
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
He's excluded, of course.

307
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Well, very especially because aside from monkey,

308
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
the rest of us come from the My Little Pony community.

309
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Oh, no!

310
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
You unzip me, Digi! You unzip me!

311
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Which is overrun with autism.

312
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
The world was so close to forgetting that.

313
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
You had to bring it all back.

314
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Bring it back flashbacks.

315
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Well, that's the thing, right?

316
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
When you hear that, it seems obvious, right?

317
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
People would joke about that, like,

318
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
hey, MLP fans are probably a bunch of autists.

319
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
But for those of us who just really...

320
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,200
They think it's a joke, but they don't really understand.

321
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,200
It's actually true because the kind of show that it is

322
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
attracts that kind of crowd

323
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
because it's something that's childish and easy to understand,

324
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
easy to empathize with, the characters have big expressive faces.

325
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
This is also why there's so many autistic anime fans.

326
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
And there's been studies done about this,

327
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
like real professional studies about the correlation

328
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
between autism and, like, cartoons and anime.

329
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Yeah, specifically.

330
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,200
I did my master's thesis on the correlation

331
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
between autism and anime.

332
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Having known Cider for three years,

333
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
that is not even slightly surprising.

334
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Weren't you like a math major?

335
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
No, I was just kidding. I was just wishful thinking.

336
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Anyway, the studies that have been done on it

337
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
are that basically because anime characters,

338
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
their faces are extremely expressive.

339
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
You can instantly get what they're thinking

340
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
in a way that you can't with real people.

341
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
So it makes it a lot easier for, like,

342
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
autistic people to connect with those characters

343
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
because they can kind of get what they're thinking more easily.

344
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
And anime characters are usually pretty straightforward

345
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
and, you know, and they spell out

346
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
sort of their personalities.

347
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
And MLP was like that, too.

348
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
But as a result of spending so much time

349
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
with autistic people, I've come to realize

350
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
that just like everyone else,

351
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,200
autism has nothing to do with whether

352
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
they're a good or bad person.

353
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Because I've met, there's plenty of people

354
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
with Asperger's and autism who I've met

355
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
who are really cool.

356
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
They're not as easy to communicate with

357
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
in terms of, like, you know, understanding

358
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
some jokes or something like that

359
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
or just being able to socialize.

360
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
But some of the autistic people I know

361
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
are amazingly creative, like, make awesome stuff,

362
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
are cool people.

363
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
You know, I've posited that I think Hideo Kiano,

364
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
who made Eva, is definitely some...

365
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
somewhat spurgy, you know?

366
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
But he clearly knows how to channel that

367
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
into something great and make art.

368
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
And then I've also known a lot of autistic people

369
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
who are fucking intolerable.

370
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
And invariably, what I've come to realize

371
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
is that it's because of how they were raised,

372
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
just like everyone else.

373
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
My cousin Evan, who is extremely autistic,

374
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
he's like, you know, to the extent that

375
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
he doesn't even remotely understand

376
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,200
how to be not a rude piece of shit all the time.

377
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Like, he's mostly raised by his mom,

378
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
like, by herself.

379
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
And his mom's a fucking crazy person.

380
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
She's like, she's a total bitch,

381
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
and she's high like 24-7.

382
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
And like, she always...

383
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
she has like a victim complex about the fact

384
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
that he's autistic.

385
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Like, she thinks it's because of vaccines,

386
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
and so she's just like, always woe is me.

387
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
My son was poisoned by the government,

388
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
and that's why I've been saddled with this

389
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
autistic son, you know?

390
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
And like, as I...

391
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
As I watch them live together,

392
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
you know, because they've lived with...

393
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Both my families lived with them,

394
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
and they've lived with us,

395
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
because they're fucking dirt poor,

396
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
because she can't fucking hold a job,

397
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
because she's crazy, you know?

398
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
And like, I'm not surprised

399
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
that Evan came out the way he is

400
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
when that's who raised him,

401
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,200
because she taught him to see himself as a victim.

402
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
She taught him to see himself as an autistic kid

403
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,200
who's not normal, who no one can relate to.

404
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
And so, he doesn't even understand

405
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
the idea of like, communicating with people,

406
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
whereas I've known other autistic people

407
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
who are extremely self-aware

408
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
about their autism,

409
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
and like, trying to control it,

410
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
and trying to understand people,

411
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
and they're great.

412
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
That is why...

413
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Okay, that is why it frustrates me.

414
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
You know, okay, the whole...

415
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
the over-diagnosis problem we got going on,

416
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
where more and more people are autistic,

417
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
but the question is,

418
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
is there actually more autism,

419
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
or is autism just more diagnosed?

420
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Or is it even a problem, you know?

421
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Yes, and it frustrates me,

422
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
because in past eras,

423
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
or maybe in other cultures,

424
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
people would maybe see someone

425
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
who we in America,

426
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
or in the psychological community,

427
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
would label as autistic,

428
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
and consider, oh, they have a mental disability,

429
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
whereas in other societies,

430
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
they might say, oh, well,

431
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
it's just a quirk,

432
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
so they just behave in this unusual way.

433
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Yeah, you're exactly right.

434
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
That goes back to what Jess is saying.

435
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Back in the day,

436
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
they would just call that person a stupid asshole,

437
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
but now we understand the advanced science

438
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
of, no, it's actually a mental disorder.

439
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
But isn't it healthier

440
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
to call that person a stupid asshole?

441
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I mean, yeah, I mean...

442
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
It would be better for them in the lab run.

443
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Absolutely, I agree.

444
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
It's like tomato-tomato, right?

445
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Like, is it a mental disorder,

446
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
or is it just a quirk?

447
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I mean, does it really make a difference

448
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
when we call it?

449
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Well, I think it matters,

450
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
because it's about how you treat that person,

451
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
when they're integrated into society, you know?

452
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I do think that they're,

453
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
like Jesse said,

454
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
there's some healthy angle

455
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
in being like, hey,

456
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
because I think when we tell people,

457
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
when we diagnose people,

458
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
and we give them that sort of easy answer,

459
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
it doesn't teach them that

460
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
what they're doing is wrong.

461
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
It teaches them that they're a victim.

462
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
It teaches them that...

463
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah, I don't like it.

464
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Oh, you've got autism,

465
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
therefore you're...

466
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
It's kind of like an excuse

467
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
that people can use,

468
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
and it's no excuse.

469
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
You still should be constantly trying

470
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
to better yourself,

471
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
just like everyone else.

472
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
You might have more of a lower ceiling

473
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
for what you're capable of, like mentally,

474
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
but that doesn't mean

475
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
that you shouldn't be trying to reach that ceiling,

476
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
and if there are autistic people

477
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
who can do good things,

478
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
then that means we should be trying to get

479
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
every autistic person to a point

480
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
where they can do good things.

481
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Not saying you're autistic,

482
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
so fuck you, you know?

483
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
You're just...

484
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
You know what?

485
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
You have no opportunities,

486
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
so just try to live.

487
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Try your best.

488
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
It's kind of a silly example,

489
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
but just to illustrate the point,

490
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
like, Forrest Gump, you know, was a retard,

491
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
but, you know, he did a lot of cool stuff,

492
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
and that's just to say that, like,

493
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
your life doesn't have to be defined

494
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
by your limitations.

495
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
You know, you can do all kinds of crazy shit.

496
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
You know, it's a good...

497
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
I mean, it's amazing to me

498
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
how often I will see

499
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
or hear, like, old people,

500
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
like, you know, people in their...

501
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
either from their 40s

502
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
up to their 70s and stuff,

503
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
and I'll hear them say things

504
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
or act in ways that I'm like,

505
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,200
this person is clearly autistic,

506
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
but is of an era where that wasn't a thing,

507
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
where, like, people didn't call him that,

508
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
and they've somehow lived this long.

509
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Like, you know, because, like Jesse said,

510
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
it used to be you were just considered

511
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
a stupid asshole,

512
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
but stupid assholes were still expected

513
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
to get jobs.

514
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Stupid assholes were still expected to,

515
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
like, you know, to find a way

516
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
to survive in society.

517
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
So, like, clearly,

518
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
in historically,

519
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,200
autistic people were able

520
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
to function well enough to live.

521
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
You know, like, whereas...

522
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
So you think the problem is now that we're aware

523
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
of autism as a disorder,

524
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
now we're coddling these people

525
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
and we're making a whole new generation of victims?

526
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Is that the problem?

527
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
And perhaps, to compound that,

528
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
perhaps there's an additional problem

529
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
of the fact that we've gotten so comfortable

530
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
with sort of the marketing machine

531
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
of, like, showing us perfect people all the time

532
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
so we're less used to these people with,

533
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
you know, weird quirks

534
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
or we don't really meet them as much, you know?

535
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
And that's why it all comes back

536
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
to my autism holocaust idea,

537
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,200
because once word gets around

538
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
that autists are getting sent off to camps,

539
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,200
then autistic people will try their damnedest

540
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
to not see autism,

541
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,200
and the problem will be solved forever.

542
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
My God.

543
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I'm just afraid, Jesse,

544
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I'm just afraid that I'll be caught up in that first wave.

545
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I've known Ben a long time,

546
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
and I'm worried about him.

547
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
I'm worried about this plan.

548
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
He knows what he's talking about.

549
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
That's always been...

550
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
That's why I have...

551
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I've described my political views

552
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
as the Aberdorf-Linkler policy,

553
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
where, like, on the one hand,

554
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I really think in, like, this authoritative way

555
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
that, like, hey, if we just, like, controlled everyone,

556
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
we could make a perfect society.

557
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,200
However, I would not fit into that perfect society at all,

558
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
so I'd be fucking myself,

559
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
so we have to be free and liberal

560
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
and, like, go against that.

561
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Um...

562
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
I do want to play off of a...

563
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I'll go ahead.

564
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
No, you go.

565
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
I want to play off of Jesse's idea

566
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
of the concentration camp thing,

567
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
because Elliot Rodger,

568
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
that was actually his solution for women

569
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
in the final seven pages of the book.

570
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Oh, really?

571
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
There would be a society where it's only men.

572
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Men don't even know that women exist.

573
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
All the women are in camps,

574
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
and the attractive ones are artificially inseminated

575
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
so that we can create new men.

576
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
And that was Elliot's idea of a perfect society.

577
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
So his solution wasn't to give men women.

578
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
It was just to remove them entirely.

579
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Exactly.

580
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
There was no...

581
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Oh, okay.

582
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
You know, that's really...

583
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
That's a really weird idea for someone who's like...

584
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
No, it makes perfect sense.

585
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
It makes perfect sense,

586
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
because the competition for women

587
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,200
is what brings out the bestial side of men.

588
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
And for him, without that temptation,

589
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,200
they have nothing to hurt each other

590
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
and treat each other unfairly over.

591
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,200
I mean, every comedian makes the joke

592
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
that men wouldn't do anything

593
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
if we weren't trying to impress women.

594
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I don't agree with that.

595
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
But also, if you remove the competition for women,

596
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,200
that was the competition Elliot was losing his whole life.

597
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,200
If you just remove that, then his standing...

598
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
I'm just fascinated that that's like...

599
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
What he got out of it was not...

600
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
I need to...

601
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,200
It was less important to him that he could actually hook up with a woman

602
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,200
than that he could prove that he could or something.

603
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,200
It was all about his self-worth, you know?

604
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
That's really what it came down to.

605
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
In his mind, women and sex were...

606
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Any guy could just jack off, you know?

607
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
We can do it, but...

608
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Sorry, go on.

609
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
What was it?

610
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
You cut out.

611
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
In Elliot's mind, women and sex were evil

612
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,200
and needed to be exterminated from society.

613
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Right, but I think that clearly comes from a place of...

614
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I mean, I don't want to say sour grapes,

615
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,200
but if he had easy access to it and was a confident guy,

616
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
I suspect his attitude would have been different.

617
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Obviously.

618
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,200
I think that's a safe assumption.

619
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,200
I mean, to him, it was like women...

620
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Okay, because women have the power to choose which men to sleep with,

621
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
and to him, they always chose wrong,

622
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
because they weren't choosing him.

623
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,200
All evil, because they chose the most brutal of men, he would say.

624
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Yeah.

625
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,200
You know, so to expand this beyond just autism and stuff,

626
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
and just into greater empathy,

627
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
like the way I sort of see society,

628
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I find everybody very easy to empathize with,

629
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,200
not usually easy to sympathize with at all,

630
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
but very easy to empathize with.

631
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
And the reason is that I have a sort of...

632
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
And Nate, I know you agree with me on this,

633
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,200
a very deterministic viewpoint when it comes to the world,

634
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
that the reason people are...

635
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I'm looking for a reason to not believe this deterministic,

636
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
but I've yet to find one, so...

637
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Right.

638
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Well, the way that people are is pretty much always a result of

639
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
what they have been, right?

640
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Like what they've gone through.

641
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,200
You're born with a certain kind of temperament,

642
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,200
certain genes, you know, like you have a certain nature,

643
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
but then you are also nurtured into...

644
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Like a Pokemon.

645
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Exactly.

646
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
You might be born with a...

647
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Oh, now I get it.

648
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Now I understand.

649
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Oh, you know, you're born...

650
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
You come into this world...

651
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
If only Elliot had known about the hidden staff.

652
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Yeah, if only he'd known!

653
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
If only he'd known!

654
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Yeah, Elliot was thinking of everything in terms of the IVs,

655
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
but he forgot all about the EVs,

656
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
because that's what it's...

657
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Yeah, you know, you come into this world

658
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
as a little fucking... as a little goddamn...

659
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Chimchar.

660
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Chimchar.

661
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Chimchar, and you might use sassy,

662
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,200
but you know, even a sassy chimchar

663
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
can still learn flamethrower, you know?

664
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

665
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Sassy chimchar, that's a stereotype.

666
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,200
So anyways, yeah, we all are kind of the result

667
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
of our upbringing,

668
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
and I think the biggest problem that I see

669
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
our autism upbringing...

670
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
The biggest problem I see in society

671
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
is no one...

672
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
No one seems to...

673
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
God, fucking damn!

674
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Society of our kids.

675
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Not the people.

676
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
I feel like you're an animal right now.

677
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
I know it's a very tall order

678
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,200
to stop thinking about autism,

679
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
but let me...

680
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
So, you know...

681
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
What if Jesse had found the death note?

682
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Oh, wow!

683
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
The world would be gone.

684
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
There'd be no one left.

685
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
This world is too autistic.

686
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Jesse would have used it immediately, too.

687
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
As soon as he found out what it could do,

688
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
I have no doubt that Jesse would have killed

689
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
like everybody would have done.

690
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I never would have done a face reveal video.

691
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Yeah, good plan.

692
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Anyways...

693
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
God, you guys fucking distract me so hard.

694
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
I would kill everyone but monkey.

695
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Oh, that's nice.

696
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
That's nice.

697
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
So, the only person worth living with.

698
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
So one of the things that bothers me the most

699
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
in the world is when I'm in a room

700
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
full of people who aren't me

701
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
and we're watching a television

702
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
on the news,

703
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
and invariably, if something bad happens,

704
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
then people will always be like,

705
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
that person's a monster.

706
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Or like, wow, what a fucking...

707
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
What a piece of shit.

708
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
I don't know where people like that come from.

709
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
How could you do something like that?

710
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
And I'm like, it's not that hard

711
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
to understand these people.

712
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
It's not hard.

713
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Like an ISIS killer or something.

714
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
All you gotta do is put yourself in their shoes

715
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
and you can immediately get why they would do the thing

716
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
that they did, right?

717
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
They're an uneducated,

718
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
probably young person

719
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
who comes from a shit-hole country

720
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
and who's been taught their whole life

721
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,200
in this other country are the cause of their problems.

722
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
ISIS is fairly educated.

723
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I mean, depending on who's in...

724
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
What?

725
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
No, like the people who leave from the west

726
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
and go join, they're usually pretty...

727
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Well, okay, yeah, but those are not the majority

728
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
of ISIS members.

729
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
I don't mean to say...

730
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
The majority of ISIS members are bumpkins

731
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
from around, you know,

732
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
those countries that get picked up locally.

733
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Like just most terrorists

734
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
are people who have been taught

735
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
that the problems in their lives

736
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
and their society come from this other society

737
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
and if they can destroy it,

738
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
then they'll be rewarded for it, right?

739
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
That's pretty easy to understand and empathize with.

740
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Like, I totally get why if you were in that situation,

741
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
you would do that.

742
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Wow, Digi, you're making this whole ISIS thing

743
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
sound pretty good, honestly.

744
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
I've even heard from people

745
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
who don't even really understand psychology that much.

746
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Like, if you actually watch ISIS recruitment videos,

747
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
it's really easy to understand

748
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
why this works on people.

749
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Because the ISIS recruitment videos

750
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
make America look like fucking monsters.

751
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
And I mean, they deserve it so a lot of the time.

752
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
It's like, they killed our families

753
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
and they fly drones around and they kill our young

754
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
and if you destroy them,

755
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
then you'll make the world better.

756
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
And it's like, that's hard to argue with.

757
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
And you know what else is interesting?

758
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
I've been watching a podcast by this guy, Sam Harris,

759
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
who's a philosopher and writes a lot of books about stuff.

760
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
He's one of the four horsemen of atheism,

761
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
but that doesn't matter.

762
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,200
He just, like, he talks a lot about how people...

763
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
It sounds like someone, Elliot Rogers,

764
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
would have been a fan of.

765
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Well, hence my interest as well.

766
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Well, you know, it's just...

767
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
He talks a lot about how people,

768
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
specifically about ISIS,

769
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
how people do not get

770
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
why ISIS would do what they do.

771
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Or rather, they always rationalize it one way,

772
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
as like, oh, they're doing it for, you know,

773
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,200
socioeconomic issues, like America bombed,

774
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
you know, Syria or whatever,

775
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
and so the guy joined ISIS or whatever.

776
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Despite the fact that, like,

777
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,200
ISIS consistently all the time puts out propaganda

778
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
saying, join us, like,

779
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
we are going to give you,

780
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
you know, like, we're returning to this form of life

781
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
where, like, you know, men are exalted

782
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
or whatever, women are, like, subservient.

783
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,200
And, like, if you die, you go to, you know,

784
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
wherever and you get virgins or whatever it is.

785
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
It's like, people don't understand

786
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,200
that the propaganda is true

787
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
and they're really quick to try to

788
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
make things conform to, like,

789
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
how they would react in a situation like,

790
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
oh, this must be a socioeconomic thing.

791
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Exactly, it's a lack of empathy.

792
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
We're trying to look at everything from

793
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,200
what would inspire us from a Western perspective.

794
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Like, well, all I care about is money,

795
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
so obviously it must be a money issue.

796
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,200
And I hear that a lot too, like, you know,

797
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,200
because average people, because they don't understand psychology,

798
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,200
which if you asked me, like, how would I fix society,

799
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
everyone has to be educated in psychology.

800
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Because as soon as you understand psychology,

801
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,200
everything else, everything bullshit in society

802
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,200
totally breaks down because it all just makes so much sense.

803
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,200
Like, religion, when you understand, psychologically,

804
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,200
why people go to religion, then it...

805
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
I don't know if I buy this, did you?

806
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
I think psychology is just...

807
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
That's because your name's fucking Saint!

808
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
You have a bias in this one.

809
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Ben was a psychology major, you know, right, Ben?

810
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
What? You're a psychologist?

811
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Oh, it was philosophy, it was philosophy.

812
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
You fucking idiot, you fucking idiot, Nate.

813
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,200
How dare you? How dare you suggest that I would study psychology?

814
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
It's the same thing.

815
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Yes, yes, our dad is a psychologist, and that's fine.

816
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,200
But psychology is reactive to, you know, people, right?

817
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Psychology is just categorizing behaviors, right?

818
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Psychology does not explain behavior.

819
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Psychology is like a catalog of behaviors,

820
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,200
and like theorizing about behavior.

821
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Just because you study psychology

822
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,200
does not give you, like, great insight into people, right?

823
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Like, psychology is the acumen...

824
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,200
The knowledge we have of psychology

825
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,200
was gained through an understanding of people.

826
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,200
You know, the understanding goes the other way.

827
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
I think when you look at someone...

828
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Does that make any fucking sense? Am I talking crazy here?

829
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
You're talking crazy, I don't get it.

830
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
But I think the way...

831
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,200
If you look at someone and you can understand where they're coming from,

832
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,200
is that not psychology? Is that not what profiling is?

833
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Like, looking at someone and figuring out why they're acting the way that they are,

834
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
that's what psychology is, right?

835
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
And like...

836
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Yeah, yeah, I guess by comparing them to similar cases,

837
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
you can come to some kind of...

838
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Right, well, I'm saying that if you understand, like,

839
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
okay, people who are religious,

840
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,200
they don't know why they are religious.

841
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,200
The way they understand it is like,

842
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,200
oh, if I believe in God, I'll be rewarded in this and this way.

843
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,200
And from a psychological standpoint,

844
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,200
the reason people gravitate towards something like that

845
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,200
is that it sort of gives them an easy thing to cling to.

846
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
They don't have to rely on themselves,

847
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,200
they can rely on this higher power that's communicating with them.

848
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
But once you understand that as like a psychological principle,

849
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,200
then it's like, oh, okay, religion's obviously bullshit

850
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,200
because the only reason it exists is so that we can trick ourselves

851
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
into feeling happy about something.

852
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
That's the only reason it's there.

853
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
I don't know.

854
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
I mean, you say that,

855
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,200
but then there are plenty of religious psychologists out there.

856
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Digi's only point is that we can gauge insight is smart.

857
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Oh, come on, that's so dismissive.

858
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
I don't like that whole...

859
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
I think it's very possible to...

860
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,200
It's kind of like there's a lot of scientists who are also religious.

861
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,200
It's because they're just not making like that mental leap kind of.

862
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Why don't you have some empathy, okay?

863
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Why do you be like, oh, well, anyone who's religious...

864
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Look, I'm not religious, but I think it's unfair to be like,

865
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,200
oh, anyone who is religious just has failed to connect the dots

866
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
in the way that I have.

867
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Oh, God, whatever.

868
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Monkey was saying something.

869
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Monkey.

870
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Digi, I agree with what you're saying,

871
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,200
but I think one stipulation I'd put on your argument

872
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
is that the way you're talking about it,

873
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,200
it's like people choose to go to religion because of these rewards,

874
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
but that's not true.

875
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,200
90% or 5% of people are born into religion,

876
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,200
and then it's taught to them from the very youngest ages.

877
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,200
I don't want to use the word brainwash because that is dismissive,

878
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
but that's pretty much what it is.

879
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,200
You're taught this and you're told this is the truth, no matter what.

880
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Very few people choose to go to religion.

881
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
But that's why I think...

882
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
That's the thing.

883
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,200
What I'm sort of getting at here is that I don't think anybody really chooses who they become.

884
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,200
I don't really believe that we have a lot of choice in our lives.

885
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
I agree with you on that.

886
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,200
You gain more choices the more self-aware you become,

887
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
and the more you understand the world around you,

888
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
it opens up more opportunities.

889
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,200
But to get to that point, you have to be lucky.

890
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,200
My dad, I don't want to slam him too much

891
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,200
because he's a very good person, I think.

892
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
He's a busy dad.

893
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,200
My dad is very sympathetic towards people who are...

894
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Mr. Bro.

895
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,200
My dad is very sympathetic to weaker people

896
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,200
and good people, but he doesn't have a lot of sympathy

897
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,200
for people who he sees as could have made different decisions.

898
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
And I don't really believe in that.

899
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
I don't believe that everyone can make a different decision.

900
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
And one of the things my dad often says is like,

901
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,200
libraries are free, everyone should be able to go...

902
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,200
If you want to better your life, just go read

903
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
and go read about how to better your life.

904
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
And I'm like, yeah, but see, you know that,

905
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,200
but a lot of people just don't know that.

906
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,200
If you never are told, hey, if you read books,

907
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
it will make you successful,

908
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
then you will never think to go do that.

909
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,200
They never let you use the computer,

910
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
they make you sign up for shit,

911
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
they make you give them a bunch of information

912
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
that a poor person can't possibly have.

913
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Even if you're told that you can better yourself

914
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
through education, you don't really get it

915
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
until you actually go and do it.

916
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Exactly.

917
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,200
When you see it, it's all luck.

918
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200
The guy who, like some teenage gangbanger

919
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,200
who joins a gang and fucking ends up killing

920
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
a bunch of people and then getting shot,

921
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,200
that guy probably never understood the value of education

922
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
because no one taught it to him

923
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
because he just didn't grow up in that environment.

924
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,200
You have to already have an in

925
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,200
if you want to get to even where any of us is.

926
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
I was raised in a family

927
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
where graduating high school and going to college

928
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
were just expected.

929
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,200
There was no even consideration

930
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
that I would do anything else.

931
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
I guess that worked out pretty well.

932
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
I know we don't really want to get into this,

933
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
but I just find it interesting that you're looking at it

934
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
from this perspective because we definitely have

935
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
a different viewing on this topic

936
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
because I think that you have exactly zero choices

937
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
in your life because the only thing that determines

938
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
what you're going to do is the physical forces

939
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
of the universe on the cells of your body

940
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
and that consciousness is an illusion

941
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
I'm more or less with you.

942
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
I don't think, when people talk about choice

943
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
in the way of like, I could have done this

944
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
instead of doing that, I don't really believe in that

945
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
because I think that...

946
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
But what is the scale of choice we're talking about

947
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
because you make choices every day?

948
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Do you though?

949
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
I had the choice to come on this podcast

950
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
that could have said, did you bro?

951
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
He's not my bro and I could have left.

952
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Let me do this. Let me go through an exercise real quick.

953
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Because what was your life?

954
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
This is something I learned from Sam Harris.

955
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
So today, as you were getting ready to do this,

956
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,200
what were the choices going through your mind

957
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,200
as you decided whether or not to do this podcast?

958
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
In your brain, for the things that you were planning to do...

959
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
So I can either do the podcast,

960
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
I can jerk off, or I can take a nap.

961
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Those are my three choices.

962
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
What are the odds you would have done the other two things?

963
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Do you really think you made a meaningful choice?

964
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Or you could have applied yourself

965
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
and killed five people.

966
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Six people and injured 14.

967
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Seven if you count himself.

968
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,200
What kind of weaponry did he use, anyway?

969
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
He had two handguns.

970
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Is that two handguns?

971
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Pretty good for handguns.

972
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
He was going around like a John Woo movie.

973
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Two handguns and slow motion.

974
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Now he's sounding even cooler.

975
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
He was in his BMW or the car the whole time.

976
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
He was just driving around.

977
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Oh, really?

978
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
I relate to him.

979
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Every day you're more like him.

980
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
You know what's worse?

981
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
You shave Digi, now you look just like him, too.

982
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Did you look in the mirror

983
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,200
and slowly comes into focus and his face is alien?

984
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Not only do I drive him...

985
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
That's the problem, success.

986
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
The richer Digi gets, the closer he gets.

987
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
Can we go back to what Nate was saying?

988
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
I think they threw off his thing.

989
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,200
I was just saying that if you really examine

990
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
the mental pathways that you're following,

991
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
you'll find that it's not like you really

992
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
made a mental list for yourself

993
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
of like, okay, I could do A, B, or C choices.

994
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,200
It's really more like your brain is populated

995
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
by your memories or your understanding

996
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
of what's going on, which is kind of like your RAM.

997
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,200
And then the first one that hits,

998
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,200
that's the one you end up doing.

999
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
Can you connect this to Pokemon in any way?

1000
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Yes.

1001
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Which stat does this tie into?

1002
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
It's like which... fuck.

1003
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
I don't want to say which starter.

1004
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Let's say you choose...

1005
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
Let's say you were going to make the choice

1006
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
between Pokemon Red or Pokemon Blue, right?

1007
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Yeah, okay.

1008
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
The kind of person you are

1009
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,200
is going to determine which game you buy.

1010
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Is your favorite color red or blue?

1011
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,200
You'll probably pick that one.

1012
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Or is one of them more popular than the other?

1013
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,200
You might pick the one that's less popular

1014
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,200
because that's the kind of thing I would do.

1015
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,200
And the forces that you feel in your brain that you...

1016
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I mean, this is my perspective.

1017
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
The forces that you feel that are a choice

1018
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,200
are actually just kind of the...

1019
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,200
You're CPU processing the information

1020
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
and then it spits out an answer.

1021
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
That's my opinion.

1022
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
It's really just that you don't have control

1023
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
over your own thinking

1024
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,200
or your own mental workings, right?

1025
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
You don't control your brain.

1026
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,200
You just are your brain and whatever it does is what you do.

1027
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
And by the way, Monkey, how old are you again?

1028
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Are you 21?

1029
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
21.

1030
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
Alright, that's cool. Just wondering.

1031
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,200
I don't know why you had to ask that in such a weird way.

1032
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
I was curious because I'm 26.

1033
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,200
He wants to know if I'm legal because we're meeting up after the show.

1034
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
That's right, that's right.

1035
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,200
But yeah, because of the way...

1036
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,200
To get way the fuck back to a point I was making earlier.

1037
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Like, when I see people saying stuff like that

1038
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,200
about ISIS or killers and stuff like that,

1039
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,200
whenever someone's like, wow, what a monster,

1040
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
I'm like, but you get it, right?

1041
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,200
Surely you can understand where that person's coming from

1042
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,200
and if we could do that, then we'd have such an easier time

1043
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,200
of fixing those things.

1044
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,200
And I think the real reason that we can't

1045
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,200
is that you'd have to create an objective standard

1046
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
and you can't do that

1047
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
because everyone sees the world differently

1048
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
and I think...

1049
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Maybe this is true of every culture,

1050
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,200
but certainly here in America we are very self-righteous

1051
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,200
and self-important about our view of the world.

1052
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,200
We see it as everyone who doesn't feel exactly how we feel

1053
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,200
is wrong, but we're outnumbered.

1054
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,200
There's way more people in China who believe

1055
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
that what they're doing is right

1056
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
and we're not going to convince them to join our side.

1057
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,200
So trying to set up that kind of objective standard

1058
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,200
is virtually impossible

1059
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
and even within one society,

1060
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,200
what I want the world to become doesn't match

1061
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,200
what my next door neighbor wants the world to become.

1062
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
And that's sort of the problem,

1063
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,200
but I think that if everyone understood psychology

1064
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,200
and we were all able to figure out

1065
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,200
why we're thinking the things we're thinking,

1066
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,200
then it would help us to break down

1067
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,200
all the differences between us

1068
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,200
because we could say,

1069
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
well, the reason those people believe that

1070
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,200
is that it fulfills them in these psychological ways.

1071
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,200
And if they understand that,

1072
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
then maybe they can figure out

1073
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,200
what would be the most beneficial way of thinking for them.

1074
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,200
And then the result of all this

1075
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,200
is that we end up with the Sybil system from PsychoPass

1076
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
and it turns out to be evil and...

1077
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,200
Yeah, it's tough to say what really the best solution is.

1078
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,200
And in the far future, right,

1079
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
when we're living in the dystopian,

1080
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200
I don't know if it's dystopian,

1081
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,200
we're living in the far future

1082
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,200
and the Sybil system has taken over

1083
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,200
and all documents from the modern day have been destroyed

1084
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,200
and someone finds Digi's review

1085
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
or Digi's analysis of PsychoPass

1086
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,200
and it becomes like a blueprint

1087
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,200
to how to take down their corrupt society.

1088
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,200
Well, my analysis of PsychoPass

1089
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,200
was that I thought the system was great

1090
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
and that's why my original review

1091
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
was super controversial.

1092
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
So it becomes like their holy texts.

1093
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,200
It becomes like the pillar of their society.

1094
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,200
I think one of the most controversial things

1095
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,200
I've ever said was that

1096
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,200
I think the Sybil system is a good idea

1097
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,200
because it's a completely authoritative system

1098
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
and it goes against everything our society believes in.

1099
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
People actually stop and thought about what that meant

1100
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,200
for you to say that.

1101
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
I think they'd be pretty, you know,

1102
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
they would raise a few eyebrows.

1103
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
Well, it's pretty funny.

1104
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,200
Yeah, he casually uses the N-word.

1105
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,200
That's the most controversial thing he said.

1106
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Yeah.

1107
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,200
Well, I think that...

1108
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,200
Okay, let's not start pretending that the N-word

1109
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
isn't anywhere wrong.

1110
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,200
Just for the record, the N-word is nigger.

1111
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,200
Yeah, that's right.

1112
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,200
If anyone was confused about what the N-word is,

1113
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
it's nigger, okay?

1114
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
Just so we're all on the same page.

1115
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Nigger, see?

1116
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,200
Digi, Digi, I'm calling.

1117
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,200
I'm calling the fucking police.

1118
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,200
Well, no, that actually goes right into the topic

1119
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200
of this whole thing.

1120
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,200
That's the problem with the world.

1121
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Nobody has empathy.

1122
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,200
Everyone's a nigger.

1123
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,200
Everyone in the whole world is a fucking sociopathic nigger,

1124
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,200
and they all need to go to nigger jail,

1125
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,200
which is just regular jail.

1126
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
Well, you know, I have a couple of songs

1127
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,200
on my upcoming album about this.

1128
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
About nigger jail?

1129
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,200
No, about, like, why I say the word...

1130
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
Society is the true nigger jail.

1131
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,200
About why I say the words nigger and nigger so much,

1132
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,200
which I think it's a fundamental lack of understanding

1133
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,200
to think that, okay, God, this drives me insane.

1134
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,200
There's this rapper called Milo, who I'm a fan of,

1135
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,200
but he seems to have a sort of disdain

1136
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,200
for white people listening to his music,

1137
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,200
and he's often mentioned how it's not okay

1138
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,200
that his white fans will say nigger at him and stuff,

1139
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,200
and I'm like, but dude, you say the word in your music,

1140
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,200
and your music is free, it's freely out there.

1141
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
Anyone can listen to it.

1142
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,200
And the people who are listening to your music,

1143
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,200
those words are now in their head.

1144
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,200
You know, like, if you grow up listening to rap music,

1145
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,200
it doesn't matter what race you are.

1146
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,200
You have grown up hearing the word nigger fucking constantly,

1147
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,200
and it means something to you.

1148
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,200
It doesn't mean, like, a black guy.

1149
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,200
It just, like, it means the unbelievable number

1150
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
of things nigger can mean.

1151
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,200
It can mean, you know, like, as YG's saying,

1152
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,200
my nigger, my nigger, which is obviously a positive context

1153
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,200
for the word, or, like, you know, fake niggas.

1154
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,200
Like, it's not saying, like, fake black people.

1155
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,200
It's fake niggas, you know?

1156
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,200
Like, these all mean something to me just as much as they mean

1157
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
something to whoever wrote those songs,

1158
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,200
and, like, I was raised on that.

1159
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,200
You can't erase that from my mind through fucking white guilt,

1160
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,200
you know, which I think is bullshit.

1161
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,200
Just to play devil's advocate.

1162
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
So are you saying that there's no situation

1163
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,200
where there could be a certain, you know, racial

1164
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,200
or cultural context in which he would like, you know,

1165
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,200
in which anything, not even that word,

1166
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,200
but something could be intended specifically

1167
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,200
for a certain group, or, you know, it shouldn't be...

1168
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,200
I mean, certainly, but if you're...

1169
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,200
Okay, here's the thing, when you're releasing...

1170
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,200
If you're not a racist, then saying nigger cannot be wrong.

1171
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,200
End of story.

1172
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,200
Yeah, I would agree with that.

1173
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Yeah, I agree, I agree.

1174
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,200
Like, there's definitely people who say...

1175
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,200
And I hear, because I live in Virginia,

1176
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,200
we're, like, right at the cross-section

1177
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,200
of the South and North, right?

1178
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,200
There's, like, incredibly racist people here.

1179
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,200
You know, like, super-racist, hillbilly fucks live in Virginia,

1180
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,200
even though right a neighborhood over is all black people.

1181
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
You know, there's no real racial tension here

1182
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,200
because it's such a, like, liberal-leaning city,

1183
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,200
but there's people who, like, really grew up

1184
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,200
with ingrained racism, and they still talk about it that way.

1185
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,200
And so I will hear sometimes, like, white ladies in their 40s

1186
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,200
being, like, oh, those niggers over there.

1187
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,200
You know, like...

1188
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
Dang.

1189
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,200
And I'm, like...

1190
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,200
It's not racist because they said nigger.

1191
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,200
It's racist because they're racist,

1192
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,200
because they obviously think of black people as lesser.

1193
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,200
It has nothing to do with what language...

1194
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,200
If they said those blacks over there,

1195
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,200
or even just those African-Americans,

1196
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,200
like, it's still racist because the context is that they're...

1197
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,200
they're just insulting black people for being black, you know?

1198
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,200
Okay, just to play Devil's Gap one more time,

1199
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
I know what people would say to this,

1200
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
is that, did you're not understanding,

1201
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,200
there's a cultural heritage to that word.

1202
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
It's been used to insult for generations.

1203
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
But the thing is...

1204
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
Oh, fuck you.

1205
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
I'm just saying.

1206
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,200
Cultural heritage.

1207
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,200
Nate, I just want to warn you, you're at two now,

1208
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,200
and if you play Devil's Advocate three times in a row,

1209
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
you actually become the devil.

1210
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
So just...

1211
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,200
So just please, please, you're on thin ice, okay?

1212
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,200
I think that...

1213
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,200
I think that language is always evolving.

1214
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,200
If you ask...

1215
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,200
And this is...

1216
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
Every time someone gets into an argument about, like,

1217
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,200
a prescriptive versus descriptive linguists,

1218
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,200
do you know those terms?

1219
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,200
Like, a prescriptive linguist is something...

1220
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,200
I don't know shit.

1221
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,200
Alright, someone who is a prescriptive linguist

1222
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,200
is someone who says that a word is like this,

1223
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,200
and everyone should use the word the same way.

1224
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
A descriptive linguist says,

1225
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,200
this is how people are actually using the word,

1226
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,200
this is what it actually means,

1227
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
so that's what it means.

1228
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,200
So, in other words, prescriptive, wrong, descriptive, right?

1229
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,200
Exactly.

1230
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,200
And if you read the dictionary...

1231
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,200
I really thought that this podcast would be us,

1232
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
you know, outlying our plans for mass murder.

1233
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,200
I didn't think that this would be what I signed up for,

1234
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,200
this linguistic debate.

1235
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,200
Well, to get through it real quick.

1236
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,200
So, the actual, like, Oxford dictionary is descriptive.

1237
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,200
Like, whatever language means at the time,

1238
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,200
that's what it says in the dictionary.

1239
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,200
They update it constantly

1240
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,200
to reflect the current definitions of words.

1241
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,200
They add in, like, lots of meme words have been added in.

1242
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Like, all those are real words because they're out there.

1243
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,200
They mean something, and therefore they are words.

1244
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,200
And I think that to try and drag a word,

1245
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,200
kicking and screaming back to its origin point,

1246
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,200
is totally missing the point.

1247
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,200
The word nigga does not mean that anymore.

1248
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,200
It has proliferated culture to such an extent

1249
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,200
that there's no getting rid of it.

1250
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,200
And there's words that have, like, I think faggot

1251
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,200
has waned in popularity lately.

1252
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
And I think the reason for that is that

1253
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,200
I think most people kind of see it

1254
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,200
as an insult towards gay people, right?

1255
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Like, when you say faggot, it feels like it means

1256
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
you're gay and that's bad.

1257
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,200
And that's why not as many people are using it.

1258
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,200
And we have a great replacement word.

1259
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,200
I don't see it that way.

1260
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,200
I mean, I don't think it's...

1261
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,200
I think faggot's fine.

1262
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,200
I don't have a huge problem with it.

1263
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,200
But I do think that because it feels more like that,

1264
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,200
it's waning away.

1265
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,200
But see, that totally depends on the person saying it.

1266
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,200
Now it's all this, like, nuanced stuff about

1267
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,200
whose fucking feelings are, like, the authority on the matter.

1268
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,200
Right.

1269
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,200
Like a chime in on the nigger discussion,

1270
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,200
that you might have an anecdote that you might find amusing.

1271
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,200
I do agree with everything DigiBro is saying, actually.

1272
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,200
And I regret that earlier I said the n-word

1273
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,200
and started all this.

1274
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,200
I should have just said nigger because in my view,

1275
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
it is completely about the context.

1276
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,200
Calling somebody a nigger to their face

1277
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,200
in an inflammatory way is, of course, wrong.

1278
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,200
But if we're having a discussion about nigger,

1279
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,200
why would you say the n-word?

1280
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,200
But back when I was in high school,

1281
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,200
we were reading...

1282
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,200
It was like to kill a mockingbird, you know, one of those books.

1283
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,200
And it was when you go in a circle

1284
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,200
and each person reads, like, a paragraph and it goes on.

1285
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,200
And there's this...

1286
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
Oh boy.

1287
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,200
There it comes.

1288
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,200
There's this little super religious uptight bitch

1289
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,200
named Mikayla in my class.

1290
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,200
Oh, everybody knows I'm a fucking Mikayla, man.

1291
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,200
I hate Mikayla.

1292
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,200
We've all got our own bitch.

1293
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,200
And you know what, Mikayla is, like, the perfect name

1294
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,200
for that kind of person.

1295
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,200
That's like the nigger for that kind of person.

1296
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,200
From now on, when I say Mikayla, that's...

1297
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,200
So here's my story about Mikayla.

1298
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1299
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,200
This is where I discovered that she is a hideous human being.

1300
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,200
Because she refused to say any cuss words, right?

1301
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,200
She would skip over it.

1302
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,200
The word bitch was in it, so she skipped over the word bitch.

1303
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,200
Next sentence, she said the word nigger.

1304
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,200
And I couldn't fucking believe it.

1305
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,200
Are you fucking kidding me, Mikayla?

1306
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
Okay, was she guilty or was she just like,

1307
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,200
yeah, that's what I do.

1308
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,200
She thought nigger was okay to say, but not bitch.

1309
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,200
Oh, my God.

1310
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,200
That tells me something about her home life, you know.

1311
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Is it possible that she actually didn't know the word?

1312
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
No, this was 11th grade.

1313
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Well, maybe because Mikayla's are such niggers,

1314
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
she thought it was okay.

1315
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,200
Oh, my God, that is priceless.

1316
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Yeah, no, but I...

1317
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,200
Anyway, just to finish off what I was saying before that,

1318
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,200
I just think because Faggot has...

1319
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,200
Not to say that I think it has negative implication,

1320
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,200
but I think enough people feel kind of wrong about saying it,

1321
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,200
that it's faded in popularity as a word.

1322
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,200
You don't hear it nearly as much.

1323
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,200
Everyone clearly thinks it's a problem.

1324
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,200
But the word nigger is not a bad word

1325
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,200
in like 99% of the context it's used in.

1326
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,200
Like, if you listen to, again, if you listen to any rap music,

1327
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,200
you've heard the word a thousand million times,

1328
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
usually in a positive context.

1329
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,200
And like, so when people think that word,

1330
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,200
it's not usually to mean like, you know, fucking black people.

1331
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,200
It's usually to just...

1332
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,200
I mean, the people who use the word by far the most are black people, you know.

1333
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,200
Just to chime in with my perspective,

1334
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,200
I did not grow up saying or hearing the word.

1335
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,200
I didn't know the word until like a black friend of mine

1336
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,200
in like 5th or 6th grade told it to me and explained it to me.

1337
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:01,200
Yeah, and, you know, I never listened to rap.

1338
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,200
I never listened to rap growing up.

1339
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
So I don't make a habit of saying the word

1340
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,200
because it's not part of the way that I grew up speaking.

1341
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,200
But I totally agree with you guys in that it has plenty of...

1342
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,200
Yeah, there's plenty of use.

1343
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,200
And you know what?

1344
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Alright, I'm doing it.

1345
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,200
I'm playing devil's advocate one more time.

1346
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,200
I'm going to lose the devil!

1347
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,200
I have no sympathy for the devil!

1348
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,200
But we can definitely have empathy.

1349
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,200
That's right.

1350
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,200
So, okay, just about the usage of the word.

1351
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,200
I'm just noticing that there's something going on here

1352
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,200
where like it's about like the feelings of the people using it.

1353
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
And I just want to raise the issue of

1354
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
what if like there's a small group of people

1355
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,200
who views a word a certain way

1356
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
and they're kind of contained in their own community.

1357
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,200
And then let's just say everybody else uses it a different way.

1358
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,200
Are those people wrong to be, let's say, offended by the word?

1359
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,200
That's a great question.

1360
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,200
And I don't think anyone's wrong to be offended.

1361
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,200
But I think that on some level we have to draw a line, right?

1362
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,200
I agree.

1363
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,200
It's a practical issue.

1364
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,200
I would just say that those people should understand

1365
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,200
and take into consideration that different people

1366
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,200
use words differently.

1367
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,200
I mean, here's the thing.

1368
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,200
I say nigger all the time because of the fact

1369
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,200
that it's not that I don't expect people to be offended.

1370
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,200
It's that those kind of people I'm okay with losing.

1371
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
Like every time I make a video,

1372
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,200
I make a decision between like...

1373
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,200
Because, you know, if you're not saying certain words

1374
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,200
in your videos, there's only one reason.

1375
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,200
It's that you don't want to offend other people.

1376
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,200
And the only reason in the world not to try to offend people

1377
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,200
is that you think it will affect you somehow.

1378
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,200
That it will either make you feel bad

1379
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,200
or it'll make so fewer people watch your videos, right?

1380
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,200
And so...

1381
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,200
Did you, that sounds like you're a sociopath.

1382
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,200
That just sounds like being practical, dude.

1383
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,200
The only reason to not hurt people's feelings

1384
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
is so it doesn't hurt me somehow.

1385
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
I think that's what...

1386
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,200
I think, like, I mean, people will say, like,

1387
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
you know, oh, I'm concerned about others,

1388
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,200
but I think being concerned about others

1389
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,200
is a result of being concerned about yourself.

1390
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,200
Yeah, like, why do people start neighborhood watches?

1391
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,200
It's because they don't want to get their shit jacked.

1392
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,200
You guys are all evil.

1393
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,200
No, I totally am with Ditchy on this one.

1394
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,200
Yeah, you're totally right.

1395
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
It's all...

1396
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
I've never read a book by Ann Rand,

1397
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,200
but I'm all about that Randian objectivity,

1398
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,200
objectivist's rational self-interest mindset.

1399
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,200
That's what it's all about and everything else.

1400
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,200
Everything else is just a fucking lie and vanity.

1401
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,200
I think that everything makes...

1402
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
I'm not shit.

1403
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,200
I just think everything makes the most sense

1404
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,200
if you look at it, like, logically, right?

1405
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,200
Like, okay, why do we have emotions?

1406
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,200
Because in our best self-interest,

1407
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,200
like, if we want to survive better,

1408
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,200
then it's in our best interest to connect with other people.

1409
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,200
Because as a community, we have better chances of survival.

1410
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,200
We can watch each other's backs.

1411
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
We can, you know, do all that.

1412
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,200
So how do we make ourselves care about other people?

1413
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,200
Well, that's where, like, emotions would come in, right?

1414
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
You get sad when someone dies,

1415
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
because ultimately it affects the community,

1416
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
which means it affects you.

1417
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,200
And, like, you don't necessarily understand it that way.

1418
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
You don't perceive it that way.

1419
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
But all the emotions you feel, they make sense

1420
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
if you look at it from the perspective of, like,

1421
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,200
how does this affect me, you know?

1422
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,200
So I do think...

1423
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
And that's the reason why we have such a hard time

1424
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
empathizing with people who we don't think affect us.

1425
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Like, if we're at war with another culture,

1426
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,200
then those people dying, we're like,

1427
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,200
well, that benefits us.

1428
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,200
So fuck them, you know?

1429
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
Whereas if it was our teammates dying,

1430
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,200
then it's like, we've lost something.

1431
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,200
So, you know...

1432
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
So I do think that all of it comes down to self-interest.

1433
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,200
This reminds me of this guy I used to work with

1434
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,200
who confessed to me that he would be upset

1435
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,200
if his parents died only because of the financial burden

1436
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,200
it would cause him.

1437
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,200
Well, he says that.

1438
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Well, that is one legitimate reason that I would be upset

1439
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
for that reason as well as other reasons.

1440
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,200
I mean, I am very emotionally attached to my parents.

1441
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,200
And it's not like if they died, it'd be like,

1442
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
oh, it's all me.

1443
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
I'd be sad about their death.

1444
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,200
I'd be sad because it's them.

1445
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,200
But the reason I have those emotions in the first place

1446
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,200
is that they make sense.

1447
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,200
Your parents are the ones who are protecting you.

1448
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,200
They're a huge part of your life.

1449
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,200
They brought you here.

1450
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,200
They're a huge part of what you associate

1451
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
with sustainability.

1452
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,200
It's like having these figures who, for most of your life,

1453
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,200
were your sustainability.

1454
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,200
So, of course, you're going to feel tragically hurt if they die.

1455
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,200
So I feel like that guy is not wrong.

1456
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,200
He's just looking at it from an extremely cynical perspective.

1457
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,200
I mean, that guy must have a rocky relationship.

1458
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,200
If, in fact, he was telling the truth

1459
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,200
and not just having a goof, which I suspect personally.

1460
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
Not just being edgy.

1461
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,200
I would never associate with edgy people.

1462
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,200
Get the fuck out of here.

1463
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,200
I listened to an interview with Anne Rand.

1464
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,200
It really bothered me because the guy...

1465
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,200
No, it was an old interview.

1466
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,200
It was black and white. It was real old.

1467
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
But the guy interviewing her was like,

1468
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,200
he was being such a dick.

1469
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,200
I saw other interviews where he was totally civil.

1470
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:09,200
But with Anne Rand, he clearly had an animosity towards her ideals

1471
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,200
and was trying to catch her out and kind of point...

1472
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,200
He was really trying to come at it from, like,

1473
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,200
you're wrong and let me prove it.

1474
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,200
He was like, oh, you say that it's all about mankind's rational self-interest,

1475
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
but you're married, aren't you?

1476
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
You financially support your husband, don't you?

1477
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,200
What the fuck's up with that? How does that jive with your gay ass philosophy?

1478
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,200
It's basically what he was to say.

1479
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,200
He does you piece of shit.

1480
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,200
I watched those interviews after I read all the books.

1481
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,200
And holy shit, that fucking guy just did...

1482
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,200
Forget the mouth.

1483
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,200
You know the same one. You're talking about the same one.

1484
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Glasses, piece of shit, asshole, I remember him.

1485
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,200
No, no, he wasn't right here.

1486
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,200
I don't necessarily agree with, like, Anne Rand's stance that, like...

1487
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,200
Alright, but this guy's the problem. This fucking idiot.

1488
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200
It's like, wait a minute.

1489
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,200
It's so easy. That guy just needed some fucking empathy

1490
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,200
because if he had even an ounce of it,

1491
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,200
it would have been so easy for him to square the idea

1492
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,200
of financially supporting someone else with one's rational self-interest.

1493
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,200
It is not complicated.

1494
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,200
There's a world where, like, maybe have a greater understanding

1495
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,200
of the fucking way that life works.

1496
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,200
It is not difficult to understand how those two things can jive with each other.

1497
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,200
I've always said that, like, the reason I have sort of a...

1498
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,200
Not necessarily, like, socialist,

1499
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,200
I would say I'm probably somewhere between that and, like, a libertarian.

1500
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,200
Again, I'm, like, an Aberdorf linkler. I believe in every fucking thing.

1501
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,200
But, like, I think, like, the socialist ideas make sense

1502
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,200
because, ultimately, having more people who are better off

1503
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,200
will benefit us because we make progress faster.

1504
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,200
Like, if more of the, like, uneducated and badly off people

1505
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:44,200
were doing better and they had better odds of, like, becoming scientists or whatever,

1506
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,200
and then we got more scientists and we're chugging along better.

1507
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,200
You know, like, it makes sense to lift people up from the bottom.

1508
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,200
And for what it's worth, Ayn Rand...

1509
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Like, I mean, anyone can, like, espouse beliefs

1510
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,200
and not necessarily uphold themselves to them.

1511
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,200
Ayn Rand herself did live on welfare for the last part of her life.

1512
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,200
So, totally against everything she stood for.

1513
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
But, uh...

1514
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,200
Look, I can't even find that hilarious.

1515
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Consider yourself a book writer, storyman,

1516
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,200
as opposed to a philosopher.

1517
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Nobody's perfect.

1518
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,200
Yeah.

1519
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,200
Nobody's perfect.

1520
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,200
Is it Ayn Rand or Ayn Rand?

1521
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,200
Nobody cares.

1522
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,200
Ayn Rand sounds like it's short for Anus Rand.

1523
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,200
Yeah.

1524
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,200
And I can't take someone seriously who's named Anus.

1525
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,200
She looked a bit like an Anus in her later years.

1526
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,200
She is an ugly woman, that is for sure.

1527
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,200
Yeah, she was no Dagny Tiger.

1528
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,200
Yeah, but she had a beautiful heart, though.

1529
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,200
A lot of Natalie Shrugged character, yeah.

1530
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,200
Why are you laughing?

1531
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,200
Because women are shit.

1532
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,200
Lol, okay.

1533
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Um...

1534
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,200
You know...

1535
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,200
If Elliot...

1536
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,200
If Elliot Rodgers were in charge,

1537
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,200
she would have been in a fucking cage

1538
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,200
being artificially inseminated.

1539
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,200
And that would have just been wrong.

1540
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,200
In that interview that you saw,

1541
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,200
did, like, was that glasses guy,

1542
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,200
like, trying to prod her about her philosophy?

1543
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,200
And she said,

1544
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,200
well, at least I'm beautiful on the outside.

1545
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,200
And then he looks at the camera like,

1546
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,200
I don't know.

1547
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,200
That was probably cut for time.

1548
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,200
You know, I'm sure it was good.

1549
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,200
He, like, he adjusts his tie,

1550
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,200
and makes an audible goal.

1551
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,200
She's like a borderline Skeletor.

1552
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,200
Oh, whatever, man.

1553
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,200
She's an old-ass bitch.

1554
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,200
Cut her some slack, for fuck's sake.

1555
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,200
Even when she was young,

1556
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,200
she was fucking weird with you.

1557
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,200
She's an old-ass dead bitch.

1558
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Come on.

1559
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,200
I've never seen...

1560
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,200
I've never seen young men.

1561
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,200
I'm Googling her.

1562
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,200
You're fucking lying to me.

1563
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,200
I don't think Ayn Rand ever was young.

1564
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,200
I think she was born a crotchety old-ass.

1565
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,200
She looks fucking fine, dude.

1566
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,200
She looks perfectly fucking fine.

1567
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,200
Whatever.

1568
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Oh, I looked at...

1569
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
She was born from a haggle on the fourth.

1570
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,200
She looks like Franz Kafka,

1571
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,200
but a woman.

1572
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,200
Yeah, I guess she does.

1573
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,200
It's the photography of the time.

1574
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
Okay, well...

1575
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,200
Hey, let's bring this conversation

1576
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,200
back to empathy,

1577
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,200
and let's talk about...

1578
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,200
Do you guys have any thoughts on

1579
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,200
who in our society, or who in the world,

1580
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,200
needs or deserves more empathy than they get?

1581
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
Me.

1582
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
Hmm.

1583
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,200
I agree.

1584
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
I agree with that.

1585
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,200
I agree with that.

1586
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,200
I have a very controversial answer

1587
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,200
that I'll probably regret saying.

1588
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,200
Uh-oh.

1589
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,200
Go ahead and go for it.

1590
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,200
That's what I was hoping for.

1591
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
That is exactly what I wanted.

1592
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
So, all jokes and memes aside,

1593
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,200
I do think society is too hard on pedophiles,

1594
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
and that's because they assume

1595
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
all pedophiles want to...

1596
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
I agree with that wholeheartedly.

1597
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Oh, I'm so glad you brought that up.

1598
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
I really wanted to talk about your thoughts on that.

1599
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,200
What a surprise.

1600
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,200
We all agree with that.

1601
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,200
All right, first of all, first of all,

1602
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,200
this is the only neighborhood you could have

1603
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,200
walked into, and everyone's like,

1604
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
oh, yeah, pedophiles, of course.

1605
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,200
No, no, it makes perfect sense, though,

1606
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,200
because I think a lot of people would agree

1607
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,200
that if you take a step back and look at it,

1608
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,200
they didn't ask to be that way.

1609
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,200
Exactly.

1610
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,200
That's the biggest thing.

1611
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,200
First of all, if we can have this whole cultural revolution

1612
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,200
about the gays and say the gays...

1613
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,200
I don't know why I'm emphasizing the gays.

1614
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,200
The gays.

1615
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,200
But if we can say that gay people are born that way,

1616
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
and we're all confident in that now,

1617
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,200
why are we not extending the same thing to pedophiles?

1618
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,200
Because they're associated with hurting children,

1619
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,200
just like the gays used to be back in the day.

1620
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
Right.

1621
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,200
And it's extended to things that are absolutely ludicrous,

1622
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,200
like in most places in the world.

1623
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
Ludicrous?

1624
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
Whatever, ludicrous.

1625
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,200
My favorite rapper.

1626
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,200
My favorite rapper, ludicrous.

1627
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,200
Yeah, I enjoyed his rap folding paper.

1628
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,200
I was...

1629
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,200
What was I fucking saying?

1630
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,200
Oh, I've completely lost.

1631
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,200
They extend things to things that are ludicrous.

1632
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,200
They extend the idea of gays being...

1633
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,200
I've lost it. It's gone.

1634
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,200
His great pedophile anthem pimping all over the world.

1635
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,200
I don't want to fuck anything except the loli.

1636
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Except the loli.

1637
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
Oh, yeah, you should listen to my loli rap.

1638
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,200
Oh, you know, okay, whatever.

1639
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,200
It's not a rap.

1640
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,200
Whatever.

1641
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,200
My fucking song.

1642
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,200
I'm all mixed up now.

1643
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,200
Think about ludicrous.

1644
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,200
You know what?

1645
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,200
If Corey in the house is an anime,

1646
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,200
then the loli song is a rap.

1647
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,200
So there you go.

1648
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,200
I was going to say that things have extended to a ludicrous degree

1649
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,200
by banning even...

1650
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,200
I'm talking about anime of loli porn.

1651
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,200
That's what I'm trying to say.

1652
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,200
Absolutely ridiculous.

1653
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:07,200
Didn't Australia ban Hentai that had flat-chested girls in it?

1654
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,200
No, no.

1655
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,200
Australia did one better.

1656
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,200
Australia banned all pornography with A-cup breasts,

1657
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,200
including live-action pornography with women over the age of 18.

1658
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,200
Things have gone so far over the fucking deep end.

1659
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,200
It's ridiculous.

1660
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,200
That makes me so angry.

1661
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,200
You know what?

1662
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,200
You know what?

1663
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,200
Okay, whatever you might have to say about pornography.

1664
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,200
I think that doing that, banning that specific pornography,

1665
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,200
is fucking dehumanizing to people with small boobs.

1666
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,200
Of course.

1667
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,200
Even way more so than porn itself could ever be.

1668
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,200
Yeah.

1669
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,200
And you know, just the opposite end of that spectrum

1670
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,200
is how people get into tizzy when...

1671
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,200
Like, there's a little bit of a tizzy about

1672
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,200
if Tifa's gonna have big tits,

1673
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,200
even though the character has big tits.

1674
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,200
And I talked to plenty of girls in the real world

1675
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,200
who have big tits that are like...

1676
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
Are you a liar?

1677
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,200
No, it's true.

1678
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,200
I swear to God.

1679
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,200
And they tell me that the fact that Tifa would be reduced

1680
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:10,200
in chest size is dehumanizing to actual real-life big-titted women.

1681
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,200
You have to fit within this fucking narrow limit

1682
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,200
of what's socially and morally acceptable.

1683
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,200
If you just physically don't fit that standard,

1684
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,200
there is something wrong with you, and it's so fucked up.

1685
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,200
Makes me so mad.

1686
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,200
Yeah, let me...

1687
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,200
Okay, I was on Twitter the other day as I often am,

1688
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,200
and I saw one of my followers, an artist,

1689
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,200
and she posted a thing that was like, you know,

1690
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,200
my art then and my art now,

1691
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,200
and it was like a drawing of like an idle girl

1692
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,200
with a microphone doing a song and dance, whatever.

1693
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,200
And the new one was better,

1694
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,200
but I couldn't help but notice that the old one was skinny,

1695
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,200
and the new one had like a noticeable potbelly.

1696
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,200
And I was like, is that...

1697
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,200
I wonder, is that part of the improvement

1698
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,200
that I'm meant to be seeing here?

1699
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,200
Is the implication here that that is necessarily better?

1700
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,200
She's become enlightened about body positivity, dude.

1701
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,200
Can we all agree that fat people

1702
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,200
deserve to be ashamed of themselves?

1703
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,200
They deserve to be thrown to concentration camps

1704
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,200
and burned a lot.

1705
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,200
I'm speaking as someone...

1706
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,200
I'm not grotesquely fat,

1707
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,200
but I feel ashamed of how fat I am right now,

1708
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
and I find that to be healthy.

1709
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,200
I think I should be ashamed because I should be healthier.

1710
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,200
I should be working out.

1711
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,200
It's a motivating fucking factor.

1712
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,200
Because you feel exponentially better

1713
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,200
when you're not fat.

1714
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,200
I've been there, and it's a much better...

1715
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Not only do you feel better, you function better.

1716
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,200
I think that shame is a healthy component of a good society.

1717
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,200
I agree.

1718
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,200
Shame is important.

1719
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,200
How else do you get people to desert you?

1720
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,200
Shame, shame, and go vote it up.

1721
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,200
We can't force people to do things.

1722
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,200
You can't force people to eat healthy.

1723
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,200
So instead, we've got this shaming mechanic.

1724
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,200
You have to do something if you want people to...

1725
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,200
We're not going to say...

1726
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,200
I don't think it's right to have us pretend

1727
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:54,200
that we find something attractive that we don't.

1728
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,200
How unfair is it?

1729
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,200
If you're super fat,

1730
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,200
and you're like,

1731
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,200
oh, body positivity, I deserve to look the way I want,

1732
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,200
people should respect that,

1733
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,200
do you extend that same thing to just horribly ugly people?

1734
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,200
Would you pretend you found them attractive?

1735
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,200
Because you'll notice that in all of this art

1736
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,200
that's coming out of Tumblr,

1737
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,200
no matter how fat the characters are,

1738
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,200
they're still drawn with normal proportioned faces.

1739
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
Oh my god.

1740
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,200
Oh my fucking god.

1741
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,200
This is such a pet peeve of mine.

1742
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,200
When people draw May from fucking Overwatch,

1743
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,200
they'll draw her with huge tits,

1744
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,200
and a huge ass and giant thighs,

1745
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,200
and a tiny waist.

1746
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,200
They draw her looking fucking sexy as hell,

1747
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,200
like hyper-sexualized, hyper-idealized body image,

1748
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,200
and then they'll do that and say,

1749
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,200
yes, so progressive, an overweight character,

1750
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,200
a fat character, someone that I can relate to,

1751
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,200
no, no, you fucking hypocrites,

1752
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,200
you fucking bastards, you should all die,

1753
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,200
you should all die for failing to understand this,

1754
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,200
that it's not the fucking same,

1755
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,200
that what you're doing is exactly the same

1756
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,200
as the thing that you claim to be against.

1757
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,200
Oh my fucking god, when people don't get that.

1758
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,200
I see these trifling ass hoes

1759
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,200
that are just big fat women who say like,

1760
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,200
I, you know, people should love me for who I am,

1761
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,200
but of course I'm not gonna date a fat guy, obviously not,

1762
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,200
why would I do that?

1763
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,200
That'd be fucking retarded, no way.

1764
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,200
I see it, it's real, it's real.

1765
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,200
When people draw, yeah, like I would respect someone

1766
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,200
who drew like a comic or something

1767
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,200
with a character who is legitimately fucking ugly.

1768
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,200
By the way, it's bad if men do that too.

1769
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,200
But when someone draws someone who is obviously hot,

1770
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,200
just they have really big thighs

1771
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,200
and pretend that that is somehow pushing an envelope,

1772
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,200
fuck them, fuck them.

1773
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,200
Oh, there's a lot of passion on this subject, I like it.

1774
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,200
Yeah, this is a great show.

1775
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,200
Yeah, just, that drives me crazy.

1776
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,200
Like the idea, look, we're on the...

1777
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,200
My audio is clipping like crazy, so sorry for that.

1778
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,200
We are a YouTube...

1779
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,200
This is a YouTube internet podcast,

1780
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,200
inevitably, there's no way that a significant portion

1781
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,200
of our audience is not fat.

1782
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,200
Right, right.

1783
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,200
And that's fine.

1784
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,200
That's fine.

1785
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,200
You're not a worse person, necessarily, for being fat.

1786
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,200
Well, I mean, you are, but like, you know...

1787
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,200
But it sure isn't making you a better person.

1788
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,200
But here's the thing, I think most fat people

1789
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,200
appreciate that they're not attractive.

1790
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,200
Like, okay, one of my best friends,

1791
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,200
my friend Dansan, I don't know if you guys have seen him,

1792
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,200
he's like 300 fucking pounds.

1793
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,200
He makes no excuses for that.

1794
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,200
He thinks of himself as like,

1795
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,200
I am not attractive, I'm not trying to go out

1796
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,200
and like fucking pick up chicks.

1797
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,200
I don't expect anyone to think I'm good looking.

1798
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,200
You know, like, he's...

1799
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,200
Yeah, he kind of...

1800
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,200
I mean, he's not ugly.

1801
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,200
Like, that's the thing, he's really fat.

1802
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,200
He's chiefly, dude, he's chiefly.

1803
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,200
I would say you can be ugly, right?

1804
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,200
And you can recognize that you are traditionally ugly.

1805
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,200
And you can still, like, you know, be positive

1806
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,200
about yourself and be proactive.

1807
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,200
And you can still go out and be social

1808
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,200
and meet people and fucking fuck people if you want.

1809
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,200
There are people that will fuck you no matter how ugly you are.

1810
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,200
And that goes for men and women.

1811
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,200
If you want to be...

1812
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,200
If you want to be the place where the ugly people live.

1813
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,200
If you want to be happy with yourself,

1814
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,200
the key to that is not to, like, try to convince you

1815
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,200
that you're something you're not.

1816
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,200
It's to be happy with what you are.

1817
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,200
If you're fucking fat, don't be like,

1818
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,200
everyone should say that I'm beautiful.

1819
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,200
No, you're ugly, deal with that,

1820
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,200
and be happy anyways.

1821
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,200
Just be happy for other reasons.

1822
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,200
Let me put a caveat on this.

1823
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,200
A lot of people will...

1824
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,200
To an extent, I agree that, like,

1825
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,200
there is a reason for fat stigma.

1826
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,200
And that's because being fat is not necessarily healthy

1827
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,200
and a person can improve themselves

1828
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,200
potentially, you know, get thinner.

1829
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,200
Yes, that can be done.

1830
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,200
But I feel like a lot of people when they do that,

1831
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,200
they sort of make this sort of insinuation

1832
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,200
that anyone can look...

1833
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,200
Anyone can be as thin as they want to be.

1834
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,200
Anyone can have the body that they want.

1835
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,200
And there are things about people's bodies

1836
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,200
and there are ways that people look.

1837
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,200
Including, to a certain extent, weight.

1838
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,200
Not entirely, that are out of people's control.

1839
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,200
And I think it's unfair to act as though

1840
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,200
every aspect of a person's appearance

1841
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,200
is under their control.

1842
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,200
Yeah, I completely agree.

1843
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,200
I just think, like, I think that...

1844
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,200
How do I put it?

1845
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,200
You can't make yourself a 10.

1846
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,200
But you can at least make yourself healthy.

1847
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,200
And it'll give you more confidence.

1848
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,200
It'll probably make you just like a better person all around.

1849
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,200
Like, you know, that same friend, Don Son,

1850
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,200
he was 350 pounds at a time.

1851
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,200
He got onto a diet

1852
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,200
and he lost...

1853
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,200
He did the keto diet.

1854
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,200
He lost 100 pounds in a year.

1855
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,200
He burned off 100 fucking pounds.

1856
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,200
And, like, it didn't make him attractive.

1857
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,200
Like, first of all, he never got...

1858
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,200
He still just looks like himself.

1859
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,200
Just a slightly skinnier version.

1860
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,200
He got, you know, muscular

1861
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,200
and he was still fat, but you could tell

1862
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,200
he was like, you know, a beast.

1863
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,200
But he wasn't doing it because he thought it would make him hot.

1864
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,200
He was doing it because he was fucking out of shape.

1865
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,200
And he had difficulty...

1866
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,200
You know, we would go on, like, these hikes and stuff,

1867
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,200
like, every year. Like, the first time,

1868
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,200
it was almost impossible for him.

1869
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,200
He would have a hard time going to fucking Otacon

1870
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,200
and walking around. And so he got fucking fit.

1871
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,200
And ever since then, he's been a way more confident person.

1872
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,200
And here's the funny thing.

1873
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,200
He regained that 100 pounds.

1874
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,200
Like, as soon as he got a job,

1875
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,200
he completely stopped working out,

1876
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,200
fell off his diet, regained 100 pounds.

1877
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,200
But he's still, like, you know, all the...

1878
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,200
But he kept the confidence?

1879
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,200
Yeah, he kept the confidence. Like, everything he learned

1880
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,200
from gaining. That's a good deal.

1881
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,200
Because he knows he could do it if he wanted to.

1882
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,200
Like, if he wanted to lose 100 pounds,

1883
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,200
he knows how it works now, and he could do that.

1884
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,200
And it's like, well, you know,

1885
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,200
he's comfortable with himself as a...

1886
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,200
Like, he never really had a huge problem with the fact

1887
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,200
that he was fat as, like, a personal thing.

1888
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,200
Like, he always just saw it as, like, yeah, whatever.

1889
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,200
I just like to eat a lot, you know, like, fuck it.

1890
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,200
And by the way, let me just touch for a second

1891
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,200
on what I believe is the origin of all of this

1892
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,200
and is the biggest problem with this

1893
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,200
and probably the biggest problem in the universe.

1894
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,200
And it's... Yeah, that's right, that's right.

1895
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,200
It's bigger than asteroids?

1896
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,200
Is that what it was?

1897
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,200
Well, it depends.

1898
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,200
Maybe, maybe. I mean, they're kind of interlinked.

1899
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,200
But it really is

1900
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,200
an entitlement to

1901
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,200
happiness and a cultural

1902
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,200
desire to remove all

1903
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,200
unhappy things from your life.

1904
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,200
Because there's this perception, and it's getting

1905
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,200
bigger and bigger, that

1906
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,200
you should not have to experience bad things

1907
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,200
in your life. And that

1908
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,200
the more happiness you have

1909
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,200
just all the time, your life is

1910
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,200
objectively better. That is, in fact, not true.

1911
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,200
Happiness is way overrated

1912
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,200
because it doesn't get jacked shit

1913
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,200
done. The only things that are

1914
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,200
worth doing in life are things that are in

1915
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,200
the pursuit of happiness and that

1916
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,200
achieve a larger goal that makes humanity

1917
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,200
better.

1918
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,200
I don't know how much I agree. I believe it.

1919
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,200
I think it's fine to cut, like,

1920
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,200
I mean, that's like saying that you

1921
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,200
have to have negative things

1922
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,200
in your life. I don't think that's true at all.

1923
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,200
They build character, dude. You do. You absolutely do.

1924
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,200
Even having to get up in the morning

1925
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,200
is a negative thing you have to do.

1926
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,200
Do you think I'd be better off if I

1927
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,200
subjected myself to every retarded comment

1928
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,200
I get, as opposed to banning

1929
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,200
those people? Okay, there are practical

1930
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,200
limits to what I'm talking about here.

1931
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,200
I'm saying that, like, I think there's a huge difference

1932
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,200
between saying, I'm going

1933
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,200
to avoid things that make me upset

1934
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,200
and everyone else has to

1935
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,200
make it so I don't see

1936
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,200
something that makes me upset.

1937
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,200
Hey, you know, that brings me to a great

1938
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,200
and indefinitely, definitely

1939
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,200
controversial monkey. You know, you're cool

1940
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,200
and all, but your topic was not controversial enough.

1941
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,200
This is going to blow your controversy

1942
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,200
of your pedophile thing out of the water.

1943
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,200
I have lots of empathy

1944
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,200
for shitty commenters.

1945
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,200
Yeah, that's weird. Get the fuck out of here.

1946
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,200
I don't understand that.

1947
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,200
I think that we need

1948
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,200
when you read a shitty comment, you really

1949
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,200
have to take a step back.

1950
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,200
And that this person just does not have

1951
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,200
the context that he needs

1952
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,200
to be not a shitty commenter.

1953
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,200
I have plenty of empathy for them, but

1954
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,200
it's like, okay, understand

1955
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,200
okay, if someone, like,

1956
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,200
stabbed me in the leg

1957
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,200
and I completely understood

1958
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,200
all of the reasons that they stabbed me in the leg

1959
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,200
I would still stab them back.

1960
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,200
Like, it doesn't...

1961
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,200
Even if it was a mistake,

1962
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,200
I mean, okay,

1963
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,200
let's say it was a total...

1964
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,200
stab you, you would stab them back.

1965
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,200
No, let's say it was a total

1966
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,200
let's say it was a total accident.

1967
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,200
I wouldn't stab them back,

1968
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,200
but I would expect reparation.

1969
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,200
Right? Like, let's say I'm standing...

1970
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,200
Are you fucking Indian?

1971
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,200
Like, if someone, like,

1972
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,200
throws a spear for some reason,

1973
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,200
like, there, let's... That's racist!

1974
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,200
I was thinking

1975
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,200
before he said anything about the word Indians.

1976
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,200
Oh, Lord, reparation, spear-throwing, this is off the rail.

1977
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,200
Well, I literally take sure

1978
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,200
you see Ace Ventura, too, the part where

1979
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,200
the African guy throws the spears into his legs

1980
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,200
because he's trying to give him a spear. Like that, right?

1981
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,200
So let's say, let's say someone's like

1982
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,200
trying, like, someone's trying to throw

1983
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,200
a spear at a target and they violently

1984
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,200
miss. In that incredibly specific scenario,

1985
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,200
if you're Ace Ventura

1986
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,200
and your friend is trying to give you a spear,

1987
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,200
and the spear hits me in the leg,

1988
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,200
then I'm not just gonna be like,

1989
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,200
oh, you know what, you missed, it's all good.

1990
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,200
I'm gonna be like, pay for my fucking surgery,

1991
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,200
because I can't walk anymore,

1992
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,200
you know? So that's the way

1993
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,200
I see it with comments, is like, no matter how

1994
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,200
stupid the person is, no matter how much I

1995
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,200
understand that they don't get what they've done,

1996
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,200
the fact is that they've made me mad

1997
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,200
and now I need to get something

1998
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,200
in return, you know?

1999
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,200
But did you have to be mad?

2000
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,200
Yeah.

2001
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,200
Did it need to make you mad?

2002
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Aren't you choosing to be mad?

2003
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,200
For deliberately fucking with another person.

2004
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,200
That's my philosophy on the whole world.

2005
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,200
Are they deliberately fucking with you,

2006
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,200
or they just not have the fucking

2007
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,200
context that they need?

2008
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,200
Are you such a Ben Saint that you completely

2009
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,200
control what makes you mad

2010
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,200
at all times?

2011
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,200
No, no, listen, I don't control it,

2012
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,200
but it's my responsibility

2013
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,200
what I get mad. Listen, this is what we need to do.

2014
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,200
What we need to do, each one of us, all five of us.

2015
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,200
Wait a minute, no, it's not your responsibility

2016
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,200
what makes you mad, that's what you're saying.

2017
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,200
Yes it is, it is my responsibility

2018
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,200
what makes me mad.

2019
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,200
It's your responsibility to not fuck with people

2020
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,200
I don't leave shitty comments on other people's videos

2021
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,200
they leave it because they're bad people.

2022
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,200
I don't know, maybe someone thinks your comments are shitty

2023
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,200
maybe somebody out there thinks your comments are shitty

2024
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,200
and gets mad about them, you know what?

2025
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,200
Hang on, Moki, what were you saying?

2026
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,200
I think what we need to do is each one of us

2027
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,200
go down the line and name

2028
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,200
all the types of comments that piss us off

2029
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,200
so that people know to never post those again.

2030
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,200
Go ahead Ben.

2031
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
Oh well, lucky for you, we've addressed this a little bit.

2032
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
I assume you know about comment or rules, our podcast.

2033
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,200
Yes.

2034
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,200
I don't think I was there, but there was a whole thing about it.

2035
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,200
Oh, I just wanted to trick you guys

2036
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,200
but it didn't work.

2037
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,200
I got to fucking let this cat out of my room

2038
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,200
she's driving me insane.

2039
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,200
God damn it, no, I'm not letting this happen.

2040
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
Anyway, how is it my fault

2041
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,200
if someone else decides to fuck with me?

2042
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,200
What's about a mentality, so after what you approach

2043
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,200
you know, what do you experience?

2044
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,200
I mean, but it's a fucking comment on the internet

2045
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,200
how does that actually affect you, why do you care?

2046
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
Because they're stupid, it's not okay

2047
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,200
for people to be stupid, they should be rounded up

2048
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,200
and sent to concentration camps.

2049
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,200
They're people,

2050
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,200
it's not their fault they're stupid,

2051
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,200
it's not their fault they're stupid, they're the product of their upbringing

2052
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,200
and their environment and their...

2053
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,200
But how do we know Ben?

2054
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,200
Ignorance of the law is not an excuse Ben.

2055
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,200
They could be malicious...

2056
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,200
What is that from?

2057
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
An excuse, yeah, what is an excuse from?

2058
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,200
Ignorance of the law is not, is that from a...

2059
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,200
That's just a fucking line for real life, that's just like a thing that happens.

2060
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,200
It sounds like something the Brisco brothers would say or something.

2061
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
I want to tell you but I also don't want to tell you

2062
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,200
because you don't...

2063
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,200
It's from Cool Cat, it's from fucking YMS's...

2064
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,200
No, it's from the Daddy Derek guy.

2065
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,200
Oh yeah!

2066
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,200
His fucking anti-copyright thing.

2067
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,200
Ignorance of the law is...

2068
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,200
God, I can't do his voice at all.

2069
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,200
It's not an excuse.

2070
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,200
What world are you living in

2071
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,200
where you have complete control over who and what makes you mad?

2072
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,200
I'm not, I don't have complete control of it

2073
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,200
but it's my problem.

2074
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,200
Well that's the thing Ben, what...

2075
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,200
Okay, I agree with the idea,

2076
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,200
my whole problem with social justice warriors and all that shit

2077
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,200
is that I see it as

2078
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,200
if you're the one who has a problem

2079
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,200
you have to go about solving it.

2080
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,200
Ben, you get mad at me 10 times a day!

2081
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,200
Are you admitting that it's all your fault and never mine?

2082
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,200
Um...

2083
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,200
Oh shit.

2084
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,200
I guess to a certain extent I would agree with that.

2085
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,200
I win! I win forever!

2086
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,200
You get in here folks!

2087
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,200
Ben fell into my fucking trap!

2088
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,200
That is a pretty good one.

2089
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,200
I think getting angry about internet comments at all

2090
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,200
is kind of on you because it's the internet.

2091
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,200
You have to expect that shit

2092
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,200
and to get upset about it is pretty hard.

2093
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,200
You're absolutely 100% wrong.

2094
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,200
I think the internet is meant for bad comments.

2095
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,200
No, I have such a problem with that mindset

2096
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,200
because that's like saying

2097
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,200
like, okay, if you...

2098
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,200
It sounds like you want to save space.

2099
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,200
What I want is reality.

2100
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,200
I want the world,

2101
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,200
I want the internet to become what it is

2102
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,200
which is reality.

2103
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,200
In reality, if you walk up to someone...

2104
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,200
You have the right mind of evil and hatred.

2105
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,200
But that's the thing, it's not.

2106
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,200
There was a time, I think, if you were talking about...

2107
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,200
That is reality though.

2108
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,200
If you were talking about the early 2000s

2109
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,200
or something like back when it was all just

2110
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,200
like a boys club of a bunch of 4chaners,

2111
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,200
then sure, but that's not what the internet is anymore.

2112
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,200
Everyone's on it.

2113
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,200
A second ago you were giving a prescriptive, descriptive

2114
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,200
argument about linguistics

2115
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,200
and now you can't accept that the internet has changed.

2116
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,200
It's not the definition you're used to.

2117
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,200
No, I'm saying that the internet has changed.

2118
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,200
There was a time back in the 2000s

2119
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,200
when it was just

2120
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,200
a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

2121
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,200
When if you went online,

2122
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,200
you should expect that it was going to be shit.

2123
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,200
But I don't think it's like that anymore

2124
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,200
and I think that us saying,

2125
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,200
oh, you should expect that on the internet.

2126
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,200
That's like saying, don't try to change anything.

2127
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,200
Just accept things as they are.

2128
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,200
Well, you know what, Digi?

2129
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,200
That is exactly what I would say.

2130
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,200
You should not try to change anything because the way

2131
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,200
the comments are on the internet is just how people are.

2132
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,200
Those are real people.

2133
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,200
That is how things are.

2134
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,200
I agree with you that that's how things are.

2135
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,200
We should be changing how things are.

2136
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,200
Yes, but any of you

2137
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,200
are on the internet and they can let their true flags fly.

2138
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,200
They can show their true colors.

2139
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,200
And guess what?

2140
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,200
A lot of people are stupid.

2141
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,200
A lot of people don't take the time to fully understand something

2142
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,200
before commenting on it and forming an opinion.

2143
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,200
Would you not rather that it wasn't like that?

2144
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,200
I would rather that it was possible.

2145
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,200
It is like that.

2146
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,200
It's not about expectation.

2147
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,200
It's about hopes.

2148
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,200
I have very low expectations for everything.

2149
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,200
All of humanity, I think they're all worthless.

2150
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,200
I have no expectations for anybody,

2151
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,200
but I hope they can be better.

2152
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,200
I hope that Harambe gets resurrected,

2153
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,200
but it's not going to happen.

2154
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,200
You have to be realistic.

2155
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,200
If you're being realistic, it's being weak.

2156
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,200
If you don't think you can make the world better,

2157
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,200
then you've given up.

2158
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,200
You're being a pussy.

2159
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,200
Make the world better.

2160
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,200
That's why I bleached the best series I've ever made.

2161
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,200
I really want to shit on you

2162
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,200
for that safe space comment.

2163
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,200
And I'll tell you why, because you fucking stupid memers.

2164
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,200
You whiny little petulant 4chan

2165
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,200
fucked.

2166
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,200
As soon as someone tells you

2167
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,200
that maybe you should be responsible for your own actions

2168
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,200
and not be a fucking cunt, what do you fall back at?

2169
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,200
Oh, you just want a safe space.

2170
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,200
What the fuck is the comment section then?

2171
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,200
If not your fucking safe space,

2172
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,200
where you think you can say whatever the fuck you want

2173
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,200
and fuck with people and piss people off.

2174
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,200
If you go on 4chan and everyone's complaining about

2175
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,200
oh, these college kids, they want safe spaces.

2176
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,200
Oh yeah, those stupid diluted college kids.

2177
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,200
They want a place where no one fucks with them.

2178
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,200
Well, what the fuck is 4chan?

2179
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,200
If not a safe space

2180
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,200
for bitter sociopathic little edulord fucks

2181
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,200
to wallow in their own misery

2182
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,200
and bring everyone down to their level.

2183
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,200
What is it if not a safe space? You fucking fuck!

2184
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,200
Yeah, it's an echo chamber.

2185
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,200
I completely agree.

2186
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,200
There's lots of them. They're all over the place.

2187
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,200
I love being there and saying shit.

2188
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,200
The reason why I use the term safe space

2189
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,200
is because it sounds like you guys

2190
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,200
are advocating for censorship in your comment sections.

2191
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,200
And I hate censors.

2192
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,200
No, I'm advocating for death and murder

2193
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,200
and censorship in a comment section.

2194
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,200
That is not a thing.

2195
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,200
Comment section is a platform I give the audience.

2196
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,200
I don't have to give it to them.

2197
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,200
They don't deserve it. I shouldn't give it to them.

2198
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,200
But I do because I have some benefit from it

2199
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,200
which is that I like reading comments sometimes.

2200
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,200
But there is no such thing

2201
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,200
as censoring a comment section

2202
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,200
because it's entirely mine.

2203
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,200
It's like if you said

2204
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,200
someone came onto my front lawn

2205
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,200
and screamed,

2206
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,200
and I kicked them out.

2207
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,200
If you would call that censorship,

2208
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,200
that's no different from saying

2209
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,200
that kicking someone out of your comments is censorship.

2210
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,200
It's not censorship. If they want a platform,

2211
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,200
they have the entire world.

2212
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,200
They can go make their own.

2213
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,200
You want to go talk shit about me?

2214
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,200
Go somewhere else on the internet.

2215
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,200
I can't ban you from our anime.

2216
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,200
They do.

2217
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,200
They do.

2218
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,200
If you bring that to my comment section,

2219
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,200
that's my house.

2220
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,200
I give you the platform.

2221
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,200
It's all me.

2222
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,200
You don't deserve it and it's not yours.

2223
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,200
I agree with you.

2224
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,200
I just think we need to respect

2225
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,200
what we were saying before

2226
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,200
is that everyone is the product of their environment

2227
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,200
and everyone is the product of circumstance.

2228
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,200
A shitty comment is the product of the circumstances

2229
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,200
in which it was written.

2230
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,200
What you were saying about taking responsibility

2231
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,200
for the fact that you're mad,

2232
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,200
what I think the social justice warriors aren't doing

2233
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,200
is that.

2234
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,200
Everyone has to change to meet my needs.

2235
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,200
They're like, I'm offended.

2236
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,200
When people say that, they're wrong.

2237
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,200
I'm offended because you said this word.

2238
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,200
Therefore, everyone has to stop saying the word.

2239
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,200
No. What you should be saying is

2240
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,200
I'm offended so I'm going to take measures

2241
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,200
so that I will not encounter this word.

2242
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,200
If you come to my comment section,

2243
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,200
I have a very easy means

2244
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,200
of taking measures

2245
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,200
so that you can't bother me anymore,

2246
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,200
which is that I ban you.

2247
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,200
It's my comment section

2248
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,200
where I have the control.

2249
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,200
What would be an SJW thing to do?

2250
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,200
What would be asking for a safe space?

2251
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,200
Would be if I went on to the internet

2252
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,200
and said, guys, everyone's leaving shitty comments

2253
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,200
about me. Everyone has to stop.

2254
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,200
Block all these websites. Block

2255
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,200
our anime. Block this place.

2256
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,200
Let me call the government

2257
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,200
and file a petition to get our anime taken down

2258
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,200
for talking shit about me.

2259
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,200
That would be the SJW mindset.

2260
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,200
Yeah.

2261
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,200
I think that the appropriate response

2262
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,200
to a shitty comment than a shitty commenter

2263
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,200
is a shadow ban.

2264
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,200
I think that engaging them

2265
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,200
is a...

2266
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,200
I have had...

2267
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,200
You have no idea.

2268
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,200
This is not the same...

2269
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
I don't know how it's been for Jesse,

2270
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,200
but for me, I have had

2271
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,200
an unbelievable number of people

2272
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,200
say this to me for their shitty comments.

2273
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,200
I've had so many times

2274
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,200
where someone writes something that's kind of

2275
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,200
snide and shitty, and I come back at them

2276
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,200
and I'm like, I correct them,

2277
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,200
and then they'll say, oh, sorry,

2278
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,200
I was just kind of mad in the moment

2279
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,200
and I didn't think you would actually read this.

2280
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,200
Well, that kind of

2281
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,200
highlights my point.

2282
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,200
It's the product of the circumstance.

2283
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
I'm saying...

2284
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,200
I am extremely empathetic

2285
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,200
towards commenters, but there's

2286
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,200
the only reason for me to do that,

2287
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,200
the only benefit for that

2288
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,200
is that I like

2289
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,200
that more people have been educated.

2290
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,200
If those people apologize and all that,

2291
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,200
that's cool and it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy

2292
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,200
that someone maybe is smarter now

2293
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,200
and they'll think more about their comments,

2294
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,200
but that doesn't mean that I'm going to do that for everybody,

2295
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,200
because sometimes I'm just in a bad mood

2296
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,200
and fuck out all of them.

2297
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,200
Let me kill yourself.

2298
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,200
It doesn't bother me.

2299
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,200
Twist your balls up and advise.

2300
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,200
I know you don't subscribe to it.

2301
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,200
I know you don't subscribe to it.

2302
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,200
These people should not get away with it.

2303
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,200
It's not okay to be stupid.

2304
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,200
It's not okay to fuck with people.

2305
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,200
They deserve wrath.

2306
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
But there is no wrath.

2307
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,200
Responding to them is what they want.

2308
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,200
It is not a punishment.

2309
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,200
It is not a punishment for you

2310
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,200
to call them out publicly.

2311
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,200
It is a reward.

2312
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,200
It makes other people want to do it more.

2313
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,200
I don't think it does, Ben,

2314
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,200
but it does.

2315
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,200
I think most of the people who leave shitty comments

2316
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,200
think it's funny.

2317
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,200
They think everybody wants that.

2318
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,200
These are not like these mythical trolls

2319
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,200
that people think exist who just want a response.

2320
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,200
These are legitimate retards

2321
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,200
legitimately saying retarded shit.

2322
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,200
They deserve to be called out for.

2323
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,200
If I could provide another anecdote, I do have a good one.

2324
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,200
Verbally beaten up, just like they would be

2325
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,200
physically beaten up if they said it in real life.

2326
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,200
Yeah, I agree.

2327
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,200
The feeling of being verbally beaten up

2328
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,200
I know, and that's a big problem,

2329
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,200
and I wish I could somehow change it.

2330
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,200
I wish that I could invent an app

2331
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,200
that let me punch through my computer screen

2332
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,200
and knock someone's teeth out, but until that day comes

2333
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,200
Alright, monkey, monkey, what's your anecdote?

2334
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,200
So this isn't specifically about shitty commenters.

2335
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,200
It's more about trolls on the internet,

2336
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,200
but back in the day there was this YouTube channel

2337
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,200
that's still up, but it's not active called Reactor.

2338
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,200
And he was just a huge troll

2339
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,200
and he would fuck with people, and specifically

2340
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,200
he made a video pretending that

2341
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,200
Grade A Under A had endorsed him

2342
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,200
and then he made it an advertisement

2343
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,200
on Grade's videos.

2344
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,200
How this is relevant is that

2345
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,200
Grade went to his video, Reactor's video

2346
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,200
and left just a...

2347
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,200
He left a huge

2348
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,200
fucking paragraph

2349
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,200
complaining and crying like a little man baby

2350
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,200
that Reactor had done this.

2351
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,200
And in that instance, Reactor won

2352
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,200
because Grade responded to the troll

2353
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,200
and complained about it.

2354
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,200
That story makes me so happy.

2355
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,200
Fuck Grade A Under A.

2356
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,200
So if you blow up on a shitty commenter

2357
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,200
then they win.

2358
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,200
You look like a fucking idiot.

2359
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,200
That's not a shitty commenter.

2360
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,200
That's a genius doing some like video.

2361
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,200
I think it's the same.

2362
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,200
Agreed, agreed. That guy's a whole new level.

2363
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,200
I'm gonna cut it and plant my flag here for a second

2364
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,200
because I've told you guys many times

2365
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,200
that I don't like the idea

2366
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,200
of shutting down my comments.

2367
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,200
I know did you views it as like

2368
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,200
this is something that I control

2369
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,200
and I'm giving you the platform

2370
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,200
because it's all in me.

2371
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,200
Why shut them down when you can just shadowban into the ocean?

2372
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,200
That's a lot of work and I don't have fucking time for that.

2373
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,200
When you get to my level of fame

2374
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,200
you will quickly realize why

2375
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,200
you want to close the comments.

2376
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,200
I totally agree that I am an idealist.

2377
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,200
Closing down my comments is like a utopia

2378
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,200
that I have to earn first.

2379
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,200
I have to get to a certain level before I can...

2380
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,200
There's this one time

2381
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,200
there was this one time on my girl

2382
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,200
I don't know which one but like these two guys

2383
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,200
were just arguing back and forth forever.

2384
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,200
I wasn't even involved. One guy said

2385
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,200
Gerlangen was the shittiest anime ever

2386
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,200
and this other guy was defending it and this went on

2387
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,200
for a literal year.

2388
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,200
I'm sure that you've had this before, did you?

2389
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,200
But a fucking year! They were still arguing

2390
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,200
and then I eventually came in and it was...

2391
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,200
I just came in and I said guys

2392
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,200
this is absolutely fucking

2393
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,200
ridiculous you need to stop

2394
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,200
just please let's all agree

2395
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,200
we are not going to agree on this

2396
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,200
and that's the end of it and they actually listened

2397
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,200
they both responded and were like

2398
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,200
like I said I love it

2399
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,200
when people make up for it

2400
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,200
and I've done it countless times

2401
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,200
the funny thing is other people responded

2402
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,200
to this first post and started

2403
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,200
another argument after, totally unrelated

2404
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,200
you've told the story before on this show

2405
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,200
but probably in commentary

2406
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,200
probably

2407
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,200
like what Mumki is saying about letting the trolls

2408
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,200
win, I think the moment

2409
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,200
you've won is when you're not bothered anymore

2410
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,200
and the moment you're not bothered anymore

2411
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,200
is when they're gone

2412
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,200
and it's so easy to do, you banned them

2413
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,200
you never have to deal with it again

2414
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,200
or when you fucking beat them

2415
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,200
into submission, I fucking

2416
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,200
the same thing Nate that happened to you

2417
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,200
happened to me the other day, only instead of arguing

2418
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,200
for one year, two people were arguing like one day

2419
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,200
and that got me to that level

2420
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,200
that you were at within one day

2421
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,200
I think it was like

2422
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,200
two responses of people talking amongst themselves

2423
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,200
about Metro and I said enough of this

2424
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,200
I have to come in, I told these people

2425
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,200
shut the fuck up you annoying idiot

2426
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,200
this shit will not stay out

2427
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,200
I agree with everything you said 100%

2428
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,200
and this guy got so

2429
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,200
Mumki shut up I'm telling a story

2430
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,200
sorry I thought he stopped

2431
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,200
go on Jesse, alright finish your point

2432
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,200
but I

2433
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,200
told these guys to shut up and this guy got so

2434
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,200
butthurt that it turned into like a long thing

2435
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,200
of me just verbally jack hammering

2436
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,200
him in the face pussy until

2437
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,200
he cried like a little bitch and eventually

2438
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,200
after like 17 responses

2439
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,200
of me shitting on him

2440
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,200
he just goes okay god

2441
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,200
so he's acknowledging that I am a god

2442
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,200
he's acknowledging that he has

2443
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:08,200
nothing left to say

2444
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,200
and he's running home and crying like a little bitch

2445
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,200
I won and I felt good about it so that's how you beat them

2446
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,200
you beat them at your own game

2447
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,200
if they want to be shitty to you, you be 10 times

2448
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,200
as shitty to them until they cry like little

2449
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,200
bitches and go home and die

2450
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,200
that's how you win I think kind of proves Ben's point

2451
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,200
because I saw one comment he said was like

2452
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,200
dude I'm sorry I didn't expect you to read this

2453
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,200
like I had no idea that like you

2454
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,200
and like I'm just saying that's the perspective

2455
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,200
he had no idea

2456
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,200
I had a similar

2457
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,200
I had a somewhat similar interaction

2458
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,200
I had a somewhat similar

2459
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,200
comment thread in the comments

2460
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,200
of that video that we

2461
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,200
posted in the chat a while back that was about

2462
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,200
the guy arguing for objectivity

2463
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,200
and art you know the really fucking stupid guy

2464
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,200
who said that it was all a scam by

2465
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,200
fucking land developers because

2466
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,200
he's clearly an insane madman

2467
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,200
I'm glad that I

2468
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,200
don't remember the name of the channel because I don't want

2469
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,200
to give him exposure because he's retarded

2470
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,200
anyway someone made

2471
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,200
a shitty comment that was like

2472
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,200
oh so

2473
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,200
if someone thinks that a pile of shit is

2474
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,200
more beautiful than a work of art

2475
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,200
are they right and I was like obviously

2476
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,200
yes it's obviously their opinion

2477
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,200
and then in response he just

2478
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,200
kept calling me stupid and deluded

2479
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,200
stupid and deluded

2480
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,200
oh yeah I'm like

2481
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,200
you're demonstrably wrong you don't

2482
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,200
understand what an opinion is and he's like

2483
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,200
well you're stupid and deluded

2484
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,200
I just leave it at that

2485
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,200
how do I

2486
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,200
stupid and deluded

2487
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,200
how do I argue with that

2488
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,200
he's not looking at ideas

2489
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,200
the same way you are he's got his own little

2490
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,200
world he's living in

2491
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,200
he's just like

2492
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,200
here's an opinion I have really strongly

2493
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,200
and I'm like yeah but it's just your opinion

2494
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,200
and he's like no but I have this opinion

2495
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,200
really strongly

2496
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,200
first I want to let monkey talk before I go on another

2497
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,200
huge rant what were you going to say

2498
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,200
I was just saying I

2499
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,200
I empathize with what you're saying

2500
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,200
100% I see your perspective

2501
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,200
it's just that from my personal philosophy

2502
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,200
I view it as censorship

2503
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,200
but I understand your point of view and I agree to disagree

2504
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,200
right

2505
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,200
I want to talk about

2506
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,200
the comments section is mega city one

2507
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,200
and I am judge dread

2508
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,200
the price of justice is freedom

2509
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,200
I want to bring this back out

2510
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:22,200
it's like another big

2511
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,200
like social

2512
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,200
overlooking point because like

2513
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,200
the way I see it like you know I empathize

2514
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,200
I said this earlier I empathize with everybody pretty easily

2515
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,200
right

2516
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,200
but functionally

2517
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,200
we have to draw lines about people's behaviors

2518
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,200
right like if someone goes around killing people

2519
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,200
then like

2520
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,200
in an ideal society

2521
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,200
where everyone understands each other

2522
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,200
and we are all empathizing perfectly

2523
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,200
then like we understand that that person

2524
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:50,200
we know that we have to correct them somehow

2525
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,200
right I love the idea

2526
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,200
of the correctional facility

2527
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,200
a place you send someone and it actually

2528
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,200
of course this is not what we have in America

2529
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,200
in an ideal world

2530
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,200
where they actually work

2531
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,200
where there's actually correctional facilities that would be great

2532
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,200
right but functionally

2533
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,200
right now we don't have that

2534
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,200
and when someone commits a crime

2535
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,200
we have to do something about it and like so

2536
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,200
unfortunately

2537
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,200
you just got to kill people sometimes

2538
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,200
some people just have to die

2539
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,200
and like that's kind of

2540
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,200
my perspective on comments

2541
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,200
the reason that I'm so comfortable with banning them

2542
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,200
is that like

2543
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,200
back when I was a smaller YouTuber

2544
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,200
and I could actually respond to everybody

2545
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,200
and I could make everybody understand where I was coming from

2546
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,200
then that was

2547
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,200
it was a beautiful time but it's long past

2548
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,200
if I put out a video now that gets 400,000 views

2549
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,200
and it gets

2550
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:42,200
10,000 comments

2551
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,200
then it's like if someone's really shitting up my comment section

2552
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,200
like in a way that it's

2553
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,200
that I find it to be detrimental to my video

2554
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,200
that person has to die

2555
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:52,200
like they have to get banned

2556
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,200
because they are just harming

2557
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,200
they're doing more harm than good

2558
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,200
I thought we were talking about capital punishment

2559
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,200
how did this get back to comments

2560
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,200
I'm saying there's no difference, I view it all the same way

2561
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,200
if someone goes around

2562
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,200
on a killing spree

2563
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,200
if someone's before that point

2564
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,200
let's say like Elliot Roger

2565
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,200
ideally we could have saved him before he got there

2566
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,200
if we understood

2567
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,200
we just need to follow the prostitute

2568
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,200
and he would have been fine

2569
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,200
I think I have something

2570
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,200
that might be controversial

2571
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,200
since we're all sharing our

2572
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:26,200
unpopular opinions

2573
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:28,200
although we all seem to agree

2574
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,200
on half of them

2575
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,200
I believe that mass murder

2576
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,200
is not inherently wrong

2577
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,200
well it depends on

2578
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,200
I mean those Jews

2579
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,200
weren't really going to much good over there

2580
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,200
Nate?

2581
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,200
I'm saying

2582
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,200
in theory

2583
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,200
if you could mass murder the right

2584
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,200
targets

2585
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:52,200
if you could find people who were just bad

2586
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,200
because they do exist, there are people who are just bad

2587
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,200
and need to die

2588
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,200
I was so right, if Jesse found the death

2589
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,200
it would have gone down exactly that way

2590
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,200
I mean I would do the same

2591
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,200
like I just said

2592
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,200
okay there's this great line

2593
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,200
from a Jane's Addiction song where he says

2594
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,200
some people should die

2595
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,200
that's just unconscious knowledge

2596
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,200
and I love it

2597
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,200
some people should die

2598
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,200
because it'll help the world

2599
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,200
the problem with all these mass shooters

2600
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,200
is that they don't have their priorities straight

2601
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,200
when it comes to targeting these people

2602
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,200
they always make mistakes

2603
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,200
they all get wrapped up in generalizations

2604
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:30,200
it's all women or it's all Jews

2605
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:32,200
it's not a group, it's all bad people

2606
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,200
just kill the bad people

2607
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,200
I've solved another social ailment

2608
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,200
thank, you're welcome world

2609
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,200
the only reason

2610
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,200
then this comes back to the Aberdorf Linkler thing

2611
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:44,200
the only reason I can't completely

2612
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,200
subscribe to that is that I'm almost sure

2613
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,200
that if all of society decided

2614
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:50,200
we were gonna do that, I'd get killed

2615
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,200
so that's the only reason I can't totally back it

2616
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,200
if we were all like

2617
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:56,200
let's just kill all the bad people

2618
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,200
this is just an ideological cowardice

2619
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,200
well that's true Digi, but to that I say

2620
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:02,200
society is welcome to try

2621
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:04,200
that's a good point

2622
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,200
I'm just saying to one of my major issues

2623
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,200
with Elliot Rogers that

2624
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,200
he didn't target the specific people

2625
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,200
who caused him this pain

2626
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,200
he just went for any random people on the street

2627
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,200
right, but there was no

2628
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:18,200
specific person

2629
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,200
it wasn't rejection specifically

2630
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:22,200
but there were specific people

2631
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,200
like James who fucked with him

2632
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,200
like Sumai

2633
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:28,200
listen to your sister

2634
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,200
on the subject of James

2635
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,200
I was really moved

2636
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,200
listening to the Elliot Rogers audiobook

2637
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,200
where you get to the part where James finally breaks

2638
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,200
off the friendship

2639
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,200
I want to know if your tears were genuine

2640
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,200
I get that question all the time

2641
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,200
I was just into the part

2642
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,200
okay okay

2643
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,200
he actually went out and killed a bunch of people

2644
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,200
to get into the mindset

2645
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,200
that's some true method acting

2646
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,200
right there

2647
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,200
oh shit, you made me lose track

2648
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,200
of my point with all this fucking Elliot Rogers talk

2649
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,200
damn it

2650
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,200
I'm not only wrong to kill random people

2651
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,200
but if you can really study

2652
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,200
people and figure out which ones

2653
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,200
are just shitty, probably shitty commenters

2654
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,200
at home

2655
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,200
what your fucking viewers, you don't know when you're next

2656
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:14,200
oh yeah, I remember

2657
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,200
who gets to decide who is next

2658
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,200
well that's a thing

2659
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,200
I think there was

2660
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,200
back in the day, in the ancient times

2661
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:24,200
everything was determined by

2662
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,200
literal physical strength

2663
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,200
the people who were the strongest

2664
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,200
it makes sense, if you're in a survivalist

2665
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,200
environment where it's like

2666
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,200
you have to be literally strong to survive

2667
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,200
because you have to fight tigers

2668
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,200
and beat people up

2669
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,200
who are fucking with your women

2670
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,200
the physically strong

2671
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,200
are the ones who get to have rights

2672
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,200
that's my ideal word

2673
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,200
I think the main reason

2674
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,200
we got away from that

2675
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,200
is that weak people figured out

2676
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,200
how they can keep themselves alive

2677
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,200
we figured out that if we can manipulate

2678
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,200
the physically strong people

2679
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,200
I say we because I am physically weak

2680
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,200
us weak people figured out

2681
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,200
that if we can manipulate the physically strong

2682
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,200
then we can figure out

2683
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,200
if we can convince them that we are valuable

2684
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,200
then we can make

2685
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,200
are you just talking about women right now?

2686
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,200
no, women don't factor in

2687
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,200
this is ancient society

2688
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,200
women don't exist

2689
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,200
they're just baby factories

2690
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,200
in ancient times

2691
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,200
I'm talking about weak people

2692
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,200
if you're not the guy who's out there

2693
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,200
beating up boars and stuff

2694
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:30,200
then how do you prove to those guys

2695
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,200
that you shouldn't be left on the hills of Thermopylae

2696
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,200
like the Spartans

2697
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,200
if you were fucking a defective birth

2698
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,200
they literally left you

2699
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,200
on the hills of Thermopylae

2700
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,200
as I always say that we should be doing to old people

2701
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,200
that's what they did to their old as well

2702
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,200
because to them

2703
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,200
all that mattered was being physically strong

2704
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,200
and able to fight, that's all their society was based around

2705
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,200
but meanwhile in Athens

2706
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,200
there were all these boy fuckers

2707
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,200
who were

2708
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,200
beating around and like navel gazing about philosophy

2709
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,200
and they were like how do we convince

2710
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,200
the strong people that we are necessary

2711
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,200
well if we figure out

2712
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,200
how to make new weapons for them

2713
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,200
to use and shit

2714
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,200
and then convince them that they couldn't figure this out themselves

2715
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,200
it's totally us, we're the smart y'all

2716
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,200
you guys go out there and fucking bench more iron

2717
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,200
we're gonna make these

2718
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,200
we'll give you new tools

2719
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,200
we convinced them

2720
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,200
one hand

2721
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,200
well arguably

2722
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,200
that's how we got to this point

2723
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,200
specialization is how society progresses

2724
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,200
right well but here's the question

2725
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,200
does society's

2726
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,200
progress matter

2727
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,200
because if it was still

2728
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:38,200
just a society of the physically strong

2729
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,200
then it would just be like a small group

2730
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,200
of wandering nomads

2731
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,200
and they're still living

2732
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,200
just like every other animal in the world

2733
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:48,200
who is just the same thing

2734
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,200
they've been for fucking millions of years

2735
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:52,200
they're just around

2736
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,200
humans would be that if not for the fact that

2737
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,200
a bunch of weak humans went like

2738
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
okay well shit like if we want to survive

2739
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:00,200
in this dog eat dog world

2740
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,200
we gotta like build a robot that can

2741
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,200
eat dogs

2742
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,200
I'll tell you why it's important that society progresses

2743
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,200
because there's going in this dog eat dog world

2744
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,200
you gotta build a robot that eats dog

2745
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,200
there's people like

2746
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,200
I mean this is an extreme example

2747
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:16,200
people like Stephen Hawking

2748
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,200
we need those kinds of people

2749
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,200
and we need them to survive despite

2750
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,200
society will just take a lot longer

2751
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,200
to get good if only the swolest

2752
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,200
people are also our scientists

2753
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,200
we need people that we keep alive despite

2754
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,200
their physical limitations

2755
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,200
we need those guys because some of them

2756
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,200
they've got some good ideas and we want to use those

2757
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,200
it's a question like do we

2758
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,200
need them

2759
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:40,200
in terms of like us as a species

2760
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:42,200
well let me tell you my perspective is

2761
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,200
I want humanity to proceed

2762
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:46,200
as fast as possible to founding

2763
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,200
Starfleet, colonizing the universe

2764
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,200
meet aliens through all that fun shit

2765
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,200
even in a recent episode of his let's play

2766
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:54,200
literally said the faster we get to Star Trek

2767
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,200
the better and I was like oh my god he's one of us

2768
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,200
me and Nate say that exact phrase

2769
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,200
all the time

2770
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,200
the faster we get to Starfleet the better

2771
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,200
but like

2772
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,200
that's how we want it to go

2773
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,200
and like sure

2774
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,200
I guess you could say

2775
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:12,200
that if we look at it as the earth is going to die

2776
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,200
one day and humans are going to get off

2777
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,200
this planet then maybe we really did

2778
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:18,200
need that as a survival instinct for our species

2779
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,200
to get like to get good at

2780
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:22,200
smarts and get the fuck out of here like maybe

2781
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,200
that was actually necessary

2782
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,200
and we're going to do better than every other species

2783
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,200
on this godforsaken rock you know

2784
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,200
but like not withstanding the sun

2785
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,200
exploding the ice skips melting

2786
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,200
comets becoming come blown into us

2787
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,200
we're definitely going to blow ourselves up

2788
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:38,200
definitely going to blow ourselves up

2789
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:40,200
not withstanding all that

2790
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,200
if we were just a bunch of nomadic tribes

2791
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,200
wouldn't we still be well off

2792
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,200
no we would not

2793
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,200
and the answer is because if the strong

2794
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,200
were the ones in charge we never would have had

2795
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,200
anime

2796
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,200
oh my god you're right

2797
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,200
anime is entirely a culture of the week

2798
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,200
it's all about how you do it

2799
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,200
I agree with everyone we need the strong

2800
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,200
we need the smart people like Stephen Hawking

2801
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,200
who are not strong but are smart enough to help us advance

2802
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:06,200
we need all those people but my point is

2803
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,200
none of those people are commenters

2804
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,200
well alright

2805
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,200
well we do need the idiot

2806
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,200
comments on my japanese anime

2807
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,200
drones to fucking turn the wheels on all these

2808
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,200
fucking machines

2809
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,200
who's going to make the sandwiches you know

2810
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,200
like they said in growing pains or whatever

2811
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:24,200
the dog killing robots will make the show

2812
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,200
so basically what we have to do is get to a

2813
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,200
society where our robots are good enough

2814
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,200
that we can kill all the stupid people

2815
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,200
oh my god this makes perfect sense

2816
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,200
this is no it works right

2817
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,200
if we get our technology good enough

2818
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,200
that we only need the smart people

2819
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,200
and we don't need anyone to pull the levers

2820
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,200
then we can annihilate all those people

2821
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:44,200
and then all the dumb shit will disappear

2822
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,200
like all the religions and stuff like that all will just be gone

2823
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:48,200
because we don't have dumb people anymore

2824
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,200
this is beautiful

2825
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,200
one thing I can say for sure is that this podcast

2826
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,200
has definitely convinced me to have less empathy

2827
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,200
going forward

2828
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,200
you know what I think now is as good a time

2829
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,200
as any to talk about how

2830
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:02,200
yesterday

2831
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,200
all my empathy died all at once

2832
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,200
and

2833
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:08,200
it has everything to do

2834
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:10,200
with our good friend

2835
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:12,200
monkey here oh no

2836
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,200
yeah that's right okay so

2837
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,200
I'll be happy to tell you so

2838
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,200
yesterday I was

2839
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,200
it was after work and I had gone to the gym at work

2840
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,200
which is this empty

2841
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,200
I've never seen another person there it's just this empty shitty place

2842
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,200
with a couple of workout equipment things

2843
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,200
and I like to listen to shit while I work out

2844
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,200
and I saw that there was a live stream that monkey was doing

2845
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,200
so

2846
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,200
I started on and I'm listening to it

2847
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:36,200
and Ben was like

2848
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,200
in the chat

2849
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,200
in the chat all the

2850
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,200
a bunch of PCP guys were there did you had been there

2851
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,200
monkey said hey to him Ben was there

2852
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,200
you know we were talking for a little bit

2853
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,200
and I was there

2854
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:50,200
I was posting I was ready to

2855
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,200
experience the warm embrace of a friend

2856
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,200
of a new friendship

2857
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:56,200
and in fact

2858
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,200
there was frequent mention of like

2859
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,200
oh look at all these PCP guys

2860
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,200
oh it's so cool they're all here

2861
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,200
oh Ben's here did you sir

2862
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,200
everyone important is here

2863
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,200
wow what a great time we're having here

2864
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,200
meanwhile I'm getting the fucking shaft

2865
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,200
and by the way I'm gonna put up on

2866
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,200
go on Ben what

2867
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:16,200
the literal founder

2868
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,200
of the PCP

2869
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,200
best guy ever

2870
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,200
just shafted unceremoniously

2871
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:24,200
I captured screenshots of my vain attempts

2872
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:26,200
of my vain attempts to reach out

2873
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,200
to form some kind of human connection

2874
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,200
but nothing I got fucking shaft

2875
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,200
and people were in the chat saying like

2876
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,200
dude you should say hi to best guy ever

2877
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,200
you should say hello and I've got pictures

2878
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,200
so I don't know what kind of conspiracy this was

2879
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,200
to just ruin my self image

2880
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,200
of my self worth but it succeeded

2881
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,200
monkey you succeeded

2882
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,200
I was just distracted by the wonders of your yellow

2883
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,200
episode I wanted to know what that was

2884
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,200
oh don't it no

2885
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,200
no you got too far

2886
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,200
delete it and just fuck yourself

2887
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,200
for the record

2888
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,200
monkey only looked at like one in every

2889
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,200
hundred messages of that chat

2890
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,200
and I posted a billion messages

2891
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:04,200
you'll see they're on screen

2892
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,200
they're gonna be on screen you're gonna see them right now

2893
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,200
I've got them

2894
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,200
you keep saying that but I'm the one who has to edit this

2895
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,200
I probably won't do that

2896
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,200
we'll work something out

2897
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:16,200
maybe we'll put a folder with them

2898
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:18,200
and there's I don't know

2899
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,200
anyway that's why I hate you monkey and

2900
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,200
you're not cool

2901
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,200
well anyways does anybody have parting

2902
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,200
thoughts on this monkey do you have any parting

2903
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,200
thoughts on this empathy topic and

2904
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,200
oh come back to me

2905
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,200
I gotta think about it

2906
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,200
Ben do you have any parting thoughts

2907
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,200
oh fuck on the

2908
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,200
topic of empathy

2909
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:40,200
um

2910
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,200
I've just been playing devil's advocate this whole time

2911
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,200
don't have any empathy for anyone it's stupid

2912
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,200
watch out Ben that's a dangerous road

2913
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,200
I was the devil

2914
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,200
I played devil's advocate three times in rapid succession

2915
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:52,200
right before the show so I've actually been the devil

2916
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,200
all along

2917
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,200
like bloody Mary like you looked in the mirror

2918
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:58,200
yeah

2919
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:00,200
devil's advocate

2920
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,200
slowly Elliot Rogers face comes into

2921
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,200
focus in the mirror

2922
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:06,200
I went to the bathroom and I looked in the

2923
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,200
mirror and I was like

2924
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:10,200
mind comp had some good points to make

2925
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,200
maybe we should look into

2926
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,200
the relative IQ's of the different races

2927
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:18,200
and also shitty commenters

2928
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,200
are real cool and we should all make them and bam

2929
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,200
I just transformed

2930
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:24,200
yeah

2931
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:26,200
I can easily

2932
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,200
see you doing that just playing devil's advocate

2933
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:30,200
Ben looking intensely into the mirror

2934
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:32,200
like wow you know commenters aren't so bad

2935
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,200
they're actually kind of okay

2936
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,200
you're a monster Ben

2937
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:38,200
I'm literally a monster right now

2938
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,200
Jesse do you have any parting thoughts on this empathy

2939
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,200
for you Ben

2940
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,200
yeah kill them all

2941
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:46,200
I agree I don't know I think I had

2942
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,200
something intelligent to say like way back at the beginning

2943
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,200
but I blew it

2944
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,200
mate you have any

2945
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,200
you have any parting thoughts

2946
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:56,200
on empathy

2947
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:58,200
I think our philosophies align

2948
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:00,200
fairly well on this you and me didgy

2949
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,200
I think empathy

2950
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,200
I wish there was more I think that

2951
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:06,200
we'd all do a lot better

2952
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:08,200
you know I meme a lot but really I'm all about

2953
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,200
I'm all about

2954
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,200
like a politician coming on

2955
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,200
like one of those commercials the ass

2956
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:18,200
like you know guys

2957
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:20,200
America

2958
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:22,200
I meme a lot

2959
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,200
I meme a lot

2960
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,200
but the true meme

2961
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,200
is Pokemon go to the post

2962
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,200
Pokemon go to the post folks

2963
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:32,200
I want humanity to do well

2964
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,200
I want as many people to be as happy as possible

2965
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,200
because that's my standard for the success

2966
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,200
of the human race

2967
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:40,200
and I'm committed to it

2968
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:42,200
that's my team I've chosen so

2969
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,200
I think we would be good for that

2970
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,200
and I think we'd all be a little better and

2971
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,200
all that shit

2972
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:50,200
I'm actually glad Ben brought up the idea

2973
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,200
of playing devil's advocates

2974
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,200
that's something I was thinking of

2975
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,200
before the show even started

2976
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,200
was how empathy is an important tool

2977
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,200
for any

2978
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:02,200
argumentative approach

2979
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,200
much like Ben and I think Nate and a lot of you guys

2980
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,200
I like to play the devil's advocate

2981
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,200
most of the time when I'm arguing

2982
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:10,200
it's not even for something I personally believe

2983
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,200
and it's just for fun

2984
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:14,200
and I would like to think that I can argue

2985
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:16,200
in favor of any stance and that's all

2986
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,200
oh my god it's Maddox you're Maddox

2987
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,200
it's the biggest debate in the universe

2988
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,200
but it's because of empathy

2989
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:24,200
the ability to put yourself into the shoes

2990
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:26,200
of somebody else's position is what allows you

2991
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,200
to play devil's advocate

2992
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,200
so for you guys Ben to say

2993
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:32,200
I'm devil's advocate but I hate empathy

2994
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,200
that doesn't make any fucking sense

2995
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:36,200
because you need it in order to play devil's advocate

2996
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,200
so I think empathy

2997
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,200
in terms of politics it's very important

2998
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,200
and there's not enough of it

2999
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:44,200
and I think we could solve a lot of problems

3000
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,200
if we just thought about what the opponent

3001
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:48,200
was saying rather than just trying to

3002
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,200
put out our own position

3003
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,200
but if you even

3004
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,200
acknowledge that your opponent

3005
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,200
that there's any rationalization

3006
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,200
or any idea at all

3007
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,200
behind your opponent's position

3008
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,200
it weakens yours

3009
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,200
stupid audience who doesn't understand that

3010
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,200
you guys are fucking morons

3011
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,200
if you have a strongly held position

3012
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,200
it's not in your interest

3013
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,200
to play devil's advocate

3014
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,200
or acknowledge another point of view

3015
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,200
who would have thought that the secret to empathy

3016
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,200
was to be the devil

3017
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:20,200
actually it kind of makes sense because

3018
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,200
who was the first one

3019
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:24,200
Jesse has been saying that all along

3020
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,200
who was the first one to hold a

3021
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,200
contrary position to God

3022
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,200
who but Lucifer

3023
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,200
his first of the angels

3024
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,200
the first to play devil's advocate

3025
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,200
is the problem with Maddox's show

3026
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:38,200
the biggest debate in the universe

3027
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:40,200
which is that he's trying to play devil's advocate

3028
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,200
against himself and play both sides of a conversation

3029
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,200
but he lacks the empathy

3030
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,200
to do that

3031
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,200
is that autism man is that demon autism

3032
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,200
yeah he's just he

3033
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,200
that old dragon odd

3034
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,200
that dragon odd

3035
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,200
oh god yeah

3036
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,200
you know my parting thoughts

3037
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,200
to go back to what monkey said at the very beginning

3038
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,200
that I think that

3039
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,200
the first reason that we're lacking empathy

3040
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:06,200
is that people confuse it for sympathy

3041
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:08,200
and so many people think that by understanding

3042
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:10,200
someone you have to agree with them

3043
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:12,200
and you don't you can completely be like

3044
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,200
you know I feel like

3045
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,200
like I said earlier you have to kill some people

3046
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,200
you gotta you gotta break a few eggs

3047
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,200
to make an omelet

3048
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,200
but at least you can feel like

3049
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:24,200
you know understand

3050
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,200
that that's not a good thing

3051
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:28,200
in an ideal society we wouldn't have to do that

3052
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,200
like you know if you empathize with everyone

3053
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:32,200
you just went like look I understand

3054
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:34,200
why Elliot Roger did the things he did

3055
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,200
doesn't mean I have to excuse him

3056
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,200
you know even if I say you know he couldn't help it

3057
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,200
it wasn't his choice even if I say that

3058
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,200
that doesn't mean that he's absolved

3059
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,200
and that we have to let him go

3060
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,200
because that's what people seem to think

3061
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,200
every time you say every time you're like oh he couldn't

3062
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,200
you know he was put in that position

3063
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:52,200
what was he supposed to do it's like

3064
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,200
oh are you saying we shouldn't punish him

3065
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,200
no I'm not saying that kill the guy

3066
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,200
he's clearly a problem for our society

3067
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,200
people aren't able to have nuance

3068
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,200
nigger jail is just jail by the way

3069
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,200
there's no difference

3070
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,200
that's right

3071
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:08,200
if you ask me

3072
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:10,200
we literally made that exact joke

3073
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,200
twice

3074
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,200
yeah he did

3075
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,200
I can attest to this

3076
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,200
if you ask me

3077
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:20,200
the real monsters are the people

3078
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,200
that can't empathize with someone like Elliot Roger

3079
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,200
I think that if you can't

3080
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,200
read his autobiography and at least empathize

3081
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,200
with some of his feelings about feeling rejected

3082
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,200
you know feeling like you've been dealt

3083
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,200
an unfair hand and feeling like there's

3084
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,200
no hope for you and how you wish things were different

3085
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,200
but they can't be

3086
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,200
I think it's fucked up if you can't empathize

3087
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,200
I can tie this into my girl and log in part 2

3088
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,200
where I talked about how the real villain

3089
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,200
is only people like a dine

3090
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,200
who despite reasonable arguments

3091
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,200
being presented have a dogmatic view

3092
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,200
of things and are unwilling to change their stance

3093
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:52,200
because of it that's the real evil folks

3094
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,200
you ruined it you made it anime

3095
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:56,200
I'm sorry

3096
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,200
but yeah that is one of the main points

3097
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,200
I was trying to make with my Elliot Roger

3098
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,200
video and you did it dude

3099
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:04,200
the news correspondence they didn't even read the

3100
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:06,200
autobiography they just had their

3101
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,200
set in stone beliefs and they were

3102
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,200
going to use this tragedy take advantage

3103
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,200
of it to express their

3104
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:14,200
previously held opinions

3105
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,200
the news is fucking disgusting and even worse

3106
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,200
even worse than their own opinions

3107
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:20,200
it's the opinions that they expect

3108
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,200
to jive with their viewers that they don't even hold

3109
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,200
necessarily themselves

3110
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:26,200
that's my devil's advocate

3111
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:28,200
and in an actually devilish

3112
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:30,200
evil context

3113
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,200
they're playing devil's autism

3114
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:34,200
and that's the dangerous game

3115
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:36,200
that Elliot was playing

3116
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,200
and he lost me

3117
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,200
oh no

3118
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,200
alright that's it for this show everybody say goodbye

3119
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:46,200

I've been at work

3136
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,200
I've been at work
