00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Welcome to the Pro Crastinators Podcast. The only Pro Crastinators Podcast starring me, Ben Saint, and Gibbontake.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And we've got, I'm not going to believe who's on the show this week. The one and only. Everyone has missed him. Everyone has been asking for him in the comments for years, for years and years.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:03,000
His slavering, drooling, brain dead fans have just been ravening in the comments. They say they won't watch if he's not here. Well guess what, suckers? He's back. It's the one. The only. Cheesy Manfredo.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm back, baby. Oh my god. Finally, the triumphant return. Finally, after. I look at. The prodigal son. I see all the comments. I see cheese heads in the comments. They'll be like, no cheesy, no watch. No cheese, no watch. No cheese, no watch. It's crazy.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No cheesy, no watch. It's like that Bob Marley.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We're back and we're better than ever. It's March 29th. Oh shit, I just stalked myself.

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh shit, I stalked the time.

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I said what time it is. They know. They know when I am.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A time traveler can come and fucking murder you.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
When they listen to this, they can be like, okay, so who was where at exactly 29th of March last week?

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They can follow the air trails. They can follow the chem trails.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did you leave trailing behind you? Everywhere you go.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They can look at the map of all the boats rounding the Horn of Africa and not going through the Suez Canal and be like, fascinating, I see.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They're going to deduce something.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They're going to grab your audio and be like, wait, wait, what's that sound?

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Wait, and then they hear the beer chirping and it's like, hold up, is that an East Coast swallow?

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I know where Ben's located.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The rarest, the rarest of them all. It only grows at this one address on this one street.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Are you sure you mean the Horn of Africa, like the bit on the edge?

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The bottom, right?

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, no, the Horn of Africa, if you look at Africa, there's like a spike on the right side.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's like where Saudi Arabia is.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Kenya is or...

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is it on the Madagascar side?

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's the thing next to...

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Saudi Arabia is the big chunk that's like cloth.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah, next to it, yeah, yeah.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's like technically Africa.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The Horn of Africa is the Somalia spike. You could stab someone.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, cool.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I see. I meant the Southern tip. I don't know what it's called.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I know it's South Africa.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I guess it's just called South Africa.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's where Elon Musk was born.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Fun fact.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lucky him.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Lucky us. Lucky us that South Africa decided to gift us the savior.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Elon Musk, thank God.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Who would have thought it would have been a white guy? That's so crazy.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's so... I mean...

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Can you imagine... God, thank God Elon Musk was born white, right?

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Otherwise, who knows what could have happened?

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, yeah, like...

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't even know what the joke was there.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's just alluding to race relations in South Africa.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Like, hmm, you know what? Think about that.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Race relations in South Africa? Why? What happened there?

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Nothing, actually.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Nothing, nothing, nothing at all.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't look it up. Don't worry about it.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They just dug the white people out of the ground, you know.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There's just different kind of rocks down there.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Like the Orcs and Lord of the Rings.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, that's where white people came from.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's all in the books.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, Saruman got the white mud and then that birthed out the white people.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The white mud. Delicious.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The whites.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So what's popping gamers? How have you guys been?

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I literally just got to my house like five minutes before the episode was supposed to start.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
On the bus.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
First time I've ridden a bus in a while, but I had to do it.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I had to risk COVID because I had to see my fucking family again this weekend.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, man.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But my parents are...

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, my dad's vaccinated. My mom is semi-vaccinated.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So I guess they were like, eh, well, time to risk it all.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They haven't had COVID in a while. I gotta make sure they're topped up.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
At least your parents get vaccinated.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm pretty sure my parents are not going to get vaccinated at all.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, really? I'm sorry.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It was like at the start. I don't know if I said this before on a previous episode,

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
but at the start of March, one of my roommates tested positive and everyone else in our house got tested too.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I was calling my mom. I was telling her that I won't be able to come visit this weekend because I don't know if I have it or not.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah. Yeah. And then I asked her if she got tested.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If anyone in the family got tested and she says, like, no, because we don't live in fear.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, dear.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, is that why? Oh, no.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's why.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah. And I'm like, I don't... Oh, I can't...

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And then I see them on Instagram story and Facebook and they're still going to like parties and shit.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And I'm like...

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I...

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They're living in fear of the vaccine. That's the funny thing is that they are living in fear.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They're so scared of taking the vaccine. They're not even difficult.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's fucking annoying. I do not like it.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think I'm going to be able to get it in like... I might even be able to get it in like a month or two.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's exciting.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I should probably try and sign on to a list or something. Yeah.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I think here in California, you could... I think everyone could get it on the 15th or something.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They're like giving... they're massively giving it out on the 15th.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't know how to do it exactly.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Jealous. Jealous.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know, it's so... it's funny because I was what...

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I heard that there's like a specific Twitter bot for people in California that if you follow them,

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
they could like tell you where you could get an appointment.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The thing is, the downside is you have to be following the bot and I maxed out my follow so I can't follow the bot.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So unfollow someone?

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No, I can't do that.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You need all 5,000 of those followers?

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Unfollowing someone is like the worst thing you could do to someone, Ben. That's like...

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's true. That's true. That's why I relish the opportunity to do it whenever I get the chance.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's why I avoid the problem by never following anyone.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't... based, based.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, yeah, people ask me why do I still follow Nick Fuentes and I'm like, I did it on accident years ago

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and now I can't go back on my word that...

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I just can't find the button.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's what a coward would do. That's like, yeah, no, you follow things till the very end.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're not allowed to change your mind, right?

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I guess you're right.

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Only a coward would undo an accident.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Only a coward would clean up after his messes.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That is so true.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, my roommates are the ultimate not cowards because they never clean the dishes. It's pretty base.

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Good for them. Good for them.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, it's awesome.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I love spending an extra 30 minutes for every meal that I make. It's fucking awesome.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's like, yeah, it's a little extra work, but it's worth it to know that your roommates aren't cowards.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You don't live with no coward.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
When push comes to shove, at least they're not cowards, am I right?

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So I saw a Nate. I hung out with Nate also. He was there, believe it or not, him and Michelle.

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Family gathering with Nate?

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I wonder if your family is related or something.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What was he doing there?

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, we were married for a brief while there.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah, that must have been very weird for Michelle, but you know.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, it was.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It was.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, so funny.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:04,000
On what was supposed to be the last day, we came into Boston and we got a munchie and Kazi to come out and hang with us.

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But it was so gross and rainy and we all hated it.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We just went back to my parents' house and just stayed there and just watched the witch, the Vovic, which I'd never seen before.

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It was pretty good.

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And then I got an acai bowl because we were saying, bro, you hardly touched your acai bowl and I wanted an acai bowl.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What's wrong?

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What's wrong, king? You haven't touched your acai bowl.

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's basically, do you know what, acai is like a berry and it's basically just like a sorbet bowl.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's like a sorbet bowl and they put granola and fruit and chocolate and shit on it.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's like frozen yogurt, but a little different, I guess.

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Acai?

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's full of antioxidants. It's a super fruit.

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's good to know. Yeah, you're probably immune to the coronavirus at this point.

146
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I should hope so because I had to ride the freaking bus and I don't like doing that.

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I tell you what, I really don't like doing that.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Not a big fan of the bus.

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Not a big fan of that bus.

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Do you get paranoid about touching the handlebars and stuff?

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Not so much about touching because I bring a big bottle of hand sanitizer,

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
of green hand sanitizer that I slapped the Slime Corp logo on.

153
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So I sanitize my hands pretty regularly when I'm out.

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
On the bus back to my house, there was a, I don't know if he was a homeless guy,

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
but he looked like he could have been, but he was sitting on, he wasn't sitting,

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
he was like leaning against a seat that was up, right?

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It was like one that you can fold down if you need to, but it was up, but he was leaning on it.

158
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He was technically wearing a mask, but it was like crunched up, so it covered his mouth,

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but not his chin or his nose, and it had spots of what may have been blood on it.

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And he was just standing there with his like cart or whatever,

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and he like talked overly familiarly to the bus driver as he got off calling her sister and stuff

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and wishing her family well.

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And then he got off and then this girl like got after him and sat like right where he was sitting,

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and I'm thinking like, I wouldn't sit there, but she doesn't know.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
She doesn't know who was there.

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The bloody mask was really like, hmm, what's that about?

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There was this one time that that sort of thing happened, but it was much stinkier.

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There was a guy on the tube, he was like very homeless, very smelly.

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Very homeless.

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Very homeless.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Extra homeless.

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Like he had his shoes were like wet.

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't know, his shoes had plastic bags taped around them, and he smelled a bit of piss.

174
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It was very unsettling.

175
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, I mean, don't judge.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean, who among us hasn't smelled of piss?

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How dare this man not have a home?

178
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What the fuck is wrong with him?

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I know.

180
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why can't he go to the home store and buy a home?

181
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He bought too much avocados.

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What I'm saying is that I came in and I didn't notice this at first because he was on one side of the train

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and then most everyone else in that carriage was on the other side of the train.

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I sat down on a free seat and then I was like, oh, no.

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Oh, God.

186
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, it's so bad.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I have to move.

188
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And it was so embarrassing.

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like sitting down next to this guy and having to move because he was like, like you would throw up sort of smell.

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah.

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Fuck.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I hate this.

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Everything about this is so unfortunate.

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Damn.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
All right.

196
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
All right.

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So give imagine that experience.

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But almost every day.

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because I know I had no way.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No, no, no.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm talking about myself.

202
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Like I lived.

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I lived unironically for a situation like that almost every day.

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Were you the homeless man?

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, I was the homeless man.

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No, it was like, no, it was, it was, it was a, I wrote the public school bus.

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And, you know, it was like, it was like, I think the beginning of high school.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I would just kind of sit in the front because I didn't have too many friends on the bus.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Right.

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And I mean, I wouldn't really care too much.

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And there's this one, there's one girl who would always sit right next to me.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And no one would want to sit with her.

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And I'm going to tell you why because she smelled really awful, like really terrible.

214
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And I don't think she had poor hygiene.

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I think it's a medical condition unironically.

216
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Cause it just, it always just was the same kind of like stinky consistency.

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And you could actually smell some soap on her.

218
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Like she would maybe try to like kind of rub it off.

219
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But unironically, she would always just smell like terrible.

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I, I think she unironically had a condition.

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
She just had a condition.

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Sham.

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah.

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

225
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And like, but like, I think over time I eventually got like numb to it.

226
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Like I didn't even like notice.

227
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Um, we never even talked at all.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
She would just like sit right next to me because she's got a.

229
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Cause.

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And now we're married.

231
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah.

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Now we're married.

233
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But was she cute though?

234
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Now she's my stinky wife.

235
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Uh, she was okay.

236
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's good enough for me.

237
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't know.

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't look at people's eyes.

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It faces.

240
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Hmm.

241
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What?

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm too nervous for that.

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The beginning of high school was like maybe 10 to eight years ago.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't know.

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There was only, there was only two Iron Man movies when I went to high school.

246
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No.

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Impossible.

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah.

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
True.

250
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah.

251
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I, I, I chronicle time by how many MCU movies existed at the period.

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Thank God we live in a more civilized age now.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah.

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thank God.

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank God there's three Iron Man movies now.

256
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Imagine.

257
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Imagine.

258
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Really in limbo after the second one.

259
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's, you know, it kind of, yeah, yeah, it's, it's terrible.

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's why I hate Trump cause they never came out with Iron Man 4 under a Trump presidency.

261
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's really, it really is a shotting example.

262
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The first thing, the first thing Biden said is that we're bringing Iron Man 4.

263
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Iron Man 4 DVDs are going to go out the door immediately as soon as.

264
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm still waiting for my Iron Man 4 DVD.

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Biden.

266
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Biden.

267
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Speaking of, speaking of Biden, here's some good news.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Fuck that.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Biden.

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Joe Biden?

271
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The Joe Biden.

272
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He's a man himself.

273
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The man of the hour.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He's going to run for president 2024.

275
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Good news.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I saw that.

277
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I saw he said he definitely wouldn't, but now he's just going to do it.

278
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He's going to be dead.

279
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
He's going to be fucking dead.

280
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm hoping he is in Minecraft.

281
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In Minecraft.

282
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He's going to perish in Minecraft.

283
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So is there, I don't know much about the election stuff.

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So can a president, like if Obama, for example, didn't run for his second term,

285
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
would he just be able to do that?

286
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I thought it was sort of like a championship belt.

287
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Like Obama has the belt and now all these people are going to try and challenge him.

288
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You don't have to run.

289
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You don't have to run, but you're only allowed to hold off as twice.

290
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes.

291
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So Trump's going to run again in 2024.

292
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So it's literally going to be Trump versus Biden again unless they die, which would be

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
better, but also probably something worse, someone even worse would show up.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So I don't even know what I want.

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's so, it's hard to predict who might be the next Trump 2.0.

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't think it's going to be, it's not going to be Junior.

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's for a fact.

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He's going to be like, no charisma.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What counts as Trump 2.0?

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like someone who's just bad policy or it's just like the same personality sort of thing?

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

302
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I could see Tucker Carlson running for president eventually, but not like in 2024.

303
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He's making too much money.

304
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Steven Crowder, I think Steven Crowder mentioned something about running for office in his

305
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
state.

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He did.

307
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He did.

308
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
God, all fucking mighty.

309
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
All every other motherfucker.

310
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Ben Shapiro for 2024.

311
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Fine and finitely a logical president.

312
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Stop just telling me facts about what is going to happen and stop.

313
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Just bring back president by combat.

314
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Trial by stone.

315
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Gladiatorial arena.

316
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We got to go back to the Skeksis and do trial by stone.

317
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I think Joe Biden.

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Like getting stoned?

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
No, it's when you take the sword and you smash the rock with it and you try to make

320
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
a big cut in the rock with your big sword.

321
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If I were going to say pull out the sword like Excalibur, right?

322
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Haven't you fuck seen Dark Crystal?

323
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No.

324
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm not a virgin.

325
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You...

326
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Got him.

327
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Got him.

328
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Got him.

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Got him.

331
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Whatever.

332
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Never mind.

333
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Philistines.

334
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, no, babe.

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm just, babe.

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
King, I'm so sorry, King.

337
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Babe, you haven't even, you barely even finished your trial by stone.

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Babe.

339
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No, babe.

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No, babe.

341
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Keep talking about Dark Crystal.

342
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So sexy, babe.

343
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Did I, did I say that I got the Asaebel?

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Did I say that on the show?

345
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

346
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Did I got the Asaebel?

347
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So now I know.

348
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

349
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay.

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Okay.

351
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I knew about, babe, you've barely even touched your collectible blue Sonic Curry.

352
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And recently I saw, babe, you've barely touched your whale flavored horse meat.

353
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That one was pretty good.

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I didn't know about, I didn't heard anyone say, bro, you've barely finished.

355
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You barely touched your Asaebel, but I vibed with it.

356
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And they used to watch, they used to watch that Pokemon Go guy, Nick, on that.

357
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He had that Pokemon Go YouTube channel, and he would always get Asaebel's.

358
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And I always wondered, and now I know.

359
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And that's my story.

360
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Now you know.

361
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I'm sticking to it.

362
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Do you still play Pokemon Go?

363
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Uh, no, not really since coronavirus.

364
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Even though like, you can.

365
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, did I call it?

366
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, you can.

367
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I just realized how dumb that is.

368
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
No, it's not dumb because they changed it so you don't really have to walk around anymore.

369
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
They made it like a lot easier to find Pokemon.

370
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

371
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Like, yeah.

372
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, the main thing they did, I think, because I opened it today, they had a nice little walk.

373
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But your buddy gives you like gifts that you can then send to friends and they can open it and get items.

374
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And poker stops spinning distance has been increased.

375
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So you can spin things that are very far away, not that far away, but like.

376
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Further.

377
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's better.

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

379
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And they've made other changes that allow you to play at home, which is pretty good.

380
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah.

381
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's not that great though, because you can't get the real experience.

382
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The real experience is just having a nice walk and occasionally twiddling at your phone.

383
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
My phone is just.

384
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
A nice walk is kind of important.

385
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I should just get a better phone because that's the coronavirus didn't help.

386
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But the real reason I stopped playing was just because my phone is bad and the game just lagged a lot and it was really annoying.

387
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So I should just get a better phone.

388
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I could just.

389
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Fuck.

390
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Get a fucking phone.

391
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,000
My parents were asking me what I want for my birthday and I literally could not think of anything like all weekend except maybe like a new pair of shoes.

392
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, I obviously need a new phone.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm such an idiot.

394
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It takes me.

395
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's taken me this long to remember.

396
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You DM your parents saying, actually, I know what I want now for a gift.

397
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And then they say, well, sorry, Ben, too late.

398
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Now Nate is going to get two gifts.

399
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I have.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I realized that like those.

401
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay, the shoes, the shoes that used to be Nate's, but that are mine, but that I did not steal.

402
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Of course, they are my shoes legitimately.

403
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I've realized that they just smelled like horrible.

404
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I just I didn't even like notice anymore because they live in my room, but like I wore them out.

405
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I put them on and I went out to like get in the car with the fam and they were like, Ben, you smell terrible.

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And I'm like, I don't know what you mean.

407
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I just showered like before I got in the car and they were like, no, you smell really terrible.

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And I was like, why?

409
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
How could this be?

410
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And I gnashed my teeth and I and I pounded my fist in the air and I said, why God?

411
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why have you cursed like this?

412
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And then I realized it was just the shoes.

413
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
They were they were like, they were just disgusting.

414
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So I washed them and I will probably destroy them soon because they are infected.

415
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
They are unclean.

416
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They are cursed.

417
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
They are cursed.

418
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They are cursed.

419
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Nate, Nate did a like a gypsy witch spell.

420
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He definitely did something because it's not it's not natural.

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's not a natural affliction that ails them.

422
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's not of this earth.

423
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You know, you wonder why Nate hasn't uploaded anything on the best guy ever channel because

424
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
he was too busy learning the dark arts so he could curse Ben saying.

425
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Curse the shoes.

426
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
To have stinky shoes.

427
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Word.

428
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
He shall have stinky shoes.

429
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Next step of his plan is to give Ben a stick.

430
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
If I can't have them, no one can have them.

431
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I will give Ben a stinky wife.

432
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That shall be the next step of my plan.

433
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No.

434
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
No, please.

435
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Why is this a stinky episode of the PC?

436
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Uh-oh.

437
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Stinky.

438
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Uh-oh.

439
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Stinky.

440
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Terrible.

441
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Terrible.

442
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, that's fucking.

443
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's fucking stupid.

444
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's fucking stupid.

445
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Speaking of speaking of stinky, I've been recently, I've been enlightened.

446
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I found out something about myself and it's due to Ben saying.

447
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
He kind of triggered this.

448
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I found out that I've been a fan of Andrew Hussie the whole time.

449
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, because I, yes, I've showed you.

450
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I've showed you the way.

451
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

452
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah, Ben said cheesy re-cyclonials.

453
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yep.

454
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Cyclonials.

455
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah.

456
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Have you noticed?

457
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh boy.

458
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Seen any Hussie stuff before?

459
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Um, I avoided Homestuck like the plague, um, because I was, guys, I didn't want to read

460
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
it.

461
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,800
I was just not interested in reading Homestuck.

462
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,000
And then, um, and then Ben over here was like, adding me saying like, uh, geez, you're going

463
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
to like, cyclonew's got to check it out.

464
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And I'm like, yeah, maybe.

465
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And then another friend of mine, uh, shout out to Sporktown Heroine.

466
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Um, she's all like, she, she showed me like a screen shot of it.

467
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
She said, I got, I got a bunch of people in my, in my Discord server to give cyclonew's

468
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
a chance and they all thanked me profusely and said, Ben, you really are a genius.

469
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And I said, I know, but thank you.

470
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I, I, I was like, wow, I, you know, it used to be best guy ever, but clearly it's, it's

471
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Ben now.

472
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Ben best guy ever is Ben guy ever.

473
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Ben guy ever.

474
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah.

475
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah.

476
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But, um, I, um, also because, uh, Homestuck is just long and I don't know that just kind

477
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
of like not, that didn't sure attract me.

478
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Right.

479
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I mean, it was, it was like a comp, it was a combination of the art style and like it

480
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
being long and it's like, uh, but, um, but cyclonew's is like only going to be nine

481
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
chapters, which is like, okay, cool.

482
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I could, I could live through this.

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Well, if you like cyclonew's and you're looking for more hussy, but Homestuck's too long

484
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
for you, you should check out a problem sleuth after, afterwards.

485
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Problem sleuth whistles the clown might be something to look into.

486
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I, I keep getting, I keep recommended, um, whistles the clown too.

487
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I mean, I'll, I'll check it out after, I'll check that out after like, colognew's cause

488
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I just, um, I don't know if I would recommend whistles the clown.

489
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's such an, it's, it's like an incomplete story.

490
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's damn.

491
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It is.

492
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That is an unfortunate thing.

493
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
No, cyclonew's takes place right after whistles the clown.

494
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
What are you talking about?

495
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh yeah.

496
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's.

497
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
He was, he was the first jubile.

498
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's, yeah.

499
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah.

500
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That's the plot twist at the end.

501
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's going to be revealed.

502
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What were you saying, Gibb?

503
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Uh, the, I'm just trying to remember it cause whistles the clown kind of felt like

504
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
clowns, Dragon Ball Z style.

505
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Like it's, they're just super powered, like one of them is sort of a Vegeta clown

506
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and the other one is sort of a Goku clown.

507
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I think Andrew Hussie is reading my mind.

508
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh my gosh.

509
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I think Andrew Hussie on air on like reading my fucking mind.

510
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's, it's unfinished, but like, it was just, clowns are funny and, and that, and

511
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
but like, not in the way they intended it.

512
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's always been cool.

513
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I read cyclonew's and it was, it was really freaky how much is kind of like stuff that

514
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I already thought of.

515
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Not like, not the story, like the story exactly was like a story.

516
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
No, no.

517
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I mean, like a lot of the ideas and cyclonew's were things I already like had in

518
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
mind for stuff.

519
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And I'm like, wait, what the fuck, what the fuck?

520
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And I just kept reading more of it.

521
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And I'm like, this is kind of like spot onto a lot of things that I kind of already

522
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
believe about, I guess, I guess spoilers for anyone who hasn't read cyclonew's.

523
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We spoiled the whole thing on the other episode.

524
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Cyclonew's on steam, on Android device.

525
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah, it's just, it's just the one time purchase.

526
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And then every time a new chapter drops, you get it for free.

527
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yes.

528
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Technically.

529
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Right.

530
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I am to get to get you to get you to read it.

531
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I agreed to, I bought you the game in exchange for you bought me David Boring by Daniel

532
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Klaus, which I read.

533
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I read, by the way, I read it at my parents house this weekend.

534
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
What'd you think?

535
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I thought it was based.

536
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Nice.

537
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I thought it was cool.

538
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And I don't know if I want to like talk to, I don't want to spoil it or anything,

539
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
but I would recommend it and it makes me, I've never read any other Klaus.

540
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I've seen Ghost World the movie.

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I haven't read the Ghost World comics, but I think I might check out some more Klaus

542
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
stuff at some point.

543
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
This is all I wanted.

544
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
This is all I wanted.

545
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Cool.

546
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Cause I would read, I read Vapors and I'm like, is this kind of like Klaus kind of?

547
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
A little.

548
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I sort of see it.

549
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah.

550
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And then I'm like, yeah, Ben should like, if Ben wants to upgrade on his, the genre of

551
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
David Boring would be like a white guy discovering himself type story, right?

552
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Kind of.

553
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah.

554
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
He needs to read more Daniel Klaus.

555
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I would recommend, if you liked David Boring, I'd probably recommend like the Death Ray,

556
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
which is like.

557
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The Death Ray.

558
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah.

559
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
That's Daniel Klaus.

560
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That one's like a pseudo superhero story.

561
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Like just, just imagine if it, just like how David Boring is written, imagine that, but

562
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
apply to like a guy who wants to be a superhero, but it's still kind of like all, all of a

563
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Daniel Klaus's characters, like main characters are usually kind of like low key shitty people.

564
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But, but not like, not like in a, like, like, how do you, how do you describe the character

565
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
of David Boring, Ben?

566
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I guess spoilers.

567
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,000
He's, I mean, he's, he's, I don't know, cold, unemotional, obsessive.

568
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
He's kind of an ass.

569
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
He's not great.

570
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah.

571
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah.

572
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I am.

573
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah.

574
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So all of his characters are kind of like that.

575
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So imagine if that character, but if you like wanted to be a superhero, and it's, it's probably

576
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I was probably unironically the most realistic take on someone trying to be a superhero in real life.

577
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah.

578
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And that, yeah, that one's good.

579
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
David, he has a recent one called patience, which is like a time travel story.

580
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And that one's like, was really, that was really good.

581
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I think he, I think he's been doing that one for like, he's been like low key, like writing

582
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
that one for like 10 years.

583
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So I would recommend that one.

584
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I should just, I should just buy, I should just buy a couple more on Amazon or something.

585
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
A few.

586
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah.

587
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I want, I really, I, yeah, I think it would do you, I think it would do you some good.

588
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think you would get pretty inspired.

589
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You know, I feel like reading David, David boring was a little bit inspiring for me.

590
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So I think you're right about that base.

591
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I am.

592
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah.

593
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I like to call David boring, my Scott Pilgrim.

594
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Because I'm really.

595
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah.

596
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Cause people always, I always hear people say like, Oh man, I relate to Scott Pilgrim.

597
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And I'm like, like, I don't relate to Scott Pilgrim.

598
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I relate more to David boring.

599
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I think that one hits me.

600
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's my relatable white boy.

601
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's not Scott.

602
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Um, yeah, I see, I guess I see what you mean.

603
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You two are, are a freak who wants to fuck his, his cousin.

604
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah.

605
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Of course.

606
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Of course.

607
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah.

608
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Spoilers.

609
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Spoiler.

610
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That was a big, big, big.

611
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's a media.

612
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That's a medium size.

613
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The story is more than that.

614
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
The story is.

615
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah.

616
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But I, I'm not wrong with you.

617
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Like, I think I mentioned this before when I tried to sell it on you.

618
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I like the whole aspect of like David boring.

619
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
He thinks he's falling in love, but really he's just horny.

620
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Like that's just it.

621
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
He's just horny.

622
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That's it.

623
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He's not like, he doesn't actually give a shit about the women.

624
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah.

625
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
He doesn't give a shit about the women.

626
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
He like,

627
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That's true.

628
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
He's like, dot, dot is like, you only like her cause she's got a fat ass.

629
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Like, no, no, there's more, there's more to it than that.

630
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But, but there's not.

631
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Right.

632
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
There's not.

633
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
No, there's not.

634
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And he just can't figure that out.

635
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Like.

636
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah.

637
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And that's all like what I kind of like got on my like second reread when I entered

638
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
my twenties.

639
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And I'm like, oh my God, he's just, he's just horny.

640
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He's not like actually fucking falling in love with these women.

641
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I can't, uh, man, I don't know.

642
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I would say there's some things I would point out about it, but they're, they're bigger

643
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
spoilers.

644
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Uh, like, I mean, I don't know.

645
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We said spoilers for people every day.

646
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I mean, I don't know.

647
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I mean, I can't believe that he gets shot in the head twice and doesn't care that he gets

648
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
shot in the head and finds the guy who did it.

649
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And it's just like, well, all's, I guess all's well that ends well.

650
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No harm done.

651
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And, um, it's, it's, I thought it was like weird that all these things where all these

652
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
death was happening and there's like no consequences for it.

653
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But I guess it kind of makes sense because it's sort of set in the apocalypse or something.

654
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So it's, I don't, I'm not sure if like the apocalypse was meant to like thematically

655
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,000
be like a theme of the story or if it is like a convenient way of like, hey, how come you

656
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
don't get, go to jail even though like the cops, the cops think you murdered your friend.

657
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh, well, it's because Dot just shoots the cops and it's the middle of the apocalypse.

658
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So there are bigger fish to fry.

659
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And so, you know, they don't come after you.

660
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Uh, and, uh, it was really, uh, when it, when like the, when they went to the island

661
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and like the germ, it's like, oh, the world, actually the world has been engulfed in germ

662
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
warfare.

663
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I was like, well, this is, this is not where I was expecting the story to go.

664
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Story, it did that a lot.

665
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Didn't expect to be shot in the head the first time.

666
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Didn't expect the apocalypse to happen.

667
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Uh, didn't expect, um, a lot of things.

668
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Did you, um, did you like, did you like all the twists and turns?

669
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I like, I enjoyed all the twists and turns.

670
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah, I did.

671
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It really, really went places.

672
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I, um, what I really also like about the book, and I guess, um, I don't know if you

673
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
caught this, but the book kind of low key tells you what like love is.

674
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Like, um, for like, there's that one line that, um, I think it's the, the Judy girl,

675
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
the first girl that he like falls in love with.

676
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We have like the fat ass.

677
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yeah.

678
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Um, he has like a flashback with her where, um, she asked her like, uh, would you kill

679
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
for me?

680
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Right.

681
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yes.

682
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And he's all like, uh, I don't know.

683
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But she says my professor says it's not love if you won't kill for it.

684
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Oh, and that's the guy.

685
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And that's the guy who shoots him.

686
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Right.

687
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Exactly.

688
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Right.

689
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Cause he, he's actually like in love with her, but here's the thing that like, um, also

690
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,000
like David, um, I feel like the book might be trying to say something like, um, David

691
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
is like love.

692
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Like he does love someone, um, not like in love.

693
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Like he wants to fuck with someone.

694
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Like for, he loves.

695
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Not like unironically, even though he never said like he loves her, he does.

696
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
He loves her like, like platonically.

697
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,160
And the big, the big scene that kind of proves that is the part where she's like getting harassed

698
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,000
by that one homophobe and like David goes up, yeah, David goes up to him with a piece of

699
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
plywood.

700
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That's like, that's like the only time he ever, that's like the only time he ever like

701
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
does anything.

702
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Right.

703
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,500
He goes nuts and he like tries to fucking kill that guy.

704
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Yeah.

705
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
He says, I'm going to fucking kill you.

706
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Which is like proof.

707
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,000
That he loves Dot and Dot loves him back.

708
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
That's way, that's way more than he ever did for any of the other women or anyone else

709
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
at all.

710
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Right.

711
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Exactly.

712
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And Dot loves him back because Dot like shoots those cops at the end.

713
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Yeah.

714
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
True.

715
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah.

716
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah.

717
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's fucking subtle.

718
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It is.

719
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Oh my God.

720
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's fucking, it's fucking genius.

721
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
He's my Zach Snyder, uh, Daniel Klaus.

722
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,500
My Zach Snyder.

723
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Is that a compliment?

724
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,500
I don't know.

725
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,000
Because Zach Snyder is a genius, Ben.

726
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I don't know.

727
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh, okay.

728
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
All right.

729
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Uh, I will, I will, I'll check out the death ray.

730
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah.

731
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Death ray.

732
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Uh.

733
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Uh.

734
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
What is that?

735
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Is that a comic?

736
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah.

737
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Is that a story?

738
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That's the one he was saying.

739
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's about the guy who wants to be a superhero.

740
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah.

741
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah.

742
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I don't know anything that you've been talking about.

743
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
He was just, he just explained it a mere 15 minutes ago.

744
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
No, no, no, no.

745
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What?

746
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,500
I'm just saying, I, I, I'm not, I don't know what it is.

747
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
So I haven't had anything to say.

748
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Where do I read it?

749
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
Okay, wait, uh, Gib, do you, um, would you-

750
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
It's a book.

751
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
You go to your local library.

752
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Gib, Gib, hard question right now.

753
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
This is the serious question.

754
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
You can't, you can't swipe.

755
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
You can't swipe it.

756
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,000
These kids these days don't know about books.

757
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,500
They don't know about physical media.

758
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
I don't, I don't-

759
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Where's clicking?

760
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
I grab a book and I'm like, where's the apps?

761
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
Where's the apps store on this thing?

762
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
I can't-

763
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
I open a book and I control-

764
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
Like, I can't-

765
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,000
Wait, I put my finger on the page, but the words don't move.

766
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Where are all the, where are all the Pokemon creatures in this book?

767
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I can't find them.

768
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I try to zoom in to a painting by scraping it with my finger.

769
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Um, Gib, hard question right now.

770
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Um, this is, uh, do or die question right here.

771
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Do you like the comic The Vapors?

772
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Think very carefully.

773
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't know if I'd say it.

774
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Think very carefully.

775
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I like it.

776
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
About your answer here.

777
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Okay, well, for everyone in the audience-

778
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I might love it.

779
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,500
Oh my god!

780
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Well, if you love The Vapors, you'll love David Boring.

781
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:06,500
It's, it's like, imagine if, imagine if Ben was, was older and a boomer.

782
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Yeah.

783
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Uh, hard to imagine.

784
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Hard to imagine.

785
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Imagine if Ben, uh, never discovered Sonichu and he's all like, I'm just, I'm just-

786
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,500
I'm not gonna read Sonichu, I'm just gonna make more comics.

787
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
That's-

788
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
I'm just gonna be good.

789
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,500
I'm just gonna be good and wholesome instead and live my life to the fullest.

790
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah.

791
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That's where, that's the Sonichu Diversions.

792
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah, I think so.

793
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Oh, and I think, uh, I think, yeah, that phrase is good, uh, Dan Pussy, which is another

794
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
book that he wrote.

795
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Dan Pussy?

796
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Dan.

797
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Dan Pussy.

798
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Dan Pussy, okay.

799
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,500
Yeah, which is, which is about like a, a piece of shit nerd who, who's, who's actually

800
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,000
a good comic artist and he like goes up in the industry.

801
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's like a weird, it's like a commentary on just the comic book industry.

802
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,500
Like there's like a bunch of like proxy characters for guys who, who work in these industries.

803
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Like there's like a Stan Lee guy who's like a piece of shit.

804
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Is it, is it like that, is it like that one like Japanese drama about the guy who like

805
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,500
wants, he's like trying to be an animator and he like goes to school alongside the guy?

806
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Blue Blazes?

807
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
Yes.

808
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Um.

809
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Is it anything like that?

810
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Blue Blazes is kind of, Blue Blazes is like hopeful.

811
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Dan Pussy, Dan Pussy is kind of like, kind of like, yeah, sure.

812
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Like kind of like the rise and fall of a character.

813
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I think it's just called Pussy.

814
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Is it called Pussy?

815
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
P-U-S-S-E-Y exclamation point.

816
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh wait, I think the character's name is Dan Pussy, but yeah, the comic's called Pussy.

817
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah.

818
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Pussy, yeah, yeah.

819
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Pussy.

820
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Amazing.

821
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah, that one's good.

822
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Um, he has a bunch of other stuff.

823
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,500
Uh, that feels very like, I don't know how, how you feel about David Lynch, but um, he

824
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
has one book.

825
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Fine, I guess.

826
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,500
He's got one book called, uh, like a Velvet Glove Cast and Iron.

827
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,500
That's like a very, it feels like the most David Lynchian thing Dan Klaus has written.

828
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Um, so, so yeah, if you, if you, if you thought, yeah, David Boring is fine, but what if it

829
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:09,500
was weird or like you should read, um, like a Velvet Glove Cast and Iron?

830
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Like a Velvet Glove Cast and Iron?

831
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
I'm writing all this down.

832
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,500
All right, good.

833
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Taking notes.

834
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Taking notes.

835
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,000
That's like, this is, this is what I want to do.

836
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,500
I just want to uplift my kings.

837
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,500
I just want to expand their minds with a good literature.

838
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Right?

839
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,000
First was an acai bowl.

840
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Now this.

841
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah.

842
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You know, yeah.

843
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,500
You, the acai bowl fueled your body and now I'm feeling your mind, right?

844
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
It's brain food.

845
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Yeah.

846
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,500
You were eating your acai bowl while reading, uh, uh, Daniel Boring.

847
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,500
You were like, whoa, I'm like, I'm like a hundred percent healthy right now.

848
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
It was a triple threat.

849
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Triple.

850
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Triple threat.

851
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Yeah.

852
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,000
So, so if, um, if the next chapter of the Vapors is suddenly more good, um, you know,

853
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,500
it's suddenly good.

854
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Yeah.

855
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
You know who to blame.

856
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,500
You know, you know who to point fingers at.

857
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Uh, good.

858
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Apparently there's a, there's a Hong Kong punk band called David Boring.

859
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Really?

860
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,000
What are their fans?

861
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
There's also a guy who just seems to be coming up when I type David Boring.

862
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Who is this?

863
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
French singer and actor.

864
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Law.

865
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Um, base.

866
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Just like, just like the real David Boring.

867
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Um.

868
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Hmm.

869
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,500
Well, somebody's going to say something to me.

870
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
I heard.

871
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,000
I was, I was going to ask, oh, since, since you are not, since you are not, uh, uh, uh,

872
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
educated, unlike me in the works, in the works of the, of the, of the Daniel Klaus,

873
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
uh, you moved, right?

874
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Oh, I was going to segue into something else.

875
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
No, I didn't mean to segue your segue.

876
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Um, well, I guess I didn't actually have much to talk about.

877
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It was, it was just the, the, the, it was the Kato guy, um, that comic thing.

878
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Oh, the, the Kato anthology.

879
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah.

880
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah.

881
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah.

882
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah.

883
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I, I, I want to do something.

884
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Which I, I don't want to do.

885
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I mentioned it last episode.

886
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's the, it's the, an anthology, this guy, um, Kato and, um, is the, it's a YouTube channel

887
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
and it's got the, the, they're looking for submissions.

888
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
They're going to do a Kickstarter later this year and they'll, yes, I mentioned this on

889
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
the last one and I put the link in the description.

890
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Okay.

891
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So what's up with it?

892
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Well, I, I want to do something and I don't want to just repurpose an old comic mostly

893
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
because it's just difficult to like make it fit into 10 pages or however many is like

894
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the maximum.

895
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yeah.

896
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So I'm thinking, okay, let's do like a short story.

897
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,800
Let's do like a couple pages, maybe two, five pages of just a little story that has a beginning

898
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,160
and middle and an end and it's going to be very easy and it's going to be short and

899
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,160
it's going to be a story and I'm going to write it and why aren't I writing it and what's

900
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
going on?

901
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
It's so difficult.

902
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Yeah.

903
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
Sure.

904
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
What's going wrong?

905
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,160
I can't, I can't figure out how to write a small story anymore.

906
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:15,160
I've, I've spent so long like in my head and on papers, secret papers, like writing huge

907
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:21,160
world building documents for a grand epic that I can't, I can't figure out how to write

908
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,160
a just a small thing that ends at some point.

909
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Well, you got to think of the ending first, right?

910
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,160
They all blow up.

911
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
That's one thing.

912
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
Well, boom, easy, easy.

913
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
That's a start, right?

914
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
They all blow up.

915
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
Yeah.

916
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
I don't know.

917
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
I guess I should have thought of more to talk about.

918
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,160
That was just, I want to do it and I need to get into the like the right mindset, the

919
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
right headspace.

920
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,160
I was thinking maybe I should think about it and then I was thinking maybe I shouldn't

921
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,160
think about it.

922
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,160
Maybe I should just draw something.

923
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
So that's where I am right now.

924
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
I don't know how to think.

925
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:03,160
You saying that makes me a little bit hungry to maybe just, I don't know, I don't know

926
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,160
what context, but like it makes me want to just, just, I don't know, think of like a

927
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,160
new little, like a little, just a little story or something that has like a beginning, middle

928
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,160
end and just draw it or something.

929
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,160
Instead of, you know, because the thing I've been working on now has been like a big long

930
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
thing in there.

931
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Oh God.

932
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Yeah.

933
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Yeah.

934
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Enough.

935
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Yeah.

936
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
I feel that.

937
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:36,160
You should, okay, if you want to, I recommend you do a story about a little goblin character

938
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,160
just running around.

939
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
A little goblin?

940
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
There's a little goblin guy.

941
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
He's a little goblin guy.

942
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,160
They run around and then he gets blown up due to his own actions.

943
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
He's hubris.

944
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
Right?

945
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
Like, yeah.

946
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,160
He's right around getting into little goblin shenanigans and because of all the shenanigans

947
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,160
he pulls, he gets blown up.

948
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,160
It all comes back in his face.

949
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
Like, oh no, the consequence is by action.

950
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
This, I gotta say, this sounds...

951
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Pulling pins out of grenades because he likes the sound it makes.

952
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
Oh, darn.

953
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,160
This is the, this is the, you got a winning formula here.

954
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
You should copy, right?

955
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
Yeah, every story.

956
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,160
Start with a goblin and then work your way up.

957
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,160
Right, exactly.

958
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Just a little goblin guy just doing little goblin shenanigans and then he faces the consequences

959
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
of his actions.

960
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
It's a, it's trying, it's trying to...

961
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,160
It sounds so simple when you just say it like that.

962
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
You have to...

963
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,160
I think it, I mean, I think the thing is it is simple.

964
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:42,160
It is just that I haven't, I haven't set aside the time to do any thinking or doing.

965
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,160
I've just thought about, like, in the future, this will be what I do.

966
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,160
Something related to that.

967
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,160
But right now I'm doing something else and I'll, I'll never, I'll like, never actually

968
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,160
properly think about anything.

969
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
Don't, don't think.

970
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
Just draw.

971
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,160
That's, that's my...

972
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Well, that too.

973
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
But like, what, what I mean is like brainstorming.

974
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,160
Like, talking to someone is so much easier to get ideas out than just thinking to yourself.

975
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
You ever, um...

976
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,160
You're having a conversation that you can bounce off of someone's, like a word someone says.

977
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:15,160
You ever thought about having like a partner, um, like a writing partner of sorts?

978
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
I'm not, I'm not applying.

979
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
I'm not applying.

980
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:23,160
I'm not applying, but I'm just, um, just wondering if there's someone you, you think you could

981
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
like, you could trust.

982
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:31,160
A writing group or partner, just like a, I don't know, writing room, a creative space

983
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,160
where a lot of people are doing things creative and you can talk to them.

984
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,160
That would be good.

985
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
Some sort of thing like that.

986
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
Yeah.

987
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,160
It kind of sucks that you have no...

988
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,160
You just walk in.

989
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,160
Yeah, go on.

990
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,160
Like, you walk into a room and you got your, like, your kawafi and you're like, uh, so,

991
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,160
uh, how about there's a guy and he falls over.

992
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
How about this little goblin?

993
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,160
A cliff.

994
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,160
And then it's like, ah, yeah.

995
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,160
It's, uh, how about this little goblin, right?

996
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,160
And, uh, due to his hubris, right?

997
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
He gets blown up.

998
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,160
Something happened.

999
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,160
He gets blown up.

1000
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,160
It always has to have a goblin and an explosion in it.

1001
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,160
Right, exactly.

1002
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,160
But how, how do we do it?

1003
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,160
He, um, I don't know.

1004
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,160
Maybe, uh, he messes with the people and the people are like, you know what?

1005
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,160
I had enough of this little goblin character.

1006
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,160
We're going to, we're going to trick him.

1007
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,160
And, um...

1008
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
Yeah.

1009
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,160
He keeps, he keeps like throwing rocks at the guy who has the bazooka and he's like,

1010
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,160
haha, this won't be backfire on me.

1011
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,160
And then the guy with the bazooka gets you, shoots him.

1012
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,160
He shoots him and then he's like, damn, I should have not poked.

1013
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
I should have not pissed off the man with the bazooka.

1014
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,160
And maybe it could be a metaphor for like property rights and being a libertarian or something.

1015
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,160
There'll be like a cute mascot character that holds up a sign that just says the moral at the end.

1016
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,160
Yeah, he turns around to like, he turns, after the goblin gets blown up and he's like,

1017
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,160
half of his body is laying, he's bleeding out.

1018
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,160
He looks at the camera and says, I can't believe capitalism caused this.

1019
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,160
Then he dies.

1020
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,160
Yeah, see, it's so much better than like, the amount of progress is made in this.

1021
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,160
Very cool is so much greater than like the number of hours I've thought about thinking about starting about.

1022
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:17,160
I think, I think a very easy way to kind of like write is like, you ever watch a venture bros?

1023
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,160
No.

1024
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Well, well, I guess this isn't really a spoiler, but venture bros is only written by two guys.

1025
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:31,160
And you could tell by watching the show because every scene there's always two people like always bouncing off of each other.

1026
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,160
And they're foils.

1027
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Like every dynamic in the show is like a foil to each other.

1028
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:46,160
Like one character is like selfish, self-absorbed or like stupid and the other character would usually be smart or like centered.

1029
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
And they bounce back at each other.

1030
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:56,160
And if you can think of like a good dynamic, like the basic one is kind of like, oh, one's the silly guy and the other one's the straight guy, right?

1031
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,160
And that's usually like a good starting point.

1032
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,160
Okay, the silly guy and the straight guy get into a car accident.

1033
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,160
What does the silly guy do?

1034
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
I don't think gay people are that silly.

1035
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,160
I feel like that's a homophobic comment to make.

1036
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,160
Yeah.

1037
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,160
Oh, my bad.

1038
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,160
I forgot.

1039
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,160
Silly was a sexuality.

1040
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Well, yeah, it's clown gender.

1041
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
It's clown gender.

1042
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,160
Yeah.

1043
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,160
LGBTS.

1044
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,160
Yeah.

1045
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,160
Where's C?

1046
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
Where's clown in the alphabets?

1047
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
It's the plus.

1048
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,160
That's why the plus is there.

1049
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,160
It's LGBT.

1050
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,160
It's C-L-O-W-N-G-B-T.

1051
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,160
It's C-L-O-W-N.

1052
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,160
I am speaking of clowns.

1053
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,160
I need to meet Andrew Hussey.

1054
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,160
We need to unite forces because he's unironically.

1055
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,160
I think I know what his end game is by reading Psycholonia.

1056
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
I think I know what he's trying to do.

1057
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,160
Do you know his Instagram account?

1058
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,160
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,160
The whole clown boy-y thing.

1060
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,160
Yeah.

1061
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,160
I started following him on my pasta account with the hopes of that being the first step in stone.

1062
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,160
So we could have clown-to-clown communication.

1063
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,160
Pure honks.

1064
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,160
Nothing real words.

1065
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,160
No thoughts, just honks.

1066
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:24,160
A friend of mine showed me screenshots of some sort of private discord with Andrew Hussey.

1067
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,160
He was talking stuff about his left-wing beliefs that unironically I agree with too.

1068
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,160
I think this guy unironically might be on the same page as me.

1069
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,160
I need to meet him.

1070
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,160
I need to be as equal.

1071
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,160
I need to create some sort of franchise that's unrelated to clowns.

1072
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,160
So I could amass the same heights he has.

1073
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,160
And then we need to bounce off of each other and convince.

1074
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:53,160
Because unironically, I do kind of have this big grand plan that's kind of like...

1075
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,160
There is an end game.

1076
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,160
I have an unironic end game to pasta the clown.

1077
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,160
That's kind of like what Z is going through in Psycholonia.

1078
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,160
I have an end game.

1079
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:10,160
I'll say it after the podcast because I don't want this idea to come out just yet.

1080
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,160
But I'll tell you what this crazy end game is like later.

1081
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,160
But I do have a clown influencer end game.

1082
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,160
That's why when reading Psycholonia, I was tripping out.

1083
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,160
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1084
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,160
It's fucking...

1085
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,160
Did you see the latest chapter?

1086
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,160
Yeah, I did.

1087
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,160
I love all the designs. They're so funny.

1088
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,160
I really like how the clowns look in Psycholonia.

1089
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,160
They're all kind of low-key juggalo-based.

1090
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,160
I haven't read the latest chapter yet.

1091
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,160
I haven't read the latest chapter yet, so no spoilers.

1092
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,160
I get my clown...

1093
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,160
It's just jubilites, jubilite designs.

1094
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,160
Yeah, they're more jubilites.

1095
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:00,160
My clown designs are more like killer clowns from outer space.

1096
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,160
That's how I get mine from.

1097
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,160
That's my fucking influence.

1098
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,160
Have you guys seen that movie?

1099
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,160
No, I haven't.

1100
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,160
It's just Psycholonia.

1101
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,160
It's Psycholonia.

1102
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,160
There's a space clown in Psycholonia, right?

1103
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,160
It all comes back.

1104
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,160
Uh, based...

1105
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,160
It's funny that you mentioned the whole like,

1106
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,160
Andrew Hussie, I want to make like a big thing so that we can talk.

1107
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,160
Because I remember feeling like that once when I read Homestuck

1108
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,160
and I'm like, oh, I should become a super famous person

1109
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,160
so that I can be friends with Andrew Hussie and talk about stuff.

1110
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,160
It's such a visual reaction.

1111
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,160
I know as a mere viewer, an audience member,

1112
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,160
that I have no sway in this situation.

1113
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,160
I have to become like a juggernaut in order to say hello.

1114
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,160
I must.

1115
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,160
Yeah, it's like a nice thought.

1116
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,160
It's that parasocial relationship thing, you know?

1117
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,160
I mean, it's like that, but it's like a little...

1118
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,160
It's turned to a little more of a good end, I guess,

1119
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,160
if it makes you want to do something with your life.

1120
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,160
If it motivates you to do...

1121
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,160
I mean, I think a lot of the stuff I've ever done

1122
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:28,160
has been motivated partially by feeling like I need to impress people.

1123
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Oh my god, that's me.

1124
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,160
So if I don't have anything to show, why is anyone going to pay attention to me?

1125
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,160
Why is anyone going to say hello or whatever?

1126
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,160
I'm not good at the social stuff.

1127
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,160
I can't just say hello and it'd be a really cool hello.

1128
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,160
No, I need stuff to back it up.

1129
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,160
I need images. I need a website with my comics on it.

1130
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
I can say, hey, look what I do.

1131
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,160
Social anxiety is like, you need to compensate for it all the time.

1132
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:05,160
Right. I always fantasize about being invited to special events in different countries.

1133
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:11,160
To countries I wouldn't even go to visit unless I was invited to, you know?

1134
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,160
Uh-huh.

1135
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,160
There's like a comic festival.

1136
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:23,160
I guess a big example that I would think of is there's this comic creator named Ed Piscor

1137
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:30,160
who got commissioned by a rapper in Japan to do album art for him.

1138
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:41,160
And Ed Piscor says, I'll do it if you pay for a luxury vacation for me to spend a month in Japan.

1139
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,160
And he did. He got paid that way, right?

1140
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:51,160
And then when he got to Japan, the creator of Afro Samurai heard that he was in Japan

1141
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,160
and he assigned a meeting with him so they could meet.

1142
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,160
And that's so fucking rad.

1143
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,160
Imagine going to a country and one of the big artists in that country finds out you're there

1144
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,160
and they DM you like, yo, let's fucking meet up, dude.

1145
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,160
That's so fucking cool.

1146
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,160
That sounds so like, I don't know, it's that like, wouldn't it be nice to be famous

1147
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:18,160
so I could do these specific things, you know?

1148
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,160
Yeah.

1149
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1150
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,160
I don't know whether that would be like a person that I would...

1151
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,160
Like, it would be cool if people were interested in what I did.

1152
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,160
But like, I don't, I haven't really thought about like,

1153
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,160
if this person said, hey, love your stuff, let's meet up and chat.

1154
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,160
Even if it was Andrew, I'd say, I wouldn't even know what to do.

1155
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,160
It'd be like, oh.

1156
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,160
Hi, hello.

1157
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,160
I would, I would want, I would want him to say, hey, listen, hey, listen.

1158
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:57,160
I've got, I've got a plan and you, and I want you to be in on it.

1159
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,160
And I've got something that we could, we could work together on.

1160
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:06,160
I've got some, I've got a devious, a devious plan for some kind of collaboration.

1161
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,160
I want you to show up on my YouTube reviews.

1162
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,160
I want you to appear in my move, my nostalgic movie reviews.

1163
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,160
Doug Walker.

1164
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,160
Yes, please.

1165
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,160
Oh, yes.

1166
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,160
I always wanted to be in a skit in a...

1167
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,160
Andrew Pussy.

1168
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,160
That guy with the glasses.

1169
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:25,160
Doug, Doug Walker appears in Homestuck 2 to say, oh, what am I doing here?

1170
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,160
I already, what do you do?

1171
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,160
I already reviewed this movie.

1172
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,160
And then he yells.

1173
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,160
He yells really loud.

1174
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,160
But Doug, it's not a movie.

1175
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,160
That's credit card?

1176
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,160
Um, I can't wait, I can't wait for the day Andrew Pussy DMs me.

1177
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,160
And he, he, he, he, it's post a picture of him with an AK-47.

1178
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,160
And he says like, geez, he strap up.

1179
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,160
We're going to make cycloneos in real life.

1180
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:55,160
He says, he says, it says, I've, I've, I've faked a gas attack on the island of Nantucket.

1181
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,160
Get on your boat and come out.

1182
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,160
We've got to, we've got to fend off the mainland police.

1183
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,160
On the, on the island of America.

1184
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,160
Yeah.

1185
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,160
I like, oh, right, right away, sir.

1186
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,160
And then I hop into my clown movie.

1187
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,160
Right away, sir, yes.

1188
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,160
Sorry, yes, sir.

1189
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,160
Yeah, yeah, right away, of course.

1190
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,160
Oh, God.

1191
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:23,160
You get into your, your clown boat and there's like 50,000 people stuffed into a tiny little yacht.

1192
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,160
It's so...

1193
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,160
Tiny little rowboat.

1194
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,160
Just all in one boat.

1195
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,160
Oh, that's great.

1196
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,160
Yeah, give your full will, your filled with ideas.

1197
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,160
My name you think of that.

1198
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,160
There you go.

1199
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:41,160
But I should write the story about a clown boat where there's so many clowns in the boat.

1200
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,160
Look, just, just, just, here's an easy formula.

1201
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,160
Just one character is super horny and the other character is not horny.

1202
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,160
Boom.

1203
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,160
There you go.

1204
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,160
There's a formula for you.

1205
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,160
Okay, re-reading psychologials.

1206
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,160
It's like that meme with the guy shooting the message over the, the cyberpunk guy shoots the message over the head.

1207
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,160
You know?

1208
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1209
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,160
But it's like, but it, but you're reading it and you're like, oh boy.

1210
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:13,160
Uh, the, the, the, I don't know, fucking capitalism is bad and millennials sure do you hate, hate life.

1211
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:18,160
And the shooting the message over your head is wouldn't it be fucked up if there were clowns in a boat?

1212
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:28,160
I wanted to, I, I want to describe psycholonial as it's literally the Joker movie.

1213
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,160
If the Joker actually believed in something.

1214
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,160
Mmm.

1215
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,160
I still haven't, I've never saw the Joker.

1216
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
I never saw the Joker.

1217
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
The Joker, I haven't seen it either.

1218
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,160
The Joker is just psycholonials, but dumbed down.

1219
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:46,160
But if you, but if you liked, if you liked all the Joker memes you've seen, it's probably worth the watch.

1220
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,160
Um, I kind of meant to watch and I just never got around to it.

1221
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,160
I, um, I wanted to get a wacky Phoenix.

1222
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:58,160
I wanted to make a wacky Phoenix.

1223
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,160
I wanted to get, um, I wanted to get a screenshot from the Joker movie.

1224
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,160
The one where it's like, he's on the talk show and it's all like, wait, you actually believe so-and-so.

1225
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,160
And then the Joker replies, yes, and I'm tired of pretending.

1226
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:15,160
It's not, I was going to get the guy saying like, wait, you actually think it's funny when cops get shot.

1227
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,160
And then it would be Z in the Joker's chair and she'd be like, yes, and I'm tired of pretending.

1228
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,160
It's not.

1229
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,160
It's a good meme.

1230
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,160
It's a good meme.

1231
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,160
It's a good meme.

1232
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,160
If someone wants to beat me to it, just go ahead.

1233
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,160
I got, I got, I got, I'm going to scramble.

1234
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,160
I'm going to scramble off the podcast and post it.

1235
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,160
I'm not even going to at you.

1236
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,160
This is a mess.

1237
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,160
It's fine.

1238
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,160
I still tweet, I still tweet all the time.

1239
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,160
But this is a message for Andrew Hussie.

1240
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,160
Don't worry, I'm going to, I'm going to get huge.

1241
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
We're going to clown up pretty soon.

1242
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
It's going to be great.

1243
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:56,160
I have, I have a couple of clown plans, a couple of plans that might put me on the CIA watchlist.

1244
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,160
I can't say more.

1245
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,160
And CIA watchlist, as in they follow your like social media.

1246
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,160
Oh, yeah.

1247
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,160
I like you.

1248
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,160
Aren't you, isn't it true?

1249
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,160
Isn't it true that you're on trial now?

1250
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,160
Is it true that you are the editor for the pizza party podcast now?

1251
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,160
Yes.

1252
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
Yes, I am.

1253
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,160
I am the editor for the pizza party podcast.

1254
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,160
You're like there.

1255
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
You're like there.

1256
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,160
Eleazar.

1257
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,160
Yeah, I'm there.

1258
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,160
I'm there.

1259
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,160
Eleazar.

1260
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,160
That's so fucked up.

1261
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,160
That's so fucked up.

1262
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,160
That is pretty fucked up.

1263
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:29,160
Can you like, can you like make them, you just sentence mix them to say stupid shit?

1264
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,160
Easily.

1265
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,160
Easily.

1266
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,160
I don't even have to try.

1267
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,160
Got him.

1268
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,160
It would be child.

1269
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,160
Damn.

1270
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,160
Got him.

1271
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:44,160
But I'm, I'm very tempted to, to make like a, like a, like a compilation of all the same

1272
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,160
sounds that like pan pizza likes to repeat in like every episode.

1273
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,160
Wait, who does pan pizza?

1274
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:56,160
He has like a, he has like a, he has like five sounds that he always makes in every episode

1275
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,160
and he likes to play them on repeat.

1276
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,160
Or you just like to like say it a lot, right?

1277
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,160
Like, uh, like there's the classic like, yeah, yeah, like he'll say, yeah, yeah.

1278
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,160
Right.

1279
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,160
Okay.

1280
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,160
Like every time someone says something like mean or rude, he would be like under his breath

1281
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:18,160
will say like rude or, or, or if it's like, or if there's like a quiet silence, he'd be

1282
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,160
like, yeah.

1283
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,160
Yeah.

1284
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,160
Like he'll, he'll do that.

1285
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,160
Like I, it's just something I fucking noticed.

1286
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,160
This is a monster.

1287
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,160
Wow.

1288
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,160
He's such an asshole.

1289
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,160
I can't believe it.

1290
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,160
He would say such terrible things.

1291
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,160
He's not, he's not human.

1292
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,160
He's beyond.

1293
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:40,160
Speaking of, and also I kind of like, uh, so, so, so you know, you know, Nolan, right?

1294
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,160
He's former member of the peaks of party podcast.

1295
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:50,160
I, I mean, I only knew him because I guess, I guess in the past him and Trixie had some

1296
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,160
bad blood, but then I guess that didn't matter at all.

1297
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:58,160
And then I was on that episode with him and I didn't, I don't know.

1298
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,160
So I knew that he was a guy on the thing.

1299
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,160
Yeah.

1300
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:09,160
Um, he, uh, he recently left the show because, um, I don't know if I don't even know if getting

1301
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:13,160
canceled the right term, but let's say he was, he was pretty sus person.

1302
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,160
Like, yeah.

1303
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:19,160
For the longest time, I would always hear rumors about him like emotionally manipulating

1304
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,160
like other artists to like get artwork out of them.

1305
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,160
I read his letter.

1306
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,160
I read his like response.

1307
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
The Google doc thing.

1308
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,160
Yes.

1309
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,160
Yeah.

1310
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,160
I have a copy of it because he deleted the original.

1311
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,160
Good.

1312
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,160
Yeah.

1313
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,160
I mean that forever.

1314
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,160
Yeah.

1315
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,160
I still have it.

1316
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,160
And he, um, yeah, like the whole he, for people who don't know, um, Nolan is very infamous

1317
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,160
for having a very specific fetish.

1318
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:50,160
Like he, uh, he liked it when like characters got wrapped and like, as in like, as in like

1319
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,160
tied up and like, uh, yeah.

1320
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,160
In, uh, what's the word?

1321
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,160
Not entangled.

1322
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,160
Uh, just like wrapped up bound up.

1323
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
Yeah.

1324
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,160
Yeah.

1325
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,160
Yeah.

1326
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,160
And if you, um, and if you like, for example, like if his little avatar on the pizza party

1327
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,160
podcast looked like a pill, but this, it isn't actually a pill.

1328
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,360
It's actually supposed to be, um, Jake, the dog from adventure time, like wrapped up in

1329
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,000
web from one specific episode.

1330
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,160
It just like stylized like a pill, right?

1331
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,160
Uh, what?

1332
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,160
Wait, look, wait, hold up.

1333
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,160
I'm going to look for a picture.

1334
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,160
Okay.

1335
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:34,160
If you, if you look for a picture of like, Nolan's like avatar, he has like a, he has

1336
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,160
like a little yellow and white like pill on his shirt.

1337
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,160
Okay.

1338
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,160
But it's supposed to be a Jake, the dog, like wrapped up in spider web.

1339
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,160
Neat.

1340
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,160
I remember that episode.

1341
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,160
Right.

1342
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,160
Yeah.

1343
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,160
Yeah.

1344
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,160
That's the episode with the spider.

1345
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,160
So weird.

1346
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,160
That's so weird.

1347
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,160
You would do that.

1348
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,160
Make that your logo.

1349
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,160
Okay.

1350
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,160
Whatever.

1351
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:07,160
I always felt like this guy has like Nutella smear it on his arms.

1352
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,160
Yeah.

1353
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:13,160
Um, and he would specifically always like, you know, there's nothing wrong with like having

1354
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:17,160
a fetish and commissioning people to like draw it as long as like the art it consists.

1355
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,160
But the weird thing, the two of the weird things he would do is like, he would kind of use

1356
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,160
his popularity on the podcast to like emotionally manipulate like art out of people.

1357
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,160
To get artists to draw.

1358
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,160
Sure.

1359
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,160
To draw his fetish.

1360
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:35,160
And also for some reason he would always want the artists to draw like they're so not getting

1361
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,160
wrapped.

1362
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:43,160
See what, what I don't really understand is like, I wouldn't, if I had like a fetish at

1363
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:50,160
first, a particular thing, I, I don't really get like wanting a particular person like

1364
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,160
to draw it or it seemed, I don't know.

1365
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,160
And this kind of thing, it seems like you want all these different artists to like draw

1366
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,160
your thing.

1367
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,160
I would be like, maybe I have one artist whose style I like and maybe I like to see when

1368
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,160
they draw it.

1369
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,160
Uh, I don't know.

1370
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:10,160
Like what I'm saying is that it's a very like weirdly, like personal relationship there.

1371
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,160
I feel like you could,

1372
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,160
Between artist and con commissioner.

1373
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,160
Right.

1374
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,160
And he would, he would also like, um, still like get commissions from like minors to get

1375
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:24,160
their like little sonas like wrapped in web too, which is so kind of, he was doing this,

1376
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,160
he was doing this until like last summer.

1377
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,160
It's a little,

1378
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,160
It's a little sus.

1379
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,160
It's a little weird.

1380
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,160
It's a little sus.

1381
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,160
It's a little sus.

1382
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:37,160
There's, I think there's, I think there's sometimes little like kind of context.

1383
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:42,160
There's like weird thing that people could do that maybe at first don't seem weird.

1384
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,160
You could like, you, you could explain like any, any particular instance of that you could

1385
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,160
explain like, Oh, well, it's not about the fact that we're underage or maybe he didn't

1386
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:55,160
know the artist was underage or maybe it was like some, but like, if you have like a pattern

1387
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,160
of doing that, then it's like, it's then it's big, then it becomes sus.

1388
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,160
Right.

1389
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,160
Yeah.

1390
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,160
Right.

1391
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:07,160
Um, it kind of reminds me like, um, uh, do you remember the whole incident with, uh,

1392
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,160
John Bob?

1393
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:15,160
I watched, um, I didn't really know what that was about, but I did watch the, the Bernie

1394
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,160
video about it.

1395
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,160
Yeah.

1396
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,160
It's very, um, yeah.

1397
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,160
That's a really good video.

1398
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,160
I like to rewatch it.

1399
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,160
Um, I'm not calling Nolan a groomer.

1400
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,160
There's like no evidence that he's a groomer.

1401
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:32,160
I read the letter and like his explanation, it did, it like, it doesn't mean that like

1402
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:40,160
it's okay to be like having this sort of like pseudo relationship over this fetish with

1403
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,160
like underage.

1404
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,160
It doesn't make it okay, but it did kind of be like, I can see why.

1405
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:49,160
Like he basically says that like basically an older person sort of groomed him when he

1406
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:55,160
was a kid and he like internalized it and sort of told himself that it was okay to like

1407
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:00,160
cope with it, I guess, which is like, I guess I can see why that would happen.

1408
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,160
It doesn't sound too outrageous.

1409
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,160
So yeah.

1410
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,160
Okay.

1411
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,160
No, I got that.

1412
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:12,160
I'm just saying that like with John Bob specifically, like he, um, he would like to draw other people's

1413
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,160
hands, like beating, beating him up.

1414
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,160
Right.

1415
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,160
And like at first, at first it's like a fun, at first it's like a funny gag.

1416
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,160
Right.

1417
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
But it's kind of like, I don't know.

1418
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,160
It's just kind of weird because it later turns out that he might have had like a humiliation

1419
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,160
fetish.

1420
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,160
Right.

1421
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,160
And so he's getting like all these other people's like popular sonos and he's like using that

1422
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,160
to beat up his little, oh, I'm just a little guy.

1423
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,160
I'm just a little guy getting beat up.

1424
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,160
Haha.

1425
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,160
Isn't that funny?

1426
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,160
Haha.

1427
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,160
Like it is.

1428
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,160
It is funny.

1429
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,660
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like, um, this is probably something artists should like

1430
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,160
look out for is like when people draw other people's sonos, how, what they do that, like,

1431
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,160
like for example, let's say like, uh, I don't know, let's say someone.

1432
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
What was the word?

1433
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,160
There's like a particular word for this.

1434
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,160
Right.

1435
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:03,440
For when you, when you, when you, when you like get art, when you get fetish art drawn

1436
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,160
of yours for you, but and you're like, you try to like hunt down more people and get

1437
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,160
more.

1438
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,160
There's a particular like verb that I had never heard before that someone said, oh,

1439
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,160
Nolan was blanking.

1440
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,160
And I said, what?

1441
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,160
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1442
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,160
Oh, wait.

1443
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,160
Fetish mining.

1444
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,160
Mining.

1445
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,160
Mining.

1446
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,160
Yeah.

1447
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,160
That was it.

1448
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,160
Yeah.

1449
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,160
He's a notorious fetish miner.

1450
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,160
It's so crazy.

1451
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,160
I remember.

1452
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,160
But it's M-I-N-E-R.

1453
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,160
Yeah.

1454
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,160
I remember when someone, that definition was floating around on Twitter.

1455
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,160
There was like several people in the comments who said like, oh yeah, Nolan from the pizza

1456
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,160
party podcast.

1457
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,160
Like, um, he, he, he was like that.

1458
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,160
And it's so funny because if he, like, I've talked to other friends and other like little

1459
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,160
art circles and everyone, every other person kind of has like a, yeah, like Nolan commissioned

1460
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,160
me to draw my sonna getting wrapped.

1461
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,160
Like you, you fucking see that.

1462
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,160
Oh my God.

1463
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,160
This motherfucker was getting every other person to draw.

1464
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,160
Like, it's just so weird.

1465
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,160
Like, why, like, I want to see you specifically get wrapped.

1466
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,160
Oh my God.

1467
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,160
Like, okay.

1468
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,160
Like, yeah.

1469
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,160
Yeah.

1470
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,160
It's so weird.

1471
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,160
I don't, I don't, that's not how I relate to pornography.

1472
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,160
Yeah.

1473
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,160
Personally.

1474
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:15,160
I don't, I don't think I ever commissioned anything NSFW.

1475
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,160
Does that remember?

1476
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,160
Um, I want to see commission people to draw like Pasta the Clown, but mostly just funky

1477
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,160
poses.

1478
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,160
Honestly.

1479
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,160
Yeah.

1480
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:28,160
I wouldn't, if I were, I wouldn't, I don't think I would do it.

1481
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:34,560
I would feel like a weird, it would be kind of like I was asking them to show me themselves

1482
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,560
naked or something.

1483
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,560
Or like, do something.

1484
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,560
It's like, hey, you do something to make me fucking come, right?

1485
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,560
Like it's not.

1486
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,560
Yeah.

1487
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,560
Yeah.

1488
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,920
It's sort of not even, it's, I would feel uncomfortable with it because it sort of makes

1489
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,560
it like not just about the content.

1490
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,560
Yeah.

1491
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,560
Right.

1492
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,360
Like, oh, draw Sonic the Hedgehog getting wrapped.

1493
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,360
I mean, that's fine.

1494
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:00,720
Cause Sonic's like a fictional character, but like draw, draw Pasta the Clown getting

1495
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,720
wrapped.

1496
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,560
It's like, uh, I think I'm good.

1497
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,560
Yeah.

1498
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,560
It.

1499
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,560
Yeah.

1500
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:12,560
At least Merlogic has the common courtesy to have cartoon characters by Wonder Bread.

1501
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,560
Yeah.

1502
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,560
Yeah.

1503
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,560
Yeah.

1504
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:20,560
He's got, he's, he's got, he's not here, he's not here for your OC.

1505
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,560
Yeah.

1506
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,560
He's not interested in your OC unless she's blonde, rich and white.

1507
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,560
Right.

1508
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,560
Sure.

1509
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,560
Which, you know.

1510
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,560
And no, no one has that.

1511
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,560
No one.

1512
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,560
Oh yeah.

1513
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,560
Oh yeah.

1514
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,560
But also, um, I'm pseudo, like taking over Nolan's role on the podcast kind of, that's

1515
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,560
fucking epic.

1516
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,560
That's fucking epic.

1517
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,560
That's, that's literally based in red pill.

1518
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,560
That's, that's based in rap pills.

1519
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,560
Yeah.

1520
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,360
I'm kind of taking over his role in the podcast, but like on my, on the previous episode I

1521
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,960
showed up on the podcast, uh, let's just say that a lot of people thought I was little

1522
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,680
too cringe.

1523
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:00,960
So I don't know how consistently I'm going to be on because, um, the episode actually

1524
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:07,680
was that, was that we, okay, I would, people should, people should go migrate from this

1525
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:13,960
episode and go, wait, people got to start posting no cheesy, no watch on PPP episodes.

1526
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,960
That's the only way.

1527
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,280
That's the only way.

1528
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:21,320
Go and find Cheesy's last episode and say no cheesy, no watch, no cheesy, no watch.

1529
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,400
If you go, yeah, yeah.

1530
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:27,120
So once the new episode drops, which is probably going to be probably already dropped by now,

1531
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,760
um, or it drops next week, I don't know, pan pizza is weird sometimes with a scheduling

1532
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,200
like for sometimes two weeks in a row, he just won't upload anything.

1533
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,720
And then he'll just upload something the next, it's so, yeah, it's so weirdly consistent.

1534
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:45,280
But um, the next episode, I'm not on cause they wanted to, I remember pan like first

1535
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,240
asking me if I wanted to be on and I'm like, sure.

1536
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:52,480
And then like once everyone was in the call, um, I tried to jump in and I couldn't cause

1537
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,800
I didn't have the recording role.

1538
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,480
And I'm like, and then I DM pan like saying, like, um, I don't got the recording role.

1539
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,240
I can't jump into the call and then pans like, yeah, actually, um, I second thought,

1540
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:05,000
we just kind of want to focus on the guests, which, uh, isn't a, isn't a bad thing.

1541
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,360
It's just kind of like, they probably don't really want me to inconsistent.

1542
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,880
Also, like I kind of low key pissed them off.

1543
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,920
Like the last episode I was on.

1544
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,040
Why?

1545
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:22,920
I, so towards the end of the last episode, um, I got them all mad at me because, um, so,

1546
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:27,000
okay, so what happened was that we were on the topic of whether or not like,

1547
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,320
like hot girls listen to the pizza party podcast.

1548
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,120
And, um, Izzy said that.

1549
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:32,640
Okay.

1550
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,920
Izzy said, no, I'm going to say no.

1551
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,880
Yeah, that's what, that's what me and Pam were saying.

1552
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,400
They're all listening to the PCP.

1553
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:38,800
Yeah.

1554
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,920
All the hot girls listen to the PCP, but, um, but, uh, but, but Izzy said that,

1555
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,520
yeah, actually there is hot girls that listen to, to the pizza party podcast.

1556
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,760
And she linked someone called stripper waifu, right.

1557
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:57,080
And like, I, I guess I, I assume they might have been some sort of sex worker with

1558
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,880
that name and with their profile picture that was suggested.

1559
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,000
I, I looked for their media tab and I couldn't find any pictures.

1560
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,200
And then I'm like, Izzy, this person doesn't got any pictures in the media tabs.

1561
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,480
How could I confirm they're hot?

1562
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,240
Right.

1563
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,520
And then I noticed in their bio, they have an only fans, right?

1564
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,320
And, um, so, so I was like, can you, can you, I want to see this person like me.

1565
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:16,880
Okay.

1566
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,000
Find me, find me the links.

1567
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,480
Show me stripper waifu.

1568
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,600
Hold up.

1569
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,000
Let's see if I could, let's see if she still has that name.

1570
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,160
Um, well, okay.

1571
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:28,800
Okay.

1572
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,920
While I look, while I, please, I'm so thirsty.

1573
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,040
Okay.

1574
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:32,360
Okay.

1575
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:37,640
While I look, while I look for that, um, tell you the rest of what happened.

1576
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:38,720
For sure.

1577
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,200
Sure.

1578
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:46,160
So, so basically, um, I see that she has an only fans, right?

1579
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,240
Um, yeah.

1580
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,160
And I'm like, oh, cool.

1581
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,960
Um, let's, let's check her prices live on the podcast, right?

1582
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,440
And, and they, and they, and they were all like, they're all like, uh, don't do that.

1583
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:58,880
That's weird.

1584
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,520
Don't do that.

1585
01:12:59,560 --> 01:12:59,800
Right.

1586
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,160
Like, uh, don't do that.

1587
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,720
And I'm like, all right.

1588
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,000
Okay.

1589
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,560
Like they all, they all told me to like, they all told me to stop.

1590
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,360
I'm like, okay, right.

1591
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:06,480
Right.

1592
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,520
And then I, and then I pretended that I stopped and then I quickly blurt out like her prices.

1593
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:11,840
Right.

1594
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,760
And then they all like, I'm super fucking mad at me.

1595
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,320
Okay.

1596
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,200
Well, they told you they didn't want you to.

1597
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,560
Yeah, they didn't tell me they didn't.

1598
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,520
No, yeah, I mean, I, I get that.

1599
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,760
I get, I understand I went too far.

1600
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:22,920
Okay.

1601
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:28,120
I don't really get why it's like a problem, but like, I guess if they didn't want you

1602
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,240
to, then whatever.

1603
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:29,640
I don't know.

1604
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:35,440
I guess cause I did like, I guess they didn't want me to think, um, I don't know.

1605
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,320
They maybe thought I was going to go into a more misogynistic joke.

1606
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,440
I mean, here, okay.

1607
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:46,760
Here's the thing, the stripper waifu, like, um, like she had.

1608
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,280
Some really affordable prices.

1609
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:51,880
Oh, okay.

1610
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,000
Like, unironically, her prices are really fucking affordable.

1611
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,040
What, what a deal.

1612
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:56,680
Yeah.

1613
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:02,000
And I was about to say, like, I think it was like a three point, like, I think it was

1614
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,160
three dollars, three, three point 50, like dollars a month.

1615
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,920
And I'm like, Oh my God, that's a fucking, that's a fucking steal.

1616
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,200
That's nothing.

1617
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
That's nothing.

1618
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:13,360
Right.

1619
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,680
Like, yeah, I could afford 10 stripper waifus.

1620
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,120
Well, okay.

1621
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,040
Well, you got to, we got to, all right.

1622
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,040
We got to patch things up.

1623
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,040
We got to patch things up between you and the pizza, the pizza party podcast.

1624
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,080
So we can have a man on the inside subverting them.

1625
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,840
Yeah, I'll be the, I'll be the PCP member on the inside.

1626
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,840
You can't, can't stop me.

1627
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,040
Um, base.

1628
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,040
Show me the lady.

1629
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,000
Show me the lady.

1630
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,880
I'm looking for the money.

1631
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,480
Please, please.

1632
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,400
She's easy.

1633
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,800
I'm looking for anything.

1634
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,240
I'll even, I'll even pay three pounds or anything.

1635
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,240
Please, she needs, she needs my money.

1636
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:55,720
Cheesy.

1637
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:56,320
I can't.

1638
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,680
Oh my God, you are literally, you are literally.

1639
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,320
Destroying a sex worker's career.

1640
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,320
On our right now, I'm, I'm, wait, wait, I'm sorry.

1641
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:07,880
Haha.

1642
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:12,360
Wait, I literally just want to see her and think if I say if I think she's hot.

1643
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,120
I just want to see, do I, do I agree with Izzy that a hot girl

1644
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,520
watches the pizza party podcast?

1645
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,040
Okay, cool.

1646
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:17,760
I found her.

1647
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:18,560
Uh-oh.

1648
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:18,960
Oh, no.

1649
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,760
I'm very skeptical.

1650
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:21,840
Okay.

1651
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,360
Here's her.

1652
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:22,680
Yeah.

1653
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:22,920
Okay.

1654
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,440
I found our only fans is right here.

1655
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,720
Oh my God.

1656
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,360
This is it.

1657
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,280
Oh, no, no, no.

1658
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:27,800
The symbol of truth.

1659
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,760
Um.

1660
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:31,400
Hmm.

1661
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,960
Well, what is that?

1662
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:38,880
I can only see like a tiny, I can only see her avatar and it's so filtered.

1663
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,000
I, I can't really.

1664
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,000
Yeah, I just can't tell.

1665
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,840
I can't, I can't really even make a determination.

1666
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:49,480
Okay, wait, so it's, oh wait, stripper waifu underscore.

1667
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,600
Let's strip her underscore waifu.

1668
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:53,320
All right.

1669
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,480
Or wait, this one is stripper underscore waifu.

1670
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,040
But do you have like a Twitter or something?

1671
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,440
Um, look, I swear she had a Twitter, I mean, she might have nuked it.

1672
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,320
Hmm.

1673
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:07,760
Cause of the pizza.

1674
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,320
It's cause you talked about it on the pizza party podcast.

1675
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,720
She just couldn't take the heat.

1676
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,440
I, I killed, I killed her.

1677
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,920
Now, now the PC, she's on the PCP.

1678
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,480
Oh, hold up, hold up, founder.

1679
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,320
Found her.

1680
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,280
Here it is.

1681
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,080
Mistress Wednesday, stripper waifu.

1682
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,240
Uh, okay.

1683
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:35,760
I, I would say, I would say that if someone called this a hot girl, I wouldn't be like,

1684
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,840
Nuh-uh.

1685
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,240
So this is fine.

1686
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,080
No, she's, she's, she's attractive.

1687
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:40,760
She's attractive.

1688
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,800
All right, Izzy, you win this round.

1689
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,360
You win this time.

1690
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,680
I'll get you next, I'll get you next time.

1691
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,080
Um, damn, she, she, she cranked up her prices.

1692
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,800
No, it's cause you gave her, it's cause you gave her the, the, the signal boost.

1693
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,320
Yeah, I, I like, you fucked up the supply demand curve.

1694
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,480
I could have, I could have, yeah, exact, exactly.

1695
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:01,640
Yeah.

1696
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,200
Once I blur it out, the 3.50 and then everyone in the, everyone was like,

1697
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,680
that's so affordable.

1698
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,560
What, what a steal.

1699
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,560
So they all jumped in, they all jumped in and now it went out.

1700
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,480
Damn, I fucked it.

1701
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,880
Well, it looks like she's doing good.

1702
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,040
Um, does it say like percentage of, doesn't it?

1703
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:18,920
Good for her.

1704
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:19,800
Good for her.

1705
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,480
Good for her.

1706
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,120
Yeah.

1707
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,160
I, I hope, I hope this conversation doesn't backfire on me.

1708
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:25,960
It probably won't.

1709
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,720
Who, who listens to, who listens to the PCP?

1710
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,640
I can't think of a single.

1711
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,400
Yeah, no, yeah, only, only hot girls listen to the PCP.

1712
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:35,640
That's right.

1713
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,480
That's right.

1714
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,000
And they like this, and they like this kind of stuff.

1715
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:43,640
I love going into the comments of that episode.

1716
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,160
And like, there's like, like the majority of people were like,

1717
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,800
saying that I was like, cringed, not funny.

1718
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,320
I kept talking over people and there's like three people who really liked

1719
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,240
me and said like, I need to, I need to come back.

1720
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,520
Hmm.

1721
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,280
And I know Cheesy, no watch, no Cheesy.

1722
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,640
No, Cheesy, no watch, no.

1723
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,800
Cheesy, no watch.

1724
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:08,680
So wait, I want to know what he want to know.

1725
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,920
Yeah, but I wanna know about your new place.

1726
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,340
Oh, all right.

1727
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:17,360
I'm in a new place of residence.

1728
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,680
I never really talk about it because, of course,

1729
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,880
it's embarrassing.

1730
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,840
I was still living with my parents.

1731
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,640
Yeah, that had to go, that had to go.

1732
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,480
Yep.

1733
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,840
Yeah, it's always been difficult

1734
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,160
like trying to figure out where to move if I wanted to

1735
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,880
because if I go further into London,

1736
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,960
the prices get really expensive.

1737
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,160
And if I go further out of London,

1738
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,640
if I need to commute into London for work,

1739
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,760
then it's just more of an annoyance.

1740
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:54,160
And I got an opportunity, a person I know,

1741
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,720
set me up with a room and they've given me

1742
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,520
like pretty good rent for it.

1743
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,440
And it's really nice.

1744
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:05,440
I'm in a place and I have fucking,

1745
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,680
I have a little bathroom to myself.

1746
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,400
I have a small kitchen area to myself.

1747
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,760
It's all one big room and like a fold out sofa bed.

1748
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,960
It's like so much privacy, it's unbelievable.

1749
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,160
That actually sounds considerably nicer than where I live.

1750
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,000
I'm jealous.

1751
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,840
Cool.

1752
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,040
It's, yeah, I feel like I can,

1753
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,480
that my favorite thing about it, unironically,

1754
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:36,120
is that I am responsible for cleaning up my own messes.

1755
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,720
I know that I usually try to clean up my own,

1756
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,280
I usually try to clean up my own stuff

1757
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,440
when I was at my parents' house just because it's polite.

1758
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,480
A lot of the time it's like dirty dishes,

1759
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:52,480
only like two of those are mine, not, there's no space.

1760
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,000
Somebody's got to do the washing up.

1761
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,040
Do I have to do it?

1762
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,720
I didn't put that shit there.

1763
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,040
That would always annoy me.

1764
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,520
But now, if there's a big pile of crap,

1765
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,920
I know that it's me that did that.

1766
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,640
And it's my responsibility and it feels fine.

1767
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:10,720
It feels completely guilt-free, no annoyance at all.

1768
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,640
I'll scrub those dishes, yes, sir,

1769
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,120
and I'll do it with a smile on my face.

1770
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,240
And I'm, it's all, I mean,

1771
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,720
I'll probably get bored of it eventually.

1772
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,920
But I just like that.

1773
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,760
No, never.

1774
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,640
God, God, I wish that was me.

1775
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,360
God, I wish that was me.

1776
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,920
It's, it's, it's very good.

1777
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,320
I can't, I can't like,

1778
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,760
I can't pretend that it wasn't like very fortunate

1779
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:37,800
that this happened.

1780
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,520
I just happened to know a person who had the space,

1781
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,960
the person they were running with left

1782
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,560
and they liked me.

1783
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,880
So friendship-

1784
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,960
It all works out.

1785
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,440
That's the, I mean, that's the best,

1786
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,520
that's all the best like deals,

1787
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,720
all the best situations you get in life

1788
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,680
because like you knew someone and they were like,

1789
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,200
oh, hey, I can hook you up.

1790
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,440
Yeah, I mean, that's how to do it.

1791
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,280
The professional term is connections, right?

1792
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,480
Right, right, right, right.

1793
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,640
Yeah, what the fuck?

1794
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,640
Network.

1795
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,080
What the fuck's up with those?

1796
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:09,920
What?

1797
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,760
It's just his nepotism.

1798
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:11,600
It's so annoying.

1799
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,080
What's the deal with networking?

1800
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,240
I mean, I hate it, but like,

1801
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,120
I will never say no on principle, you know,

1802
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,680
I will never, my principles will never get so large

1803
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,320
that I will refuse free shit if it's offered.

1804
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,880
Oh my God, as a socialist,

1805
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,040
I want nothing but free shit, am I right?

1806
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,200
My fellow commies?

1807
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:37,160
Yes, but also, I don't know, you should,

1808
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,960
you have to share, you have to share that room

1809
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:46,160
with everyone, with me, with just me, only me.

1810
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,440
I'm the only one who gets socialism.

1811
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,800
You have to share the room with me

1812
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,160
and I love to masturbate.

1813
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:53,880
No.

1814
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,800
That's one of the dust, that's,

1815
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,560
actually, I'm not going to say that, that's gross.

1816
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,320
I masturbate, I masturbate naked, so you just have to.

1817
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,840
No, no one can tell me, don't do that.

1818
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,960
Nobody can come into the door and say, what are you doing?

1819
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,360
No, no.

1820
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,560
It's all like, I'm jerking off in here.

1821
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,920
Hey, I'm jerking off with the door open.

1822
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,440
Hey, I'm jerking off in here.

1823
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,280
What are you talking about?

1824
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,480
Hey, I'm jerking off over here.

1825
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,800
I'm jerking here.

1826
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,160
It's actually, you know, this is America.

1827
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,560
This is the best thing about it.

1828
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,680
This is America and no one can tell you

1829
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,680
that you can't jerk off in your own doorway

1830
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,480
with the door open, facing out

1831
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,640
into the rest of the apartment complex.

1832
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:43,040
Biden didn't say day one, we could jerk off, day one.

1833
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,480
And we better, and we better now,

1834
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,800
before he force feminizes all of us.

1835
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,520
We better get it in while we're still going.

1836
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,560
I'm way ahead of him.

1837
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,640
Hey, we're first jerking off,

1838
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,120
then freeing the kids in cages.

1839
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,760
I think that was step two.

1840
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,600
Can't wait.

1841
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,560
You Europeans are so progressive.

1842
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,160
You're so ahead of the curve.

1843
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:04,440
We're, we're cavemen stuck back in America.

1844
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,280
Yeah.

1845
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,800
Still waiting to be forced feminized by our presence.

1846
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1847
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,120
I don't know, I feel like,

1848
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,960
I feel like in the UK specifically,

1849
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,440
we're behind America when it comes

1850
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,120
to forced feminization policy.

1851
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,600
Yeah, it's kind of.

1852
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,440
It's a race.

1853
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,720
The race is on.

1854
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,360
Yeah, J.K. Rowland saw trans people and be like,

1855
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,480
yeah, I don't like that.

1856
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,800
Then she used her wand.

1857
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,640
No, no, no, no.

1858
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,480
Yeah.

1859
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,800
No, I don't like that.

1860
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,640
She summoned all her, all her, her coven.

1861
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,200
She got to, she saw.

1862
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,240
Dude, I just realized, you know, you know,

1863
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,280
punk, you know, the character I made.

1864
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,120
She's a pumpkin.

1865
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,520
You know that pumpkin meme where he says,

1866
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,040
no, I don't want that.

1867
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,520
I wonder where that, where.

1868
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,360
No, I don't know.

1869
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,320
It's like a pumpkin who says no.

1870
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,160
Okay.

1871
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,600
Wait, what?

1872
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:49,880
It's like a pumpkin who says no.

1873
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:50,920
I just figured that out.

1874
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,760
I don't know what.

1875
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,760
That's where it retroactively inspired.

1876
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,520
Is this a, is this a, is this a British meme?

1877
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,080
No, I don't.

1878
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,920
No.

1879
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,360
Okay.

1880
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,400
Wait, oh yeah.

1881
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,720
Oh, it's just like, it's a game.

1882
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:06,120
It's like a, oh, wait, oh, I know what you're talking about.

1883
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,080
Yeah, I remember, right?

1884
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,760
The hungry pumpkin who said, you say,

1885
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,160
give me the french fries.

1886
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,120
You click on something else.

1887
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,160
He says, no, I don't want that.

1888
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,760
That's punk.

1889
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,600
No.

1890
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,000
Purple sleeves.

1891
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,840
Oh my God.

1892
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,680
No.

1893
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,520
It's punk's dad.

1894
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,640
Is this retroactive lore?

1895
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,640
This is true.

1896
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
This is punk's dad.

1897
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,840
It's kind of base.

1898
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,360
Oh God, he eats the whole mug of coffee.

1899
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,920
Give me the salt.

1900
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,160
Okay.

1901
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,920
He just wants the salt.

1902
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,120
Why just the salt?

1903
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,720
Why is it just a stick of butter?

1904
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:40,960
Like his,

1905
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,920
All right, complete tangent.

1906
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,880
So I just had a brain blast about that.

1907
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,400
Like his angry eyes.

1908
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,840
I don't know.

1909
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,200
I think I've seen this.

1910
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,880
I can't,

1911
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,880
I can't tell if I've ever seen this before or not.

1912
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,720
It's too,

1913
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:59,440
my mind is just too much of a swirling miasma of

1914
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,760
genius thoughts.

1915
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,040
It may have appeared in like a flash

1916
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,960
in some sort of meme compilation.

1917
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,200
Wasn't it on, it looks like one of those like kids

1918
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,720
like flash games you could play at school that didn't.

1919
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,840
It was,

1920
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,640
it was on a site called pumpkin,

1921
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,240
like pumpkin spelled wrong.

1922
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,800
Like pump.kin.

1923
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,280
I can't remember.

1924
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,400
It was like an old site and it was just sort of like

1925
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,280
learning games,

1926
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:31,000
but made by like non native English speakers.

1927
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,120
So it was kind of like broken English

1928
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,160
and didn't really teach English very well.

1929
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,840
And it was funny how bad it was.

1930
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,320
Like those children videos that like are like generated

1931
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,680
by people in India.

1932
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:44,920
Yes.

1933
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:45,760
Something like that.

1934
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,280
That's pretty based, pretty based.

1935
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,680
Pretty fucking based.

1936
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,200
Well, now we know.

1937
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,040
All right.

1938
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,160
Now we know the pumpkin story.

1939
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,600
It's just so weird to me.

1940
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,840
Like I made a pumpkin who says no,

1941
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,960
and I have had seen this before that.

1942
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,680
I just didn't make the connection until right now.

1943
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,680
So consciously you were thinking about it.

1944
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,120
That's just something pumpkins do, right?

1945
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,600
Like they don't like things and reject them.

1946
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,440
Yeah.

1947
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,280
Oh yeah.

1948
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,920
No, it's just a normal pumpkin thing.

1949
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:20,760
Pumpkin.

1950
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,080
It's like a,

1951
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,560
like in Cinderella when they did turns the pumpkin

1952
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,840
into a carriage and the pumpkins like,

1953
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,600
no, I don't want to be a carriage.

1954
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,280
And he doesn't want to be a carriage anymore.

1955
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,120
It turns back into a pumpkin.

1956
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,920
He got forced carification.

1957
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,440
Oh my God.

1958
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,480
It's just like,

1959
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,000
you know, we all understand that like,

1960
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,800
you know, foxes are clever.

1961
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,760
Pumpkins, very picky, very cheesy.

1962
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,200
They do like to deny things.

1963
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,040
Yeah.

1964
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,080
It's time to learn.

1965
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,280
I'm going to go to wikipedia.pumpkin.

1966
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,240
Christ.

1967
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,320
No.

1968
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,760
I'm going to learn something about pumpkins.

1969
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,160
See if they actually are picky.

1970
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,000
Yeah.

1971
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,400
Let's find out.

1972
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,240
Not going to lie.

1973
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:59,600
I was a big fan of the Gibbon monkey talk

1974
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,640
in the last episode.

1975
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:03,040
I thought that was really good.

1976
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,840
I learned things about baboons,

1977
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,760
that episode that I can never unlearn.

1978
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,600
And I-

1979
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,040
You mean orangutans.

1980
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,680
Yes, yes, orangutans.

1981
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:12,520
Whoops.

1982
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,240
Is your flange still there?

1983
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,400
My flange is,

1984
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,240
I have been,

1985
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,320
every time I see another male,

1986
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,520
now I have been challenging him on the strut

1987
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,680
and just beating the shit out of him.

1988
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,320
And every time my flange grows bigger and bigger.

1989
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,160
Yeah.

1990
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,320
You challenged that one homeless guy on the bus.

1991
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,000
That's why his mask was all bloody.

1992
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,760
That's why his mask was bloody.

1993
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,600
Yeah.

1994
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,120
That's courtesy of Ben Flange-Saint.

1995
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,680
His flange deflated as mine swelled

1996
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,760
to ever greater, ever greater size.

1997
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,600
And resplendence.

1998
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,360
Every male you defeat, your flange gets bigger and bigger

1999
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:47,000
until you're just fucking massive.

2000
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,160
I think that's how it works.

2001
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,760
I'm still a little bit iffy on how does an orangutan's body

2002
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,240
know that it has defeated the alpha orangutan

2003
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:00,560
and must begin to grow, do you emit flange hormones?

2004
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,400
Do the-

2005
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,160
And yet it happens.

2006
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,600
Do the orangutans?

2007
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,960
Apparently.

2008
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:06,800
Yes, gone.

2009
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,240
No, you could finish your orangutans.

2010
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:11,640
I was just gonna say, do orangutans rip off each other's flange

2011
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,280
and that's just like...

2012
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,680
And stick it on their own?

2013
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,640
And stick it on their own face and sew it in with gorilla glue?

2014
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:23,400
They eat it and they absorb the flange nutrients

2015
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,800
and they just get bigger.

2016
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:29,520
It's got that special flange tissue.

2017
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,200
There's only so much to go around,

2018
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,240
so they have to eat it off of each other and repurpose it.

2019
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2020
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:38,000
It's just like eating penis makes your penis bigger.

2021
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,200
Exactly.

2022
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,640
There's only so much.

2023
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,680
Straight there.

2024
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:50,720
Apparently pumpkins I learn now are easy and fun to grow.

2025
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:56,120
They are not picky when it comes to habitat for growing.

2026
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,160
So it actually doesn't happen in the real world.

2027
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:04,960
Pumpkins are actually quite amicable to situations.

2028
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,480
I can't believe the media would smear pumpkins.

2029
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,720
I can't believe the media would smear pumpkins

2030
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,400
saying they're not as crazy.

2031
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,320
Well, this is like how the one famous drow

2032
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:19,000
that everyone writes books about is the only good one.

2033
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,800
The drow are all villains,

2034
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,600
but Drizda Ordon is the good guy who goes against the grain.

2035
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:29,160
These are lone individuals who stand up

2036
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,800
against the tyranny of their culture.

2037
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,400
They were just sick of how chill and fun and cool

2038
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,600
all their pumpkin relatives were,

2039
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,440
and they were like, no, not me.

2040
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,240
I'll take the road less traveled, thanks.

2041
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:46,840
I will inherit the role of the asshole pumpkin.

2042
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,000
There has to be one.

2043
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,120
Yeah, pumpkins, like the bottoms of pumpkins

2044
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,920
look kind of like assholes, but I think it makes sense.

2045
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:00,440
If you cut a hole in it, you can fuck it like an asshole too.

2046
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:01,280
Yeah.

2047
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,800
Did you know?

2048
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,000
Guys, don't give me any ideas.

2049
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,440
I might draw that.

2050
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,520
I might draw it, then I'll become an SFW artist.

2051
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,360
You guys better not.

2052
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,040
You could do it if you wanted to.

2053
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,880
I could do it.

2054
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,000
Can I commit?

2055
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,120
I'll hold that sort of Damocles over my own head

2056
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,360
in a bid to get people interested in my brain.

2057
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,440
I'll hold that sort of Damocles over the pumpkin

2058
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,240
and think, should I cut a hole in it?

2059
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,800
Should I lower the sword and cut the hole?

2060
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,080
I'm on a commission you gave to draw your Sona,

2061
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,680
fucking a pumpkin.

2062
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,000
Nothing weird about that.

2063
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Which Sona?

2064
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:39,840
I don't know.

2065
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,000
There's so many.

2066
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,280
Just pick one, pick one, pick one.

2067
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,000
Draw me a pumpkin wrapped up in a spiderweb, please.

2068
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,160
Uh-oh.

2069
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,680
Uh-oh.

2070
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,680
Uh-oh, stinky.

2071
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,360
It all, it all circles back around.

2072
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,640
Time to wrap up this section game.

2073
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,360
I was gonna say, are we at voicemail time about?

2074
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,560
Yeah, it seems like.

2075
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,600
It's like, I guess we are.

2076
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,440
I don't know.

2077
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,520
I didn't have much else to talk about, I don't think.

2078
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,120
I guess I'm not really there.

2079
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,080
I guess I'm not really there.

2080
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:21,080
So let's, I made a, I guess I'm making clown adoptables.

2081
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,560
Are you really?

2082
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,640
Yeah, I am.

2083
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,080
This is like the fourth time I'd done it.

2084
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,440
Oh wait, I saw,

2085
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:33,680
I saw you made some monster on Instagram.

2086
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,160
Yeah, yeah, I made like a,

2087
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,760
made a little post about it.

2088
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,160
And adoptables are,

2089
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,280
adoptables are very interesting now,

2090
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,200
cause the whole talk with like NFT,

2091
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,560
like people are like,

2092
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:49,320
oh, you could finally own digital art, finally.

2093
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:52,400
And it's like, well, adoptable has been around for like years.

2094
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,240
Yeah.

2095
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,880
You could already own like.

2096
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,440
It's so, I mean, it's so stupid.

2097
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,000
It's almost as if the NFT doesn't mean

2098
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,320
or do anything.

2099
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,360
There's no contract.

2100
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,480
So there's no legal liability for anything.

2101
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,960
You just say you'll,

2102
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,680
you could just sell the adoptables

2103
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,000
and then continue to draw the thing

2104
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,320
and nobody can stop you.

2105
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,000
No.

2106
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,840
Same with NFTs.

2107
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,000
You can just say, hey, you own it

2108
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,440
and then you can just delete it

2109
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,920
and then you just do it again.

2110
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,640
Then they don't have that specific thing.

2111
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:21,480
With the adoptable,

2112
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,040
they like literally give the person the JPEG.

2113
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,000
So they like, like, I mean,

2114
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,120
it's the JPEG and it's the understanding

2115
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,120
between you and them that this is yours.

2116
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,640
No, I don't understand anyone.

2117
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,600
I'm not an understanding person.

2118
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,560
I'm kind of like the goblin who blew up in a way.

2119
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,920
Well, I'm just the whole goblin getting into shenanigans.

2120
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:41,760
Yeah, you should have.

2121
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:42,840
Thanks to my own hubris.

2122
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,840
I sold too many adoptables.

2123
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:45,680
That's what I should try.

2124
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,480
I should try a comic about a little goblin

2125
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,680
who gets into shenanigans selling adoptables.

2126
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,320
Then he gets blown up at the end.

2127
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,240
Oh, wait, the goblin accidentally creates

2128
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,400
like an offensive adoptable

2129
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,360
and his name is credited as a creator

2130
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:02,760
and he gets attacked by Antifa or something.

2131
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,640
Maybe he makes adoptables and he puts them

2132
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:09,720
and he ties them to NFTs and then twist.

2133
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:13,360
What blows up is actually the price of the cryptocurrency

2134
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,360
and his NFTs are with a fortune

2135
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,240
and he becomes rich beyond his wildest dreams

2136
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,560
thanks to his own hubris.

2137
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,320
And he buys a bazooka and he doesn't know how to use it.

2138
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,160
And then he gets blown up.

2139
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,280
Yes, yes, obviously.

2140
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,600
And then he gets blown up.

2141
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,600
He gets rounded up with all the billionaires

2142
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,720
and then gunned down by Antifa at the end.

2143
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,800
Yeah, that's a good ending.

2144
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,520
Oh, good ending.

2145
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,360
I hope that's how cycloneo ends.

2146
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,080
But with adoptables is kind of like an honor system.

2147
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,160
You gotta like, the previous ones I'd be like,

2148
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,160
okay, so this is like, you own this character

2149
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,480
but every time you use it for anything

2150
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,760
you have to credit me as like designer.

2151
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:54,920
And that's about it.

2152
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,440
But I think I'm gonna actually create some sort of physical,

2153
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,040
not a physical form, but like a digital form

2154
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,880
that people can just like put their signature on.

2155
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,120
Like you own this character

2156
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,360
and you can do whatever you want this character.

2157
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,520
You just always gotta credit me as designer, right?

2158
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,920
But also I wanna add like,

2159
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,400
oh, you can't sell this character as an NFT.

2160
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:17,760
Yeah.

2161
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,360
And I think a bunch of just-

2162
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,680
I would hate that if somebody did that.

2163
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,120
Yeah, and I think artists should just,

2164
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,720
now at this point just any artist

2165
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:25,640
if you do any commission,

2166
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,800
if you don't want your artwork to ever be NFT,

2167
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,360
you should like clarify that,

2168
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,160
specifically in your fucking commission

2169
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:34,560
so like it can't be fucking used.

2170
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,720
I don't think I have like,

2171
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,240
I don't think I have like,

2172
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,760
I mean, I've done a few commissions for some people

2173
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,240
but very little of my art,

2174
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,440
it was like I sold it to someone

2175
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,440
or I made it for someone for money.

2176
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,280
Like I think I own almost everything, which so,

2177
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,640
so that in theory means I don't have to worry

2178
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,840
about it getting NFT, right?

2179
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,760
Yeah, as long as you know, post the images online

2180
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,280
and then some, it's like ha, I yonk

2181
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,960
and then sells it, right?

2182
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,120
Yeah, but I mean-

2183
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:05,960
That's like anyone could probably do it.

2184
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,840
You could do it with any JPEG, right?

2185
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:08,840
Right, right.

2186
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,800
I guess if I'm thinking of like,

2187
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,240
if I'm thinking of like actual legal consequences,

2188
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,360
cause that's where my mind goes

2189
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,480
when it comes to adoptables.

2190
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,560
It's like, the honor system, I have no honor

2191
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,600
and I don't want any.

2192
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,680
I will never honor these things.

2193
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:29,320
But like, I suppose if somebody like, say for example,

2194
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,600
somebody just draws like Magda or whatever,

2195
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:37,400
just pretends that it's not Magda and sells things.

2196
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,320
Like you, I don't think you've like,

2197
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,280
like legally gone through like copyright process

2198
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,120
for your stuff.

2199
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,320
You don't have to like file copyright.

2200
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,360
You don't need to do that.

2201
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,360
Yeah, it's good.

2202
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,200
It's like, you did it and if it came to court,

2203
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,320
you could say, I did it.

2204
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,160
Here's the proof.

2205
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,200
It came out before.

2206
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,040
And then they would be like,

2207
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,480
oh, I guess you have a case.

2208
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:01,040
But if you had sold something as an adoptable,

2209
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,000
I wonder what would happen if that did go to court.

2210
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,040
You changed your mind.

2211
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,160
You wanted to use that character again.

2212
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,720
And their case was you sold it to me as an adoptable.

2213
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,960
I mean, there's no precedent for that.

2214
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,160
I've heard people, I have not seen this,

2215
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,720
but I heard people say specifically in the furry community,

2216
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:20,560
there is like a resale market for adoptables.

2217
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,600
I mean, literally, I guess nothing's really stopping me

2218
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,920
from going to someone who I sold an adoptable fund.

2219
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,520
It's like, hey, I changed my mind.

2220
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,480
Can I buy this character back off of you?

2221
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,820
Right?

2222
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:31,640
I don't know as in like selling it back

2223
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,120
to the original creator.

2224
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,160
Yeah, yeah.

2225
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:39,160
But I was thinking was that like in my special contract

2226
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,000
that I'm gonna write out,

2227
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,720
I'm gonna have like a clause in there where it's like,

2228
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,480
so I don't own the character I sell to you, right?

2229
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:52,480
I don't own it, but I am allowed to like use

2230
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,160
like similar aspects of that design

2231
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,280
for my own personal or commercial products, right?

2232
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,960
Or my own pieces, right?

2233
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:04,480
Cause sometimes like, I mean, I don't,

2234
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,640
sometimes like recently when I was designing

2235
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:10,080
a one specific like clown character,

2236
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,920
I liked the design so much, I decided,

2237
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,960
you know what, I'm not gonna sell this design.

2238
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,120
I'm just gonna keep that design, right?

2239
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:18,880
But there's like other characters that I've drawn

2240
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,920
where it's like, I like this aspect of their design.

2241
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,520
I would like, I could see myself reusing

2242
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:28,160
this specific aspect and like with another character,

2243
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,920
not that character, but just a piece of that character, right?

2244
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,520
But I just kind of want to get that like,

2245
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:36,040
I guess like internet legally bounded, right?

2246
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,040
It gets like, yeah.

2247
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,760
I mean, I guess at some point you hit a sort of gray area

2248
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,120
where it's like, okay, well, how many elements

2249
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:46,960
can a two characters share before they're

2250
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,640
the same character, basically?

2251
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,880
That means these, I guess it would,

2252
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,280
that's gonna depend a whole lot on the details.

2253
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,440
I, yeah, like, I think I've probably,

2254
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,040
I don't know if I mentioned this before in the podcast,

2255
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,880
but I've already told you guys about this comic

2256
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,440
called the Capra.

2257
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,800
Capra, I don't think so.

2258
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:14,120
Yeah, Capra, a Capra, right?

2259
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:18,800
So in that comic, it's like, if you read it,

2260
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:23,800
it's unironically like a Suicide Squad fan fiction.

2261
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,280
It's just that they got all the characters

2262
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,840
and they made them like legally distinct, right?

2263
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,000
But the thing is that like-

2264
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,480
They, 50 Shades of Graded.

2265
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,400
Right, exactly.

2266
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,840
But it's so, but the thing is that like,

2267
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:43,320
they didn't really like change the designs that much.

2268
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,720
Like, all right, like this character,

2269
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:51,720
this character right here with like the white mask

2270
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,200
and like the gun wrist.

2271
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,440
Like this character is from,

2272
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,080
he's supposed to be based on,

2273
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:04,960
he's based on this character from the Suicide Squad, right?

2274
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,000
Yeah, dead shot, yeah.

2275
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,240
And just look how similar they fucking look, right?

2276
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,920
Like they don't even look too different.

2277
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,760
Like someone in passing-

2278
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,760
It looks like someone just erased details from the-

2279
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:17,600
Right, exactly.

2280
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,920
From the original.

2281
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:22,160
Yeah, someone in passing could just like see like,

2282
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:25,040
and also the characters have very similar names.

2283
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:30,040
Like the character of Dead Shot, his name is like Floyd

2284
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,800
and the character in Capra, his name is like Lloyd, right?

2285
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,040
Yeah, Natch, naturally.

2286
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,160
Yeah, it's not even like too, like fucking different.

2287
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,200
Like yeah, if you walk by,

2288
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,480
if you know anything about Suicide Squad

2289
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,640
and you walk by this cover,

2290
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:46,920
you might think it's like a Suicide Squad book, right?

2291
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,680
But it's like legally allowed,

2292
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,760
like you're allowed to just like do this.

2293
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:54,760
Yeah.

2294
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:57,120
Yeah, and I guess what also helps is that like the book is,

2295
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:58,480
the comic's actually fucking good.

2296
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,560
Like it's not a bad comic.

2297
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,600
I see.

2298
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:02,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2299
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:04,480
So that means that-

2300
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,360
That's what's weird about,

2301
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,960
that's what's weird about Adoptables to me is like,

2302
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,600
what's the, if you see a character that you like,

2303
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,200
what's to stop you from not buying it

2304
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:16,600
but just making a character that has very similar elements?

2305
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,960
I think I'm, I think the vibe that I'm,

2306
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:20,800
the most people who-

2307
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,640
Doing this essentially.

2308
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,480
I think I'm-

2309
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,600
Toppering it.

2310
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,680
Yeah, yeah.

2311
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:30,160
I don't know, like I don't see that, like I don't,

2312
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:32,920
I mean, I've only recently started doing Adoptables.

2313
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:33,840
Yeah.

2314
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,200
I don't know if maybe like the process of just doing that

2315
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,200
is like an extra amount of energy

2316
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:42,960
that not that many people have or like care too much.

2317
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,520
Maybe like, yeah, I can see that happening,

2318
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,040
but as of yet no one has given that much of a shit

2319
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,840
to like try, right?

2320
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,600
I think to me it's just sort of like,

2321
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,280
if you have a good design,

2322
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,360
like you said with the specific clown one,

2323
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,960
like it's so good you want to keep it,

2324
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,440
you don't want to sell it.

2325
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,120
So people who are selling Adoptables

2326
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:03,280
aren't selling their best work,

2327
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,200
they're selling things that they don't really care about

2328
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,600
as much and they can, you know, people can have-

2329
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,240
I mean, they might sell something that's like,

2330
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:13,240
just appeals to someone else more than it appeals to them.

2331
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

2332
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,240
But like if I'm like going out,

2333
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,280
like if I'm on the hunt for a character

2334
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:23,040
or if I see a character design in use

2335
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,920
and I'm like, oh, I want that,

2336
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,120
that's not up for adoption

2337
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,800
because they've been used already in something.

2338
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,600
Yeah, yeah.

2339
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,360
Usually an Adoptable is just like a character sheet

2340
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:33,480
and I don't feel anything

2341
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,880
when I look at a character sheet usually.

2342
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,640
You want to, yeah, yeah.

2343
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:41,920
I noticed the two kinds of people who like buy Adoptables

2344
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,920
are people who can't really draw that well.

2345
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:46,760
So they had like a,

2346
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,080
so let's say they buy an Adoptable,

2347
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,840
it's like, oh, cool, finally, I have an OC.

2348
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:52,280
So I'm going to show this to other people

2349
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:55,200
to commission them to draw this character, right?

2350
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:56,160
Yeah.

2351
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,080
That makes sense.

2352
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,960
I've heard people say stuff like they don't,

2353
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,520
like some people want to do fan art

2354
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,840
of other people's Adoptables,

2355
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:06,240
which I think it's fine.

2356
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,520
Like that's nothing weird about doing fan art

2357
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:09,360
for someone's OC.

2358
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,040
Yeah, I would say fan art is fine.

2359
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,520
Yeah, as long as they're not like selling it

2360
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,160
or passing it off as an original.

2361
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,160
I think also the thing is that like,

2362
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:18,560
everyone in here is like an artist.

2363
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,000
So if we don't really need to buy a character,

2364
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,520
we just design one, right?

2365
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:25,920
Yeah, I don't really necessarily dislike

2366
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,880
the practice, I just think it's so pointless

2367
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,160
and I would never use it in any way.

2368
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:36,160
I can, no, if, I mean, I guess I can't really imagine,

2369
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,360
I mean, Furries have a whole thing

2370
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,760
where they have like a Sona

2371
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:45,960
and like I can't really imagine like having a Sona

2372
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:48,400
that like is me that I, maybe if I did,

2373
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:52,920
I would be like, yeah, please like draw this Sona of mine

2374
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,840
doing all these things I want to see.

2375
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,560
Maybe that would make it easier to understand.

2376
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,440
Actually, I've got like two or three artists

2377
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,400
who have like bought Adoptables,

2378
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,880
like for example, this Adoptable that I sell,

2379
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,800
Panpeekse bought this one from me.

2380
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,480
And, oh, really?

2381
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,840
Yeah, yeah, and I guess like, oh.

2382
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,320
Yeah, yeah, like, yeah, I've got it like friends buying.

2383
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,240
It's kind of cool, actually.

2384
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,040
I like what I've noticed is that,

2385
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,440
what does Panpeekse want to do with it?

2386
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,560
I mean, I've gotten like two friends

2387
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,360
who have bought like two Adoptables off of me

2388
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,600
and what they usually do is they grab it

2389
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:31,800
as like kind of like a base

2390
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:35,360
and then they like kind of redesigned a little bit, right?

2391
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,600
Of course that opens the question as like,

2392
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,720
well, what if like, let's say they just kind of just looked

2393
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,680
at it and then they just designed their own.

2394
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,040
Yeah, what if they just did that without buying it?

2395
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,000
Without buying it.

2396
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,360
Like, I, hmm, I guess you don't.

2397
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,960
I mean, it does ultimately come down

2398
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,360
to like people willing to spend money

2399
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,320
and you just have to hope that they are.

2400
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,040
Do you technically lose?

2401
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,040
Do you technically lose?

2402
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,480
Cause it's kind of like, I don't know, like I,

2403
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:03,560
it's kind of like pirating a movie, I guess.

2404
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,640
I guess, I'm sure a lot of it does come down

2405
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,000
to just like people want to support an artist

2406
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,680
or like just people just don't want to be thieves.

2407
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:15,560
They want to like appreciate something that they like

2408
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,440
and support it.

2409
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,400
I'm sure that's a big part of it.

2410
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,120
I think the.

2411
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:20,960
I would be,

2412
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:25,280
or the, or they just don't want to like get into trouble.

2413
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,600
They don't want someone like it best, best just to not

2414
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,120
even fuck with like any chance of someone accusing me

2415
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:31,400
of being an art thief.

2416
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:34,560
I mean, if, if the person you the thing,

2417
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,360
if the person you like stole, like quote unquote,

2418
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,560
stolen and adoptable from is popular,

2419
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,680
you'll probably be put on blast.

2420
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:42,920
You're right. Yeah.

2421
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,400
I think what I think people don't really care too much

2422
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:49,720
if designs are similar, but they, but they,

2423
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,480
I think people don't like tracing more.

2424
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,640
I think tracing is like what people don't like more.

2425
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,640
Yeah. Yeah.

2426
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:01,080
Hypothetically, what if somebody like came up with

2427
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:03,960
as many character designs as humanly possible,

2428
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:07,400
put them all up for adoptable, you know, you could buy them.

2429
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,120
And it's like so many character designs

2430
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:14,760
that basically every character design ever is like.

2431
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,080
That sounds plausible.

2432
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,280
You couldn't, you couldn't no longer design

2433
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:21,360
your own character without somehow plagiarizing

2434
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,360
these adoptables.

2435
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:24,320
And then you know what, you should, you should,

2436
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,320
you should try. Excuse me.

2437
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,760
You should try to do that.

2438
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:28,800
You should try to do that.

2439
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,960
You should try to design literally every character

2440
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,440
that could ever exist.

2441
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,200
Yeah, actually, that's a pretty good racket.

2442
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:36,400
I could spring up.

2443
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,560
First you start with a stick figure

2444
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,680
and then you draw a stick figure with a face.

2445
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,480
Then you draw a stick figure with hair

2446
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,080
and then you start to stick figure with clothes

2447
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,400
and you just keep going down the line

2448
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,600
until you get everything down.

2449
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,120
Yeah. And then I say,

2450
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,680
different face, different face, different combinations.

2451
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,000
Excuse me, you have drawn,

2452
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,880
you've drawn a character with two hands

2453
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,560
and glasses and a hair and I did that.

2454
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,400
So please pay up.

2455
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:03,520
I call Marv one say, excuse me, sir,

2456
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:07,120
I think you ripped off my design for Iron Man.

2457
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:09,400
I came up with a robo red and gold guy.

2458
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:14,080
I guess also like, there's like weird specific

2459
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:14,920
kind of like rules.

2460
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,880
Like you ever seen the thing where like,

2461
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:19,560
like a show would have the same name

2462
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,760
as like an album or a song,

2463
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,880
but it's okay since there's both two different pieces

2464
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:26,680
of like properties that like it's fine.

2465
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,480
Oh, you mean, you mean like the Vapors

2466
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,840
which shares the name with an 80s band?

2467
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,120
Yes. Oh, I didn't know that.

2468
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:34,960
Yeah, yeah.

2469
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,120
Or how Bongo Luna shares the name with like a DJ.

2470
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,600
Does it?

2471
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:41,440
Oh, I think so.

2472
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:42,840
I found like a guy.

2473
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,200
Like Bongo and Luna?

2474
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:47,080
No, I think I can find a guy called Bongo.

2475
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,200
No, I found a guy called Luna

2476
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,600
and I think he made a remix that has the word Bongo in it.

2477
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,320
I see.

2478
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:54,160
It's like the most.

2479
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:55,000
Yeah.

2480
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,800
I mean, it's kind of like, I mean, the thing is like,

2481
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,720
if there's something I've like learned,

2482
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:06,200
this might be like kind of like cynical or unironically,

2483
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,320
I'm just built different.

2484
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:08,920
It's like, I don't know.

2485
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:13,000
Like I noticed some shit takes effort

2486
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,240
and sometimes if it's even the little bit of effort

2487
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:17,120
people just won't do it.

2488
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,960
Right?

2489
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:18,800
Yeah.

2490
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,720
So I'm just not too fucking like worried.

2491
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:21,560
Right?

2492
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,400
Sure.

2493
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,240
Yeah, I get you.

2494
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:24,080
And I guess the thing is like,

2495
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,840
I kind of have so much faith in my like,

2496
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:29,440
I guess skill in designing characters

2497
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,320
that like I'm not fucking too worried

2498
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,920
about selling off a couple of designs.

2499
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:34,760
Right?

2500
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:35,600
Sure.

2501
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,040
I mean, that's why like, I mean, yeah.

2502
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:40,920
But if I want to reuse like aspects like of a character,

2503
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:44,160
like why not can I have another character

2504
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,880
that also has like a broken heart on an axe, right?

2505
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,920
But it has like something else different about them, you know?

2506
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:50,760
Mm-hmm.

2507
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:51,600
Right?

2508
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,320
Like it makes perfect sense.

2509
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:55,640
Yeah, I could like still do that again, you know?

2510
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:57,680
Yeah.

2511
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:58,720
I got you.

2512
01:47:58,720 --> 01:47:59,560
Right.

2513
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,400
I got you.

2514
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,400
Hey, do you want to start voicemails?

2515
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,880
We're gonna start voicemails.

2516
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,720
Let's start them.

2517
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,560
Let's start it.

2518
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:06,760
Bass.

2519
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:07,880
Bass.

2520
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:11,760
So first one is called, wait, I'll put it in the chat.

2521
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:12,600
There it is.

2522
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:14,960
First one is called, wait, it's loading.

2523
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:15,800
Okay.

2524
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:19,480
More like take a shit on my desk yearly.

2525
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:22,200
Three, two, one, go.

2526
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:25,160
Give shit on my desk yearly five just came out.

2527
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:27,920
And every time that it shows up, I'm like,

2528
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,400
oh yes, this existed.

2529
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:30,320
I totally forgot.

2530
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,840
And it's a wonderful, fun little time.

2531
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:37,840
And as such, I decided to rewatch all of it

2532
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:41,040
from the beginning and shit on my desk yearly one.

2533
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:45,280
One smug left a comment saying,

2534
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,880
in three years after the procrastinators have all died

2535
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,640
in the suicide pact of 2020,

2536
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:51,600
I will make sure to keep watching these videos

2537
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,640
and keep your legacy alive.

2538
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:56,640
And I have to say, where,

2539
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:59,840
where was the suicide pact of 2020?

2540
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:00,680
Come on.

2541
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:04,120
I would, that would have been so cool.

2542
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,840
Swimming bass, swimming bass.

2543
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,720
We fucked it up.

2544
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,080
I forgot about shit on my desk yearly.

2545
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:12,800
We did a suicide pact with the entire world in 2020.

2546
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,400
Bass, bass.

2547
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:16,720
Yeah, nine years,

2548
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:19,320
we're all gonna do the biggest suicide pack

2549
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,840
on a global scale.

2550
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,880
It's gonna be pretty rad.

2551
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:25,600
Except it's suicide, it's homicide,

2552
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:26,920
and I'll be left alone.

2553
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,600
Can you remind me,

2554
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,320
can you remind me about the premise of shit

2555
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,720
on my desk yearly?

2556
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:36,080
Yeah, so it started like five years ago now.

2557
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,440
I think it's episode five.

2558
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:40,920
Yeah, so four or five years ago,

2559
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:44,000
I think it was around the time when I was like,

2560
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:46,120
actually, I don't know.

2561
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:50,280
I think it was just sort of like episodic videos about stuff.

2562
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:55,280
I think Digi, Trixie was doing things of that nature

2563
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,800
and I was, I think it was like a joke that was like,

2564
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:02,640
what if I did a scheduled release video

2565
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:03,960
that was like a year?

2566
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:05,640
And I checked and you could do that.

2567
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:08,960
And I wanted to see how many years it could be in the future,

2568
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:11,200
that you could schedule something to appear on YouTube.

2569
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:14,840
So I filmed a bunch of like completely pointless crap,

2570
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,320
like me just talking about the shit

2571
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,600
that was on my desk at the time.

2572
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:19,640
Okay.

2573
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:24,040
And it's like banal and as tedious and pointless as possible.

2574
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,720
But the fact that it came out like once a year,

2575
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:29,880
for who knows how many years, it was the joke.

2576
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:31,800
Is it still coming out?

2577
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,400
Yeah, number five just came out.

2578
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:36,280
Oh yeah, we give and take channel.

2579
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,440
Oh my God.

2580
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:39,080
Do they come out automatically?

2581
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,200
Yeah, I scheduled them all at once

2582
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,600
and they are still like, they're like, yeah, you can,

2583
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,400
you just, I feel like you could go to like 2040

2584
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,320
and schedule something and it will appear

2585
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:51,920
if YouTube still exists.

2586
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,760
Damn.

2587
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,600
That's interesting.

2588
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,640
How many do you have lined up

2589
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:58,440
or do you want to spoil it?

2590
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:01,840
Kaiju comments and says, oh my God, it's still going on.

2591
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:05,960
Yeah, it's funny because it's like everyone's like,

2592
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:08,920
oh no, I'm old, I'm a whole year older.

2593
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:13,000
Because it's such an uneventful video series,

2594
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,960
but which means it catches people by surprise

2595
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:17,480
every time it happens.

2596
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:18,960
You're watching Best of the Worst,

2597
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:21,680
Biohazards, Slaughter High and Kill Point.

2598
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,800
Oh, that's a good one.

2599
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:24,840
I made sure to.

2600
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,400
Maybe I'll go watch that.

2601
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,880
Yeah, that was what was out at the time

2602
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,040
and it was on trending.

2603
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:32,760
So it was like, oh, that was proof,

2604
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:36,000
proof that it was actually filmed in the past.

2605
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Notably, this video has no dislikes and 145 likes,

2606
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:46,720
which is very, very unusual that not a single dislike,

2607
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:50,240
but congratulations on that.

2608
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:51,080
It did again.

2609
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,480
Yeah.

2610
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,200
I made the best YouTube series in the world.

2611
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,120
It's true, it's true.

2612
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:02,280
Um, next voicemail is called,

2613
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:05,880
sorry, let me find my shit here.

2614
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:09,320
Next voicemail is called Put Put Prince.

2615
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:10,760
Let me put it in the chat.

2616
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:13,800
There it is, three, two, one, go.

2617
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:14,720
You're right guys.

2618
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:18,440
So since Radcon, I've wanted to come up with like,

2619
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:21,720
a voicemail to leave something funny or something artistic,

2620
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:25,400
but it's been a year and I've come up with nothing so far.

2621
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:29,320
So I'm going to self-prove myself where I leave a voicemail

2622
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:32,840
every week until I come up with something decent

2623
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:35,440
or something, something all right.

2624
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,160
So that's it, that's my plan.

2625
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,880
Every week, one voicemail.

2626
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:41,480
And if Tom is here, how does he feel about streaming?

2627
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:45,160
You know, his creative, you know, his projects and stuff.

2628
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:48,640
If Gibby's here, you know, I'd like his closer streams

2629
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,960
and if Ben is here, you can fuck off.

2630
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,800
Damn.

2631
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,400
I predicted that, I predicted that joke.

2632
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:03,160
Did they say that they liked the Clarissa streams

2633
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:05,120
or did they ask a question I didn't hear?

2634
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:08,000
I think he said he liked the Clarissa streams.

2635
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,160
That's what I heard.

2636
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:11,880
Tom's not here.

2637
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,600
Okay, so the plan is I don't have anything good

2638
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,840
to make a voicemail about,

2639
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:19,200
but I'll just keep making one until I make a good one.

2640
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:21,120
All right, we'll get good luck.

2641
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:22,760
It's a good plan.

2642
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:24,480
You start by doing something.

2643
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,640
And then you make a terrible voicemails

2644
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:28,760
and then eventually you don't.

2645
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:29,600
That's the first time.

2646
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,320
I mean, one of them's gotta eventually be good, right?

2647
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,440
It's the law of averages.

2648
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:38,160
Right, one of them guys is eventually the top 10, you know.

2649
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:41,400
You gotta make, you know, you gotta spend 10,000 hours

2650
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:43,640
mastering the art of making voicemails.

2651
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:47,120
So you gotta work through all the first 10,000.

2652
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:50,160
I just hope that I'm a guest on

2653
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:54,040
when we get to the good one, that'll be very eventful.

2654
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:55,440
Years from now.

2655
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:56,800
I'm gonna try to guess it.

2656
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:01,680
The next voicemail is called Rub and Tug.

2657
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:04,080
Three, two, one, go.

2658
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:08,360
So if you wanna have sex,

2659
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,260
I know you've never had sex before.

2660
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,200
I've found this great website.

2661
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:16,880
It's called rubmaps.ch.

2662
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:22,800
And it's this place you can find like prostitution brothels.

2663
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:27,440
And you walk right in and you say the code word or whatever

2664
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:30,000
and then they'll sucky sucky for five bucky.

2665
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,320
And it's pretty legit.

2666
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:35,320
I just found out about this a few days ago

2667
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,560
and planning my next visit.

2668
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:39,120
Fuck yeah.

2669
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:42,400
Wait, what was the website called again?

2670
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:46,520
Rubmaps.ch.

2671
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,240
Rubmaps.

2672
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,880
Where fantasy meets reality.

2673
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,320
Oh my God.

2674
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,720
Massage parlor review, erotic massage.

2675
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,480
I am over 18, yes.

2676
01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:01,640
That's America, so not for me, I guess, lol.

2677
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:03,680
Latest reviews around me.

2678
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:07,560
Oh, Jenny over in Worcester.

2679
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,480
Only $60.

2680
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:12,240
Jackie is $40, herm.

2681
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:15,720
That's a D, is that cheaper than,

2682
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:19,840
is that cheaper than, oh, what is it, waifu?

2683
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:21,120
Something waifu?

2684
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:25,560
40, I guess $40 for the massage right now.

2685
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:28,880
$7 a month, seven times 12.

2686
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,520
That's like, I don't know, wait, wait,

2687
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,160
I can do this, I can do this, it's like.

2688
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:36,920
How many handjobs could a month for a stripper waifu?

2689
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:40,640
That's like $85, that's like $85 a month.

2690
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:43,120
40, like, it'd probably be cheaper

2691
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:46,680
to just join a stripper waifu's only fans

2692
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,880
than to go to one of these massage parlors.

2693
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:54,880
But that's not the personalized experience, though.

2694
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,960
Okay, you know what, maybe like, I don't know,

2695
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:03,960
stripper waifu, maybe do one month of stripper waifu

2696
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:07,000
just to feel it out to see what's the flow

2697
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,400
of content being uploaded and give or take

2698
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,960
if you don't like that, save your money next month

2699
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:16,200
and go to see Jackie.

2700
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:18,040
This one is.

2701
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,360
For $40.

2702
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:25,080
Some of these people, oh, this lady's name is Yo-Yo.

2703
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:28,480
I like that, for some reason.

2704
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,480
Does she spin around really fast?

2705
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:35,240
Why is this review near me in Lafayette, Louisiana?

2706
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,040
This is fucked up.

2707
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:39,920
Oh, wait, no, I was looking at newest reviews in the US.

2708
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:44,680
Okay, that's, latest reviews, let me find one,

2709
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:47,320
let me find a good review here.

2710
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,080
Okay.

2711
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:52,120
It says you can't read a review, it's a premium,

2712
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,640
it's fucking kidding me.

2713
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:54,960
Click your little instant access to the review,

2714
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,120
go premium, it's fucking lame.

2715
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:58,400
Are you fucking kidding me, I can't read a fucking review.

2716
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,240
That's lame.

2717
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,040
Jesus, that sucks.

2718
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,880
That was gonna be great content.

2719
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:06,560
Yeah, that's lame.

2720
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:11,440
Damn, if anyone can get me a subscription

2721
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:16,440
to rubmaps.ch, strictly for content creation purposes,

2722
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:19,560
obviously, send me a DM.

2723
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:22,640
Oh my God, wait, oh my God, this place is way closer

2724
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:24,520
than I thought, it's like only two blocks away

2725
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,160
from my pad, holy shit.

2726
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:27,000
Oh my God.

2727
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:33,160
They say the devil, they say the devil is tempting.

2728
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:34,840
He's a tempting person, right?

2729
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,800
I didn't think he was gonna be this tempting.

2730
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,120
He's in the details.

2731
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:43,760
I didn't think he was gonna be this tempting.

2732
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:46,960
Oh, you're terrible.

2733
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:49,680
As tempting as sex, could it be?

2734
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,280
I don't think anything could be as,

2735
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:54,120
wait a minute, a hand job, though.

2736
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:57,080
My harm, my harm, my hand job.

2737
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:02,140
Next voicemail is called,

2738
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:09,040
Gidus to it, Gidus to it,

2739
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:11,280
three, two, one, go.

2740
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:17,520
First off, we have a pretty cool, pretty small,

2741
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:20,280
pretty chill, a cycloneal server,

2742
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:23,520
which I will probably link to in the comments.

2743
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:27,080
But anyways, speaking of cycloneals,

2744
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:31,000
remember clown and horse gender?

2745
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,400
Of course.

2746
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,040
Yes, wait, is that it?

2747
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:37,800
Okay, good, okay, good.

2748
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,480
You're welcome in advance, by the way.

2749
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:45,080
But remember when, when, when in KMZ,

2750
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:47,520
just kind of, you know,

2751
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:51,560
just kind of like strangled equestria death?

2752
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:52,400
Yeah.

2753
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:56,060
No.

2754
01:58:56,060 --> 01:58:57,680
Yes, I remember that.

2755
01:58:57,680 --> 01:58:58,520
No, I don't.

2756
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,440
You're welcome.

2757
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:06,080
I don't, that doesn't make any sense.

2758
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:08,080
What is the implication here?

2759
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:11,600
I think the implication is that clown and aqueous

2760
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:14,640
is like horse and is like clown gender,

2761
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:17,440
horse gender, it's not a sexual preference.

2762
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,520
It's not misunderstood, I think.

2763
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,520
I don't, I don't know.

2764
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,840
I mean, it's not about clowns having sex with horses.

2765
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:26,560
This is something else.

2766
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:29,480
If it, I don't, he can't, he can't think that.

2767
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:30,880
He can't think that that's what it is.

2768
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:34,540
But it's like, okay, the clown,

2769
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:39,540
so it would be an allegory for someone with no gender,

2770
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:43,860
killing someone with a lot of gender.

2771
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:48,220
So what's, what am I, what, what does it mean?

2772
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:53,220
Riddle me that, ironmathyatgmail.com.

2773
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:54,780
Riddle me that.

2774
01:59:54,780 --> 01:59:55,620
Okay.

2775
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:57,140
Riddle my ass.

2776
01:59:57,140 --> 01:59:58,740
Riddle my ass.

2777
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:03,740
Hey, next, next, shout outs, shout outs.

2778
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:06,980
Next one is called Tom's Content Gold Mine.

2779
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:09,260
Three, two, one, go.

2780
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:12,900
Tom always acts like he doesn't have anything to talk about

2781
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:16,420
on the podcast and yet he plays D&D every weekend.

2782
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:19,540
Clearly, as someone can talk about what he did during D&D.

2783
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:22,260
After all, the best thing about D&D is telling people

2784
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:24,460
who really don't want to listen to it

2785
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:26,020
about what you did over the weekend.

2786
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:26,860
That's absolutely true.

2787
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:29,500
And what would fit more on the PCP than that.

2788
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,580
That is absolutely correct.

2789
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:32,860
I want 100% agree.

2790
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:33,980
It is a content goal.

2791
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:37,260
I was looking forward to getting my like frog character

2792
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:38,900
campaign more underway.

2793
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:40,540
I was going to talk about it,

2794
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:42,980
but then it kind of evaporated and it never really came

2795
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:44,700
to pass, which was sad.

2796
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:49,300
Tom's got the opportunity to, it would be like,

2797
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:51,540
it would be, imagine it's even worse

2798
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:53,540
than like Maige talking about her dreams

2799
02:00:53,540 --> 02:00:55,620
would be Tom talking about D&D.

2800
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:58,300
I was just having a flashback to that.

2801
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:01,380
And ironically, Tom needs to learn

2802
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,260
to be more annoying on the PCP.

2803
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:04,660
He doesn't take enough risks.

2804
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:05,660
I actually agree.

2805
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:06,500
I actually agree.

2806
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:09,380
I think Tom avoids talking about things

2807
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:11,300
that he thinks no one will be interested in.

2808
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:12,300
And I think as a result,

2809
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:13,740
he ends up not talking about things

2810
02:01:13,740 --> 02:01:15,900
that we would genuinely,

2811
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:19,180
we could ring interest out of if we tried.

2812
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:21,500
Tom, you gotta know you're annoying, Tom,

2813
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:22,780
and you should own up to it.

2814
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:25,660
God made you annoying and you shouldn't feel shame for it.

2815
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:26,500
You can't deny it.

2816
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,820
It's one of your talents.

2817
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:29,780
You can't just pray the annoying away.

2818
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:32,180
You have to embrace it.

2819
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:33,020
Exactly.

2820
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:33,860
You have to be your true self.

2821
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:35,220
Embrace the cringe, Tom.

2822
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:36,340
Embrace the cringe.

2823
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:37,180
That's right.

2824
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:39,660
Well, Tom does embrace the cringe

2825
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:41,180
because he posts gifts.

2826
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:43,340
He posts reaction gifts, gifts,

2827
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:45,460
which we know is we have the cringe trial.

2828
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,980
They truly are a gift.

2829
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:48,580
And he was found guilty.

2830
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:51,960
So we already know this much.

2831
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:53,980
Next voicemail is called,

2832
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:55,580
it's just called Janess.

2833
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:57,660
Three, two, one, go.

2834
02:01:57,660 --> 02:02:00,380
What do you recommend for a daily regimen

2835
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:02,940
of learning the drawing fundamentals

2836
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:06,900
to practicing drawing over and over again?

2837
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:09,700
What space of time should I allow for each?

2838
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:16,780
You're asking the wrong people.

2839
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:19,140
Who the fuck says, I don't know how to draw.

2840
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:22,180
I mean, what space of time?

2841
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:23,740
Well, you know how to draw.

2842
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:24,620
What is my time?

2843
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:25,460
I would say,

2844
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:28,260
what is your drawing regimen for learning how?

2845
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:29,100
Did you do that?

2846
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:31,100
Did you do the whole like stuff?

2847
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:33,660
I remember back in middle school

2848
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:37,100
when Tumblr was at the height of its popularity,

2849
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:39,860
I would have a USB where I would just constantly save

2850
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:41,700
like a lot of like photos.

2851
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:44,940
Like photos are real life of people in outfits or scenery

2852
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:48,420
and to a USB and I would call the folder art references.

2853
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:50,420
And during weekends,

2854
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:53,860
I would just go through like every single one of the photos

2855
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:58,260
and just draw as closely as I can to that photo.

2856
02:02:58,260 --> 02:02:59,180
Even though it looked bad,

2857
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:00,700
I was still trying to draw realistic

2858
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:02,460
and over a course of the time,

2859
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:03,300
like I would just start,

2860
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:06,100
I would just kind of subconsciously learning like anatomy

2861
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:07,820
and how to make like things look good,

2862
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:09,020
how to draw hands well.

2863
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:09,860
Because I did that,

2864
02:03:09,860 --> 02:03:12,220
it's like why I know how to draw hands well now.

2865
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:14,260
That's an interesting, that's a pretty good,

2866
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:16,020
it's a pretty good regimen you get there.

2867
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:16,860
Yeah, yeah.

2868
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:18,460
So if you can just, I don't know when you have free time

2869
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:20,700
like weekends or whatnot.

2870
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:21,980
I know there's certain websites

2871
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:24,420
that just give you random like stock images

2872
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:27,340
to kind of practice with, right?

2873
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:28,660
Yeah, yeah.

2874
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:30,780
I got to start, I got to start like,

2875
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:32,620
I got to go back to the fundamentals a little bit

2876
02:03:32,620 --> 02:03:35,700
because I have not drawn humans in fucking forever.

2877
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:39,340
All I'm drawing are little goblins getting blown up

2878
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:43,300
and it's fun, it's fun, it's great, it's awesome.

2879
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:46,900
It's awesome, it's great.

2880
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:48,460
I'm happy for you.

2881
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:49,940
Read Villainverse, of course.

2882
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:50,780
Read Villainverse.

2883
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:54,140
I need to practice more humans.

2884
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:56,420
If you want to see goblins, lots of goblins getting blown up.

2885
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:58,780
Goblins get blown up in Villainverse.

2886
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:01,180
Every chapter, at least one goblin blow up.

2887
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:04,380
One goblin blow up, that's the cheesy guarantee.

2888
02:04:04,380 --> 02:04:05,700
Oh, goblins.

2889
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:09,140
I don't know if there's anything funnier than a goblin.

2890
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:10,980
I just don't know, there it is.

2891
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:14,260
I think their question was about like

2892
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:16,380
how to balance drawing for fun

2893
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:20,140
and drawing fundamentals like time-wise.

2894
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:23,060
I don't know if there's like, I guess the balance would be

2895
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:27,220
depending on the person drawing for fun enough

2896
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:30,220
so that you enjoy drawing in general

2897
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:32,460
so that when you're doing the fundamentals,

2898
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:33,740
you don't want to die.

2899
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:36,100
I would say just draw at how much time,

2900
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:37,900
it's just like as much as you can

2901
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:40,180
that you aren't like suffering and you want it

2902
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:43,460
and you are fucking furious and fed up and you hate it.

2903
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:45,580
If you get to that point, it's time to take a break

2904
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:47,300
and maybe come back tomorrow.

2905
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:49,860
I think it'll depend on everyone.

2906
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:54,420
Different like the tolerances for this

2907
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:57,020
because I have, I'm no patience for learning.

2908
02:04:57,020 --> 02:04:58,100
I hate learning.

2909
02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:01,940
It sucks, except when it's random facts on Wikipedia.

2910
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:04,300
But like studying and like drawing stuff

2911
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:09,020
that isn't like funny stupid shit is difficult for me.

2912
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:11,380
So I can't, I got to do it more.

2913
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:14,980
I just got to, I don't know, learn discipline, I guess.

2914
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:18,380
I think would be good is kind of like

2915
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:21,020
have the fun drawings be like the reward, right?

2916
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:23,460
So like, let's say I'm going to try to draw

2917
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:26,100
three like anatomy pictures for practice.

2918
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:27,220
And then once I finish those three,

2919
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:30,380
my reward is to draw like my fun little anime,

2920
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:33,220
weeaboo, bullshit, whatever the fuck you like.

2921
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,340
You know, that'll be your little fucking,

2922
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:36,220
that'll be your little treats.

2923
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:39,020
That'll be your carrot at the stick, at the end of the stick.

2924
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:41,500
I hate carrots.

2925
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:44,660
It would be your ass I eat bull at the end of the stick.

2926
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:46,180
Yeah, bro.

2927
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:47,100
Oh, base?

2928
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:49,380
Oh, fucking love, I say he bulls.

2929
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:52,060
I don't know.

2930
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:54,500
Next voicemail is called,

2931
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:56,780
I have to draw my commissions.

2932
02:05:56,780 --> 02:05:59,180
They've waited many months.

2933
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:01,380
Three, two, one, go.

2934
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:06,860
Hey, PCP, I haven't actually listened to the podcast

2935
02:06:06,860 --> 02:06:11,100
in like several months, probably like six months now.

2936
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:12,260
I'm really behind.

2937
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:13,380
I haven't been listening to anything about it.

2938
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:14,220
Don't worry about it.

2939
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,060
I just wanted to tell you that.

2940
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:16,940
Nothing happened.

2941
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:19,780
They gave me a refund on it, but I still got the switch.

2942
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:20,620
Based.

2943
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:23,100
So I got a free switch and I got Mario Kart with it.

2944
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:23,940
Fuck you.

2945
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:25,340
And I can't stop playing Mario Kart.

2946
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:26,780
For like the past four days,

2947
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:28,500
I've done nothing but play Mario Kart.

2948
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:31,180
I got the gold wheels, gold Mario, I got the gold kart.

2949
02:06:31,180 --> 02:06:32,020
Good for you.

2950
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:34,620
And I'm getting really close to getting the gold glider.

2951
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:36,900
I'm like ranked 5,000 online.

2952
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:38,500
All right, next game's about to start.

2953
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:39,340
I'll see you.

2954
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:42,900
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2955
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:43,740
The title.

2956
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:46,940
I hope he gets that gold card.

2957
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:48,060
I hope he's got it by now.

2958
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:48,900
I really do.

2959
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:50,500
You said he has a list of the PCPs,

2960
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:52,340
so I guess I'll update him.

2961
02:06:52,340 --> 02:06:53,540
So I think you got to,

2962
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:56,460
if you really want to like update yourself on the PCP,

2963
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:58,140
I recommend reading Villainverse.

2964
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:00,220
Just look up Villainverse.

2965
02:07:00,220 --> 02:07:01,780
If you want to really understand.

2966
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:03,100
If you want to really understand the PCP,

2967
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:05,220
there's a, it's either a Tumblr link

2968
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:06,500
or a Medibang link, right?

2969
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:09,700
But you know, just their first three chapters

2970
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:12,100
and a prologue, it should keep you up to speed.

2971
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:12,940
And maybe it should,

2972
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:14,500
maybe it'll fix your Mario Kart addiction.

2973
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:15,840
Who knows?

2974
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:18,940
Hmm, anything is possible.

2975
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:22,300
And anything, anything is possible, game.

2976
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:26,660
Next voicemail is called satire.

2977
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:28,860
Three, two, one, go.

2978
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:32,020
Look, look, look, look, look.

2979
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:35,420
The capitalist system, the corporateocracy,

2980
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:36,420
whatever you want to call it,

2981
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:38,740
it's all built with loss in mind.

2982
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:40,580
See, these companies,

2983
02:07:40,580 --> 02:07:41,660
they know they're going to be stolen from.

2984
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:42,700
This is going to suck.

2985
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:44,220
And that money is right there,

2986
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:46,220
the being stolen from fund.

2987
02:07:46,220 --> 02:07:48,980
And you can, you can reach out and take it.

2988
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:50,820
You know, you can steal from Walmart

2989
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:52,020
and they won't follow you out.

2990
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:52,860
You know what I mean?

2991
02:07:52,860 --> 02:07:53,700
Oh, this is about chocolate thing.

2992
02:07:53,700 --> 02:07:57,380
That sort of thing exists, but like larger scales.

2993
02:07:57,380 --> 02:08:01,420
Or you can get away with like a lot.

2994
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:02,380
I'm not kidding.

2995
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:05,140
Because these companies don't have the resources

2996
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:07,420
to investigate every time they're stolen from

2997
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:08,340
in a petty way.

2998
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:14,180
This goes for other things too.

2999
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:18,140
Like creditors and banks and shit.

3000
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:24,260
And banks, they're actually committing fraud constantly.

3001
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:27,540
And if you know the law, you can fuck them.

3002
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:31,740
And you can take their money basically

3003
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:33,300
and keep your credit score.

3004
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:37,500
I'm not giving advice or anything.

3005
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:39,180
I just think everyone should look into

3006
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:42,820
the opportunities afforded to them by the system.

3007
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:45,340
And we are in the looting phase of capitalism.

3008
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:46,180
So it's okay.

3009
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:52,780
I think it's kind of based.

3010
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:54,180
I think it's kind of based.

3011
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:59,900
If the, I don't, I'm sure it's probably true.

3012
02:08:59,900 --> 02:09:01,380
It's probably true that banks

3013
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:03,300
are constantly committing fraud.

3014
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:04,660
How do we get it though?

3015
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:06,500
I don't know.

3016
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,940
I would like to maybe know more

3017
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:10,540
about how to actually get the money.

3018
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:12,420
I look like, I don't really,

3019
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:13,940
I don't know like really can say anything about this

3020
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:15,980
because you know, Vosh hasn't made a video about it.

3021
02:09:15,980 --> 02:09:18,220
So I didn't really know what to think of it.

3022
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:19,060
Yeah, sorry.

3023
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:19,900
We're gonna have to.

3024
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:23,500
Maybe call back next time we are Vosh, my guy, I'm sorry.

3025
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:26,540
We can call in, we can call in on the stream and ask him.

3026
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:31,180
But yeah, I know about like,

3027
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:32,900
it's easy to fucking steal from Walmart

3028
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:34,980
and all these places, it's no crime.

3029
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:39,180
I mean, it's true that like, yeah, I mean,

3030
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:44,180
no corporate entity will like pursue a loss

3031
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:46,140
to an extent that like getting it back

3032
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:48,940
will cost them more than they'll recoup from it.

3033
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:51,580
So like broadly, yeah, you can steal,

3034
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:55,580
you can steal from anyone who doesn't have the resources

3035
02:09:55,580 --> 02:10:00,580
to not, yeah, who it's not worth it for them to like

3036
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:03,220
unsteal it, which you know,

3037
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,500
you could use that knowledge

3038
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:06,220
in any number of different ways.

3039
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:09,740
Up to you, gamer.

3040
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:13,140
Yes, each gamer, it's up to each individual gamer

3041
02:10:13,140 --> 02:10:18,140
to decide which, I don't know, fucking Twitch stream

3042
02:10:19,220 --> 02:10:22,780
to dump their bits into or what the fuck does that mean?

3043
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:25,180
It's up to each gamer to decide whether they want

3044
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:27,180
the good or bad ending, a mass effect.

3045
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:31,420
It's all, it's up to you, gamer, it's up to you.

3046
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:34,540
It's the choices you make that matter,

3047
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:36,100
which is the true ending.

3048
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:41,860
The next voicemail is called Based Joker,

3049
02:10:41,860 --> 02:10:44,500
three, two, one, go.

3050
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:47,300
Every poo poo is pee-pee time.

3051
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:52,820
But not every pee-pee, it's poo-poo time.

3052
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:57,060
Everything about that one, Mr. Batman.

3053
02:11:02,420 --> 02:11:04,380
I had an impression.

3054
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:06,100
I think about that all the time.

3055
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:07,260
What's the deal?

3056
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:11,700
I fucking love all the sort of like heat ledger impressions.

3057
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:12,980
That was a good, that was a pretty good

3058
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:14,340
heat ledger impression.

3059
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:17,100
I'll give him that one and I laughed so.

3060
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:21,020
My father left the voicemail on the BCP on time.

3061
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:26,100
Next voicemail is called.

3062
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:28,300
Do you wanna know how I got these subscribers?

3063
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:30,540
Got these subs.

3064
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:33,180
The next one.

3065
02:11:33,180 --> 02:11:36,020
My father ate a S.I.E. bowl on time.

3066
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:42,460
Batman, you barely touched your S.I.E. bowl.

3067
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:44,940
You barely touched your Sonic Curry.

3068
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:49,380
Stupid.

3069
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:52,900
The next voicemail is just called High Ben,

3070
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:54,860
three, two, one, go.

3071
02:11:55,860 --> 02:12:00,860
This is the procrastinator's podcast theme of the day

3072
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:02,860
and I'm really gay.

3073
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:06,860
Yes, I wish I had a voice modulator,

3074
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:08,860
but I don't, cause I'm whore.

3075
02:12:08,860 --> 02:12:11,860
Say hello to Ben and Gib,

3076
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:14,860
and maybe even Tom Oliver.

3077
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:17,860
But not Fixing Aid, Mumky or Davoo.

3078
02:12:17,860 --> 02:12:20,860
Jesse Mage, Mumky Jones or Jeff Foo.

3079
02:12:20,860 --> 02:12:23,860
But Ben St. is here with Gib.

3080
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:30,860
And that is pretty okay.

3081
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:34,860
Pretty okay.

3082
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:36,860
The water of the PCP.

3083
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:37,860
I'll take it.

3084
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:38,860
I'll take pretty okay.

3085
02:12:38,860 --> 02:12:40,860
He didn't have me at the beginning,

3086
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:42,860
but that finale really like, okay,

3087
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:45,860
he landed it.

3088
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:49,860
Nobody said my name with such gusto before.

3089
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:54,860
He really went for it,

3090
02:12:54,860 --> 02:12:59,860
and I have to applaud the enthusiasm.

3091
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:01,860
The next voicemail is

3092
02:13:01,860 --> 02:13:04,860
Literal Baby Children,

3093
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:07,860
three, two, one, go.

3094
02:13:07,860 --> 02:13:09,860
Hello, PCP.

3095
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:14,860
Where were you when you found out Dan Grumps was a rapist?

3096
02:13:14,860 --> 02:13:17,860
Oh my gosh.

3097
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:21,860
He's not a rapist.

3098
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:23,860
There was a whole big thing,

3099
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:26,860
but he's just maybe a scummy guy.

3100
02:13:26,860 --> 02:13:28,860
I didn't really look any further into it.

3101
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:31,860
It apparently has a history of like,

3102
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:32,860
I know when I say groomer,

3103
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:35,860
people think by default like minors,

3104
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:37,860
but no, a groomer could also be applied

3105
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:39,860
to someone who just uses their power

3106
02:13:39,860 --> 02:13:43,860
to like get people over someone, you know, by...

3107
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:44,860
Yeah.

3108
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:49,860
He used his influence as a popular let's player

3109
02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:54,860
to fuck some fans occasionally.

3110
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:56,860
That's what I would assume.

3111
02:13:56,860 --> 02:13:59,860
That's what I would assume he would do.

3112
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:02,860
Oh, he didn't call him back.

3113
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:05,860
Oh no, but I want him to keep fucking his girls

3114
02:14:05,860 --> 02:14:07,860
who I think he shouldn't be fucking.

3115
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:09,860
Why didn't he call them back and keep fucking them?

3116
02:14:09,860 --> 02:14:11,860
That's so evil.

3117
02:14:11,860 --> 02:14:13,860
It's...

3118
02:14:13,860 --> 02:14:15,860
What a joic.

3119
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:18,860
Hey, I'm joicin' off here.

3120
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:21,860
I'm zirkin' off.

3121
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:25,860
Because it's been a while since that happened.

3122
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:27,860
Yeah, it's been like two weeks.

3123
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:29,860
Yeah, fucking time moves so fucking fast.

3124
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:31,860
Wait, no, it's been one week.

3125
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:34,860
Like, by the time this video drops,

3126
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:36,860
we're all gonna forget about that boat

3127
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:40,860
that like got stuck in the Suez Canal.

3128
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:45,860
I only kind of heard about that second hand in there.

3129
02:14:45,860 --> 02:14:48,860
I don't really get what's so funny about it.

3130
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:51,860
I can't believe Dan fucked the Suez Canal.

3131
02:14:51,860 --> 02:14:52,860
Yeah, he fucked that.

3132
02:14:52,860 --> 02:14:55,860
He dug it, he dug the Suez Canal with his own hands.

3133
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:56,860
You know what?

3134
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:58,860
It's actually a perfect time for me to make this announcement.

3135
02:14:58,860 --> 02:15:01,860
I won't just be replacing Nolan on the Pizza Party podcast.

3136
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:04,860
I'll be replacing Dan on Game Grumps.

3137
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:05,860
Congratulations.

3138
02:15:05,860 --> 02:15:08,860
Finally, we can have a man on the inside of the Game Grumps.

3139
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:10,860
Yeah, yeah, I'm not so grumpy now.

3140
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:14,860
Hopefully, I don't fall for some horrible controversy

3141
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:16,860
any time soon, ha ha.

3142
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:18,860
Hopefully, you don't fuck any fans,

3143
02:15:18,860 --> 02:15:22,860
because that would be a big no-no.

3144
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:25,860
That's why every time I hook up with someone,

3145
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:27,860
I make sure, have you heard of Villainverse?

3146
02:15:27,860 --> 02:15:29,860
I would say, no, I'm like, oh, good.

3147
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:31,860
Every time you fuck, every time you,

3148
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:33,860
when you're on Game Grumps, you gotta be like,

3149
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:34,860
hey, you ever heard of Game Grumps?

3150
02:15:34,860 --> 02:15:36,860
They're like, ugh, I hate that shit.

3151
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:37,860
That's for babies.

3152
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:39,860
And he goes, yes, yes.

3153
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:41,860
I'm done, I'm done fucking someone.

3154
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:42,860
I'm free.

3155
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:43,860
I'm done fucking someone.

3156
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:45,860
And then afterwards, they tell me, by the way,

3157
02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:46,860
I really like Bangalore Luna.

3158
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:48,860
And I'm like, oh, no, what have I done?

3159
02:15:48,860 --> 02:15:49,860
No, what have I done?

3160
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,860
What have I done?

3161
02:15:51,860 --> 02:15:53,860
Next voicemail is called,

3162
02:15:53,860 --> 02:15:55,860
next voicemail is called,

3163
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:59,860
it's called doidgazers.

3164
02:15:59,860 --> 02:16:03,860
Three, two, one, go.

3165
02:16:03,860 --> 02:16:04,860
Hello there.

3166
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,860
This is doidgazers.

3167
02:16:06,860 --> 02:16:07,860
Hello.

3168
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:09,860
And I'm your host, D.

3169
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:14,860
And today, we're gonna be smoking some weed.

3170
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:19,860
And then after that, we're gonna talk to some guy.

3171
02:16:19,860 --> 02:16:22,860
And then we'll go smoke some old weed.

3172
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:23,860
Gripping.

3173
02:16:23,860 --> 02:16:25,860
And then I'm gonna do the hippity hop.

3174
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:28,860
And that'll be a remedy wrap.

3175
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:30,860
Is this a people movie I'm watching right now?

3176
02:16:30,860 --> 02:16:32,860
Please give me money.

3177
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:37,860
And subscribe to my blog post, Patreon thing.

3178
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:38,860
That's right.

3179
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:40,860
And you can give me money.

3180
02:16:40,860 --> 02:16:41,860
Thank you.

3181
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:43,860
You're welcome.

3182
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:45,860
Nice, nice baby.

3183
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:48,860
I love the baby in the back.

3184
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:52,860
That added a texture to it.

3185
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:54,860
Is this what it feels like to watch voicemail?

3186
02:16:54,860 --> 02:16:56,860
I've never seen episode of voicemail.

3187
02:16:56,860 --> 02:16:57,860
Is this what it's like?

3188
02:16:57,860 --> 02:17:00,860
It's, I mean, it's way longer.

3189
02:17:00,860 --> 02:17:01,860
Where is the baby?

3190
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:02,860
No baby.

3191
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:05,860
And imagine it's like four hours instead of 30 seconds.

3192
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:06,860
Well, there's no baby.

3193
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:09,860
I'm not interested in that because the baby stole the show.

3194
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:10,860
Yeah.

3195
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:15,860
I mean, I don't think I've watched an entire episode of that podcast.

3196
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:19,860
I've heard like a little snippet here and there.

3197
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:20,860
I skimmed through one.

3198
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:23,860
And I watched half of another one.

3199
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:25,860
It's bad.

3200
02:17:25,860 --> 02:17:26,860
It's dumb.

3201
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:27,860
It's awful.

3202
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:28,860
And I hate it.

3203
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:29,860
Yeah.

3204
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:30,860
Well.

3205
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:31,860
Yeah.

3206
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:34,860
I'm anti-yig studios.

3207
02:17:34,860 --> 02:17:36,860
I'm anti-yig studios until that.

3208
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:38,860
I'm also anti-yig studios.

3209
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:39,860
I'm glad you're here.

3210
02:17:39,860 --> 02:17:41,860
I'm glad you'll support me.

3211
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:42,860
I'm sorry, Ben.

3212
02:17:42,860 --> 02:17:44,860
Say I'm going to betray you right now.

3213
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:49,860
The last video they dropped, let's say it changed my mind.

3214
02:17:49,860 --> 02:17:52,860
It made me feel stronger than ever.

3215
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:55,860
Maybe yig studios isn't so bad if they could beat up Ethan.

3216
02:17:56,860 --> 02:18:02,860
I agree that Ethan Ralph is a monster, but I don't think any better of anyone involved over this.

3217
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:04,860
I feel, yeah.

3218
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:07,860
I feel like everyone should be embarrassed.

3219
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:09,860
Emotionally about it as you seem to be.

3220
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:14,860
I think it was, it was a funny moment, but like, LeMau.

3221
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:15,860
Let them fight.

3222
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:20,860
I'm not really like, ooh, thumbs up to whatever this situation is.

3223
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:21,860
It's completely insane.

3224
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:22,860
Let them fight.

3225
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:23,860
I'm so surprised.

3226
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:26,500
I'm so surprised that it was like uploaded and so

3227
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:32,280
That's the problem for me. Yeah public amount about it. There's like wow

3228
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:39,460
That's the issue for me. What a fucking joke. What a what a gross what a what a fucking yucky

3229
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:43,540
group gaggle of goblins. We've got over there

3230
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:47,900
Hopefully not and not funny goblins that get into shenanigans

3231
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:50,620
Uh

3232
02:18:52,220 --> 02:18:59,900
Anyway, doid gazers, doid gazers everypony. It was a little based. It was a little based

3233
02:19:00,300 --> 02:19:04,300
You know credit was credit is due they punched Ethan Ralph a bit sure pretty good

3234
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:08,860
I guess but I mean who hasn't right who hasn't punched Ethan Ralph

3235
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:15,100
Next next voicemail is called honest requests

3236
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:19,580
There it is, uh, three two one go

3237
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:23,100
Okay, I know this is like entitled fan bullshit

3238
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:27,500
But arm retrieval meant a lot to me and I'm like semi furious that munchie

3239
02:19:27,740 --> 02:19:32,380
Privated all of that shit without warning. Uh, I would like to download all of it, please

3240
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:34,780
Because it meant a lot to me

3241
02:19:34,860 --> 02:19:37,020
Is there any way you could tell him to like hey

3242
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:42,380
Could you unprivate it for like even 24 hours so I could download all of it real quick?

3243
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:48,940
You could and it could be gone forever, but I just I just want it for for to have personally because I love it so much

3244
02:19:49,820 --> 02:19:51,820
Please I love that show

3245
02:19:51,820 --> 02:19:57,020
I'm very angry that it's gone with no warning. I just want to download it for personal viewing

3246
02:19:57,340 --> 02:20:00,140
I'm not going to re upload it. I promise. I understand that

3247
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:06,940
I think you should just ask him. I think you should just ask munchie. I mean, there's nowhere you can contact him

3248
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:11,420
That's the thing is there not wait wait hold on. No, he doesn't use twitter

3249
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:14,060
He's changed his social media

3250
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:17,420
Hold on. I'm getting his clothes the social media stuff

3251
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:22,860
I'm getting a discord DM from munchie and he says that he'll have it up for for three weeks

3252
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:27,260
You have three weeks to to download it before he before he deletes it

3253
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:31,900
And hopefully he sticks to his word. It doesn't delete it two weeks earlier. Let's see

3254
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:38,220
Um, I don't I mean I can I feel like I didn't expect because like

3255
02:20:39,180 --> 02:20:42,940
Certain munchie content was like, oh, yeah, I could see why he wouldn't want any of that up

3256
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:48,220
And like I I could see why he wouldn't want to inform people so that they could re upload it

3257
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:51,500
Um, I didn't know that I didn't know that armless

3258
02:20:52,300 --> 02:20:58,860
I didn't know that arm retrieval was gone. And yeah, I'm not entirely sure why it's down. I guess just to complete the

3259
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:01,900
The the mission I suppose

3260
02:21:02,460 --> 02:21:07,500
Maybe maybe there's some aspects of it. I forget like he doesn't want to like I feel like his

3261
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:10,380
Decision to not inform people was so that

3262
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:14,540
That was definitely one she are definitely deliberate. Yeah

3263
02:21:15,340 --> 02:21:17,660
I'll I'll I mean I kind of want to see them again

3264
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:21,340
I don't know whether I'd watch them but like it is kind of sad that they're gone

3265
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:24,300
If yeah, maybe I could talk to him about like

3266
02:21:25,020 --> 02:21:31,180
Something it might be worth asking him about I guess. I don't know if I was munchie. I would really try to like get

3267
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:33,340
Just to

3268
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:38,780
Take down that the plea of in the weave episode where they talk about curvy because that's probably one of the most

3269
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:41,260
most heinous shit involving munchie

3270
02:21:42,380 --> 02:21:46,060
Is that right? It's the one where he says like the n-word like a hundred times

3271
02:21:48,860 --> 02:21:54,860
Yeah, like I see the case to be made there. I have not watched arm retrieval. I mean, that's why he took down lectures the first two

3272
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:58,460
Yeah, I mean, I don't maybe maybe just doesn't want to take I mean, I don't know

3273
02:21:58,460 --> 02:22:04,220
I don't know what what's going on. I don't know if I don't think much even has any contact with jess

3274
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:07,820
So he would have to establish contact first

3275
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:12,780
Is the plea of in the weave on on jesse's channel? It's on my japanese anime

3276
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:15,900
Yeah, okay. Yeah

3277
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:17,900
Yeah, that's a good point and uh

3278
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:20,860
I don't know

3279
02:22:20,860 --> 02:22:25,740
Contact jesse about it. Yeah, like there was one thing like, you know, it's how much you like, yeah, you probably should

3280
02:22:26,300 --> 02:22:29,740
Try to tell jesse to be like, yeah, he take that down because

3281
02:22:30,380 --> 02:22:33,100
Is it much he's trying to actually work in the industry and whatnot?

3282
02:22:34,220 --> 02:22:39,100
Or whatever. It's not I think he's it's not necessarily about that exactly. He just

3283
02:22:39,900 --> 02:22:41,900
He just made the decision that he wants

3284
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:43,980
the

3285
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:50,060
The life he led online to be like he's embarrassed, but he doesn't like it doesn't like that. It's all public. He wants it gone

3286
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:52,460
so i'm like, yeah

3287
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:56,860
I maybe forgot about that actually. I should probably mention it. That's probably

3288
02:22:57,420 --> 02:23:02,140
It would probably maybe bear mentioning like before this episode comes out when we're in we talk about it

3289
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:04,140
Which might provoke people to like

3290
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:06,540
Try and try and archive it

3291
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:12,060
I know probably already someone probably already has it somewhere. I feel like that's viewers

3292
02:23:12,620 --> 02:23:16,300
Viewers, I know how you feel. I know you don't like things being gone

3293
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:19,740
But munchies my friend and I care more about him than I do about you

3294
02:23:20,140 --> 02:23:23,820
Yeah, whatever whatever munchie says it goes

3295
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:27,100
Pretty much

3296
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:29,420
Uh next voicemail is called

3297
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:32,220
Mentos trio thing

3298
02:23:33,420 --> 02:23:35,420
three two one go

3299
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:38,300
I just want to say that i've been

3300
02:23:38,780 --> 02:23:44,700
Curious about the mentos trio ever since the things we can't get into podcasts and at the time

3301
02:23:45,180 --> 02:23:46,940
You know after learning more about you guys

3302
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:52,780
I just assumed that it was like ben nate and grace, you know, like your sister. No, uh

3303
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:58,300
I assumed that was the trio. It was not. I don't know why that that was my go-to

3304
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:01,500
I'm surprised you remember we have that wasn't the case

3305
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:03,900
um

3306
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:06,780
Cool, thank you. Thank you for finally answering a question that I

3307
02:24:07,420 --> 02:24:13,180
Was like intending on making a voicemail to ask about for a while, but I just kept forgetting so

3308
02:24:13,580 --> 02:24:18,460
Fucking good on you ben. Thank you. I'm glad I'm glad someone actually remembered and one

3309
02:24:19,580 --> 02:24:24,860
It might have been yeah, it might have been before you joined last week. I think I talked about it like at the beginning

3310
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:30,060
I guess I remember and you have mentos

3311
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:33,500
Yes, I told I had in previous episodes

3312
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:38,860
I had I had mentioned a thing I used to be in called the mentos trio and I think last episode was the first time

3313
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:40,860
I actually explained what it was

3314
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:42,300
lol

3315
02:24:42,300 --> 02:24:43,500
um

3316
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:50,380
Okay, so the next uh, the next voicemail is a it has an imager link, which I I guess I will post it

3317
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:53,180
Here

3318
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:57,420
Okay bacon bacon busker beatdown

3319
02:24:58,460 --> 02:25:01,900
Featuring error are a bear and pig

3320
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:07,820
Okay, okay, this is uh, okay

3321
02:25:09,580 --> 02:25:11,580
This is well, this is well drawn actually

3322
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:18,140
Uh, this is could use some color though. Um, okay, so this is album art. I suppose

3323
02:25:18,700 --> 02:25:20,700
Uh three two one go

3324
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:29,980
The missiles in my hands and pistols in my eyes won't work against this pig

3325
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:35,100
Because of his thick hat even when the bear uses

3326
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:36,860
Claw attack

3327
02:25:36,860 --> 02:25:41,580
It doesn't really work because the pig's too fat

3328
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:51,580
But the pig's got a big honking hog. He go we gotta use our words to burn him. So

3329
02:25:52,460 --> 02:25:56,060
He's burning so hard. He can't get back

3330
02:25:56,540 --> 02:26:04,940
We gotta beat the pig with a candid rap need to do a rhyme to take him down

3331
02:26:05,820 --> 02:26:11,980
What kind of rhyme could make a swine frown?

3332
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:17,340
I don't know

3333
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:20,780
What kind of rhyme could make a swine frown?

3334
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:22,860
uh

3335
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:24,380

Uh by killing you and cutting you up. That's a good one. There's potential there. There's potential there

3345
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:06,780

Sad but true god jk jk. You're lucky. I'm an ally. You're lucky. I'm an ally, sir

3354
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:53,420

3355
02:27:57,100 --> 02:28:01,420
Well, Errorari, I hope I hope we've given you a little bit of ammunition there for

3356
02:28:02,380 --> 02:28:04,540
For the rap against this this pig

3357
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:11,260
Hope we helped uh next voicemail is called. Oh fuck. What is this? What is this garbage?

3358
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:13,900
It is called

3359
02:28:14,060 --> 02:28:15,740
Pete

3360
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:20,540
Okay, it's called piece. Do you give do you see this it's called pcp opening one

3361
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:23,420
And then there's like a what?

3362
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:28,860
It's like one second it's one second and it's

3363
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:31,900
What is this?

3364
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:39,020
Yeah, uh, there's a link to uh, I don't think this works. I think they fucked this up

3365
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:44,380
Oh, well, it's a file share. Yeah, I don't know what that is

3366
02:28:46,300 --> 02:28:49,260
Try again next time buddy better luck next time

3367
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:57,100
Yeah, okay. Okay. Next one is my uh, no, I haven't posted it the next voicemail. Oh, wait. Did you wait?

3368
02:28:57,100 --> 02:29:03,180
Did you listen to this the one second one the one second one? Yeah, I did. He just says he just says what what?

3369
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:07,020
Okay, he says what there's double check. What?

3370
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:09,900
Yeah, unfortunate

3371
02:29:10,220 --> 02:29:15,260
Uh, the next one is called mine sweeper, but demons three two one go

3372
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:19,420
Someone brought up demon crawl last week and I'm a big fan of it

3373
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:21,500
But they didn't do a great job of selling it. I thought

3374
02:29:22,220 --> 02:29:24,220
Mine sweeper is a big part of our functions

3375
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:28,380
But there's so much other shit that if you're just here for mine sweeper, you may not actually enjoy it

3376
02:29:28,540 --> 02:29:31,020
You play through a bunch of levels that get bigger and harder, of course

3377
02:29:31,180 --> 02:29:37,020
But you've got an inventory to manage you got gold spend health defense armor stage mods to deal with

3378
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:43,260
Metaprogression shit bosses so on so forth the idea is that it's got cruel rng that will gleefully throw

3379
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:45,260
unavoidable guesses at you left and right

3380
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:48,620
So you got to mitigate that with stuff you find like a bow to shoot at hidden cells

3381
02:29:48,620 --> 02:29:51,020
Or a familiar to run around and die to monsters for you

3382
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:55,820
Also, maybe you get bad items that fuck up your run like something that makes them pc's never show up or

3383
02:29:56,380 --> 02:29:59,740
A hobo cat that makes shop prices higher. I could go on about it forever

3384
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:03,980
But you can just play the android version for free to see if you like it pc version is well worth it

3385
02:30:04,140 --> 02:30:09,900
But obviously that costs money. Uh, not a problem for me, but hey, it's cute. It's got a nice pixel art style

3386
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:11,500
It's good. Go try it

3387
02:30:11,500 --> 02:30:15,100
Okay, cool. I think a little bit more again

3388
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:18,220
Uh

3389
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:20,860
Oh god, I I forget to wait

3390
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:27,980
Demon crawl demon crawl demon crawl now. I understand it a little better

3391
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:31,020
Demon crawl

3392
02:30:31,340 --> 02:30:36,540

All which is true only metal can thoroughly freak a podcasters minds

3399
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:09,420
If you want your minds unfreaked in your lives

Then this monopoly man would be a tree chase the bands. I won't open you a million dollars by the end of today

02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:52,460
Um, you guys to keep playing we're gonna do that. We're gonna do the next one without you

3409
02:31:52,700 --> 02:31:56,540
We can't we got to go we can't you when things change you just got to keep moving forward

3410
02:31:56,540 --> 02:31:58,540
You can never go back. You can only go forward

3411
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:03,740
Next one is called the bandits have arrived three two one go

3412
02:32:05,980 --> 02:32:12,140
Tom deduces that the bird creature is telling what they believe to be the truth

3413
02:32:12,860 --> 02:32:15,740
And has no hints of maliciousness about them

3414
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:22,540
Gib also succeeds in tickling the bird creature into laying an egg

3415
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:25,500
And proceeds to eat it in front of him

3416
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:28,620
The bird creature does not like this

3417
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:34,060
And then proceeds to leave without offering any additional information or weaponry

3418
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:38,860
You continue your fortifications for the next few weeks

3419
02:32:40,140 --> 02:32:45,340
Finally a band of bandits appear outside for fortress

3420
02:32:46,380 --> 02:32:48,380
The bitcoin bandits

3421
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:52,700
They make attempts to penetrate your structure, but then stop

3422
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:59,900
It seems your fortifications have succeeded. They then make the demand

3423
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:03,580
Man

3424
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:06,300
Give us your bitcoins

3425
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:10,700
What do you do

3426
02:33:11,740 --> 02:33:12,940
Very simple command

3427
02:33:12,940 --> 02:33:17,260
I like the fact that that bird was trying to help and I just tickled it into making an egg

3428
02:33:18,220 --> 02:33:24,940
Uh like like how inappropriate and then I ate the child that they made and they're like oh god gross

3429
02:33:26,060 --> 02:33:28,220
It's terrible. It's terrible etiquette

3430
02:33:29,020 --> 02:33:29,420
um

3431
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:33,100
Oh, it's just chaotic and neutral things

3432
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:35,980
uh, I mean

3433
02:33:36,060 --> 02:33:38,540
I actually already I already sold on my bitcoin

3434
02:33:39,580 --> 02:33:46,620
So, uh, uh, oh, you know about that. I sold two similar time a little later than you did so I didn't uh

3435
02:33:47,420 --> 02:33:48,700
a

3436
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:51,420
It was it was already going down by the time I had sold it

3437
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:57,660
But then it went even lower and I was like it started to come back up and I just reinvested the money the money again

3438
02:33:58,060 --> 02:34:03,100
It's gone back up. Uh, so basically I've just I nothing happened actually

3439
02:34:04,460 --> 02:34:11,020
Damn, I sold it. It's back. It went back up to it was close to where I sold it before

3440
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:15,020
It's gone back up most of the way, but not quite to where I sold it

3441
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:18,060
So I may still I may still have made the right decision

3442
02:34:18,300 --> 02:34:24,140
Uh, although damn it really like shot up earlier today and I don't I don't like that. I don't like to see that

3443
02:34:24,220 --> 02:34:25,500
Yeah

3444
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:27,500
So please please die again

3445
02:34:27,980 --> 02:34:30,540
It it was like at the lowest point in the last week

3446
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:33,580
And I was like, you know

3447
02:34:33,660 --> 02:34:37,900
I don't like the idea that I don't have bitcoin. What if it does go up? I'll feel so stupid

3448
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:42,380
So I just put the money in I basically paid for the transaction fee twice

3449
02:34:43,100 --> 02:34:45,100
And I yeah, I mean

3450
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:48,540
But it went up though, so

3451
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:53,820
You just feel more comfortable when you have bitcoin you feel naked without bitcoin

3452
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:56,780
Okay, yeah, I guess

3453
02:34:58,540 --> 02:35:04,860
Uh, I need my bitcoin to keep me warm at night. Yeah, I say I say to these bandits. No, you can't have my bitcoin

3454
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:07,100
It's my safety blanket

3455
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:11,900
I say, uh, I say, oh god, they they don't uh, they don't know

3456
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:19,660
I say I say there's no bitcoin. There's no bitcoin. I sold on my bitcoin. Sorry. I sold the bitcoin. No bitcoin here

3457
02:35:20,540 --> 02:35:25,740
Goodbye, but ben. I've already told them that I have my bitcoin and I won't no, but I

3458
02:35:26,540 --> 02:35:29,660
Oh, well, I mean they can have your bitcoin

3459
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:32,380
You know, I don't care. Oh, no

3460
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:36,780
Uh, I I push ben off of the photo. No, I push you

3461
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:39,660
the fortifications

3462
02:35:39,900 --> 02:35:41,740
Oh roll for

3463
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:47,980
Pushing off fortifications. I'm gonna get they can they can take your bitcoin and leave my fuck leave my fortifications in peace

3464
02:35:49,420 --> 02:35:53,900
No, we're struggling. This is where we are right now. We're struggling trying to push each other off

3465
02:35:53,980 --> 02:36:00,540
We're trying to push the other way. What is what does pushing me even do for you? They're gonna just come to see that I have no bitcoin

3466
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:03,900
Yeah, but if if you're down there

3467
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:09,180
You should just let me put you should just let me push you off because no no no no you do have bitcoin

3468
02:36:09,260 --> 02:36:13,420
So it makes more sense. That's why I need you to be pushed off because if you're pushed off you can't push me off

3469
02:36:13,420 --> 02:36:17,660
If they if you if I push you off, they'll take your bitcoin. They'll be happy. They'll go

3470
02:36:18,460 --> 02:36:20,620
If they if you push me off then I want to have my bitcoin

3471
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:25,260
There's if you if you they're still gonna attack you they're still gonna attack you for those bitcoin

3472
02:36:25,500 --> 02:36:27,500
Yeah, but then I'd be in the fortifications. They'd

3473
02:36:27,820 --> 02:36:33,500
I don't but I don't want you to be in the fort. I want to be in the fortifications you and your bitcoin can go outside

3474
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:35,660
please

3475
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:37,660
Like I push I push harder

3476
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:42,060
I want to live and I want you to die. No, I want to live and I want you today

3477
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:48,940
Okay, so it seems don't you just understand it seems we're at an impasse here

3484
02:37:18,700 --> 02:37:20,700

3565
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:34,780
Digi after dark and I and I was amazed how much I I still like

02:43:36,140 --> 02:43:38,540
Related to a lot of her older points

3567
02:43:39,260 --> 02:43:42,620
Like in in this moment right now and there's more right now in my life

3568
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:48,700
And I realized maybe maybe I should be the new digi bro. I I I relate so hard at this moment right now

3569
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:55,020
That would be pretty ironic then if they replaced uh, no one be with digi bro on the on the

02:43:56,220 --> 02:43:58,220

3583
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:56,940

Not only is it your weekly reminder to catch up on one piece this week ben, but

3592
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:23,740
How about this the binding rizek is getting its

3593
02:45:24,300 --> 02:45:26,300
Final dlc

3594
02:45:26,300 --> 02:45:32,860
31st. I thought you guys should know if I recall correctly. That's a game you guys enjoyed in the past. It's true

3595
02:45:33,020 --> 02:45:35,740
But I know that's something that I am looking forward to

3596
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:40,780
Fair um, I don't need I don't need that in my life right now

3597
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:45,180
I got I went on I got on another noida kick earlier in the week and I

3598
02:45:46,620 --> 02:45:50,300
I got so I got so powerful that I was crashing the game

3599
02:45:51,100 --> 02:45:53,100
Uh, like my wands were so good

3600
02:45:53,740 --> 02:46:01,180
I don't know why they do this but but when I have wands that shoot too many that shoot a single projectile that explodes into many small projectiles

3601
02:46:01,740 --> 02:46:05,420
Some that can sometimes crash the game and it was doing that it was crashing my game

3602
02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:10,140
It was deleting my wands. It was deleting my spells. It was corrupting my save data. It was so

3603
02:46:11,260 --> 02:46:13,020
infuriating

3604
02:46:13,020 --> 02:46:15,020
Uh, I I don't

3605
02:46:15,100 --> 02:46:21,260
Know what the problem is like like I still could play it but like stuff was gone and I'm like well, that's not fair

3606
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:23,260
I fucking I earned that stuff

3607
02:46:23,740 --> 02:46:27,100
My wands my wands. No, it's unfair. It's unfair. Why?

3608
02:46:28,860 --> 02:46:31,100
It's unfair and I hate video games now

3609
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:35,180
And uh, I was going for the alt I was going for the 33 orb run

3610
02:46:35,740 --> 02:46:37,740
I had everything I I needed like

3611
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:41,980
And I I guess I still could do it that save file is just kind of there

3612
02:46:42,060 --> 02:46:45,260
But like I'm just feeling I'm salty about I haven't touched in a while

3613
02:46:46,140 --> 02:46:50,780
Uh, and I don't I don't need to start playing a new game like binding if I if I started playing binding vizek again

3614
02:46:50,780 --> 02:46:54,140
I'm sure it would sink another 100 200 hours into it easy

3615
02:46:54,860 --> 02:46:56,940
Maybe at some point. I'll I'll I'll go back to it

3616
02:46:59,020 --> 02:47:00,140
Um

3617
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:09,740
The last the last voicemail is called oopsie. But oopsie bobo. There it is loading it there three two one go

3618
02:47:10,700 --> 02:47:16,060
Some pussycald in last episode to warn you about the consequences of shoplifting

3619
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:20,700
Um, buddy, don't express your own insecurities on other people

3620
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:24,300
We very know what the fuck is gonna happen if they catch us

3621
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:27,020
Nothing they're gonna say. Please stay

3622
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:32,940
I've done it. They've caught me nothing happens. Try to get away with it. Just play along

3623
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:37,580
You can um put them in another bag and try not to pay for them

3624
02:47:37,980 --> 02:47:43,740
And if someone sees your bag you just go like oh, no, no, no, I just forgot to pay

3625
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:46,540
I'm so dumb

3626
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:49,180
Sorry, sorry. I forgot to pay

3627
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:52,060
Now I gotta go

3628
02:47:52,060 --> 02:47:53,100
Bye bye

3629
02:47:53,100 --> 02:47:58,940
I think it just walk out of the store in almost every case like the worst they can do is like ban you from the store

3630
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:02,700
And like if they remember you they might they'll tell you like you can't come in here leave

3631
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:06,860
Uh, I think that's the worst that's gonna happen. I can't say for sure

3632
02:48:07,500 --> 02:48:12,300
Thank god, like like I said on the last one. They they're not cops. They can't arrest you. Yeah, my uh

3633
02:48:13,020 --> 02:48:19,900
My cousin, uh, tried to steal a pants from macy's and they told him he was banned and then he came back to next month

3634
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:23,180
They didn't fucking notice

3635
02:48:23,820 --> 02:48:27,340
I'm sure if there's like a change in management then like how would the craig

3636
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:31,420
Craig left the call. It's I guess it's been three hours

3637
02:48:32,060 --> 02:48:33,260
um

3638
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:39,180
But I guess that's a good signal for us to end because yeah, we were 10 minutes away from uh, ellie is our three hour limit

3639
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:41,420
All right, okay, I guess any

3640
02:48:42,380 --> 02:48:46,940
Yeah, go on. Yeah, any any final any final thoughts before we wrap up

3641
02:48:47,020 --> 02:48:51,180
I think I remembered the specific reason why I wanted to come on

3642
02:48:51,980 --> 02:48:56,540
I dropped a video recently called how to get your own adult swim show

3643
02:48:57,100 --> 02:49:02,540
And I did I didn't want to provide it. I did show it to you. I don't know if you've seen the finished version then or gib

3644
02:49:03,580 --> 02:49:05,980
I don't think you showed me the finished version

3645
02:49:06,460 --> 02:49:11,740
You showed me a version. Yeah. Yeah, I did. I've been just showing it around to everybody because I'm pretty

3646
02:49:12,300 --> 02:49:14,300
proud of how it came out

3647
02:49:15,100 --> 02:49:21,900
And I need I need I need more eyes on it and since uh, since daddy pan is not going to put me on every episode

3648
02:49:21,980 --> 02:49:23,980
It just every other episode

3649
02:49:24,060 --> 02:49:29,260
I and I need I need the views I I savor I'm savor for the views on this video. I need them

3650
02:49:30,140 --> 02:49:35,900
Right, so you absolutely. Yeah, so it's on the cheesy manfredo channel. It's how to get your own adult

3651
02:49:35,980 --> 02:49:37,580
swim show

3652
02:49:37,580 --> 02:49:39,580
I recommend it. It's a funny

3653
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:47,020
Video, I won't spoil it. It's funny. It's informative to spoil it. It's basically

3654
02:49:47,740 --> 02:49:51,980
It is informative. I didn't I did not know any of this until you told me about it

3655
02:49:52,060 --> 02:49:57,500
I guess like to run it down really quickly. There's there's there's a stream on adult swim

3656
02:49:58,060 --> 02:50:03,020
Um called the development meeting where people could actually call in and try to pitch an idea for a show

3657
02:50:03,420 --> 02:50:06,620
And they were actually talking to people who are development heads at adult swim

3658
02:50:06,620 --> 02:50:08,300
So these guys aren't just like

3659
02:50:08,300 --> 02:50:11,020
Host or actors. No, they're actually like development heads

3660
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:15,500
And I've seen enough episodes that I like know the meta game of how to get like a pitch

3661
02:50:16,060 --> 02:50:21,900
Like across so this video. Yes. Um, yeah, this video is going to teach you the way to perform the perfect

3662
02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:25,500
It's a good idea. It's a good idea for a video. It really is

3663
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:29,340
Um, yeah, check it out. Let's check it out

3664
02:50:30,220 --> 02:50:33,100
I will once again remind you that if you're a comic artist

3665
02:50:33,100 --> 02:50:38,700
Do you know any comic artists cartoonists who want to maybe get their work published in the kato anthology?

3666
02:50:39,020 --> 02:50:43,580
Link down in the description if you want to see see that and then submit your work

3667
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:50,780
For when they do the Kickstarter to publish it, uh, probably in a month or a little more. I'm not exactly sure but soon

3668
02:50:51,660 --> 02:50:53,660
Link in the description for that

3669
02:50:54,460 --> 02:50:57,900
Um gib anything left

3670
02:50:58,780 --> 02:51:04,380
No, no, I guess I guess that's it. I guess that's it for the pro

3671
02:51:06,220 --> 02:51:08,220
Crastinators

3672
02:51:08,300 --> 02:51:10,300
podcast

3673
02:51:10,460 --> 02:51:12,460
Goodbye

3674
02:51:14,220 --> 02:51:16,220
Long later

3675
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:19,260
Goodbye

3676
02:51:19,660 --> 02:51:21,660
