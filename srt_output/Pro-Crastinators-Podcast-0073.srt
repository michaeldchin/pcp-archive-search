00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,200
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, the only podcast

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,920
with me, the best guy ever, and nobody else. I am the best guy ever. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
Podcast. We're the best guy ever. Yeah, I'd say Munchy's here. What's up Munchy?

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,200
Um, um, hey, hey, everyone. What's going on in here? I just came in off the street where

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,280
I slept last night. How's it hanging? Oh my god.

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,080
That madman, that trickster god Ben Saint is here. We've got Mumkey Jones.

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,240
Hey everybody, I like video games. Also Tom Oliver.

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,920
Sup beautiful bastards. Hope you're having a fantastic time now. Welcome back to the Tommy

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,120
Oliver Show and let's just jump into it. Tom, these come out on Sundays, not Saturdays.

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,600
You already fucked it. It's a Saturday when I'm recording it and that's the only day

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,160
that I care about. That's true. That's true. We're men who live in the day, the here and

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,640
now, we don't live in the future. I live in the present. I don't concern myself with petty

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,960
things like the future. Yeah. Fuck that. So if you remember a way back to episode one

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,360
of the procrastinators podcast, we talked about the best game ever undisputedly undertale

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,120
as we all agree. And it's time to revisit that issue by talking about the greatest game

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,600
console of all time. We're talking consoles people of all of all makes models and builds.

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,960
And let's let's check in with our friends over at Urban Dictionary to read what a console

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,360
is. Okay, actually, these definitions are terrible. These people are not my friends.

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,160
I just want to disclaimer that I do not associate with them. Oh, Urban Dictionary. Yeah. Oh,

20
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,600
here we go. My enemies console definition number two on Urban Dictionary, a computer

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,080
intended for limited user interaction, such as the NES or the PlayStation. Such computers

22
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,360
are intended only for loading single programs in one session, although newer consoles are

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,480
able to perform such feats as getting on the internet networking between other consoles

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,840
of the same type. I'm a fucking nerd. Even I hate this guy. Holy common input devices

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,840
for consoles include controllers also called paddles sometimes joysticks or arcade pads.

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,720
Who calls a controller a paddle? What is that? Okay, doesn't matter. I wrote this, aka retard.

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,160
Maybe the same people that call levels boards. What the fuck? Is that a real thing? Yeah.

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,640
Yeah. Danny on game drums would always call it if he would get a free man and he would

29
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,360
clear the board. I mean, I love the free man thing, but I've never heard this. Dude,

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,120
when I would play fucking brawl with my cousin, he would be like, oh, dude, oh, dude, I love

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,360
this map. I love this fucking map. It's a stage. You know, the map on a little bit more

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,560
sympathetic. No, the game specifically calls it a stage. Yeah. It says choose your stage.

33
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,800
Oh, I love this map. Oh, get fucked. Yeah, you just get reamed in the middle of an IHOP.

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,560
Like you do. I read in your mind. I know you want to. Okay, fair point. Fair point.

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,400
To start us off, now we, this whole topic was suggested by our dear friend, Tom Oliver,

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,680
rest in peace, who suggested that we discuss the greatest. Has he killed himself since

37
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,200
we recorded this? I'm always thinking about it, man. You never know. Check out a monkey

38
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,680
and Tom's suicide packed video or whatever. Yeah, that's what it's called. That'll be

39
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,080
the last episode. We'll be called then. Right, of course. So Tom was just talking about how

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,640
great the GBA was. And I believe that takes his spot for the greatest game console of all

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,280
time. Indeed. It's a tough battle. You know, a lot of people, Tom, oh, sorry, go on. That's

42
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,240
all I was going to say. It's a tough battle, but GBA is number one in my book. Now I'm

43
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,320
sure a lot of people, when they hear you say that would immediately jump to the fact that,

44
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,480
but, but Tommy, it can't even play fucking Halo while I'm downloading terror flops of

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,800
child porn at the same time, like my PS4. What is your defense of this position? It's

46
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,600
baby shit console. Look, there's, there's serious Sam on the GBA due to course. Actually,

47
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,360
quite a few 3D games on the GBA, surprisingly enough. But no, I mean, the problem is like

48
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,200
the new new consoles, the kids these days, with their fucking multimedia consoles,

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,440
consoles have like jumped the plot and forgotten what the point is playing fucking games,

50
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,520
all right. PS4 had all these goddamn channels, you could watch YouTube on it. But how long

51
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,640
could you only play Bloodborne and nothing else? It's fucking bullshit.

52
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,120
Long time.

53
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,800
The GBA launched with a fucking kick ass lineup of games and it only got better. And that's what

54
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,200
these, I feel like everybody here is, is not retarded when it comes to gaming consoles. So I

55
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,040
feel like even though I'm sure some of you won't agree, the GBA is the best console. I'm pretty

56
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,640
sure none of you are going to have retarded choices like the PS4 or some gay shit like that.

57
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,360
That's going to be about consoles that play games and don't do much else.

58
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,680
Anything past the PS2, they don't even have identities anymore.

59
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,080
They just became like a weird conglomerate of...

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:25,920
One of the worst experiences of my gaming life was when I bought Metal Gear Solid 4.

61
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,640
I got the PlayStation 3 bundle with Metal Gear Solid 4. It was great. I plug it in.

62
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,320
And then as I'm starting it up, it's like legendary the setup time for Metal Gear Solid 4.

63
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,000
It was like the first moment when it's like, okay, things have gone terribly, terribly wrong

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,040
at some point. And this is the point I'm trying to make in general. The big consoles,

65
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,280
like the load times. I'm thinking about Bloodborne, for example. So I played Bloodborne right when it

66
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,680
came out, like Midnight Release. It was fucking great. And that was before they had patched the

67
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,080
little... You know, the loading screens and all the Dark Souls games held us show an item and a

68
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:10,240
description of a certain item in most of the Dark Demon blood games. So that Bloodborne,

69
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,040
when it first came out, didn't even have that. It just for the loading screens would just have

70
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,680
the word Bloodborne and nothing else. And of course, in that game, you do a ton of traveling

71
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,920
back to your home base. I know. It was absolutely unbelievable. The whole time I was screaming

72
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,760
about why they didn't have this thing from the others, which was just... It was kind of fun to

73
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,800
read the description of items while you waited for things to load in Dark Souls 1, 2, and whatever,

74
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,840
the ones that were out of the time. But they didn't have that. It fucking sucked. So my point is just

75
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,280
like, there's so much fucking loading that you have to suffer through to play these cutting-edge,

76
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,320
so beautiful, amazing games. But on the GBA and shit, there was so much less of that stuff,

77
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,960
because they really prioritized gameplay. And that is just something that's really been

78
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,360
sacrificed in a terrible way. Well, hang on. Well, GBA was a cartridge console,

79
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,000
and cartridges didn't even have loading times. There were a couple games on GBA that had loading,

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
and there's mostly the 3D ones, but there was only a couple seconds. But no, it's just...

81
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,240
See, that's my point, Ben. The fact that we were so obsessed with creating these big old

82
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
experiences where you have to load in a gigantic map and process all this data at once...

83
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,280
I feel like I'm going to get triggered and talk about my realism rant in games and how it's the

84
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,760
most cancerous thing ever made by mankind. It's inevitable. It's related to this. I want to hear

85
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,880
it. It's so fucking dumb. Honestly, because you're saying how everything after PS2 doesn't have an

86
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,760
identity. It's because this realism curse became a thing. How fucking sad is it that in the PS2,

87
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:47,360
you had Naughty Dog and Insomniac doing Ratchet and Clank and Jack and Daxter. And then the next

88
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,520
console cycle came along. It's like, oh, look at all these polys we can throw around. We're going

89
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,920
to make uncharted and fucking resistance, which are like bland fucking gay games that have no

90
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:05,200
personality. The kind of snapshot little zinger sentence I would say is, make art, don't make a

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,480
tech demo. Because when you make a realistic game, no matter how good it is, all you're making is a

92
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,760
snapshot of the technical limitations of the time. It ages terribly. It never looks cool.

93
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,720
But on the other hand, here's a perfect example of the shit when it started happening in the

94
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,440
PS2 era. Because PS2 and Xbox, the originals, is when they started to kind of like, oh, we can

95
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,240
make games that look super fucking real. Maybe we should do that. Do you remember Lord of the Rings

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,880
that came out on PS2? They're fucking dumb little gimmick where they're like, we're going to have

97
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,880
FMVs in the movie, and then they're going to, well, I can't put enough quotations around this,

98
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,640
so I'm going to try, seamlessly transfer to gameplay. And at the time, everyone was like,

99
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,200
whoa, it looks so good. But you look at it now, it looks like ass, like it's a joke. It's like,

100
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
are you serious? It looks like someone like with Down's Syndrome made these models. Because like,

101
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,880
it's impossible to make realistic models on the PS2. Whereas a game that came out in like,

102
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,560
the exact same time, I think the same year, the Legend of Zelda, the fucking Wind Waker,

103
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,240
Twilight Princess, Wind Waker, right? That had art direction. So like, that game is just as old,

104
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,280
but it looks gorgeous today. Gorgeous when it came out. You're so right about that.

105
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,520
Not only does it not, does photorealism not age well, because the technology is not there to

106
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,520
achieve true photorealism. So as we like, get closer and closer, like the old stuff will just

107
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,880
look worse and worse. Like, not only that, but like, photorealism is just a poor, it's just a poor,

108
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,920
like, artistic inspiration to work from. It's just a bad thing to work towards. Because

109
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
that everyone, like, everyone's trying to make it look realistic. They're all trying to make it

110
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,720
look the same. Like, what makes the game look good is not the graphical fidelity, but yeah,

111
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,200
like you said, the art direction. Like, good art direction is what makes the game look good and

112
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,600
look cool. Something modern now, like Bloodborne, like, it looks good. Like, it looks aesthetically

113
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,320
pleasing, despite the photorealism it shoots for, not because of it. Like, it's the art direction

114
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
that carries the game like that. And all the good games that are out right now, like, like,

115
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
it's, you're going to be fighting against the realism as it goes on. Because like, when the PS5

116
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,800
comes out, the art direction of Bloodborne still holds up. But man, those visuals, like, that cloth

117
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,520
simulation, we still couldn't re-do real-time cloth sim. It looks really fucking stupid now.

118
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,080
So it's just like, you're always going to have something like that. And it's really dumb.

119
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,280
I didn't mean to shit on Bloodborne, incidentally. Like, I wasn't trying to say it in any way,

120
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,320
like, it's too obsessed with photorealism. Actually, I think that's one of the brilliant

121
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,280
things about Bloodborne. It's sort of like, it is going for a little bit of photorealism in that

122
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,720
just, like, the things are obviously human-shaped and they, you know, act sort of the way humans do,

123
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,920
like, your playable characters and stuff. But like, the, the, what makes that game great is, like,

124
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,440
the, the cool environments around and stuff. And like, so I'm just saying, like, the art design

125
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,440
of Bloodborne is actually great. Right. Because it does all the stuff in addition to just having

126
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,000
sort of a baseline level of realism. But like, your call of duty and your battlefields, they're

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,920
never going to look, they weren't inspired to begin with. Like, the reason they were impressive is,

128
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,800
like, whoa, this is pushing the hardware. But as the hardware ages, like, you play Battlefield,

129
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,920
like, remember when Battlefield 3 came out, everyone was like, holy fucking shit. Like,

130
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,880
you play Battlefield 3 now, it looks embarrassing. I remember a string of first-person shooters

131
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,880
coming out that people were very impressed with for reasons I don't understand. Yes, I do remember

132
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,240
that. It was, it was, it was dumb. It was stupid. And it's, I also feel like there's definitely a

133
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,680
business side to this because, like, by, by making photorealism, like, the thing, like, because we

134
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,520
know, like, for some reason, everyone in America who isn't like a fucking nerd is just like,

135
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,360
cartoons and stylizing things are gay, I have to have it look real. So that's what opened up

136
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,640
gaming to a wider demographic and caused this massive commercialism in the first place.

137
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,960
But on top of that, you're also basically low barrier to entry, no taste required.

138
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,840
Exactly. Perfect. Perfect. And then on top of that, you've also set up this cycle that will

139
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,240
never break of like, we need to make games more real. So every couple years, you're going to buy a

140
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,840
new console to get better visuals where like, honestly, if you just cared about art style,

141
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,320
like, look at Wind Waker, you could still make beautiful games using PS2 quality hardware because

142
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,360
like, there are indie devs right now who make games that are gorgeous, but are super low end. So

143
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,600
one person can make it. And of course, all, all like the, the equipment manufacturers, all like

144
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,240
the CPU guys, like, they love this because this is excuses to like, force people to buy the new

145
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,240
shit that comes out that cranks out that little bit more. I think the most disgusting thing now

146
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,800
is that we have the Xbox one X and the PS because like, they're not even new consoles, they're just

147
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,440
like, we're just now they could run at the frame rate that PC's been running for the last 10 years.

148
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,840
It's so fucking dumb. And people just eat it up. Like I was really hoping that the Xbox one X and

149
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,920
the PS4 pro would flop and make me be like, Oh, I guess people aren't that retarded, but they're

150
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,800
selling great. So it's just, I know what this is, Tom. This is, this is what exactly Ben was saying.

151
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,720
This is the normie influx into the normies. These are people. They ruin everything. This is people

152
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,080
not looking for the best artistic or, or game experience. Like all of us are fucking veterans.

153
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,840
We know what makes a good game because we've been there for decades. We've been experiencing this.

154
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,680
We know what makes a game good. These people don't know shit. So they latch onto the most

155
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,320
obvious thing they can find that to them, quote, unquote, makes a game good. And it's how pretty

156
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,080
it is how, how life, and it's not even that like they understand what a good art style looks like.

157
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,760
It's that it looks the most true to life. Therefore, it's the best. Oh, it's infuriating.

158
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,160
These people don't know shit. Normies, get the fuck out. Not only. I say better myself.

159
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,360
Not only do you realize the graphics just look bad. They are just not pleasant to look at because

160
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,360
they always look ugly regardless of anything ever. It also just harms the game. Okay. The only thing,

161
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,480
the only thing I care about in games is, is, is if the aesthetic matches the gameplay and vice

162
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,120
versa. That's the only thing I care about. I don't even care about the game is good. I was red

163
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,840
build on this. I became like this after like, like listening to the developer commentaries and

164
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,600
like TF two, like, like, if you go to TF two, you can like, go like watch like some commentaries

165
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,400
like in game. And they talked about how in TF two was really going to be this fucking like,

166
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,400
like, you know, super realistic, hyper, you know, hyper realistic blood splatter all of your screen,

167
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,600
you know, tails doll behind you, don't look out for Ben drown, you know, like that.

168
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,760
Okay. But, but then like, they're like, this makes no sense, because if we're going to make a good

169
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,360
game, you know, the, the no real people are going to build bases like 20 feet from another, from

170
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,320
another. So this is going to make no sense. Like, like, if we do this in like, you know, with realistic

171
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,920
graphics, you're going to look fucking retarded. And if we want to make it look good, then we're

172
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,400
going to have to like, make the game shit and boring. So they're like, and there are a ton of

173
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,920
like areas where like, you know, a map can't be huge, it has to be, you know, a map that's designed

174
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,800
well. So there'll be plenty of streets and stuff and corridors you couldn't technically go through,

175
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,560
though it looks like you could in a realistic saying, you know, if there's like a fence that's

176
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,960
like maybe one foot high, and they don't want to, you know, completely just wall off, then people

177
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,880
would be like, why can't why can't we get over this. So they're like, well, why don't we just

178
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,040
fucking just make them all cartoon characters, and not just cartoon characters, cartoon characters

179
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,480
that benefit the gameplay. These the game, the T2 gameplay is all about just fucking being an insane

180
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,760
lunatic and fucking killing people and like, and like wartime bullshit and you know, all that kind

181
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,560
of stuff. So they took inspiration from like wartime posters of the fucking like 1940s and

182
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,560
shit. So they got all that, they got insect that matched the gameplay and complimented

183
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,080
and they got to fix the gameplay too. It was a beautiful marriage. Yeah. And that's the aesthetic

184
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,720
The aesthetic totally works in the sense of like gameplay because like the whole idea about

185
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,120
like the spy just like wearing a mask of the thing that he's disguised as, like that's great and

186
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,440
that works from a gameplay perspective and an aesthetic art style sense. It's a perfect blend.

187
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,360
That's I mean, that's that's just what makes that's what makes a good work of art of any

188
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,200
medium is just that all the elements, all the elements compliment each other and become a

189
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,720
beautiful marriage. Yep, that gets on Koensterk, my dog.

190
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:55,600
And games are no exception. Is Nintendo the only company that hasn't like been

191
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,640
cucked and tries to go for realism all the time? Hmm, it seems that way. One of the few.

192
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,440
They're definitely the biggest one who's like fought off the temptation. I think most of it

193
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,280
was even just because like out of necessity, because like they gave up trying to like do

194
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,480
the highest spec hardware a while ago. So they have to rely on art style to actually

195
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,400
have the lowest they have the lowest right? Yeah, they focus more on making the games all HD

196
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,600
rather than like making fun games. I was just about to say that while they didn't make realistic

197
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,640
games, they still like if you look at the cutscenes for Smash 4, they look like oh Mario's

198
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,760
individual hairs are fucking rendered. I don't I don't care. I don't care. I mean,

199
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,960
you know, Nintendo had Nintendo had lower hardware, you know, power or whatever with its

200
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,240
consoles. But they also they also had that guiding that guiding Shigeru Miyamoto and oh god,

201
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,240
who's the earthbound guy? Who's the earthbound guy who just died? They had they had those guys

202
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,720
like the tone like the tone at the top of that company was like games should be fun, right? Yeah,

203
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,520
so I feel I feel like that probably went away towards keeping them out of this this fucking

204
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,240
ghetto that we're all in of photo realism. My favorite thing about Miyamoto is how he ruined

205
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,960
Paper Mario. I really love that guy. It's disgusting. I think the good thing about Nintendo is that

206
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,760
they recognize their limitations and then that's what makes you creative is to have those limitations

207
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,600
whereas like, you know, Sony and these other people are like, oh, let's let's see how far and

208
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,080
wide and crazy we can make the graphics without yeah, what can we do with them? We'll switch to

209
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,600
discs so we can have the biggest maps and the most and the most the most individual hairs rendered

210
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,080
in the most veins rendered in the bulging eyeballs of our space marines. You know now that now that

211
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,840
Tom said that I really can't help but think that like really the thing that makes the most sense

212
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,880
to me is that guys like Sony and Microsoft like obviously they're wrapped up deep in like the

213
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,160
hardware game so it's totally to their benefit to do things that like like to push technology

214
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,720
forth so that they can sell more of that shit and like it makes sense to them to iterate in

215
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,000
a small increments as possible to force people to buy it so yeah man like this just to me now

216
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,080
that I'm thinking about it this really just seemed like I'm not criminal but just manipulation

217
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:12,960
wait wait what did Miyamoto do to Paper Mario? Oh, let me tell you. I mean I know that the thing

218
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,320
with Square and Mario fell through and Mario RPG 2 became Paper Mario I don't know anything else

219
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,760
but that was good though that was still in the good days yeah so Paper Mario 1 and 2 are basically

220
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,600
masterpieces they're the best games ever made probably and they are better than any other

221
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:38,080
game ever made um and then Paper Mario 3 comes out it's like a weird like science one thing but

222
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,200
that's fine that wasn't that wasn't I like yeah I was just about to say I like it as well it was

223
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,440
different but you know what it was it's still a fun game then uh everyone was but but everyone at

224
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:59,040
the time was like I remember that I remember people saying that yeah that was me me too yeah um

225
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,920
you know I mean yeah I was like yeah I would like that as well and then Nintendo was like well um

226
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,640
okay sure um and then they were making like like like like some like early press releases they were

227
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,360
like yeah we're gonna make a stand at Paper Mario game it's gonna be sick and then or the 3DS as well

228
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,480
yes yeah which we'll get into how handheld consoles are objectively better than home consoles I think

229
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,120
yes we will uh and uh but yeah I don't know if it was Miyamoto himself but something someone said

230
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,120
it was like yeah this is basically just gonna be the thousand-year door again but uh you know

231
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,920
different and on the 3DS and uh so I was like okay and then it comes out and uh it's basically

232
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,520
unplayable it's nothing like the other games it's a game called Mario sticker star and it is an I

233
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,120
played that game my parents bought me that game and I fucking hate it it's terrible I played it for five

234
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,560
minutes you you are you are literally incentivized to never fight a single enemy or else you are at

235
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,240
an immediate diss okay like it sounds like an undertale to me

236
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,840
except that's yeah uh Mario sticker star is truly the greatest undertale of our generation

237
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,280
have you played any Mario RPGs whatsoever yeah I played um I played Mario

238
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,520
like an OG yeah I played the OG the OG one is like one of my favorite games of all time

239
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,240
yeah okay uh I'm assuming that that was just like uh like later Mario and Luigi's I actually I

240
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,520
haven't played it because no it's it's like extremely old school JRPG oh okay well uh okay well uh

241
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,960
it that's actually the first game I ever played in my whole life I think I was like two or three

242
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
and my grandma gave me the controller and I was like what the fuck is this shit your grandma was

243
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,320
playing Mario RPG oh my grandma's the one who got me into video games my parents oh holy shit

244
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,240
my when when my when our parents saw me playing Mario RPG my mom was really confused by the like

245
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,560
turn-based battle system because like maria would swing his hammer and it wouldn't actually hit the

246
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,800
enemy just damage would appear and she and she'd be like it's not even hitting him and I'd be like

247
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:01,520
mom you don't understand your mom would love call a duty five oh yeah visceral military action

248
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,640
then that's perfect then that's perfect okay you swing your hammer imagine if your hammer

249
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,120
had ammo and once you were out of ammo for that hammer you could not use it ever until you got

250
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,600
more ammo that's what every single attack in sicker star was like so dude I can't tell you all

251
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,240
the bosses that I encountered in sticker star that I literally ran out of attack things that you

252
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,360
could use to damage the enemy yeah you just have to lose and like go figure it out some other way

253
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,800
you piece of well yeah it's a resource management sim it's deep and strategic oh yeah all right all

254
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,240
why would you ever get into a bad like if you you can't ignore it's an RPG okay it's not an RPG

255
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,560
but it was supposed to be it's an RP well I mean it's a paper maria it was called paper Mario RPG

256
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,200
it's a really piss game okay everybody should yeah exactly everybody should go watch a hyper bit

257
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,320
heroes video that he made recently about it's got all the details on this not only that but again

258
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,680
where it's slightly aesthetics impact the gameplay in paper mario one and two all this is the argument

259
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,720
everyone always brings up and this happens in a lot of other ways just in this but this is the you

260
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,040
know the classic example the the toads the toads and mario mario one and two were all distinct

261
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,440
yeah like they did so much with the toe care design that I didn't like that is like way more than it's

262
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,880
ever been used ever they gave them all the end of the world they built they built new worlds yeah in

263
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,000
paper mario one and two like like rich like final fantasy style worlds where you can go an adventure

264
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,640
with towns and shit and it was great all that's personality and richness and they just stripped

265
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,360
they thought nope this is terrible this is a waste of our fucking time no one wants this

266
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,040
shit literally everyone wants it so so they just made they just made all the toes the exact same

267
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,680
you know red spots and then just the standard outfit just all of them maybe one of them has

268
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,800
like sunglasses who gives a fuck and all the worlds are just you know new super mario bros we

269
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,240
they're all just fucking you know grass desert whatever the fuck we're in fucking paper mario

270
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,600
two you go to like fucking like like a cortez pirate ship or like rachel mania in the sky

271
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,400
it's fucking sick fucking the fucking glitz pitch the fucking glitz pit the greatest level of any

272
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,240
video game of all time okay you know what let's not spend too much more time on this we understand

273
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,800
where you literally give birth in the middle of having a wrestling match yeah I remember I don't

274
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,280
remember that okay they also in a similar way they fucked up the uh the mario and luigi series

275
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,560
mario and luigi superstar is a masterpiece one of my favorite games of all time uh and then I think

276
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,200
the series has declined since then but like the new one is just I don't know who cares the point is

277
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,880
it doesn't matter like they're they're fucking it up it's just getting worse and worse uh paper mario

278
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,560
one through three is great i'll stand by that all right i'm the third one the one that was on we uh

279
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:47,520
yeah yeah i actually meant to say the one with like the fez like change your change your camera angle

280
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,280
3d yeah yeah that was really cool yeah it was that statement i just said is true but my brain was

281
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,120
lying to my mouth what i actually meant to say is that mario and luigi one through three is great

282
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,760
and uh fuck oh really yeah i think one is one is a masterpiece greatest game of all time two is

283
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,840
good and then the rest are like i don't care anymore okay we're those let's move on let's move on

284
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,840
enough about mario luigi we're just we're we're superstars on the gba superstars on the gba uh

285
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,240
i think two and three i think i think i guess that's why i only played the first one because i

286
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,920
didn't get whatever the other one you got the best experience you got the best experience

287
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,880
so i didn't play the other ones either and i'm glad that my memory of the franchise has not been

288
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:36,640
soured uh fuck you as a story time real quick nate um uh do you remember at red con 2 when me and

294
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,240
here all right it's time to talk about the best consoles yeah old consoles are better but which

295
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,720
one is the best that's the best which one's the best i can tell you the story of how the gba

296
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,040
broke my heart okay go for it i was seven years old the gba just came out and i wanted it and my

297
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:32,000
my dumbass dad said well if you wanted why don't you just buy it yourself excellent good point what

298
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,840
kind of lesson is that to teach a seven-year-old like am i supposed to go get a job am i supposed

299
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,440
to learn about like individual responsibility what are you saving what fucking money i'm seven

300
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,440
allowance i don't i don't get allowance there i don't know about you guys i thought allowance was

301
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,000
a myth that was on tv me too me too me too yeah yeah it's bullshit but i eventually get one

302
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,040
because my mom is not a prick and she gets me and i got i got the oh gameboy color game pokemon

303
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,760

304
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,480
beautiful game card games so fucking good and i'm seven and i don't know how anything works

305
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,640
my first pokemon game so i in the game with a like a level 90 for alligator i beat red

306
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,440
i remember specifically the four attacks of my for alligator were and i shit you not i don't

307
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:26,480
know how this happened cut slash scratch and hydro pump but those were the four

308
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,160
attacks that's a the top tier threat in the oh you made a game

309
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,040
whatever there was the girl were you the girl in the crystal yeah um of course just wondered

310
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,720
probably i don't remember but probably okay anyway here's the heartbreak we go on a trip a family

311
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:51,200
trip down to uh arizona and we take a plane ride and i'm playing my gameboy on the plane and i think

312
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,440
oh man there's on the seat in front of me there's this little pouch that you can put stuff in

313
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,560
i want to put my gameboy no i know where this is going and then we finally get to our destination

314
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:07,120
we're in the hotel and i'm like i'm gonna play some more put oh oh oh oh goodbye for alligator

315
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,480
i have i love gameboy yeah yeah i would buy forever gator

316
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,000
i have i have i have my story that i may have told before when i was running to catch a train

317
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,800
i think i was coming home from college that was in the money episode that inspired this

318
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,520
this very out there you go oh yeah tragic story ben i'll recap it real quick i was running for

319
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,360
the train and i had my ds in my pocket with nate your copy of zelda four swords i think

320
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,480
and it was the zelda the the 3d one on the ds i can't remember yeah it was but but yeah and it

321
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,160
just it just fucking i was running to the train and it just bounced right out of my bag and just

322
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,400
slid right under just fell right off the platform under the train and i'm just staring at it like

323
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,960
it's right there and i can't get it i just had to get on the train and sit on the seat and i just

324
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,680
like it's right there it's like a couple feet below me but there's no getting it now it's like

325
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,720
it's like ben's on the train to auschwitz and he's like i just what can i do i can't interfere in

326
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,800
this this is not my business i don't know about you guys what is he the conductor sure yeah i don't

327
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:17,840
know about you guys but ben in a train station in a hurry just feels so right to me it's not like

328
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,360
the train was leaving early like it was on time ben's just late it was it was it was it was leaving

329
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,080
imminently it was leaving in the next minute or two the lesson to take home from this is always

330
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,600
make sure that you're on time so you don't you don't run in and you're bouncing your shit and

331
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,640
every you got and you don't and you don't lose your brother's copy of zelda four swords wherever it

332
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,360
was i think it was phantom hourglass you know it was phantom hourglass that's right yeah okay fag

333
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,880
all right the ds light is the best console ever made okay here we go we're getting to Tom why do

334
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,240
you sign because the ds can play game boy game it can but it's just it's not the same it's not the

335
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,760
same yeah you know how everyone knows it has a backlight you fucking retort it's objectively

336
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,520
better munchy so does the munchy i can scientifically prove to you that gba sp is a superior

337
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,920
game boy advanced experience than the ds light do you want me to explain to you how the very the

338
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,120
very simple reason is that oh there it is there it is look don't get hard on the middle of the

339
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,840
podcast rip shape no no the reason that the sp is superior is because the the biggest problem i

340
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,960
have with the ds light because i had a gba original had a gba sp which i went through two and i tragically

341
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,360
broke one that's a good story uh then i had the original ds then i got the psp which was fucking

342
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,320
gay and then i got the ds light sort of and the one thing that i hated about the ds light that was

343
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,760
never fixed is that the d pad sucks and the reason the d pad on the on the ds light sucks he's right

344
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,680
is because it has terrible diagonals if you try and play fighting games which i played all the time

345
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,600
i played street fighter out three played street fighter two played king of fighters to howling

346
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,400
blood you can't do quarter circles on the ds light pad because the diagonals suck but the perfect d pad

347
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,800
ever made is the one on the gba sp because it's clicky and it's super tactile and responsive

348
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,240
it's the best d pad ever made on god's earth and it's perfect it's amazing i would hook it up to a

349
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,600
playstation and play real fighting games with it because it's so fucking good i i i have an objective

350
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,240
uh counter argument to that exact one these diagonals are actually perfect on the s and i

351
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,480
know why i know how because i used to play bows is inside story my favorite fetish game ever made

352
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,000
and i would only walk diagonally because i thought the sprites were cool i would only do it i would

353
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,880
only walk the diagonals diagonals on the ds light work but you have to push and hold it down if you're

354
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,120
trying to do a quick quarter circle in a fighting game they don't register i hate fighting games why

355
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,520
would i play one there you go because i'm not i'm not talking about what's better for fighting

356
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,760
games saying what's the what's the definitive gba experience and i'm saying if you play fighting

357
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,800
games it's better to get an sp than a ds light ergo the argument that it can play ds ergo that can

358
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,280
play gba games is invalid because it can't play them all effective tom just to be fair tom every

359
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,400
gameboy i've ever had the r and l button would like stop working yeah yep same same thing on the

360
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:13,120
ds though so that's that's that's that's just that's a nintendo problem no i let me okay let me just

361
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,000
say the ds can play five generations of pokemon tom how many generations of pokemon can you play

362
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,720
on your fucking sp fire red and leaf green the only ones that matter that's true that's all you

363
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,360
need all right let me let me make the business argument here okay here here's why the sp wins

364
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,360
in this one category it's because the sp was the first laptop i ever owned i would do all my i would

365
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,760
do all my business dealings on i have my spreadsheets and i would organize i'd flip it open on my lap

366
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,200
and i'd be typing on it uh you know on on a high powered business trip i was a fucking god of 80s

367
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,120
finance and business the sp was so i actually felt i felt like a business dude the sp was so

368
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,760
fucking cool like you had the gameboy advance original and it felt like a toy and then like

369
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,120
you graduated sp and you felt like a man because it was it was such a much more sophisticated

370
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,760
design it was sophisticated and it's not that we have to give credit to the sp i just like the

371
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,240
first handheld console with a backlight dude you know how much that saved my life yeah i know my god

372
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,800
i can't believe it took them that long to back you know jesus christ it's because and you could

373
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,520
plug it into the wall no more fucking batteries oh my god that was so important it saves my wallet

374
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,120
it saved my eyes it literally is the closest thing to god ever made by human genius okay well

375
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,120
while we should give it credit for being the first in those respective categories going back to it

376
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,160
now the backlight sucks on the sp and the yes is way better it has improved that's true i i want to

377
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,160
say that i still on the subject of feeling powerful when you're when you're having your high powered

378
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:44,240
laptop console i still feel intimidated by my fucking 3ds it's like i feel like it's too powerful

379
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,080
for me like like i need to like like handle it with with with velvet gloves like like like like

380
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,080
it's a delicate button of an atomic bomb and i could fuck i could fuck this up at any minute

381
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,840
like i don't deserve it i actually agree i actually agree ben and i think nintendo sort of

382
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,800
has tacitly admitted that in the way that they've made like the 2ds and they're just like yeah we

383
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,520
had the original 2ds this thing is too advanced for me to be enjoying myself with i know everyone

384
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,240
thinks it looks fucking stupid but the original 2ds is so much more comfortable to hold i believe

385
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,720
it takes a beating and keeps on taking doesn't give a fucking shit it is great and i love it

386
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,920
i mean okay so recently they came out with excel thing i want to get that that's what i was just

387
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,080
going to say so like okay now that it's been like fucking 20 years or whatever since like the original

388
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,640
ds came out they have finally or since the 3ds came out it seems like they finally like with their

389
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,040
very last iteration which no one's going to buy because everyone already owns two different versions

390
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,200
of it there's like it's you know some weird collection of letters and numbers at the end but

391
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,960
it's like the 2ds excel light or whatever it's like the biggest or whatever it's got two

392
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,320
thumbsticks in it it's got the huge screen it's got uh support for everything now that seems like

393
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,640
the defeat and it doesn't have that waste of space that was the 3d technology nobody cares about that

394
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,800
but it doesn't have what me and ben have and nobody else in the world has which is the capability

395
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:07,280
of plugging it into your computer yeah look at don't you go fucking high rollers over here

396
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,640
you goddamn right that is okay you know what i was gonna save this for later but i on that point

397
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,880
since you brought it up tom earlier sort of discounted the psp i do have to say though from a

398
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,800
from a sort of technical standpoint the psp has been the console that i have most i should i should

399
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,880
on the psp but honestly it like the games that came out on it were okay but the fact that you

400
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,280
could fucking put custom firmware on there and do whatever the fuck you wanted exactly was the

401
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,840
fucking tits the only thing that sucked is that sony constantly tried to like fucking cock

402
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,960
block you with that because every time you want to play the one good game it's like you're going to

403
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,960
upgrade new firmware it's going to break your fucking custom firmware what do you want to do

404
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,520
it's all right but the psp also gave me the ability to watch porn on a console for the first time

405
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,080
and i did that like a motherfucker that was my 3d is right right oh my god it was fucking nuts in

406
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:03,680
my fucking bed with that shit holy shit it was nuts but also just the psb turned me into elite

407
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,320
hacker man like i became a genius thanks to owning a psb it was it was from a technical

408
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,080
perspective and what it could be done with it it was super fucking cool you like for the first

409
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,680
time you bought like i got a four gig card and you just loaded games right on it and you didn't

410
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,320
have to dig around with the discs anymore you got rock hard you felt like it was incredible it was

411
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,240
it was so empowering and uh it would be i think the only point i want to make else about the psp

412
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,280
is that as like a long time sony guy you know playing like kingdom hearts and um uh you know

413
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,040
all the final fantasy games that were on sony shit like so there was a kingdom hearts game

414
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,720
i had to play it honestly there were two games that matter for the psb there's kingdom hearts

415
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,640
birth by sleep not that i even like that game but i had to play it as a kingdom hearts guy

416
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,320
and there was desidia final fantasy the most important game in my entire life that i played

417
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,440
more than anything else what's that another very important game on the psp that'd be metal gear

418
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,560
solid peacewalker peacewalker of course i love fucking peacewalker you know what was great about

419
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,560
peacewalker the bizarre fucked up control scheme on the psp and it i fucking loved it it worked it

420
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,320
did work it was even found a way to make that single analog not suck i was it was very impressive

421
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,640
you people you use the fucking like uh uh so you know you got the deep and on the left on the right

422
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,280
you've got the buttons instead of the normal scheme you use the buttons to like control the camera

423
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,120
in first person or something like that it was fucking bizarre uh but okay that's all i want to

424
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:29,040
say about the psb you know what i've always had a deep-seated hatred for the psp because much like

425
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,680
our friend hippo i'm a big fan of the ratchet and clink series and i bought and played every game

426
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,000
and then they announced hey guys the next one ratchet and clink size matters is a psb exclusive

427
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,680
and i said i played it fuck you well you see where you cried like a little bitch i instead bought a

428
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,560
my dad wanted me to buy all my own shit it's not my fucking job get a goddamn job let me take you

429
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:01,120
monkey when i was 10 in fourth grade and pokemon first came out and all of my god damn friends

430
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:07,840
had a game boy i was like mom please can i have a fucking game boy and she was like no i'm like

quarters i had a huge fucking cup full of like money i would do for chores quarters that i found

434
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,560
around the house quarters i'd find on the street and i saved up i think 80 out of the 100 i couldn't

435
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,000
even afford the game boy color so just going to get a game boy pocket because that was $20

436
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,320
cheaper i'm like i gotta cut my losses here so i save up the 80 fucking dollars and by some fucking

437
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,880
miracle there was a coupon that i found for like i think it was walmart that like you buy a game boy

438
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,360
you got one free game it's like oh i don't have to save the 30 so it's like all right i'm going

439
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,080
and i'm getting pokemon so i went i went to the store and my dad went with me and my dad

440
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,960
didn't know anything about games so i gave him the money so he could buy it and shit he bought the

441
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,280
game boy color instead which was fucking sick so i got the free upgrade but then i made i made i made

442
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,840
critical error and i was retarded because i was i was 10 and i was stupid because i went and talked

443
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,640
to the guy who was selling the games and i said i wanted pokemon for my free game and he was like

444
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,200
pokemon's really complicated i don't think you'd enjoy that game oh and he talked he talked to me

445
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,320
out of getting pokemon and it was the biggest mistake of my life because the game i got sucked

446
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,920
and then everyone and then my friend let me borrow pokemon and it was the best thing i ever played

447
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,480
in my goddamn life and i was like mom i need pokemon and she's like save up so i had to save up

448
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:46,880
again to get pokemon and then i did the shitty game was uh it was it was gex gex for game all right

449
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,480
all right and it was it was pretty bad uh because it with all the all the like humor that was from

450
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,120
the playstation one gone nothing in there uh so it fucking sucked but um so i got pokemon i became

451
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,560
the best we should find out who that employee was uh i i would i would absolutely assassinate him

452
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,720
without a second thought if i knew who let's go do it who does that to a little kid say it was it

453
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,720
was it was awful so i i got pokemon red i fucking dominated i was the best kid at school uh

454
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,360
wrecked train uh i didn't i i was so committed to game boy and handheld gaming that when the

455
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,000
pokemon band happened and they banned all the shit and they they literally rounded up all our

456
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,880
gameboys and put them in the principal's office when this band happened what the fuck and i was like

457
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,680
no so i went to the principal's office sat down they wonder why people shoot up schools and had a

458
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,920
discussion with the man for like half an hour through all of recess and convinced him to let

459
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,520
everyone have their gameboys back and for three weeks before someone else fucked it up again we

460
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,920
all had our gameboys and i was a hero but the fucking hero we did it go dude the tragic end to my

461
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,640
pokemon experience was i i was i was working this entire time to get the whole pokedex because of

462
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,720
course that's what you do and this was back when i actually had friends in real life which is a

463
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,440
phenomenon that has not since come back so i could actually trade be a link cable and get the the guys

464
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,080
that weren't in the game that you had to trade for the only one i needed was machamp and it was it was

465
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,720
the weekend i was going to get it on monday for my friend michael and so because he had the he had a

466
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,720
game i had a machoke and he needed gangar so we're going to do the trade and train it back was fine

467
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,760
uh so we went to the movies i don't remember we're going to see but i was playing my gameboy leveling

468
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,960
up my level 96 uh venus or and this is before the rare candycoats so i did that fucking like

469
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,840
legit to this day i remember leveling up till 96 by killing a level two pigi because i never

470
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:38,640
ran because running's for bitches so yeah so i i i was just playing the game on our way to the

471
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:46,000
movie and someone hits me and i dropped the gameboy turns off and then i turn the game turn it back

472
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,080
on the gameboy's fine but the cartridge has been destroyed and all of my files are gone

473
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,160
dude no like someone just like they were exing the movie they hit me like they ran into me

474
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,880
and it flew out of my hands and and it and it just the cartridge didn't survive the drop

475
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,040
god they fucking animate you god damn it everything it was the at least now we know why tom's depressed

476
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,360
dude i it's it's something you don't recover from and to this day i've never gotten all 150

477
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,000
because i don't have friends anymore and i can't trade so it's it's it's it's the worst it's the

478
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
worst fucking thing of all time um and and and pokémon has never been the same since a little

479
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,280
a little bit of the good news tom that day the the good news is you don't need friends to complete

480
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,680
the pokedex anymore you can do it uh as a lone suicidal boy so yeah but now it's like 800 people

481
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,360
and it's like that's true i don't want to catch 800 pokemon sheep over has a gameboy color with

482
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,920
pokemon blue so if you want to come over here we will fucking trade with you and get you your 150

483
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,880
dude i would honestly make like i if i'd sat down for a week and just like all right i'm doing it

484
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,960
i'm finally making it happen and just fucking did that it'd be the greatest accomplishment of my

485
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,600
life because that's a good idea to this day it's just once you move into the cargo van and we'll

486
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,320
do it i do yeah that'll it'll just dissipate the cloud of darkness that's been over you

487
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,320
that day is that treasure it's all it's all from that one day but yeah mom dad i don't need prozac

488
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:28,160
anymore i got 150 i don't need 150 milligrams of prozac i have 150 pokemon it's amazing okay

489
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,640
so of course everyone pokemon is like integral to to the the childhood you know

490
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,360
super console experience so did anybody play any of the older it's anyone have any fond memories

491
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,200
of the older consoles than that like ben and i had a super nintendo i had a second say good

492
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,760
genesis was my first console and the first game i ever played in my entire life was when i was in

493
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,000
first grade and we had like a game day at school like you bring in games you play it's the end of

494
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,360
the school year and i brought in like shoots and ladders because i was young and retarded

495
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,560
and oh and my friend brought in a gameboy with super mariland two six golden coins and let me

496
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,640
try below and my life changed forever it was like the big original gameboy and i was like holy

497
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,720
fucking shit this is literally magic i need to kill you and take this home with me and ever since

498
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,200
then it took me three years to get the gameboy finally because ever since then i wanted it and

499
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,000
it just ah it was the worst but i but it finally made happen my favorite my favorite old school

500
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,960
console is magic the gathering hey oh look at that yo fuck mate me and you mate me and you had we

501
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,520
started we started young with the fucking um and the nes the nes i remember when we got the

502
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,600
i think our uncle gave it to us and yes that's right that's right and i remember that i told i

503
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,600
said it was the greatest day of my life and i think i disturbed our parents by insisting

504
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,520
that the day i got this fucking game was the greatest day of my life our parents definitely

505
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,080
had a weird cloud over their heads when like they did we actually kind of fell out of video games

506
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:58,080
for a while but it was when i was given a gameboy pocket for christmas like a year or two after

507
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,200
that that was when it all came tumbling i'm sure my parents just like their hearts sank because i

508
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,120
had asked my parents to like buy me a new console back then like hey everyone's playing gameboys can

509
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,280
i have one they're like no no you don't need that that's that's not for you it's not good but then

510
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:18,160
one of my fucking uncle i think was uncle jake gave me a uh gameboy and i man our poor our poor

511
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,920
parents uh i i think i think i don't know about i mean i think i was like fucking obsessed like

512
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,160
all i ever wanted to do was play video games which i feel like is probably why our parents

513
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,720
develop like a bad feeling because i played too much what i do is i get up i'd get up before school

514
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,800
i'd start playing sonic 2 and then i'd leave the console on all day come home and just immediately

515
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,200
pick up and eventually there's like you're too obsessed we're taking it and like well now i have

516
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,520
literally no meaning to like being alive and but then i got the gameboy later and i got an n64

517
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:53,280
and that was that was some good times i remember one time i was like it was late and i was playing

518
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,160
i was playing donkey kong country 2 and i was like i fucking love this game i want to i would

519
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,800
just want to keep playing it and i think mom was like ban its bedtime you gotta go to bed and i was

520
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:10,080
like i want to stay i want to play video games and i think dad was like he was like no mom listen

521
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,800
he's a big kid he can do what he wants like if he wants to stay up all night and play this video

522
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,880
game let him let him pull an all nighter and i don't know if he was genuine i don't know if he

523
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,840
was genuinely trying to do something nice or if he was trying or if he was playing some weird

524
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,120
psychological manipulation games but the way it was offered made me feel like like guilty for like

525
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,480
wanting it in the first place so i was just like no never mind i'll go to bed that's interesting

526
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,120
but you know what that's kind of good like parents do a lot of like babying of their parents but to

527
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,440
like force you to make a decision like it's kind of making you mature i guess i don't know it seems

528
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,080
like a good thing i guess i guess i mean if he's really like guilty if he says it like oh no it's

529
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,520
not like your parents lives matter to you at all just do whatever you want no in hind no in hindsight

530
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,560
i think he was genuinely giving me the choice yeah well yeah i think that's good i think that's

531
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,800
kind of good like if you actually stay up and then you like are having a terrible time the next day

532
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,480
and you could just make the prayer like well you know you stay up maybe he maybe he wanted it to be a

533
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,120
learning moment i hope so i want to say my first video game experience because because i hope that

534
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,280
ben i hope you apologize to dad for not learning the lesson he attempted to teach you that fateful

535
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,680
day i know i groveled yes good it involves everyone's favorite resports enthusiast rocky

536
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,240
my first video game experience of all time okay so so i walk into second grade ballers

537
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,800
fuck and ready to fuck up some bitches hell yeah as as you do and then i then and then i see like

538
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,560
this like fucking kid in the back of head like everyone's like like crowded like crowded fucking

539
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,920

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,680
around just you know killing some rain cores and uh you know just remembering some ethnic minorities

542
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,640
and then i and then i like have them so i'm like guys guys what is this what's happening

543
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,200
and then he turns around to me and he smiles wisely ever heard of video games

544
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,720

570
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,120
and when after school every day i would just go to a rocky house and i would beat the shit out of

571
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,680
an brawl because even though i i was a spun mashing he was shit and i was down be his

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:59,600
curvy every single day of my life and i was right down be his curvy that's undefeatable yeah

573
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,920
literally literally impossibly and yeah after i beat him every single time he would like cute

574
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,200
like like like like right before i like star katom he would just like reset the matching

575
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,880
but like that didn't know and then yeah i was just warming up bro i have fun memories of resetting

576
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:19,520
brawl matches uh at the moment of truth yeah i was like being fucking blasted away on my

577
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:28,000
did not fucking count we're doing it again yeah i i always loved in in smash like you know that

578
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,680
weird combination of buttons you have to push in order to reset the match you have to push

579
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,960
like 10 fucking buttons at once i always really like that i was fun yeah i loved it so like when

580
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,240
you like like like you always know that moment you always know that moment when you're like

581
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,400
winning the other person's game really fucking mad and then like yeah like as soon as you like

582
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,560
hit them and you know that hits about to kill and they pause even before you match actually as you

583
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:54,400
know oh shit they're doing it and then you hear that all those fucking like 10 thousand

584
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:01,040
buttons yeah no yeah fucking and then it's over no contest it's objectively true you guys are equal

585
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:07,360
in skill there's no delta between these people yeah oh thank you announcer thank you and then you

586
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,240
would always smile wisely and you and you would know that that that your sheer intellect has gone

587
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,800
as your hand shake with the with the tremendous effort you had to press to push all those fucking

588
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,520
buttons at once as ever your soul fucking leaves your body this year effort of restaying that

589
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:27,040
fucking game i'm not going to play smash anymore that's their game i'm not going to fight them

590
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:38,000
i'm going to fuck them i proceed to unplug everyone else's controller of course that madman

591
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:47,600
uh uh yeah okay guys guys we've been talking a lot of shit here is it time to get down to brass

592
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:54,240
tax time to get down to brass tax we've got to address at least a little bit uh stationary consoles

593
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,720
non-mobile the play station is the best console of all time is it is it just going to be the ps2

594
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,720
are we all going to agree it's the ps2 you know what from objectively the best yeah ps2 is probably

595
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,240
the best i'm you know i think i think for me i have a real soft spot for the super nintendo i think

596
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,920
my favorite childhood memories are with the super nintendo so i don't know if anything will ever

597
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,000
top that for me fucking mario rpg secretive mana the greatest the greatest times you're about the

598
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,480
remake of secretive mana that's coming they're making a 3d remake of secretive mana oh god this

599
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:31,120
fucking just gag me just gag me i know i know we'll see i'll report back i we should mention this

600
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,440
too briefly before we get into that whole thing what console did you guys grow up with

601
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,040
because i only had nintendo con i only had a gang cube a we and then an sp and then a ds

602
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,920
well well we me and me and nate a year ago me and nate started with the nes and we upgraded to

603
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,520
super nintendo but then but then we diverged because final fantasy was on play station so we

604
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,280
had to switch so we so we switched to be in sony boy's final fantasy path yeah we follow final

605
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,920
fantasy's trajectory through through every twist and turn that it took mm-hmm yeah although there

606
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,840
was a we at some point we didn't return to where i could get my hands on because most of the time

607
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,640
i either had to give up a birthday slot for a console or i had to pay for of course my own money

608
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,360
so uh living living birthday to birthday was how this is how this operation that's how it worked

609
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,760
you had to you had to you had to plan it strategically i have i have a great story of one of my

610
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,200
birthday when i got an xbox for the first time because i was just like me and my friends were

611
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,640
getting big into halo and halo two was just about to drop and okay so halo two came out

612
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:32,160
november 9th 2004 and i remember this because my birthday is november 8th so on the 8th i get

613
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,520
the money to buy an xbox so i go into game stop i'm like i need an xbox he's like getting ready

614
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,680
for halo two i'm like fuck yeah dude and the guy just looks at me he like looks he looks around the

615
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,480
there's nobody in the store except for me and him for some reason because it's a small game

616
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:50,880
so if he looks on the story he's like do you want to touch it i'm like what he's like and then he

617
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,520
goes he goes in right he goes to the back store brings out a huge stack of halo two copies that

618
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:01,280
oh and he just holds it out and i get to like hold it the day before it comes out and he's like

619
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,040
oh my god it's like dude you're gonna come back tomorrow and get it i'm like ah it was so fucking

620
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,280
cool but yeah i got that was gonna give him a hand job so you could have it early uh you know

621
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,040
he was trying to get you back there you know he he tried but but he was close but you know

622
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,560
my my my my desire to to make sweet love to my new xbox console was more powerful yeah than my

623
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:27,600
desire to please him sexually so you could you could have made it work you could have made it work

624
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:33,360
that's all yeah that's true i was young a relationship is a two-way street tom it takes work god damn

625
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:39,280
you have to work out of this i had a date with the master chief that night um yeah incidentally

626
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,080
my my greatest gaming uh triumph of all time was playing the greatest game of all time final

627
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,640
fancy ducidia for psb like a full like it was like christmas night or like christmas eve or

628
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,400
something i was at me and ben's house or our family home and i had just fucking created a pandora's

629
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,560
battery by sawing through my fucking battery pack for my psb i remember that hack it was nuts i had

630
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:06,320
all my shit laid out i was a fucking wizard i was i was running a thousand bots and fucking linux and

631
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:13,280
all kinds of i have no idea what you're talking about it doesn't matter the point is i was in

632
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:18,240
high level hacker mode uh so the the point i'm trying to get to is just that i i there was a

633
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:24,720
it was a release of the iso for ducidia like seven days before it went live in japan in japan

634
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,320
not even in america it took like another year for it to come out here and i was fucking playing it

635
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,720
on christmas eve a snow fell around and i was literally little finger looking out the world

636
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,720
and i'm like i just made you my fucking bitch i run this shit i controlled this world was getting

637
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,320
psp isos before they came out in america like i remember playing like the bleach game that came

638
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,480
out like two years before it even got like a chapter in america like that was some cool shit

639
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,560
oh it was great and then eventually once i got into the uh the the ds like uh what do you call

640
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,720
ace card just like yeah i have one for gba and for ds it was so fucking for gb legit yeah those

641
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,120
were fantastic again that was the best in playing like metal slug and like all these games are

642
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,000
harder to find i could never i could i always wanted to play yig drew union for gba and it was

643
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,240
like a turn based with like this super fucking sick art style but it never worked on my car and i was

644
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,800
always pissed to this day i still haven't played it i should buy it someday see that that's kind of

645
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,760
the point that i'm getting to right now so the greatest the greatest console ever made is i'm

646
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,720
going to go with the ds light just because it's my favorite ds and it is it has everything to do

647
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,880
with the fucking hacking scene so like did you play wake one on ds i i did not i don't

648
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,000
know i don't play so they remade the original quake for pc on ds with mouse aiming with like

649
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,440
the touchscreen and it had multiplayer multiplayer it was the coolest fucking wireless multiplayer

650
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,920
holy shit it was awesome the reason it was so cool is because uh we had this kid who was like two

651
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,680
years older than us that go went to our school i think his name was paul gibbler or something and

652
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,520
he was like a super hacker man so he put quake on all the pcs for like two years wake all the time

653
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,360
and no one knew how to stop it then eventually they hired someone to get rid of it and like the

654
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,400
exact same time quake came out on ds so we're like fuck you we're still playing quake anyway

655
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,200
bitch that's perfect and it was either that or mario kart ds in the middle of class and they couldn't

656
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,040
stop you because they're just wireless now so it wasn't link cables oh man it was so there were

657
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,520
there were some heroes at my school who installed civilization on like every computer they could

658
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,840
get their hands on oh my god like everyone to be playing civilization in like library class or

659
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:29,440
whatever the fuck it was but yeah i mean i i uh the hacking thing psp stuff got me into the scene

660
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:36,000
but it was the ds like the library of the ds is incredible it's so many incredible games and the

661
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,720
fact that you have access to the um to like the gba library once they expanded that capability

662
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,200
and you could run those two oh it was the fucking best did you have i have it right here i have it

663
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,800
right here and i play that shit all the time with all these my ds it's sitting right over there too

664
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:54,560
did you have the um right i got i got the flash card that i had it had uh the card itself and then

665
00:57:54,560 --> 00:58:00,080
it had a gba slot too so you could play gba roms off the ds slot it just like did a pass through

666
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,280
and then it was flush to the system because you know how would like i did not have that yeah with

667
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,920
the light the games the gba game stuck out because it made it smaller but this one was flush like the

668
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,720
regularist like filler cart they put in by default but it still ran all the gba games so i had like

669
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,640
both of them going at the same time and i was a fucking god that's dope it was super fucking cool

670
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:22,240
but i mean the whole thing is like i'm sitting here like like preaching like the gospel of gba

671
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,680
but but like it's like there's like a fraction of a percent between gba ps2 and ds they're all

672
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:33,440
like like so fucking like unstoppable in their own in their own class like it's just uh it's hard

673
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,720
to pick you know gba definitely was like the one that i had like the most fond memories of because

674
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,560
it's like i don't know i think it's because like that was when i had the most money and time for

675
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,760
games so i had tons of gba games and i just like i played them constantly in class like i may play i

676
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,920
loved metroid fusion that was the first metroid ever played and i had no idea what to expect me too

677
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,680
i fucking love that game dude incredible it's so good it was because like i played nintendo games

678
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:03,120
i wasn't in super metroid people shit on fucking metroid fusion metroid fusion is better than super

679
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,840
metroid god damn you metroid fusion is the best metroid because like it's a crafted narrative

680
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:13,200
experience all right thank you nobody understands that crafted experience day i'm waiting for

681
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,160

that like so some guy who know like the director of that game whatever said like yeah guys just so

687
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,880

691
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,960

695
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,240
we all know what i'm talking about and they they fucking black hold her panties and the new one

696
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:35,040
it's a disgrace i hate this fucking god damn it it makes me so fucking mad how could they do that

697
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,880
like okay the fact of the matter is kids uh and and parents at home like sex is real it is real

698
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,600
women are real you can't just like pretend that it's not there and like how are kids supposed to

699
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,720
fucking find out that sex is real if you just like put black holes over vaginas everywhere

700
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,040
they just have that's how actually how does blacking out a pair of panties make kids think

701
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:00,560
that sex isn't real where are you getting this you know where i'm getting it from okay i'm saying

702
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:04,560
that's the attitude that these people are approaching these kind of decisions from it's like they want

703
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:10,640
to just block out the whole concept of like even a vagina from the minds of children i guess male

704
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:16,080
children but also the penis for every one game panty peaches panty should be the main focus and

705
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,840
she should be the only thing she's fucking wearing i mean i mean they should be there all right

706
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,560
they're they're real she wears a dress god damn it let's not let's not run from the fact that

707
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,640
where you win a dress and you do a badass high kick you're showing everyone your panties that's

708
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,600
real i agree i agree but i i agree that it shouldn't have been censored but not on the grounds that

709
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,600
we need more sex in our video game is on the ground that it should not lie to people i don't think

710
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:42,320
a parent that's seeing panties should be inherently sexual okay but but it's it's the idea that like

711
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,440
they're replaced with this black hole like like they're they're covering it up you know like

712
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,920
they're ashamed of it and i just i'm like why why you know fucking deal like uh couldn't they just

713
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,160
added more ruffles or something could he's added more ruffles underneath there that's a more creative

714
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,400
solution that i would be more in favor of i i probably wouldn't love it but it's better and

715
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,640
like palutena like you can just see palutena's panties because like her dress doesn't really

716
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,400
allow to make like a black hole so it's okay it's okay for her but not for peach what the fuck

717
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,600
oh it's okay for a fucking uh what's his name sakurai yeah sakurai's waifu palutena gets to

718
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:16,880
show her panties to everybody but peach doesn't that's bullshit do you like how sakurai waifu

719
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,200
has has like a stripper taunt you like that yeah she literally has a stripper pole taunt

720
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,400
okay fucking sakurai get the fuck out you're done son you're you're all wrapped up uh oh but

721
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,120
okay nobody has mentioned i really i did want to give a strong shout out to the ps one the

722
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,480
fucking ps one that made me yeah the console i ever got for free no strings attached and it was

723
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:42,080
the greatest day the ps two the ps two is only objectively the best because it's riding on the

724
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,920
backs of the on the back of the ps one yeah because you can play ps one games on it all my

725
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,800
favorite games from the ps one yeah there you go there you go and uh the ps two only wins by

726
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:56,320
revolution of the disc the disc in the ps one was a big fucking deal you know and it should be

727
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:02,080
celebrated as such and the concept of the memory cards which i love memory cards are dope um and

728
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,880
come on we all know the okay let's just let's just address this right now the aesthetic it's the

729
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:13,440
aesthetic of popping between discs in the ps one is like the most enjoyable experience of any

730
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,160
it felt like you got way more game for your money even though it it's question yeah that's

731
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,800
even true like like when i got the first game i got for my ps one was final fantasy nine and when

732
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:29,440
it was four discs long i felt like a i know i know there is so much here how am i ever gonna get

733
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,080
through all of this it was the best feeling of all time to have like four discs all at once isn't

734
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:38,080
it great isn't it great the square edicts uh instead they make the base game and then they

735
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,800
basically sell you the other three discs as that dlc packs later i love modern video games

736
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,760
point out i commented on this on that video this morning but i was like i i the comment i just said

737
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,760
was uh i i forgot that metal gear solid two was actually metal gear solid three because remember

738
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:00,000
mgs one came on two discs that was great that's a brilliant point on my on my new video yeah

739
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,000
it just so you people know what the fuck we're talking about i made a video about like people

740
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,240
are actually making a claim that the final fantasy seven remake because square enix has said

741
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,480
they're splitting it into individual parts that are like individual game experiences these are

742
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,920
their words because of that it's the same as final fantasy original because it has three discs

743
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,760
like this is a real watch my video it's yes it was a period in the world um yeah so the fuck

744
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,320
yeah ps one uh i think i might honestly give it to the ps one is my favorite console i think i think

745
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:35,840
the ps two is like the best but it's got final fantasy seven eight and nine how can you argue with

746
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:41,840
that lineup it's it's it's a legend of groon chrono cross don't say the big cross was so fucking

747
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:48,240
good chrono cross sure yeah i love chrono cross it had it had that awesome remake of chrono trigger

748
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,280
two that's yeah you're absolutely that was in the final fantasy collection fantasy anthology

749
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,640
whatever it was anthology it had four and it had chrono trigger in it i just i just emulated

750
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:03,760
this very morning before this uh the the ghost in the shell ps one game which has some of the

751
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,880
best fucking animation it is the manga of ghost in the shell come to life like it literally never

752
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,680
has in any other medium it's actually super fun loved it really liked it yeah it was really fun

753
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:20,560
ps animation is the best game of all time with realville everybody loves thrillville it's super

754
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:25,120
fun uh playstation playstation only there was a if only there was a let's player that i loved who

755
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:30,480
was who was like doing videos about thrillville right now while he's drunk off his ass and doesn't

756
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,520

757
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,160
i'm sorry bend i play playstation one had vandal hearts and vanguard bandits to

761
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:06,080
lincoln park and just let me go back just let me go back to the good old days of 15 year old me

762
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:14,560
uh the good good times okay uh any yeah go on much what do you say i i i haven't had much to

763
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:20,160
say about this because the only games i ever played on the ds or sorry the ps ps2 were my cousin's

764
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:25,520
game so i just you know walked over to his house uh well you know every once in a while and he would

765
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:30,880
like uh everyone go to sleep and he was like you want to see what a real video game is and you

766
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:36,960
would pop in like like grand theft auto or like oh some of the most tedious games of all time i was

767
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,680
like i was so paranoid about that shit like i remember i had i had a copy of uh the original

768
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,560
grand theft auto for ps1 and it was the first m rated game i ever snuck into the house my parents

769
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:51,280
like i fucked that shit and i was so paranoid i actually like took the the manual out of the game

770
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:58,480
case i cut out a t rating from an ad from an ad and pasted it onto the front so no one could tell

771
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,600
that it was rated m and just just in case i happened to leave it out no one would be the wiser

772
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:08,880
nate i was thinking with your head nate i might be misremembering this but didn't our dad like

773
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:15,360
take uh uh grand theft auto san andreas from you let me let me tell you the tale yeah i was just

774
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:22,800
an adult i i want to say i was literally 18 i think at this time okay but the idea was i was

775
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,720
in his house you know you know what no i wasn't 18 i was i was like 60 this was in high school

776
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,640
sometimes okay maybe you were like maybe i think maybe you were like 16 and he said i'll give it

777
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,600
back to you when you're 18 and then just never did well to be fair i never called the question

778
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:42,320
when i was 18 but when i was in my 20s you know my my early 20s god i'm in 27 out oh god okay uh

779
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,600
uh uh uh what the fuck was i just i totally lost my train of thought because i want to die

780
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:51,600
san andreas oh right when i was 20 something like he finally gave it back he was just like

781
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,520
looking through his sock drawer and i was like hey nate i found this didn't i steal this from you

782
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:00,960
here you go and then why did he take it from you what what was his reasoning that he gave okay i

783
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,720
honestly think that the real reason that he did it was because i think we had had a conversation

784
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,640
about how he doesn't want those sorts of video games in his house and then like i just did it

785
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,280
without like checking with him like he just he watched it on me playing it sometime and uh i'm

786
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,320
sure all this contributed to my deep uh just like hatred of having other people around when i play

787
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:22,400
video games it freaks me the fuck out i have to do it in secrecy it's like it's like a secret

788
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,760
eater only i'm a secret game player no one can witness my my sin dude i feel the same way i feel

789
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:33,040
like vaguely embarrassed whenever anyone knows i'm playing video games it's like oh no the shame

790
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:38,720
you fucked us up you fucked us up dad uh oh but i did want to give my dad credits because one day

791
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:43,040
i brought home uh devil may cry one and i was really excited play because i thought it was really

792
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:48,800
cool and i was like oh no is dad gonna be okay with this but what i did was i said dad i got this

793
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:53,600
game devil may cry one i was hoping that you could just like you know i don't want to do the shit i

794
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,280
did with san andreus could you just you know is this cool with you he's like all right nate tell

795
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:01,440
you what let me play it and i'll get back to you and i was well okay and i was a little worried

796
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:06,240
because it's kind of a violent game anyway i came back after a little while he said date i played

797
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:11,600
this it's kind of fun uh it seems seems fun seems appropriate so you know whatever go for it

798
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,760
weird our dad played some devil may cry one had a little fun that game was fucking great

799
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:21,360
it is a great game absolutely that was my first ps2 i can i cannot imagine dad playing devil may

800
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:27,040
cry that is like the weirdest thing i can ever even conceive of it is a bit weird you know one time

801
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:32,160
ben watching don't take it fucking stabbed by by what's her face in the first cut scene yeah

802
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:37,520
you just like this seems appropriate yeah holy shit what the what the fuck i don't know man i

803
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,360
guess he he just thought it wasn't that i honestly think it was more of the fact that he felt like

804
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,680
like i had gone behind his back and like betrayed him in some way so he had like forbidden or something

805
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:51,920
so i get that but uh remember ben when dad came up to us and was like hey guys uh i so you've got

806
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,880
grand theft no it wasn't grand i see you've got a gta now fuck what's that gta grant tourism that's

807
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,960
the where i'm looking for you've got grant tourism over your playstation i like cars uh would you

808
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,480
mind if i played that sometime you know i'm not gonna like kick you off or anything and ben was

809
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:10,640
like no this is our game console you're not allowed to play our video games defend yourself ben

810
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,000
that is not okay i don't okay i remember that happening but i remember that me and dad were

811
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
like we were like in the midst of an art like there was some shit going down that made me mad

812
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:26,640
him about that and and yeah i remember he i sort of remember that happening if dad had just come

813
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,320
up to me in good faith and been like hey you've got a video game i'd like to play of course i would

814
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,360
have fucking let him but it wasn't that simple if we were there was there was some fucking context

815
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,280
to it that i don't remember but yeah i remember getting mad at him i remember getting no i think

816
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,880
i got mad at him because like he went and like played it like he played it without asking or

817
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,360
something i don't know like i don't think he came up and asked me i think he he just like told me

818
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:52,000
that he had gone and like played like my like our ps2 because we bought it like he had played on our

819
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,320
ps2 without without and i was mad about that i guess i sort of get that i don't know whatever uh i don't

820
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:04,880
i don't remember the typical ben hiding behind the the defense of context like a fucking coward oh

821
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:11,920
it's we've been saying context matters oh it's that it's mattering game way so as the result of

822
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,720
this podcast that the ds light is the best handheld and the ps2 is the best console i think so

823
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,920
super nintendo super nintendo is the best console we all agree of course did you did make wanted to

824
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,040
make sure that i mentioned he he is with me on gba being best console that's true did you would have

825
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:31,200
been here i think to say that he's a gba guy for life so i was listening what does hippo say

826
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:37,040
oh that's a good that's a good i also want to throw in that um i don't i never really got into

827
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,600
handhelds i never really enjoyed handheld gaming as much as uh the rest of y'all seem to it just

828
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,440
just felt it just felt like such an ephemeral experience in comparison like such a crack addict

829
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,800
my weird thing is that like when i got into a franchise i had to have it on me constantly so

830
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,120
if there was like a handheld version of something i played on ps2 i had to have it just so i could

831
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:59,840
have it on me at all times like a fucking like comfort item it was really weird and and honestly

832
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,240
you know i think that shame about people seeing me play video games might be why because playing

833
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:08,480
video games in public feels wrong and bad to me all right bet you got you listen to me listen to

834
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,880
me on this point this is this is the real deal all right here oh by the way gibb says that he

835
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:18,000
loves the ds but he thinks he's leaning towards gba himself so he's on the other ally and sounds

836
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,280
like he's leaning towards gba okay but here's the deal ben about handheld consoles every i don't

837
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,440
actually play handheld consoles like out in the world even back in the day i you know i'd play

838
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:32,960
pokemon stuff but that wasn't the main joy of it the main joy of it was being maximizing my

839
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:39,200
comfort when i play that's what it's all about so and that's why the espy changed the game because

840
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,120
i plug it in i would plug it in i would sit in my bed put a bunch of pillows behind me i could

841
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:49,600
lean back in 100 maximum comfort have the backlight on and just play literally forever this is this

842
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,440
is like important beyond words being able to i'm telling you the console experience cannot compare

843
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,400
to the handheld in this kind of situation or i'm just way too poor to afford like a god tier

844
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:05,440
chair that would that would come close to everyone's got a bed not everybody has a fancy chair you

845
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:10,560
know the bed experience like even when i had like a semi decent chair like like my my shoulders

846
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,800
eventually get tired sit like because they're you're on sit on like down and like crane your

847
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,480
neck down and like lean forward and shit even if you have like a good chair i've got a great chair

848
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,480
that i'm sitting in right now and i'm telling you i much prefer you can get tucked in your

849
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:27,840
fucking blankets in your pj's in your bed have a fucking cup of tea if you want it's the maximum

850
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,560
comfy experience it's the best experience which is why i haven't mentioned till now because i wanted

851
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,760
to bring the hammer down because there is an additional console that bridges this fucking

852
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:44,320
interdimensional gap between the console and the handheld it's the switch the fucking switch is

853
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:49,200
the greatest console ever fucking made it doesn't have enough games yet it doesn't have enough games

854
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,600
yet but in terms of comfort i've got it right here i just pick it up it charges all the time

855
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:58,480
i pick it up it's got this huge screen the buttons are tactile and great it's got all the yeah

856
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,760
let me know when the switch gets fucking thrillville then come calling

857
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,840
i will i listen i played i played uh zelda on it which was good then i played shovel knighted

858
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,760
which i rebought and have beaten that game basically 100 percent that game was fucking

859
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,400
great to replay on the switch i'm playing sonic mania right now it's fantastic on this thing i

860
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:22,560
play it in my bed comfy as fuck you can't beat it this is where this is where the future of the

861
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:27,840
human race is going in the direction of comfiness in bed with the fucking switch at the end of this

862
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,640
podcast nate will get a knock on his door and shigeru Miyamoto will be there draped in a black

863
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:42,320
kingdom hearts cloak and he will shadily hand him an envelope full of money here's my opinion on the

864
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:53,200
subject the only two video game consoles you should ever own is the pc the lace nintendo

865
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:58,960
console and then of course the dslite just okay but on that on that point can we just say fuck you

866
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,440
nintendo for like being so exclusive with their shit and protect like like what is their defense

867
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,200
for not just being like on board with the pc it's just so they can get more sales they can push

868
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,800
hardware you know yeah absolutely well i mean that's different and we've completely neglected

869
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,200
we've completely neglected to discuss the pc's viability as a gaming console which i will swear

870
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:20,880
by i don't need any i don't understand why at this point if anyone if anyone is is ignoring pc for

871
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,440
modern consoles i think you're retarded because a modern console is just a pc worse like there's

872
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,480
no reason not to and not to mention though the pc is basically better at old games too because you

873
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,760
can fucking emulate anything in the world so it's got literally everything you can't beat it it's

874
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,720
incredible and it just blows everything else out of the water for me the only reason to even have

875
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:45,120
like the handheld part is just because because i just don't feel right when i'm playing pokemon

876
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,960
on like the computer i just don't feel like i want to have that experience like having to be on a

877
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,800
time screen and having to bring it around that's the one deal right there like that's why i

878
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,760
prefer playing on my switch versus on my fucking computer because i can't fucking get comfy in my

879
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,240
bed and play my fucking computer but i can on my switch which is why all right the switch is like

880
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:07,520
the only device i need to smile i'm gonna bring up one of the best like the best like marriage of

881
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,480
this that you've probably never heard of because it just came out a little while ago it's called

882
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:17,840
is it like a steam box or whatever have you heard of the gpd win no no so it is it is a a pc

883
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:24,480
that is the size of a 3ds that runs like old games and shit because it just runs windows so

884
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,240
anything you can emulate on a pc that's like not like super graphically demanding if you just run

885
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:33,360
right on this it has like dual analog and face buttons and little keyboard built in holy christ

886
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:39,120
and it just you just that's whatever you want on it and it's it's fucking it's pretty legit i will

887
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:45,840
say that uh as i've i've i've grown up with mostly pc after you know doing the whole handheld

888
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,800
nintendo phase i should also briefly mention uh just before i get into that is that i also did

889
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:58,240
this like slipped my mind i also did have an xbox 360 and a ps1 however the ps1 uh my mom got me

890
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:03,600
by accident thinking i want to get a ps2 for my cousin had it she got me a ps1 and she got me rayman

891
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,320
and i just could not get past the literal first jump and i cried and that was also the first time

892
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,000
i discovered i don't like the way baloney tastes after thinking that i liked baloney for a long

893
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,480
time oh no experience then i was just like i don't want this anymore and then i i think i like threw

894
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,960
it away or maybe like i gave it to someone uh and i just didn't like it and also for the 360

895
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:28,560
the literal only game i played was the simpsons game and lego star wars you and your fucking lego

896
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:37,200
star wars yeah that's the sound of mini kick makes when you pick it up by the simpsons game

897
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:42,160
do you mean simpsons road rage no i mean the simpsons game the simpsons that's the 3d one right

898
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:47,680
oh um right right that's yeah could you play as like literally every character yeah well you can

899
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,600
play as all the main family and then it has like a fucking like we like met a narrative like home

900
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,920
stuck plot it's great uh incredible yeah simpsons road rage is amazing yeah well it is i also play

901
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:04,000
that on the ps2 anyway uh so fucking back to what i was saying about pc uh just to like like a comment

902
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:10,640
again on when like i want in tune to go to bcbs if splatoon allow me to play with a mouse and keyboard

903
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:17,920
it would literally be my favorite game of all time splatoon is so fucking great i love splatoon

904
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,520
it's the fact that splatoon lacks local multiplayer is like the saddest thing it's it's a travesty

905
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:28,640
it's a travesty for sure that's all to say that keyboard and mouse is probably like my favorite

906
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,360
like way to play a video game other than of course you know the handheld yes people get so

907
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,080
fucking high and mighty about game pads i fucking love keyboard and mouse i will play any game on a

908
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,160
keyboard because it's the right tool for the right job there are certain games that will play way better

909
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:47,280
with mouse and keyboard and there's some play better with games some games like n64 games don't

910
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:51,520
really work that well with the keyboard but like like almost anything else like anything that isn't

911
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,080
joystick dependent i beat hollow night just the other day uh and i basically a hundred percent of

912
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:01,440
it and um like i i at first i was playing on the keyboard and it was okay but then as soon as i

913
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,440
plug in my ps4 and i get my input map or shit and i get it run on there like that's just how it's

914
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:10,240
meant to be played you know that's i think my best accomplishment ever with the keyboard control was

915
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:16,640
when i was in college i didn't have a 360 and devil may cry four came out oh shit it was i

916
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:24,400
literally i had this shitty laptop so i played devil may cry four on my laptop at 640 by 480

917
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:30,240
resolution and it wouldn't stretch so i played on a little five inch square 640 by 480 on my laptop

918
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:36,480
screen with keyboard and beat the whole game and i felt like a god because it's so fucking hard

919
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:41,920
but i played with wasd and like four other buttons and beat the entire game of devil may cry four

920
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:48,800
and i was just like yep incredible i'm the best person who ever lived your video game has shooting

921
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:57,120
or aiming in it do not and put it on a console any console it has to be on a pc the other day

922
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:02,560
i i went to a fucking i went to a friend's house and he had fucking overwatch disgusting on his

923
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:08,080
fucking uh i can't imagine playing on on game and i tried to play with a game pad and it was the

924
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:13,200
worst experience in my entire even right now like i love halo like halo one and halo two i have such

925
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:17,360
good memories of that playing on an xbox but i'm playing right now spv three which is like a

926
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:23,920
a fan made remake of halo one on pc and it's so much better with mouse and keyboard like like

927
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,800
worlds better you just cannot do first person shooters or you know third person you cannot do

928
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:34,960
any of that on a game pad it just does not have the precision that you need to play those games

929
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:41,200
it just does not fucking work it's literally horrible i have no idea how it's lasted this long

930
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:46,640
you have to play a first person shooter look it's all the fucking norm they ruin everything they ruin

931
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:52,560
games they ruin control inputs it's before but think about before like like the end of the ps2

932
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,600
and like xbox live and shit all the shooters like we're on pc only like counter strike and fucking

933
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,040
all that shit that was where the shooter then fucking halo two came along and

934
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:07,200
normalized fucking online shooting and now we have this fucking huge scene where like analog is what

935
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:11,200
they build these games for so even when you get them on pc they have like aim assist and stuff

936
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:17,120
that you have to go in and disable oh yeah to take it to the to the meta point on on that like this

937
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:23,200
idea of like making games to like include the most people are like to make it playable for enough

938
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,520
people like like just the idea of putting a i don't know fucking call of duty on a console as opposed to

939
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:32,800
pc and just like casually it down like you're you're not making the tightest best possible game you

940
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,600
can make in that pace in that in that way you're just making one that like more people can buy

941
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:43,520
and uh don't care for it can i say i just just that call of duty is like my not even i don't even

942
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,520
like dislike call of duty playing it like it's fun like mindless kind of pop it's like watching a

943
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,240
popcorn movie but a game i enjoy it what i found really fucking disgusting is just like how like

944
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:57,920
how blatantly corporate that series is now that when like the ps4 came out and it started selling

945
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,800
better they immediately switched sides from xbox to ps4 is like oh there's a bigger install base

946
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,920
now so now they're gonna get the timed exclusives and it's just like gross you know you know i'm

947
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,160
with you and you know what else fucking pisses me off sports games that come out once a year

948
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:18,480
like who the fuck does anyone buy these fucking yeah my cousin my old roommate cub

949
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:24,320
yeah he buys every fucking mad game why explain that to me i i try to ask him and he says oh but

950
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:32,240
they updated with the new characters just fucking download it download it characters you want the new

951
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:37,280
because every year you have to ask for the players or whatever yeah that's such a great excuse to

952
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:44,160
like what does it need like how is the game any different or better it's like because you can pretend

953
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,720
that you're your favorite fucking six foot four that's the whole thing it's like people who play

954
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:53,520
those games are into like sports in general so like they want it to mirror what they're watching on tv

955
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,320
at the time and that's how they make ten billion dollars i don't get it and why can't that be downloadable

956
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:03,200
content for like a dollar why do you need a new 60 dollar game i mean because ea this is what ea

957
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:08,400
does they just want to milk the market as hard as i mean they bought they bought exclusive licenses

958
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:14,880
to all those like actual that's why like you know uh nfl 2k and i'll like sega had their 2k line that

959
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:20,000
was going on for a while like they bought the rights to using the nfl ea did so like sega's like

960
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,160
well i guess we can't make these games anymore and they just stopped yeah exactly they fucking

961
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:31,200
monopolize them shit it's fucking gross fucking um by the way i ea is probably from right here one

962
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:35,040
of the worst game companies but i can't be too hard on them because every single day i would open

963
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:39,520
up my xbox 360 which which i also sold later when i realized i was done with the simpson's game

964
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,320
but every single time i'd open it up for the simpson's game we'd go ea it's in the game

965
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:51,120
ea sports it's in the game i remember i remember that i'm gonna see the funny home of simpson

966
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,920
i remember that from i remember that for there was a sports game i really love it was blades of

967
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:02,080
steel on the nes the hockey game it was the shit yeah that was i like i like ea you you could you

968
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:06,560
could fucking fight you could have there you could you could get into a little a little like sparring

969
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,480
match between players and you would have to like time your button presses or some shit and like

970
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:14,640
fucking punch each other it was a win and that was like that was the only part of the game that

971
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:19,760
was actually worth playing but it was so worth it tom was blitz the one where like you break somebody's

972
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:25,200
bones and you can see the x-ray of it um i think they made another one later that did that i was

973
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:30,240
that might have been like that might have been nfl the league might have been the one that was

974
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:34,480
called i forget but the nfl blitz was like it was like an arcade it was made by midway it was like

975
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,360
an arcade version of football so like the downs were like 30 yards instead of 10 and like you could

976
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:44,640
throw like a fucking like halfway across the map and shit it was like super arcadey it was like

977
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:51,600
nbh it's not a map it's a fucking stage exactly it's they're both appropriate they're fine it's a

978
01:24:51,600 --> 01:25:01,280
board it's a board guys clear that board uh tom brady i'm sorry all my gaming terms came from my

979
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:05,360
friend devin who played counter strike 1.6 religiously so everything's a map because i just

980
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:10,480
i still i've ever heard growing up sure yeah fucking do us too i all day every day hey i love

981
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:15,440
that okay i i want to present a nightmare scenario for you people that will leave you like you know

982
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:27,600
shaking up into crying at night imagine you were forced to play a video game oh god what controller

983
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:35,520
do you use game here's past the controller bro giant spider for ps2 ps2 dual shock i

984
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,480
my favorite is still the xbox 360 controller i like the offset dual analog i have big hands

985
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:45,920
so i play on ps2 with dual analog my thumb is always hit each other so uh yeah i definitely go for

986
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:52,160
the the classic playstation dual analog ps2 style okay i need that's what i used to play pokemon

987
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:57,840
like in all my nuzlocs i plug in my ps2 controller into my computer and play it on that i use my i use

988
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,240
my ps4 just because it connects easier for some reason but yeah it works just fine okay so we've

989
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,040
been talking forever and i figure we're probably have to move on to question some point but i

990
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:09,120
figured we could close this out with something we've been arguing about what's the best console

991
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:15,600
what's the worst college ship but can we all agree that the worst console is your smartphone

992
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,720
like playing games on that is is by far the worst thing of all time like there are some

993
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:25,840
decent games that are designed for touchscreen are you a magic harp jump is the fucking pinnacle

994
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,720
of modern gaming i was swear by it you're not you're not letting me finish my point like anyone

995
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:35,200
like the game loft games where it's like you have the analog sticks on the screen and cover up half

996
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:40,480
of it yeah oh that is literally the most retarded i've never i think they can that's acceptable

997
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:45,600
i've never tried to play such a game it sounds horrifying it's the worst it's the worst thing ever

998
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,640
the read the official remake of the ascensors arcade game i used to play all the time i wanted

999
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:54,000
desperately play the arcade game but i couldn't because i only because i was a little baby

1000
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,040
i said i could only play it on my on my fucking smartphone it was the worst of my life because

1001
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:04,480
the buttons were just on the screen and it was just like overlay yeah the overlay was just on top of

1002
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,480
the graphics and i just could not see half the i tried i tried like an emulator or something on

1003
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:13,600
my phone but that's how it worked like this it's unacceptable it's unacceptable it doesn't if i can

1004
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:19,840
speak up in favor of it funny colors i and i emulate gameboy advance on my phone and pokemon

1005
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:24,720
and yugioh like it's perfect for that fine it's a game gameboy color works really well too because

1006
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:29,360
like yeah this it's a square screen so it sits at the top and the buttons are under it and right

1007
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,480
that's just like yeah it's perfect so if you're playing like dragon quest three or dragon quest

1008
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:38,000
monsters or pokemon like that's fine play well i'll also say totally i hate i have tried that too

1009
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,240
and i hate like the the way that you have you know using the buttons on a touchscreen like they're

1010
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,720
way less tactile and like enjoyable to use than if you had it on like you know a controller and

1011
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:51,840
shit so it's worse in that way for sure i think that's the definition of not being tactile in fact

1012
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,640
i think you're correct which is why i think it only works for like a turn-based thing like yugioh

1013
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:01,520
or pokemon right like if i try to play mega man battle that work it would suck really fucking fun i

1014
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,440
don't know if you play that game at all mom game they have specifically for phones they like they

1015
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:11,520
stripped it down a little bit your your decks like 30 cards instead of 40 or max at 60 and there's only

1016
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:16,160
three rows instead of five rows so like matches go really fast but it's super fun can i get marsh

1017
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:21,280
mullen and lava golem that's all i need i have no idea because they they start they basically

1018
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,880
started at like the first couple sets and they're adding it as it goes on so they're kind of like

1019
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,880
ramping up the the the meta of the game as it goes i haven't played it in months so they're

1020
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,200
probably like way more sets now and i probably stuck but that was really fun good way to play

1021
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:39,200
you go on the go my favorite mobile game is grub hub it has really good game i think that's

1022
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:42,640
it's good it has a lot of things to offer is that the thing that you just get food with

1023
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:48,400
yeah no it's yeah i mean it's a great game i mean yeah it's it's like a virtual sim of you

1024
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:54,560
ordering food i know i hate i hate i hate grub hub grub hub has unethical game design it has that

1025
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,040
it has that skinner box that addiction it's aesthetics do not fit its gameplay

1026
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:05,360
whatsoever the microtransactions on grub hub are just ridiculous what's your favorite map on grub hub

1027
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,560
my house a dust two by by far

1028
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,880
for me it's either uh it's either dust two or pizza those are my two oh wait my favorite uh

1029
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:22,080
grub hub map is uh it's blood gulch which is what i call the path from my table to my toilet

1030
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:31,360
hey we got some questions on patreon let's let's check them all right everybody we're switching

1031
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:36,160
over we're going to the patreon remember people if you want to get your questions fast tracked go

1032
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:40,320
become a patron and then you'll be in the chat and you can ask questions when we fucking ask for them

1033
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:45,360
how many times have i just started to say the donkey kong country theme song this like this podcast

1034
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:54,000
and then just stop after hey i didn't know that's what that was also uh yeah and the the url people

1035
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,560
no patreon.com slash the procrastinators that's the one okay all right what do we got what do we got

1036
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,880
what food have you eaten the most out throughout your entire life anything related to

1037
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:09,200
carnivoreism or meat i eat meat by far the most that's a category so i guess i don't know uh

1038
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:16,320
chicken nuggets it's just chicken nuggets i eat 20 chicken nuggets a day every day of my life

1039
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:20,320
well is that true that that comes into it's been true ever since i moved to north carolina

1040
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:26,880
this comes into an important definition because if you order 20 chicken nuggets but then you also

1041
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,280
order one steak technically you're gonna be eating more chicken nuggets than just that sick even though

1042
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:36,160
you get the same amount of like actual food in you so by that logic you would of course get more

1043
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:41,200
chicken nuggets even if you just eat the normal amount of like an order of by by that logic the

1044
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:45,440
food i've eaten the most of is nerds because every time i eat nerds i eat like 50 000 of them

1045
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,160
that's true that's true they're gaming the system they're all right i guess

1046
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,720
the other day i was i highly i highly recommend going to dairy queen and handing them a box of

1047
01:30:54,720 --> 01:31:00,480
nerds and saying make me a blizzard but put these in it instead do they do that one one time i got

1048
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:05,440
them to do it for me it was sick i was curious to see if the candy i liked as a kid was still good

1049
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:09,520
and i bought an airhead and i bought a ring pop and i had to throw them away because they were

1050
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,640
just disgusting oh my god this is the most important thing i will ever ask any of you

1051
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:18,080
this will be the last time i ever speak to any of you i'm gonna leave after this question

1052
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:25,760
do okay do any of you live near like a mining town or any sort of like old like frontier s cowboy

1053
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:33,280
situation do any of you definitely not yes i do okay okay well only paint you a rich tapestry of my

1054
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:40,160
daily life on the range as they say so uh i live next to like an old mine town whatever i go there

1055
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:44,000
there would always be like you know some like tourists looking like gift shop and in such a

1056
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,960
gift shop there would be the most magical food i've ever encountered in my entire life it would be

1057
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:54,720
in the candy section and it would be just the sack this like old time like like like cartoon

1058
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:58,720
sack and it was like you know like like with the money like the mice have won it but it would say

1059
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:04,240
gold like pure gold and you would buy it for like maybe like like like for like two dollars and you

1060
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:10,640
would open it up and there would be bits and pieces of yellow gum that they were shaped like

1061
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:15,440
gold nuggets and you would just pour that entire bag of bits into your fucking mouth

1062
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:20,000
and chew it all like the fucking slut you are and you would drown yourself in that delicious

1063
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,760
fucking i think i've actually seen these before but i've never tried them you have to live in a

1064
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,600
mining town to get this candy i i think so but well that is until that is until the other day

1088
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:54,800

1089
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,880
to be nice that's why people are assholes they can smell that weakness that's true you got you

1090
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:03,520
got to cut you got to cut them before they cut you you've got a hashtag chat it up my dude you

1091
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:08,640
got to chat it up jazz it up you have to realize that by standing for something you inherently

1092
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,920
stand against something else as well and those people come for you so you have to tell them the

1093
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:17,440
fuck off that is true that is true um yeah i guess just uh don't be a pussy all right there you go

1094
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:23,360
that's the advice someone asked a retired question uh okay who's the strongest person a fusion of

1095
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:28,640
monkey hey read their name they just have credit get read their oh sorry sorry orca um in the pcp

1096
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:33,280
patreon lounge okay if you too would like to be culvin started go pledge a dollar

1097
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:39,760
this is important monkey who is the person that like if me and you fused together who's the strongest

1098
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:45,360
person he could be anybody you're already the most powerful being in the universe so like i don't

1099
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:49,520
even know why i'm involved in that that's true you just make him weaker don't you think because

1100
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,720
yeah i'll just bring him down he would make him try to kill himself suicidal tendencies right and if

1101
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:59,840
once he dies the whole world dies the the way i see it it's a lot it's a it's not like like you

1102
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,880
know autocracy versus order you don't like like yin and yang and sort of like uh like like like like

1103
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:09,840
you know honor versus love and stuff like that so if you used to gather like like all all of my

1104
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:14,000
inhibitors that like lessen my power than you know like i i try and you know i i try and remain

1105
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,880
honor bound by not having sex and you know right uh you know all i do is have sex so we'll

1106
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:24,480
belt exactly yeah i'm picturing sort of like munchie is like the eva unit one and then if i

1107
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:29,040
fused it with with munchie like the the armor that actually holds within the creature back

1108
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:33,920
from destroying the whole world would come bursting forth and yeah it would be uh it would be the

1109
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:39,520
end times for sure i think we need to come up with a list first of all i want to say any sort of

1110

1112
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:53,680
we get rid of them for their sins uh nila grass tyson first one to go because oh yeah right not

1113
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:57,280
because of any other reasons not because you know he's an asshole literally just because he's black

1114
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:02,800
that's because he's black of course he's the only black person i can think of

1115
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:11,200
and uh yeah that's it that that's the end of our list hey here's a question on twitter from

1116
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:16,960
at commander incest sounds like my kind of guy he says if you were to make a frankenstein monster

1117
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,880
out of the pcp members what parts would you use and why you'd have to use my iron cock that would

1118
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,600
be uh you'd have to use my you'd have to use my heart my heart to give us a strong moral center

1119
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,600
to remain powerful in this world yeah that's that's good so we've got the cock in the heart

1120
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,120
whose brain do we use in this situation we gotta use mage's brain otherwise it's gonna be all

1121
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:39,920
fucked or else we'll be misogynists yeah we need mage's females no matter what they have to use

1122
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:45,840
my lungs my lungs have to be involved so that's true so they can clip the microphone with every breath

1123
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:54,480
yeah this beam will be more powerful than anything else i've ever made it's gonna be my life it's

1124
01:37:54,960 --> 01:38:00,240
it's gotta have hippo's hair yeah hippo's gotta have my funny bones so that nobody thinks it's funny

1125
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:05,440
that's a good idea that's a good idea uh well let's just give it tom's skeletal structure in

1126
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,520
general so that we're tall and intimidating against the world you know that sounds good

1127
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:22,080
the best thing you can think of about tom is that he's tall is well physically we can also take

1128
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:30,720
his uh his hatch you know his brony curious hat in addition to your ironclad cock can we add on

1129
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:38,560
digi's phymosis foreskin of course that's the only part that's the only part for digi we take

1130
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,040
is his foreskin well that's what he would want us to take it's what they should have taken when he

1131
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:50,240
was born he's been looking for an excuse to get rid of it and his flesh golem is the perfect reason

1132
01:38:52,240 --> 01:39:02,240
uh yeah incredible incredible one this this batch of patrons are not are not doing it for me yeah

01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:31,600
my favorite podcast of all time go to armital.com well that sounds more like a nightmare than yeah

1139
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:36,800
yeah yeah i was recording arm retrieval and then roxy along walked to my room and i was like oh that's

1140
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:42,800
a first that's the best dreams have sex with me roxy i love you uh and and then i was like i was

1141
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:48,880
reread i was i was rereading act six today roxy i don't you you didn't live up to what i remember i

1142
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,240
don't i don't know if you're my favorite character you're out of my favorite characters anymore

1143
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:55,520
i think you need to leave my household and i don't think you're welcome here anymore

1144
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,080
and then uh and i and i shoot her away and and that was that was the end of my dream it was a nightmare

1145
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:07,440
you're out of the pcp you don't disrespect roxy even dream for him

1146
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,920
yeah dude what if that was like actually real roxy because you were in the dream bubble and you

1147
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:21,280
bumped into actual roxy in your dream bubble oh the sex could be real for me oh it could be real

1148
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:25,680
if it was in a dream that makes it that's how it works that's that's how it works in homestuck

1149
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:31,360
technically i do something uh what do we got hey okay bunchy this one's for you i'm sure i don't

1150
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:39,360
know if anyone else at leo j larkin asks if you had to pick a pre 19th century military to serve in

1151
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:45,680
which would you choose and why uh i love this question i love when did the nazis start

1152
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,800
a little bit after that unfortunately yeah a while after that um i would want to be a

1153
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:55,440
persian slave soldier for sure because that's just the most powerful aesthetic that there is

1154
01:40:55,440 --> 01:41:00,320
somewhat similarly i i would go on i would go on g hods all the time i would be an ottoman empire

1155
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:04,400
fucking you know that's not a bad choice i would be one of those i would be one of those christians

1156
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:08,960
that um like like like they just like stole from one of their puppet states and they just like

1157
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,560
they're like okay you're our slave now like constantine or something one of those guys

1158
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,320
yeah yeah yeah and then remember you're a soldier you're not the emperor you're a soldier in the

1159
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:21,120
military in this example yeah yeah yeah okay so so yeah i'm just uh i'm just going to oh wait did

1160
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:25,280
it say command no no no i well i mean you could you could let's say you could put in command if you

1161
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:29,040
want but you're still a soldier he just doesn't deserve it so yeah i would just be like a fucking

1162
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:34,240
janissary and i just ride around in my cool ass fucking uh horse and just beat the shit out of any uh

1163
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:39,760
unwilling people whine you know i would just force my willum upon like my whim upon uh everyone
