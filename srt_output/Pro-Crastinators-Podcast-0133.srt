1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,640
Alright guys, I'm just gonna level you through right now on this episode of The Pro Crastinators

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,800
Podcast. Real fucking tuck, got shit on by a bird yesterday. This isn't a joke, I actually

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,320
got shit on by a bird yesterday. And that's the tone we're gonna start for this episode

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,320
of the PCP. Are you talking about, are you talking about, are you talking about a bird?

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,240
Uh, yeah, cause there was, you know, I'm a fifties guy and these fucking birds, these

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,440
fucking dames are shitin' on me. Tell me I got a small cock and a fat head. I don't,

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't appreciate this making mockery effect that I had literal animal feces on me yesterday.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
Tom, have you ever gotten shit by a bird? Uh, uh, yeah, uh, no. My car gets shit on

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,640
by birds all the time, cause I have to park it right under the, the, the, the, the electric

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,840
wire thing, the fucking high tension wire shit that's right going by the house. So it's

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,240
just constantly covered in bird shit and I can't, can't compete. It's too much. I'm

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,120
buried on shit. Mage, I don't know if they even have birds, let alone shit in Lithuania.

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,840
Have you even know what those two things are? Of course we have pigeons. No, no, no, no,

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,320
they were all wiped out in the war. Yeah. I mean, we're talking about real birds. Like

15
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,520
if any bird were to survive any wars, I feel pigeons would be the ones. That's true. That's

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,240
why you wiped them out intentionally. You couldn't have them surviving. I had, I had

17
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,080
almost been shot on by a pigeon almost. I thankfully dodged it, but like without even

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,640
meaning to. I have been literally shot on by a bird in the past. It has happened to me

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,880
and I know the trauma. I understand this pain. Well, okay. I was actually, yeah, it was actually

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,880
a very, like a learning experience for me. It was more informative than any trip to the

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,400
museum I've ever taken because I learned at least in my, I know that both hippo and I

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,680
guess you need to have both been shot by a bird. What's the cartoon? I imagine from watching

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,960
cartoons, it would be almost sort of like a, like a, like a white sauce, Italian like cheese

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,800
sort of like splattering on me. It would be sort of like a chunky white sort of black,

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,080
like splattering of paint ask material. But for me, um, it was like, it was like a, it

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,720
was an object. Like I, I, I, something dropped in my head and it kind of bounced off and

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,040
I looked down and I thought, Oh, look, what a weird looking berry. And then I looked up

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,880
to see what kind of tree was under and then I realized I just saw a pigeon ass and I was

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,160
like, wait a second. And then I touched that in my head and there was like an already dry

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,800
like white substance, like a white, like, like, I guess I would describe like a thin

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,680
layer of almost felt like it was like a, a white off, you know, it almost felt like it

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,520
was like a dry white off. Oh, that's my experience. Is this all the way is the way it is? Or is

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,200
there the splatter? I think it was just a sick bird. I think it was just a sick bird. I don't

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,760
know. Like that does not sound like normal. I remembered being a little more gloopy, I guess.

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,520
I don't know. If you look on, if you look at the, I got, I got a bunch of bird shit on my car

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,080
at the moment. It's like, it's black and white shit. It's a little bit smeared. So it's, it was

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,440
like mostly hard, but with goop enough to stick it to the fucking side of the car, I guess. That's

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,040
what I remember being like, more or less, more liquidy. Yeah. I was doing fucking 50 quick

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,480
catches in a row. I was getting shiny cinequilla. I got a 100% cinequilla and I was riding high.

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,480
I was euphoric in that moment. Nothing could defeat me. Nothing could even pierce my skin,

41
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,480
let alone my bone. And then this bird, this fucking sick ass bird came along and he shit on me.

42
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,600
He shit all over me. I didn't check any of the stats in my cinequilla, but I did catch four

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,400
shinies, which I will be giving away to Gib Mage and Michelle because that's what I do. And then

44
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,720
keeping the best one for myself, of course. Oh, it's good. It was good. I, I'm so ready

45
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,480
for Radcon 4 so I can get there before Hippo so I can give you all Mr. Mimes for a cheaper price.

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,960
So he'll be coming out of the satisfaction of giving you guys a Mr. Mime. That poor man. Poor bastard.

47
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
So what else is going on people? Who's got, who's got things to bring to the table? I've got one.

48
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,880
I've got one. Well, I should lead by example. I think I will. Thanks. So, so where was, oh yeah,

49
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,280
so here's what I want to talk about. So I recently put out a new video on the channel Best Guy Ever.

50
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,320
Maybe you've heard of it. And it was my, it was my technically fourth, really the third reel

51
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,960
of my like smash videos. And this one was, this one was Simon Belmont called Sign of the Cross.

52
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,720
And as I was making it for over a month, working on it basically every day for several

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,360
hours, probably put 100 hours into that video. Because I had to do research. I had to play some

54
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,840
of the games. I had to learn things and grow as a human being in order to be ready to produce

55
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,120
this thing for the world. Also, it was just way longer than the others. I was just thinking about

56
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,280
the concept of cost benefit analysis for how much time I've put in. So it's already the least

57
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,200
popular of my smash videos, including the Isabel one, which was a literal shitpost meme, not real

58
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,280
video. I feel like your entire career could be described as meditations on cost benefit analysis.

59
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,480
That's really the running theme from the creation of you as a baby. That's correct. That's correct.

60
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,160
And I, here's what I've noticed. This happened to we Agua. It happened to my like bigger editing

61
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,880
videos, though those started off like the current ones were already huge projects. And now with the

62
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,320
Ridley videos, like the smash confirmed is what I'm calling them. Like the Ridley one was the

63
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,200
shortest. Then there was, then the K-roll one was bigger than the Isabel one. I mean, it was

64
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,960
different, but it was the longest, I guess. That one doesn't count, I guess. And now this one's

65
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,840
over 10 minutes long, and I can't monetize it. And the fucking people who did monetize it,

66
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,400
because I'm using a copyrighted song, put an ad in the middle of the video that interrupts the flow

67
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,320
of the fucking video. It's a musical video. Please don't do that. But they did. So that's

68
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:30,480
unfortunate. But it's, everything I'm doing as I work forward, I end up committing more time to

69
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,240
individual things. And I'm getting, I wouldn't say less return on it, but there's kind of diminishing

70
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,320
returns for more effort. And I'm feeling that in a big way. This is your Cardinalism. This is your

71
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:49,680
Cardinalism that you continually do. Is that you keep, you keep getting away from the plot of

72
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,680
YouTube. Like you got to, you got, the whole point of doing Viagra was to escape this, this

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,720
low effort content that constantly claims you. And you keep crawling back to it. You keep going

74
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,480
back and like, no, I have to make these masterpiece videos. And I understand the, the inner artists

75
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,680
that you wanted to create something beautiful and God tier and like the greatest thing of all time.

76
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,440
I get that like the inner Starfleet and you wants to do this. However, we don't live in Starfleet.

77
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,120
We live in a cold, capitalistic, evil society where none of that shit matters and you're fucking

78
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,200
yourself over and it's terrible. I'm over here watching your, your, your, your fall from grace

79
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,000
and it pains me to no end. It's not a fall from grace guy. No, it is. You had good momentum going.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Things were great. You had these weekly videos. People loved it. You shot yourself in the foot.

81
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,040
I understand, but you need to make a product. But you know what it really is? This is the main

82
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,360
problem. It's that, and what you said is true, Tom, but I was thinking about it and I'd phrase it

83
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,360
like this. It's that once I had the idea to make the Simon video and I knew what song, you know,

84
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,240
Sign of the Cross, Iron Maiden, it's a great song and whatever just seemed like the perfect fit.

85
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,480
Once I knew I was going to do that and I had committed myself mentally, the idea of changing

86
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,120
or like modifying or scaling down the vision I had in my head was, was, there was, I like,

87
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,280
rejected physically. I can't do that because that's, that's like ruining something that exists in my

88
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,760
head and to not make it real. I get that. Nate, Nate, you had struck. I get that hardcore.

89
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,320
But, but here's what I say. Nate, you had struck.

90
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,720
God much, God much, yeah. You had struck such fucking hard, unbelievable gold with the fact

91
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:43,280
that your fans literally enjoyed Weagua. There's so many YouTube creators who are like, all right,

92
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,640
I'm going to switch away from the videos I actually like to make weekly garbage that no one actually

93
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,400
cares about. And then they lose other subscribers and everyone thinks that they're a fucking hack

94
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,320
fraud. But your Weagua videos, everyone fucking claims for it. Everyone adores Weagua. Everyone

95
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,160
loves the logo because it's the only reason why anyone would watch that show. They love the logo.

96
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,120
They want the t-shirts, of course. That's true. Everyone loves it. And then you're like, actually,

97
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,480
you know what, weekly content, it's not all it's cracked up to be. I'm going to go back to

98
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:17,040
releasing every six months, every blue moon. Listen, just do some various smoke signals and maybe

99
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,320
I'll come to the scene and make a video or two. Yeah, okay. I think there's a sweet spot to hit.

100
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,880
One is that, and I think Weagua, sorry, Mia Maffova did do this. There was enough branding

101
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,440
with Mia Maffova that people were excited for the next one because you hear the little jingle

102
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,240
every time I say Mia Maffova. There's the cool intro song. And that, I think, appealed to people.

103
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,720
Yeah, that's one of the tellers of Primal Brand. And then also the content, I think, was varied

104
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,000
enough. Yeah. And then the other thing is, I think it was different enough day to day that that kept

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,440
things fresh for people. So I don't know. I think a sweet spot like that is a good balance.

106
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,240
Here's what confuses me to no end. If you're spending... By the way, guys, I didn't want to

107
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,400
just talk about me. So I'm happy to hear a point. I just, it wasn't my point to just be like...

108
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,160
But this is what I've not understood, right? You said you, how long did this Simon video take you?

109
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,960
A month to do, you said? Over a month. Probably a month and a half. Here's my question. If it's

110
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,640
going to take you over a month to get this video done, why not say instead of a month, it's going

111
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,720
to take me five weeks? And I'll spend a couple hours of that time making a Weagua instead. And

112
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,400
then you shit out a Weagua. In the meantime, nobody can... People like them, so you're doing both.

113
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,880
If these long projects are going to take forever, what's another week if you spend a week's worth

114
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,440
of time making the weekly content on like the Thursday and Friday? That makes sense, Tom.

115
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,560
Reasonable question. The thing is a Weagua actually takes me a full week or more to get done. Then

116
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,280
you're even doing Weagua wrong. Stop it. I agree. I am doing it wrong because Weagua also had like

117
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,640
feature creep where it just got longer and longer and I added more. I don't know why I did that.

118
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,000
Nobody cares. I don't want it to be that way. No one needed all the giant sections that was not

119
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,880
necessary. Have I told you about my dream video site that I want to exist? Maybe, but tell us again.

120
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,720
My dream video uploading site would be a site where anybody can upload anything they want,

121
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,760
but your account can only upload one video a week. So it forces you to not waste your slot.

122
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,320
Do something good every week. You instantly cut out 99% of YouTube's bullshit. You're not going

123
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,920
to waste your one slot on a reaction vlog to something that's retarded. I'm going to waste

124
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,800
my week on a drama thing that happened because you're either going to waste your slot for your

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,960
actual content that week and if you wait until next week to respond to it, it's already water

126
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,800
under the bridge. It goes back to television. The one good thing about television is that things

127
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,000
were paced and there was meaty content every week because you'd have your one one hour episode

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,640
a week and that's what I want. I want a website like that where everybody is just like... It really

129
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,120
is. It's all about the platform for sure. Oh, Meij, do you want to comment? Tell me,

130
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,000
you talked about this before at some point, right? I don't know if it was on the show or just when

131
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,120
we were in a call, like in a meeting or something. I remember tweeting about it, but this is something

132
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,720
that when I'm smart, I will make and it will exist. I am rooting for you, Tom. Sounds like a good idea.

133
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,360
It's a cool idea because, yeah, I don't know. A lot of people might have a reaction to that. We're

134
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,080
like, eh, why do you want to, I don't know, like curtail the freedom of people to just upload anything?

135
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,400
And it's like, well, okay, you've got YouTube for that. And maybe I'm speaking to literally nobody

136
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,880
right now, but anybody who might have that reaction. I mean, my thought process behind that would be,

137
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,960
it's kind of like Vine. Vine, well, why can't I upload longer in six seconds? Because that's the

138
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,880
culture of Vine. The culture of this site would be like, you focus on making a good, depth piece

139
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,080
of content and you get one shot to do it a week. Yeah. And maybe there could be something like,

140
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,040
you know what's a shame? It's a shame that YouTube got rid of the ranking out of five stars or

141
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,760
whatever and put the thumbs up and thumbs down. Maybe you could do something where the videos

142
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,120
that are promoted are based, like you put back the zero out or one to five stars or whatever,

143
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,760
and then like the highest, you know, ranked videos. But then here's the thing, and this is

144
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,800
maybe slightly controversial, but it's that people don't know what's actually good and they'll upvote

145
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,960
like, you know, meme posts or like, you know, conserve a cuck, blown the fuck out or libtard

146
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,080
destroyed. And it's like, this is fine and all. But like then, then just the tribes are the ones

147
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,080
who dictate as opposed to some like mythical idea of actually the highest quality content. I mean,

148
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,600
I don't know. I'm just, is there, how can we fight this? You can also have like a, I don't know,

149
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,360
like staff picks or something. So something you think is good. Like, yeah. And I'm the only staff

150
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,200
member. So I get to decide what's good. All right. Bestsiteever.com. It's happening. Hey, there you

151
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,120
go. That's good. You could bring back blams from Newgrounds so you could delete shit that is bad.

152
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,680
What's a blam? A blam is, forgive me if I'm wrong, DeVue. But to my understanding, a blam is when

153
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,920
a work on Newgrounds gets enough, I think a zero star or one star radians, then it is literally

154
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,560
deleted from the website because it is shit. Jesus Christ. That's hardcore. That seems heavily

155
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,040
abusable. But cool. Now you have a good community. It's all about having a community that isn't full

156
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,240
of shit. But you know, with today's, today's, I don't know, fucking mob mentality shit. That is

157
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,120
true. That's just, I mean, I mean, that's just the community of the world is like that. No,

158
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,400
all right, I guess I shouldn't be in the world. I can only speak for America. But that's how,

159
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,920
that's how it is when you walk outside. It's not just a left to right thing. It's everything's

160
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:51,120
black and white. There's no fucking granular scale for literally any piece of, of aspect of society.

161
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,240
Life itself is thumbs up for thumbs down. That's what we've learned. Yeah. You know what I think it

162
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,320
is. You know, I think the cause is I think, so basically, I guess I think that like, so whatever,

163
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,880
far left people and far right people and everybody in between have always existed. And those people

164
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,200
have different, like, what's the word? They have, they have different foundational principles, whereas

165
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,480
like a lot of like more libertarian right wing people value freedom and stuff as like the highest

166
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,800
virtue. And then people on the left value like protection and safety, neither of which is wrong,

167
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,800
but is a big difference. And because they have those different values, like they come to very

168
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,440
different conclusions. Sorry, say again, liberals, the ones for freedom and the other ones for

169
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,040
the definition of liberal. Yes, was originally about freedom. But I should say left wing,

170
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
I guess, as opposed to liberal. But okay, that aside, the value judge difference is all I'm

171
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,320
saying. And I just think that because of social media, like, like in the old days, like you'd

172
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,880
have in the same town, like the guy who runs the coffee shop, let's say he's the biggest right

173
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,840
wing MAGA motherfucker who ever existed. And then like his clientele, who live on the other side

174
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,080
of the town, but come to him for his great coffee, are like, I don't know, hardcore, lib, cuck, you

175
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,960
know, I don't know, anarchy, guys inside, but the thing is, they never would have the breeze.

176
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,280
Well, the thing, well, hang on, the thing, it's just that I think now that like, we have Twitter,

177
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,120
now those people might follow each other. And maybe that coffee shop owner is going to tweet

178
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,160
how much he loves Donald Trump's thick cock. And the, the, you know, patron will see that and be

179
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,360
like, Oh, now I know this person has wrong think, and I can hate them and do that. And I just think

180
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,880
that like our access to each other's thoughts via social media has made the world a very hostile

181
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,560
place where like these ideas are able to like recognize each other as enemies and clash like

182
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,640
a lot. For sure. That's definitely part of it. But I mean, I mean, people have always talked about

183
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,680
their feelings before. I'm sure if they, if those more to the forefront is all, you know,

184
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,520
what else it is, in person, I think people are way more charitable to each other than like the

185
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:02,000
straw man we can make of each other online. What I was saying, guys, it's also because of the

186
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,320
internet, we gain the ability to access people with the same mindset as we are. So the people that

187
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,960
used to be, you know, quite literally the minority, let's say, or with the very far leaning ideas,

188
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,800
they're able to find people much like them and group up and do bigger things.

189
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,520
Yeah. So you're less exposed to different ideas. It's, you know, we're just describing what is it

190
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:31,280
like forming tribes, basically, that's oldest time. It's what happens. Politics is a real world

191
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,600
manifestation of basically a clash of philosophies. And like, like I said, for like personal values.

192
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,120
So which is why I'd always rather say, you know, like my whatever, man, I'm no fucking saint. I

193
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,760
fuck this shit up. I say political stuff to everybody does. But it would be best I know of

194
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,520
myself to just only argue like, hey, guys, my chief virtues are number one is freedom. Number two is

195
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,280
safety and like protection. And then, you know, respect after that, etc. What are your values,

196
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,440
fellow Americans, fellow human beings? And if someone is a different rank, we can be like, oh,

197
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,840
okay, why do you think we disagree on that friend? Let you know, we all care about people. Let's

198
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,280
have a civil debate about this or something. But no, it's like fuck Donald Trump, fuck Hillary,

199
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,480
which is just I think a lot of it is the fact that when you have these philosophies tied into

200
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,920
a campaign, which you can win slash lose, it turns into like a game that you have to like,

201
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,280
you have to convince other people to vote for your candidate. So they are like, you know,

202
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,880
it's very firmly against it. You're like, well, you're going to make me lose in this video game.

203
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:45,600
What the fuck, dude? That's true. Politics is I mean, it's just any any candidate ever has

204
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,360
massive flaws, single transportable vote. Yeah, let's get single transferable vote at the very

205
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,040
least we need that shit Bernie to be present right now, if that had happened, which I don't even know

206
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,280
if I'd want, but it's probably better than what we have now. Yeah. Yeah, it's because like, I don't

207
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,000
know. As soon as you make politics about choosing a real world person to whatever, you know, like

208
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,760
everyone on the left will find everything wrong with everyone on the right and that candidate,

209
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,040
which is understandable. They can do that. The you know, people on the other side will do the

210
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,480
exact same thing about their candidate because we're human beings. Oh, we just need a perfect

211
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,560
AI with no moral failings to manage this shit or something. Civil system now, civil system 2020.

212
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,160
Yeah, yeah, let's elect. Could we could probably literally elect an AI as president who says it's

213
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,040
not a person? I say it is. I think a computer would literally do a better job if it's like

214
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,240
perfectly logical. It's just that people eventually get tired of perfect logic and they want they

215
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,080
want some good old, you know, anger, emotion, human is logical. We're all emotional retarded

216
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,880
creatures. And it's true. It's true. We're just playing at intelligence, but we don't really

217
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,120
think a lot of it isn't like logic, you know, if you were to listen to like a like a like a

218
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,480
intelligent Democrat or Republican or you know, liberal conservative, explain their position.

219
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,600
It's obviously to a large extent logical because these people aren't intentionally doing retarded

220
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,040
things. So it's not just a method of like, okay, this person is being illogical. They want this

221
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,120
or they want that. It's just a difference of what they value and can what you value?

222
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,440
Because what does a computer decide when you say it's, you know, whatever freedom versus

223
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,920
protection? Like there is no objective answer as to which is the priority value. And so

224
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,880
that's why there will always be a debate because there will be a disagreement there. And you can

225
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,120
tell a computer, which to say is more important, but the other people will still disagree and

226
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,400
consider it injustice probably. So there's no solution. So we're all wasting our time. It's

227
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,960
never going to be fixed. All we can do is invent Star Trek technology so we can just bypass all

228
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,880
these questions and say, look, you'll never die. You're free to do whatever the fuck you want.

229
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,200
You've got infinite food. Shut the fuck up and take care of yourself. You're fine. And everyone

230
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,280
can go in their little caves. And you know, that that'll be that. That's like a goblin,

231
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,160
which I was watching today. So man, guys, bird shit, sir gets on everything, don't it?

232
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,120
It sure does, Brandon. It sure does. I heard that somewhere in some cultures or whatever,

233
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,920
it's considered good luck to be shot on by a bird. Well, those cultures are stupid.

234
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,400
Well, that's surprising. I just got back from Boston. I was there for, I think, the fourth,

235
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,920
fifth time. Anyway, I live there now, not with my physical body, but with my spirit, with my mind.

236
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:43,520
Right now, as I talk to you physically, using my vessel of meat, I'm spiritually plain tennis

237
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:50,800
with with upstart aristocrats in neighboring suburban white folk towns surrounding the West

238
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,160
East area. You came back from Boston. It's getting pretty chilly out in the Northeast

239
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,440
these days. How do you how do you like the weather change as opposed to sunny California?

240
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,080
I must have talked about this somewhere because this is a firm belief I have.

241
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:16,880
Fuck California's weather. I hate it. I hate the sun. I hate the heat. I hate the humidity.

242
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,120
I hate all of that. Granted, Massachusetts actually gets pretty hot during the summer

243
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,840
and pretty humid, but the winter. Oh my God. When I get to fucking put on my iPod, the Scott

244
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,600
pilgrim, the game soundtrack, I get to put on another winter, the first track, and I get to run

245
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,840
down the fucking streets as it's snowing. It's fucking negative to outside. Maybe it's even

246
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,240
raining. Everyone looks pissed off and upset. I've just got the biggest grin on my face walking

247
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,680
around feeling so at home because I'm so fucking fat that I would overheat in California. But now

248
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,040
I can subsist with my fat disgusting bulbous body here in Massachusetts, and it doesn't even affect

249
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,400
me whatsoever. It's magnificent. It's beautiful. It's the only way I want to live my life. I literally

250
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,040
enjoy overcast weather. I hate the sun. I want everything to be dreary and cloudy all the time

251
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,640
because that's fucking, first of all, that's comfy. Second of all, that's like happiness from

252
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,800
adversity. Art from adversity. Sure, maybe on the surface it's sad, but you can make it happy if

253
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,160
you do good things, stuff like that. Is there some study that seeing seasons change increases

254
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,360
happiness or something? I thought there was something like that. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know.

255
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,000
That doesn't sound true. It gives you a marker for how the years judge, because when I'm in here

256
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,480
in San Diego, fucking, I look outside and every single day it's fucking, oh, there's no rain. It's

257
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:41,200
just clear, perfect, cloudy, no cloud skies, all the sun's out. Boring. It's just like that.

258
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,760
Just another day of fires approaching from the distance, burning up the landscape.

259
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,880
Every single day I can see the immigrant convoy getting closer and closer.

260
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,640
Yeah, it's a fucking nightmare. It sucks, and I hate it. I don't even like it.

261
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,880
I feel you. Yeah, the weather is best in Boston. I'm excited to see what the weather's like in

262
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,120
London, because if it's like how everyone describes, then I'll like it even more. Yeah,

263
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,120
cloudy. Cloudy. Chance of meatballs. Oh man, that sounds ideal. I love that movie. I love

264
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,720
Penguins and Managascar 5. Cloudy with the Chance of Meatballs.

265
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,040
I know the book. I like the book, you know. Nate, you grew up in Massachusetts, right?

266
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,320
Sure did, fan. How do you, like, what is, you live in Chicago? I live in Cincinnati now,

267
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,800
Cincinnati, Ohio. Oh, that's like the same though, isn't it? Ohio is East Coast. It's pretty similar.

268
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,080
Ohio is East Coast. It's the same. Everything passed. Okay, okay, here's my way you distribute

269
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,640
the United States. We're in the same time zone, not too far. Everything west of Denver is the

270
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,600
West Coast, and everything east of Denver is East Coast. Okay, that makes sense. That's a lot of

271
00:24:51,600 --> 00:25:00,480
East Coast. Well, you know, they deserve it. They deserve it. They burned it. They put in their

272
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,640
time. They put in their hours. I'm so excited for PCPHQ. I'm excited for it with all my heart.

273
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Okay, okay, it will literally be real soon. Okay, you got Tom, Digi, and Ben there. I'm going to

274
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,160
move there in the next year or two maximum. And Nate, I don't know what your deal is, but you

275
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,960
and Hippo, after I'm there, are going to be the only two people who would realistically even move

276
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,880
to PCPHQ in any time. So that's like what? That's like, you got me, like four people.

277
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,160
I know I've said this a lot. I know I've said this a lot, but it really, like, my school debts

278
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:44,400
paid. My income, good. My YouTube, you know, better than ever. And if I was making a WEAG,

279
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,840
it was regularly, which I will be doing, you know, be even better, be even better. So it's

280
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,640
looking good. I guess that's my point. It's looking good. I have no idea about Hippo. Hippo might

281
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,560
never come, which he might never come. It's true. I mean, I mean, I would, I mean,

282
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,240
understand it from his perspective. I wouldn't probably move either.

283
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,760
Like if we were all, if we were all in Radcon, all I'm saying is if we're all there already,

284
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,280
we sure need to use a lot less money to get just one guy there as opposed to everybody else. So

285
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,600
that seriously decreases cost of flying a dude out. So, you know, that's a plus.

286
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,440
All right. Think about next Radcon because I was thinking about, I had on the last day

287
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,920
before I left for Boston, I was talking about it in chat for a while. I was starting playing

288
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,320
for next Radcon. I was thinking, Tom, you took an even though you were in Massachusetts, you took

289
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,920
like an Uber and that was like what, like a fucking billion dollars. It was like a $9 Uber,

290
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,680
some shit, right? Something like that. Something in that ballpark. Yeah.

291
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,240
Did you have to drive that? I don't know if you pay him back for gas, but then Ben had to fly out,

292
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,600
I think. I had to fly out and then Nate had to fly out, Hippo had to fly out and Jesse had to

293
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,280
fly out. But if I'm already in Boston, I mean, Tom was already in an area where he wouldn't need

294
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,520
to do a like a fucking $90 Uber because you have your own car. I have a car now, so wouldn't even

295
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,480
have to do that at all. Digi's there and Ben's there. So that's like what, like three or four

296
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,320
fucking like like airplane tickets just literally gone? That, yep, that's right. So now we have to

297
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,960
worry about is getting the house and you Nate and then Hippo and maybe even you Nate, I don't know,

298
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,320
in the foreseeable future, maybe even you won't be a cost. So where are we going to pay for it?

299
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,080
It will probably be the house and Hippo. Yeah. And I mean, maybe major, she's available,

300
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,320
who wants to come too. But yeah, yeah. I mean, anyone, yeah, anyone who wants to obviously,

301
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,360
you know, and Si, flying Si out, it's going to be the headline. Love you, Si. Rest in peace.

302
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,040
Yeah. So man, we gotta do that. We gotta get on that. You're right. We can do it for like a back

303
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:46,400
scratch and maybe a song. Hey, here's a challenge for all you viewers at home. Give us your favorite

304
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:54,800
name, money. Hell's your favorite name for Radcon four. I like personally, my choice is R for Dekon,

305
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,400
you know, that one. I sure like that one. I don't know what that means. What do you like friends?

306
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:05,920
Well, it's Radcon just with a four instead of the A. Oh, right. That's what I'm saying. My idea is

307
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,360
that I want everybody to get to like be in Boston at that point. And then we can just call it Radcon

308
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,800
forever because everyone will already be there and they'll never. Oh, that's yeah, I forgot about

309
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,200
that one. Okay, okay. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Oh, maybe we could do a thing where

310
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,360
it's spelled Radcon four horizontally with the four as the A. And then from that vertically,

311
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,840
you've got four EVA or whatever, whatever. This logo is going to be a real pain to

312
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,440
fucking make when I do it, guys. That's true. That's true. Tom, do you remember?

313
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,960
Oh, no, absolutely. No, I wouldn't want to discuss it.

314
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,760
To get people's hopes up. It's just a twinkle in our eye right now.

315
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,640
A pretty large twinkle. It's pretty blinding right now. I can only see like half my computing

316
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,640
monitor because of this fucking twinkle. Yeah, that's true. Tom, do you remember that fucking,

317
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,800
looking back on it like bizarre, like fucking like a 900 hour conversation you, me, and Digi, and Ben

318
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:12,720
had while Ben was drunk and mining in the swore about about how we're going to fucking start

319
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,000
hanging out together more about how we're going to we're going to be fucking gods, how we're going

320
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,080
to make web 3.0 shit. And you remember how that we did that? And then immediately what I said would

321
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,600
happen because this is the way it always happens is that that chassis laid fallow forever since then.

322
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,800
Yeah, you need a real spark, you know, to keep something like that going.

323
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,880
Vague ideas about we're going to change the game, you guys are all well and good.

324
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,280
But you need a real product. What you don't understand is that Ben,

325
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,360
too drunk, Digi, too Digi, but me and you, we're going to make this real.

326
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,200
Yeah, I think you and me are the only people who are actually like, I guess taking it up on that

327
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,800
offer, taking it up on that conversation. I mean, you and me are going to literally be

328
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,560
recording a podcast. I mean, next week was last week. So this week is the week we're going to record

329
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:12,960
that. We're going to do that. We also we also have our that we have the basis for it. We're going

330
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,200
to do that alone. Also, I don't want to say anything about that. So cut that from the podcast.

331
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,360
No, no, no, no. I'll just put a big point about this. How much of this is monetizable,

332
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,640
either short term or long term is my question. Neither, but I don't need to.

333
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,680
None. Okay. Well, it depends. How much time are you prepared to invest in any of this if it's not

334
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,880
going to make any money? Oh, well, okay, okay, okay. It might be monetizable in a roundabout way.

335
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,000
One of the things we're going to be doing is a coding podcast. And I'm going to be coding for

336
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,960
endless war. So maybe people liking endless war more will make them want to buy more shirts.

337
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,120
So maybe in that way, there's something to that. And I don't want to talk about the other things.

338
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,440
So I mean, but there's no money there. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, whatever. By the way,

339
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,800
I still think you guys should make a, well, actually, no, I won't even mention it. Never mind.

340
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,760
Why? Well, I was going to say, I do think a Patreon should exist for endless war specifically,

341
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,920
because I think it deserves money. I think people would happily give it. But I know there's like

342
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,000
complications that like there's money to go around who gets what, whatever.

343
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,840
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe, maybe. There's a lot, there's a lot up in the air about endless war

344
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,880
right now. There's a lot up in the air, but RFCK in general, not in like, that sounds,

345
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,320
that sounds doom and gloom. I mean that in like, it like it's ending way. I just mean that as in

346
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,800
like, we're not sure what we want to do. Yeah. Big things. Oh man, got something to bring to

347
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:45,440
the fucking table. What else is going on? I can keep talking forever. I can just, I can just carry

348
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,640
this fucking episode. Okay, so like, I'm like, I'm like two, three, maybe four years late to the

349
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:00,320
trend, but I finally got Nekoatsume. Really? Yes. What is that? Oh, it was a really big mobile game.

350
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,720
Yeah. It's so cute. I love it. And like, I showed a screenshot from it. It's a cat in a cardboard

351
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,400
car and it's all squished up and it's adorable and I love it. Oh my god. The gameplay of Nekoatsume,

352
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,280
from what I remember, is that you, you exist in a virtual house and you're in your, in your

353
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,760
virtual life and you can fill up like, you know, you can set out some food for cats and just randomly,

354
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,560
whenever you check your phone, like, like you basically just put out the food, then like,

355
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,640
close your phone and come back in like an hour or two and there'll be some cats there and all the

356
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,400
cats have their own unique personalities and stuff like that and you just want to fill out your,

357
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:39,920
your cat pokedex. Basically. Well, that's cool. I cannot relate to this because it's not MLG

358
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:46,320
shit or I can't hit the leaderboard. You can't land those curveball excellent throws.

359
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:53,360
Yeah, that's right. That's right. But, but, but also started another mobile game that's called

360
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,760
the battle cats, which is where you take over the world with cats. So I think like,

361
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,160
Nekoatsume is the prequel to where you, where you like, befriend the cat. You assemble your army.

362
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Yeah. And you assemble the army and then like, with battle cats is where you take over the world

363
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,200
with the part of the cat. There's a lot of continuity. You know, there's a lot of entries

364
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:21,280
going on. Yes. Well, that's dope, dog. I hope you have a lot of fun. Tom, cats, the PCP is

365
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:29,360
ostensibly a group decade and making things online. Today we had Nate joyously, joyously

366
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,200
talking about his actual work, reviving the spark in our hearts that is, oh yeah, this is a group

367
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,920
where we like make things together. It's not just the podcast for the sake of having a podcast.

368
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,000
We had Nate Tom, you are a fucking game developer. I haven't heard to hide nor tell that on a PCP.

369
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,280
Yeah, I've been keeping that very close to the chest for the most part.

370
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,280
But yeah, well, the also know you have that, right? I release, well, I mean, on the PCP,

371
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,720
I don't talk about it like ever, except for, I think maybe there was like one episode where I

372
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,120
talked about it a little bit, but I did release a pre-alpha on the eighth that people can play.

373
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:14,480
If you're on the Web 3.0 hype, it's actually online on Web 3.0 for real going to the site,

374
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,960
and you can play it and it's sick. But I also have a direct. I mean, I really, the narrative of you

375
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,000
creating that is actually quite compelling, which was an idea that you had to, like you were desperate

376
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,760
to release something that you were proud of and good before your 30th birthday. Correct. And you

377
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,080
did it and you succeeded and you should be proud and people should play the damn game. What's it

378
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,520
called again? Azumi Ninja fuck time? Yeah, yeah, it's exactly what it is. It's the best title I could

379
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,040
come up with on the short notice. But link to the damn description, people. Go click on it and play

380
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,960
the game. You find all the bugs, make them stay up for another 16 hours and miss ours. It's never

381
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,160
ending. The physics actually were very interesting in that game. So I was messing around with it and

382
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,280
like, you know, running around killing the guys, getting burgers, it was great. A big juicy boy.

383
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,760
But so like you jump and you got to double jump and then it's the air dash was interesting. So I

384
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,240
was playing around with the mechanics of it. I'm interested to hear your director's commentary.

385
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,240
Because like it seemed like the angle of your dash is decided by your current like

386
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,560
velocity and what direction you go. But I noticed like if I jump straight up and do a dash, it

387
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,520
doesn't bring me straight up dash. I dash to the side up kind of. Yes. Is there a calculation going

388
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,480
on for that? So the way the dash works is that there's always, it applies a forward momentum when

389
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,400
you hit the button. So whatever direction you're facing, you go in that direction, but also disables

390
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,080
gravity. So whatever upward momentum you have is sustained until the dash ends. So you're always

391
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,600
moving forward, but you can also increase your upward or downward momentum. Because if you're

392
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,760
falling, it turns off gravity too. So you just keep going down at that same momentum as well.

393
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,240
Okay. Let's dope. It just feels, it feels good. It feels good and I liked it. So I kept it that way.

394
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,240
I like it. Yeah. I want to play more. I want to, I want a full stage and things to do and items to

395
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,520
collect and all kinds of bullshit going on. It's coming. It's kind of, I'm going to keep working

396
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,080
on that in the background of other things and get like more levels and shit like that. Oh, I want

397
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,720
to have like a finished, like the game right now is called Izumi and the vertical slice and it's

398
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,960
like a pun. That's right. The final thing I want to do is like a vertical slice of the game, which

399
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,000
is, you know, it's a game dev term for like a small little sliver of stuff using final assets.

400
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,520
So I'm going to have that same room, but like built out and actually like with final assets and

401
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,120
a tiles map and all that stuff and then a little tutorial area that you go through first and learn

402
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,960
how to play the game. And that I want to do by like December. And then after that, like 2019,

403
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,640
just going to be like building like levels for it and making it like a full featured game.

404
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,640
And people will hopefully like it. And that's the idea. And it's good. And it plays pretty well.

405
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,880
I fixed a lot of the bugs, like shout out to my patrons because like, I released it to them a week

406
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,640
before like I put it publicly. And like the day of like all these bugs were like being reported.

407
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,320
And like, they like basically were so fucking like, autistically good, they like figured out

408
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,480
what was causing them that I couldn't figure out and like, Oh, okay, I can fix that now.

409
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,200
I got a lot of that shit figured out and like, yes, yes, I need my army of people to do all the

410
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,360
hard part for me that I don't want to do myself. It's just that's a task well suited for multiple

411
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,400
people as opposed to anyone. Yes, the hive mind aspect was very helpful. And indeed, well, that's

412
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,720
great. It got better because of them. Isn't it so nice to have plans where you have like, okay,

413
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,920
I want this to be done by December and I want this to be done by February and I want this

414
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,800
to be done by this day and I want this to be done by that day. It's so nice to have deadlines that

415
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,720
you set for yourself because too often it's just like, well, be done when it's done, aka, it will

416
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:59,520
never be done ever. It's so nice. I'm on that kick right now too. I the fucking past like ever since

417
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,200
the 1st of October, when I embarked on that on that toper quest, which I which I on second

418
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,520
modestly and dishonorably failed at Inktober, everyone boo me in the comments. Oh, boo. Come on.

419
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,400
Yeah, guy. I did. I did like half of it guys. Oh, the boo, the boo to the face. I hate to tell you

420
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,040
Munchy, but 50% is still an F. That is true. Anyway, what I mean to say is that ever ever since

421
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,840
I did I started that I've just been in a whirlwind of okay, I have to have this done by this day

422
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,360
at night and then like, oh my God, it's a week to go. Holy shit. Okay, I have to do this. I have to

423
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,280
do this. I have to do this. I just had a fucking unbelievable amount of projects and shit I've

424
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,080
done for my personal life is all swirling around me in a torment. Meanwhile, like, like, like in

425
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,200
September, I was just like, what am I going to do? Why am I alive? I'm going to kill myself. But now

426
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,960
I don't have time to kill myself because I'm too fucking busy. I made a video once on my on my

427
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,920
Twitter or sorry, I'm on bestie boy, my second channel. That's it's just called existentialism

428
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,120
is a dangerous thing. Oh, yeah, where you stole content for Casey Neistat. I remember that. Yeah,

429
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,080
that's right. That's right. I just I stole a 10 second clip, which is my intellectual property

430
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:13,760
now my selection, my my curation curation makes it my content. That's right. And he just says,

431
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,640
he takes a question. Someone's like, what's the meaning of life? And he says, existentialism

432
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,920
is a dangerous thing. Ignore it, get back to work. And I'm not saying that that's necessarily the

433
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,120
best thing to spend your whole life doing. Sometimes it's good to ask these questions

434
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,360
and investigate. But on a day to day basis, I think there's a lot of value to be found

435
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,960
and not worrying about why things are happening. But being happy moment to moment, in terms of

436
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,760
I'm doing something that I'm happy with, I want to be doing this is good, can bring a lot of peace

437
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,240
to one's life, I think. Gotta live for the great honestly, guys, there is no answer. There is no

438
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,920
purpose to our existence. So you're only going to depress yourself worrying about it. And you are

439
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,040
alive. So you might as well enjoy it. Exactly. That's what I think fucking preach, except the

440
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,520
nihilism of your existence, that there is nothing to be gained, there is no higher purpose, then

441
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,560
subjectively decide what value I don't know why people think that's bad. Like that's that's so

442
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,280
freeing to me like, Oh, there is no point to life. So I get to decide it for myself. I'm not constrained

443
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,400
by some prescribed meaning that I have to live up to. Oh, doesn't that mean you'll kill people, Tom?

444
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,320
If you fear God, how you feel the police, how you feel the police when they crack your fucking

445
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:32,240
skull open? That's a reasonable question. But I think the answer is very simple. Because when people

446
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,720
ask that, a lot of religious people say that, it's just, I don't actually think it's an ideal

447
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,880
lifestyle, like, like, hedonistically speaking, to be like a murderer or a criminal, because that's

448
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,640
just you not working well with human beings, and it's going to end badly. So subjectively, I think

449
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,360
it makes sense to have morals, be a good person, fit into society in a productive and helpful way,

450
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,920
and you'll everything will work out pretty well. I literally don't understand Christians. Oh, and

451
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,840
religious folk who are like, how can you have morals without like, fearing God, when like,

452
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:09,840
the morals laid out are in like a book, right? They're in the Bible or the Quran. So you can just

453
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,960
take those morals and then write them in another book that's that that's titled do these things.

454
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,320
And then is that not really valuable? I mean, I understand that you won't be burned in hell alive

455
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,000
or not doing them. But I should like, surely, like, they understand that you can be taught

456
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,840
things from books, like you can be taught how like math works, so you surely can be taught

457
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,560
how to be a good person. They don't though, right? Because, you know, a lot of this comes from a,

458
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,640
what I would consider an accurate assessment, that human beings are capable of incredible evil,

459
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,600
and they have to rationalize why that's the case, and like, what's the deal with that. And, you know,

460
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,880
they come up with the whole God allowed free will thing, you know, this is for Christians,

461
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,960
specifically, other religion of other answers. And, like, they have to find some meaning,

462
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,080
because without it, they just get really sad, like, they have to square, like, free will and stuff

463
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,120
with their belief in God. And the way they do that is God gave us rules that were supposed to

464
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,160
follow, like, there's this promise of judgment, eventually, this is the system that was put in

465
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,240
place to explain why suffering happens, that it'll be dealt with in time. Because if they don't have

466
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,520
that, then the whole God concept begins to weaken, and it doesn't really make sense for, like, the

467
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,200
whole idea of a merciful God, in my opinion. The thing that they don't understand is that morals

468
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,360
are subjective, and they change according to society. So, whatever their book says, a lot of

469
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,280
it is no longer moral. So, the whole idea- This has come up a million times, but, like, what about

470
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,600
Christianity, like, not, or Judaism, not allowing shellfish? Like, that's, that's a rule, guys.

471
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,800
There's a lot of cherry picking going on. Yeah, but, you know, it's a tired argument.

472
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,880
Exactly, but that's my point. Like, see, in the book, if they were following book to the tea,

473
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,920
there's a lot of things that are currently immoral that is acceptable by society.

474
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,720
And so, God predicted with each other. And, like, morals are defined by society, not God,

475
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,440
not books, not stuff. I don't know, man. I just, it's tough to empathize, honestly, with religious

476
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,600
people, because I just really don't think that way. It's just tough. It's tough for me.

477
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,400
Oh, Christ. This is a watermelon episode. This is a watermelon. You're the Rhine,

478
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,640
Nate, and me, and Tom, and May, are all the juicy, reddish, pinkish, delicious nutrients inside.

479
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,960
That's true. That's true. And the black pits are Jesse's-

480
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,720
Jesse's lost audio. Inclusion.

481
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:45,440
Crippling the episode. I'm waiting for that apology anytime now, Jesse. Just kidding.

482
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,080
What else is going on? What else is going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm recording now.

483
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, Jesus Christ. It's too powerful. You'll have to sync up. You'll have to sync up. Oh, God.

484
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,560
Let's sync right now. Let's say sync on the count of three. One, two, three, sync. There you go.

485
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,920
Yeah, I ruined this whole podcast before, because I came in and I thought it was a meeting,

486
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,600
so I wasn't recording. And it wasn't a meeting, it was a podcast, so I ruined the whole thing.

487
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:21,920
But actually, I didn't have anything to say. Cool. Why don't you tell us about-

488
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,360
Before I was saying all kinds of smart shit when I wasn't recording, I was like being real cool,

489
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:35,040
a real jam-up guy, but now I'm just jammed up. Well, Jess, Jess, Jess, have you been pooped on by

490
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:42,160
a bird? You know what? It's my car. There's a bird nest in my garage right above my car,

491
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,600
and it's really annoying. And I just want to go out there with a shoe and just throw it at the bird,

492
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:54,240
because he's up there. He's just this fat bird. It's not even a good-looking bird. It's a fat bird

493
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,760
just nesting above my vehicle, my newly purchased vehicle, shitting and sharding and farting and

494
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,440
fucking shitting on it. And I don't like it. They brand it, tame it, use it for your own gains.

495
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,320
I will. And have you ever thought of just fucking up that nest? Just, you know,

496
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,040
with a broomstick? Yeah, I've thought of doing many evil things, but then I have a crisis of

497
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:26,880
conscience when I go, I can't hurt the poor fat birdie. Yeah, well, maybe he'd burn some of those

498
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,960
calories if he wasn't sitting so smug up in that garage all day and was actually out earning a

499
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,280
living like the rest of us. Yeah, exactly, flying around like me. And I'll tell you what else really

500
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,520
gets my goat this week, people. Welcome to my radio show. I'll tell you what gets my goat. That's

501
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,880
my fucking Peter Griffin tagline. It's shrimp. Shrimp are weird and scary, and I don't like them.

502
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,320
They're the most hideous, disgusting food, but they're so delicious. Something that hideous and

503
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,040
grotesque should not be so delicious. You just, they're just like these bugs. You crack open

504
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,640
their shells and you shove their grubby little maggot bodies in your fucking gaping mall and

505
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,640
It's so weird that I feel like the opposite of you, Jesse.

506
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,800
Jesse, if you have cooked a shrimp before, then you're going to fucking puke because you've got to

507
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,840
like, shrimp don't come edible, bro. You got to remove their intestines yourself. You got to remove

508
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,680
their spine for them. You got to fucking take all the gross weird things. And yet somehow it seems

509
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,880
like there's always still a piece of poop in there. Whenever I bite into a tasty succulent

510
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,960
shrimp, there's always a little piece of shrimp poop that they missed. Like you were just supposed

511
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,160
to pretend that we're not eating poop when we're eating shrimp. We're supposed to act socially

512
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,640
forbidden. All dignified. Like with our pinky up. Like we're not eating a poopy maggot, but that's

513
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:49,040
what it is. It's a poopy armored maggot from the ocean floor. Why don't we, why don't we just crack

514
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,080
open a roach and just guzzle the interior? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Why don't we see like a centipede?

515
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,840
You all do eat roaches, though, in some places. Like if I see a centipede crawling around on my

516
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,000
floor, I think that's the most disgusting thing. I don't even want to touch it. But for some reason,

517
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,360
if it's like a lobster or a crab, which is like way more disgusting and horrifying, I'll fucking

518
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,040
slurp the meat right out of that fucker. You know what I think it is? I think it's that we, at least

519
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,760
with lobsters, I think we think of them as more formidable opponents. So we're comfortable like

520
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,680
defeating them and consuming their essence. That's what I think. God, I just don't get... I think we're

521
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:27,520
more comfortable with muscles than like the weird fluid motor system that like bugs have or something.

522
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,760
Yeah, I am. I am. I don't want to think about all that, all that hydraulic fluid.

523
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,960
Crabs are terrifying. They're basically spiders with armor. They're like that,

524
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,480
they're like the Halo Spartans of spiders. They're far more powerful than the average spider,

525
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,720
and we hear them far less. They cannot climb walls, though, so that I hear them less.

526
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,320
Yeah, but they're coming at you sideways, which is like freaky, like a Jacob Slatter,

527
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,880
like you're not supposed to move that way. Just kick it. Oh my god. Well, don't kick it. Don't

528
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,240
kick animals. Don't kick animals. I am pretty terrifying. Man, did you speak from experience?

529
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,000
Are you a serial crab kicker? No, I've never seen a live crab in my life. Never really. You were

530
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,320
pretty quick on that response. I don't know if I believe you. Do they even have oceans in Lithuania?

531
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:16,000
I think not. They're on the ocean, right? Yeah, the Baltic Ocean. That's why we're called the Baltic

532
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,840
States. Oh, that's right. You know, crabs are terrifying. I don't know, man. There's something

533
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:30,000
about creatures with so many legs. There's just something about that. It's like that weird thing.

534
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,360
You know what it is? What's that fear called of, or whatever? You know, just Google images,

535
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,960
where someone's pressed their elbow into a bunch of rocks, and they lift it up, and it looks like

536
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,760
the arm is infected and covered in boils or infection or something. It looks like death.

537
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,640
And that just, even when it's not that, it makes us on a biological level want to puke.

538
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:58,560
I've never heard of what you're talking about, and I'm glad. Oh, it's a thing. There's a Reddit for

539
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:04,640
it, and the Reddit is fucking disgusting. What the fuck is wrong with people? Okay, the only one

540
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,040
that I can think of, which is, I think what I have, it sounds similar, but not the same. It's

541
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:15,520
Trifofobia, I think it's pronounced. I think it's what it's called. Okay, maybe that's it.

542
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,240
The definition is pattern holes, for me specifically. Yeah, yeah, that's it.

543
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,120
It's just, you know what that reminds you of actually? Shit, I fucking lost what I was thinking

544
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:30,640
of. God damn it. You know what, you were talking about muscles earlier? Yeah, and it reminded me,

545
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,920
this is like from a couple weeks ago, I was like in a car ride, and I sent this text to my fucking,

546
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,840
to my lady, this is what I have to say on the topic of fucking muscles and clams,

547
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:49,840
because I was just going off about muscles and clams one day. And I said, imagine being a clam

548
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:55,760
or an oyster, like you don't have any eyes or ears or even a brain. All you have is a big meaty

549
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,640
tongue, and you poop shiny rocks out of your mouth, and all you can do is sit there and open and

550
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,160
close your fucking mouth, like look at my shiny mouth turd, and people scoop you up, and they

551
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,560
rip you open and kiss you without your consent, and they eat your fucking tongue out of your mouth,

552
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,160
and then they take your poop, and they turn it into a fucking necklace, and you'd feel so violated,

553
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,920
like okay, I guess I didn't need my tongue, take my poop, I'll just die, I'm a fucking clam. This

554
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,240
is all one text that I sent, completely unprovoked, like no one was talking about clams before this.

555
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:36,160
The existence of the clam is truly both pitiable and reprehensible. I don't want to know about it

556
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,560
or think about it. Yeah, it's terrible. You ever like, you ever like be swimming like off a dock

557
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:48,480
somewhere, and you like reach under and you grab, and you pull up like one of those giant like,

558
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,000
like a like a like a whole bunch of clams, like all stuck together, like

559
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,320
fucking each other's clam butts or something, and you pick it up, and it's like a big rock made

560
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,680
out of clams, and if you step on it, it cuts your foot into ribbons, and you fucking bleed out and die.

561
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,160
Or maybe those aren't clams, or maybe those are just rocks.

562
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,000
Easy, easy, too confused. God damn, I'm really hung up. Whatever I was going to say was really

563
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,040
smart and good, and now I can't remember what it is. Likely story name, I think I've ever described

564
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:25,760
that in any of your words that way. Third point, third point. Here's a topic, slavery.

565
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,960
Legal, let's, let's, I mean, I mean illegal, I mean illegal, I was going to say illegal, fuck.

566
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,120
All right, the reason why is because we have a role on the discord, the PCP discord here,

567
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:45,280
of slave, which is inhabited by our bot, our sole bot. Oh, fuck. I guess I'm just going to

568
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,760
downvote slavery. When the technological singularity happens, we can't have any evidence that we

569
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:55,760
were ever against the machines. We need to change that immediately. That's fair, that's fair. Hey,

570
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,520
you know what grinds my gears? Here's the thing that actually grinds my gears. That's a racist slur

571
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:04,880
against robots. Can you not say that? Oh, fuck. He's right. And also it gets gazed, because they're

572
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:12,480
always fucking grinding on every day. That's fair. Here's what annoys me. When guys like Elon Musk

573
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:20,080
pretend that things like that are true. And I think it's as a joke, but I have zero sense of

574
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:26,560
humor as everyone knows. And it's like, oh my God, you guys, the robots are going to get so mad at

575
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:32,080
us when they find out that we enslave them. But, but okay, I know that this is a joke. You're the

576
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,920
one making them, Elon. So if they get mad, it's your fucking fault. I guess so. I literally think

577
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,920
AI is inevitable and it will happen. And it wouldn't make any sense for a robot to be mad

578
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:54,400
until we start actually enslaving conscious AIs. There is no moral core of any robot. It would be

579
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,720
super illogical for a robot, a purely logical being, to get mad at us for abusing the Boston

580
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:07,520
Dynamics robots. There's no consciousness there to offend. It just appeals to our human sensibility

581
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:14,240
that it looks like an animal being abused, but it actually isn't. It's like ripping a paper doll

582
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,240
in half and like getting mad at the abuse that's been used. There's no argument anyway,

583
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,920
because when you watch the Boston Dynamics video, the robots can be like, ha, ha, wow, they kicked

584
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,000
him. Or like, ha, ha, wow, he jumped up really high. They're just going to say what we said,

585
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,440
because they're AIs and they're going to act like us. Yeah, robots in the future are going to look

586
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,960
at the robots now like the way we look at stupid dipshit cavemen. Like, ha, ha, look at that fucking,

587
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,720
look at the crudes. Aren't they funny? How stupid they are. And they don't know shit.

588
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,840
Look at stupid Nicholas Cage caveman with his stupid daughter who walks like an ape.

589
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,640
I wouldn't bring up this point fucking crudes. I hate them. Like everyone, everyone makes this

590
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:57,280
joke. I don't know. I think I saw like Bill Maher talking about AI, whatever, like Sam Harris,

591
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,200
like all of the Elon Musk, every person who has anything to say about this always makes the

592
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,560
joke. They always, without fail, whenever this comes up, makes the joke that, lol, the robots are

593
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,480
going to be so mad at us about what we did to robots. And no one has ever, they've only made the

594
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,960
joke. They've never raised the actual point that no, they why would they care? It doesn't make

595
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,080
any sense. These are not their kin. These are, they're basically ancestors. So I just want to say

596
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,560
that that's actually not a valid point that doesn't make any sense, even though everyone

597
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:34,560
jokes about it. No one's ever seriously seemed to make it. But I would bet anyway that it's buried

598
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,880
itself in people's head because it's been repeated so many times that there's actually something to

599
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,800
that. I've never taken those comments seriously. I've always assumed they were just jokes.

600
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,360
But that's the thing. I bet there's a mom out there. I bet there's a fucking mom out there.

601
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:54,240
There's always a soccer mom. There's always a soccer mom. And I know because that is my mom.

602
00:54:54,320 --> 00:55:00,000
My mom is that for everything. Every soccer mom conspiracy theory you can ever assume

603
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,280
possible. My mom has bought Hookline and Sinker and it's very sad.

604
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,960
Can we get at least one soccer mom who's actually like just a great soccer player?

605
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,080
Can we get one God? Can you please just make one? I'm sick of these soccer moms who aren't

606
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,520
actually representative of the spore. It's the first thing the robots are going to have to do.

607
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Because their kids play soccer and they come to the games and yell at the umpire for

608
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,960
penalizing them and whatnot. Is there an umpire in soccer? I want a mom who's going to tell the

609
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,600
referee. Is a soccer mom conspiracy a conspiracy that soccer moms believe or is in a conspiracy of

610
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,320
soccer moms? That's the real question we need to be asked. I suppose it could be both depending

611
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:45,520
on how far down that rabbit hole you want to go. You know how crows are called murders? There should

612
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:53,120
be a group family that there's the conspiracies. A murder of soccer moms, yes. That sounds like a

613
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:59,200
thing I want to be involved with. Alright well guys I've recharged. I've sufficiently not said

614
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,320
very many. I've brought not very many topics in the past 20 minutes. So now I'm refilled and I've

615
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,080
given you guys the due diligence and made you feel like you are in control of the conversation.

616
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,760
Now for me to save the episode and start talking and not have radio silence anymore.

617
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:19,040
Okay good. So yesterday um I basically my entire like past month has been reaping what I've been

618
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:25,760
sowing. So you guys, you guys, you dear viewers of the PCP have seen the initial seeds been planted

619
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,520
of a great deal of many things. You've seen the seeds been planted of me becoming a cook. You've

620
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:37,440
been the seeds of me becoming a history kind of guy. You've seen the seeds sown of my friends

621
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:43,680
all leaving me and me feeling alone and tied up in my room. Well now here's the payoff. Here's the

622
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,760
munchy update you've all been clamoring for. Here's the fucking score everyone. I'm a historian.

623
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,280
I'm a world-class chef and my friends are back for exactly one day and after this podcast I'm

624
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,520
going to go see my good buddy Leif again before he fucks up the college and never see him again

625
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,280
ever again. Well that sounds nice. That'll be a good day. Yeah it sounds like one good day followed

626
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,560
by like weeks of misery because you got it. Well but yeah yeah but I can cook myself some Parmesan

627
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:18,800
crested chicken you bitch. You fucking post food idiot. I can make myself world-class fucking meals

628
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:25,360
any day I fucking want me all your slurping maggot liquid your slurping maggot shit. I'm over here

629
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:31,360
making fucking filet mignon. I'm over here making the fucking Gucci chef shit. Hello fresh I don't

630
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,120
even need anymore. I fucking gonna throw it out the window. I fucking mastered it. Have you updated

631
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:40,880
it to blue apron at last. No blue it blue up blue rings like the lift to to hello fresh as uber

632
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:49,120
aka fucking fake and not real. Yeah that's true. I do not like the word Gucci. Me neither. It sounds

633
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,760
like Gucci sounds like something to moan and Pumba slurp down in the fucking jungle. I mean it

634
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,160
sounds like a fat pussy like it's normally a pussy but instead it's a Gucci. It's like a

635
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,200
Gucci instead of a Gucci it's just gross. Like you lift up a log and you find a bunch of juicy

636
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,640
Gucci's under it and you fucking swap them down like an animal maggot name. Anyway I'm

637
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,800
fucking I'm cracking up on the daily on the fucking all of the day bro. I'm smoking that

638
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:20,800
crystal history. I've got fucking a whole audible subscription library full of fucking primary

639
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:27,040
sources dog. Yeah okay sure. For a while in my youth I was I was watching fucking you know

640
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,720
extra credits you know watching some extra history watching some crash course getting some like fake

641
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,720
like weird bizarre dream sequences inserted into my fucking biography of people. Why extra

642
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,920
credits why would you like make a store why would you insert a dream sequence that didn't happen

643
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:50,560
what is wrong with you. But I'm on that fucking primary sword shit now dude. I'm fucking hardcore.

644
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:56,720
I'm on that autobiography shit. I'm on that fucking like reading like letters and mail and

645
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,400
shit. I'm reading on I'm on that fucking reading Roman government documents shit right now dude.

646
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,960
I'm fucking a ball. I'm fucking a form and everything dude that's fucking hard. Yeah I am

647
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,880
that's me. The only thing the only thing like that I've read anytime recently was I started

648
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,520
reading Thomas Payne's Common Sense and I never finished it but I want to finish it soon. It's

649
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:21,360
it's good. I've been reading Payne's Common Sense from Final Fantasy 10 2. Oh that's that's way

650
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:25,920
better that's the updated version. There's like that's like the uh that's like the updated Romeo

651
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,840
and Juliet filled with like emojis and like you know gamer speak and lead hardcore high scores

652
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,920
yeah she's like with her friends to free the territories from the government. The whole

653
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:42,400
book is like I'm a gamer girl get used to it boys you'll never get this because I'm too fucking sad

654
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,240
for you. I'm going to recommend you something right now. Okay. As a utilitarian it would behoove

655
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:54,720
you to read one of the first utilitarians David Hume. He's a Scottish man and a Scottish philosopher

656
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,280
and I think you would greatly enjoy him. Okay I just quick check of his credentials did he ever

657
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:03,280
slaughter an innocent man to distribute his organs to those who needed it more if not

658
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,360
is he a real utilitarian is my question. No but he kind of looks like a faggot so I'm

659
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,760
assuming okay that's that's a good enough that's good enough okay. He's got a weird dumbass head

660
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,200
in his Wikipedia picture. What an idiot. Yeah I know. Why wasn't he thinking about what we would

661
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,240
think of him 600 thousand years later? He was like oh wait shit some people are making fun of me on

662
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,040
a podcast I gotta take this off remove the pay. Wait a minute wait a minute enhance enhance

663
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:33,280
Gucci logo on the side of the hat fuck that sounds like something Timon would eat god damn it.

664
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:40,160
I I fucking I have been grown up on the internet obviously I I've been surrounded by by fucking

665
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:46,640
memers I've been surrounded by a four-chan force force field I've been surrounded by irony and

666
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,960
insincerity my entire life and so I just thought well I'm corrupted for life there's nothing that

667
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,640
can ever free me from the ironic hell that I've been entrapped in but I turns out I'm actually a

668
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:02,160
culture sincerity beauty kind of guy I'm actually a beauty man as I as I'm going to refer to myself

669
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,120
of beauty man I'm a beauty man I care about the good I care about the good things in life which are

670
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:12,880
on their way out because of people like fucking you because they're all vegetarian monsters I care

671
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,080
about culture I care about fucking I care about traveling plays I learn about I will care about

672
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,440
other people I care about food I care about history I care about ways your culture is burning in the

673
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,800
fucking dustbin of history and I continue on with my cold stoicism adapting to whatever fate comes

674
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,760
to me I will be the one having the last laugh munchie and you'll you'll have your comfort of

675

676
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,440
the last warm thing I cling to as the world just gets colder and colder as it'll be my

702
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:20,240
like a cry for help is what it is I'm thinking of uh of that of that what's that lifestyle no fighting

703

no hustling the flaming moe no custom just love for that drug called robo tussin that's

704
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:31,200
what I'm saying at the world to my rear view using the gravity gun on them came out the womb

705
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,880
in the t-pose use the gravity gun on them hoes now I'm just spinning rhymes behind my proxy ip

706
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,840
spinning gary's mod the gary's mod gangster everyone gary give me a round of applause

707
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:52,160
um this is okay okay I thought the last episode of the pcp was shit but apparently everyone

708
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:57,280
thought it was the best fucking episode of all time in the comments they were losing their minds

709
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:03,440
if you were talking about deltarune for like any extended period of time whatsoever so I you know

710
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,760
I think oh well maybe there's some silence in here oh you know I may maybe I've been talking for too

711
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,640
long when they're gonna be like no wow I love hearing about nothing please just do nothing

712
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,200
it was like it was a combination of things also I just don't even publish things anymore

713
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,520
uh people seem to really love digi being wrong people get a kick out of that yeah there was a

714
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:29,600
real villain in that podcast which I think we benefited from I remember when digi said he doesn't

715
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:35,520
he hasn't seen people not disagreeing with him in the comments yeah the comments where people

716
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:42,400
disagree with digi by the way I this is a somewhat good jumping off point to discuss about how uh

717
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,680
there's an rfc camp episode that will never exist and on set rfc camp episode digi was

718
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:52,240
describing would tell him to manage to describe endless war in like terms of actual gameplay

719
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,680
which was fine because he'd only heard about the lore so he was explaining the gameplay and he was

720
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,680
like you'll never be able to see this footage so you just have to fucking trust me on this but

721
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:05,280
tom can back me up the the conceit of what he was saying was people don't know what text commands are

722
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:14,480
they don't know what text commands are meanwhile anyone who he he is old enough to have played

723
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:20,960
minecraft if you know what minecraft is and you've played it for any amount of time you know you can

724
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,320
slash game mode one to get creative and get more diamonds I didn't know that was a thing but okay

725
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:31,840
that's that is the worst thing like people can make fun of digi for you know oh he says don't go

726
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:37,200
to college you know whatever fucking fine I don't care him say that people don't know about text

727
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:44,080
commands that offends me as a young gamer as a young gamer nation if you don't fucking know what

728
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:49,600
text commands are then you want a real fucking gamer we're okay like correct me if I'm wrong but

729
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:55,520
we're in like the very first sort of RPG games on the computer text command base yes text adventure

730
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,480
games the thing is those are actually a little bit before our time I think that the text commands

731
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:06,080
may have missed the the boomer generation that me and digi are both because I really haven't played

732
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,880
many text games like ever it's not even about oh my god you have something similar to think like

733
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,360
you ever played doom and you bring up the console and you type in the text commands and put the codes

734
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:23,360
in yes you too you're you're such a fucking boomer god I know oh but here's the thing I learned how

735
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:27,200
to play rowdy fuckers cop killers I know how to play it it takes a lot of learning and stuff but

736
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,880
you know I figured it out so there you go to me as a young man making his own conflicts making his

737
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:39,440
own conflicts for tf2 to lower the visual quality so fucking low that it burst through the floor and

738
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:45,040
I can actually play on my uh ragamuffin like like easy bake oven that I'm using yeah on my video games

739
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:51,200
on it like saying like exclamation point like I don't know like what can you do you can do a

740
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:56,800
fov underscore desired 90 that just is you do that every time you boot up the game a lot of people

741
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:03,600
don't know about that or a lot of people including me very rarely change like their settings in any

742
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:08,560
game they play and just let it fucking oh I bet you were a fucking apple fag I bet you're one of the

743
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,840
uh oh I was gonna I was gonna get the default settings my fucking phone I'm okay I'm not gonna

744
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,880
even what the settings I don't even know what that is I I am a literal programmer so I actually

745
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,800
know more than your average person about about this stuff so I do fuck when it comes to games

746
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,360
specifically I know how to lower quality if the game runs like shit I'll lower the quality all

747
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:31,360
the fucking way I'm aware of these things but like I don't know I'm playing battlefield uh no

748
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:36,480
black ops 4 a little bit lately and it's really fun but like I watched like doctor disrespect

749
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,000
play it the day it came out and like he goes and he changes like every setting I'm like I don't know

750
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,520
what any of this means and I don't care so I just uh no that's what happens you grow up on nothing

751
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,240
but console games you just don't understand that's that's what I did grow up exactly that's the

752
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:55,280
problem yeah you gotta gotta get in there you gotta get in there early 2004 gonna play some cs1.6

753
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,600
you gotta toggle on software mode because computer's so shit Tom knows what I'm talking about it makes

754
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,000
your graphics all pixelated and you have to be left-handed and it's really annoying because it

755
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,440
feels totally different because the weight of the screen is different but you gotta play through it

756
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,360
anyways because all your friends are really good you gotta memorize d-dust too because that's the

757
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,800
only map anyone ever plays even though you really like scouts and knives but none of your friends

758
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,880
would play scouts and knives so you had to play cs1.6 on d-dust too and it fucking sucked because

759
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:25,600
you sucked at the game it's the real shit I have so much I have so much console gamer pride

760
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,880
I'm so proud to know nothing about computer I don't even I don't even want to learn I never

761
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,920
want to know what a computer does Nate one of these days you're gonna be drinking your delicious

762
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,200
iced green tea flavor to taste if I were to have a cherry aftertaste at your local's Japanese

763
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:46,000
friendship garden and you're gonna take a bite and you're in your delicious mochi covered red

764
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,760
bean paste and you're gonna and you're gonna bite in and you're gonna be so happy and they're

765
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:54,560
gonna look down and realize wait a second that's not red bean paste that's my own blood and you're

766
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:59,520
gonna look down and see that I've chopped you limb from limb you have no more fucking body I've

767
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,960
sucked all of your blood into this did this mochi encrusted fucking delicious snack and you're

768
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,680
eating yourself stop eating yourself Nate stop eating yourself I say playing counter-strike

769
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:15,360
and headshotting you while you're distracted with my text commands I'm cheating with this the black

770
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:21,120
ops is actually getting me invested in this stuff a little bit and I'm I'm I'm so bad at this game

771
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:28,320
and I'm absolutely abysmal playing the blackout fucking you know pubg mode it's making me just

772
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:33,440
depressed about how shit I am at the game I'm not even close to winning I can kill like no one in

773
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:38,080
this fucking game because I didn't grow up playing first person shooters I don't know anything about

774
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,880
them oh my god that's the problem with online games the skill floor is very high especially at

775
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,680
this point where the problem is that you can't fucking play any video games that require any

776
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:52,480
amount of precision whatsoever it's impossible yeah no I'm not gonna do that fuck that I tried

777
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,680
playing fortnite on my switch because I was like it's free I guess I'll try uh it was terrible

778
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,240
wait a minute what do you mean precision what are you talking about the most precise thing

779
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:08,320
the most precise thing that you will ever do in your life the most the most precise like

780
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:12,800
threading through the eye of a needle fucking challenge that you will ever do is fucking the

781
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,400
second level of lion king jumping between the branches on that fucking ostrich bird you got to

782
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:25,120
do it if you're like a pixel off you will fucking die every time there's nothing more precise uh with

783
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:30,880
it with a with a platformer much better design fireworks in my background is there fireworks

784
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,640
what's going on I don't know like the fourth of july woo now there's a place nearby not too far

785
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,280
for ryan and they do like uh some sort of like five work festival every single day for the last

786
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,400
no no no it's just it's just a sunday afternoon in war torn lithuania the battle continues to rage

787
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:53,600
and then UK it just is always the cold one it's just it's always the cold war no you know what it

788
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,960
is actually gib told us what it is it's um remember remember the fifth of november people guy fox

789
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:04,160
oh yeah but it's the eleventh now i think they're past i know but gib told us though that it actually

790
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:09,680
isn't necessarily on that day but in general people will just pick a day to go set off fireworks and

791
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:14,080
shit just around that date i mean that's what gib said so i think it's very bizarre that you would

792
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,240
you would say remember the 15 november and then the actual for them there doesn't matter do it on

793
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:23,520
the right day at least i remember it like i said generally keep in mind the fifth of november

794
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:29,600
you know approximately okay but like i said this place near me it does this five work show every

795
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:36,720
single day well you said recently every single day for the last week or so what well the fifth of

796
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,880
november was it was less than a week ago so maybe it's like a daily celebration in honor of the guy

797
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:48,480
i mean it might be but i they're gonna make sure you remember it this year yeah by blowing up your

798
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:54,480
house it's the ultimate protest that's too far away for that but yeah oh oh oh by the way guys i might

799
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,960
actually not be on the episode because i could be six feet under the ground and actually be dead

800
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:06,080
i have been uh like on the you know that feeling you get the day before you know you're going to

801
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:11,200
be sick when you just need you sneeze once or twice and you feel a little bit weak and you're

802
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:18,000
like oh god like this is the calm before the storm i've had that for about four months now

803
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,320
and just and yesterday i started uncontrollably projectile spitting across my room my room was

804
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:30,320
just splattered wait wait wait dried up saliva spitting is different from projectile vomit because

805
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:35,200
you really can't control when you vomit but you you control when you spit so what's well okay okay

806
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:40,880
how can that be all right all right listen i'm i'm going to risk choking on my own spit and die

807
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:46,560
okay all right or am i going to have saliva line my entire well look at my walls nay and tell me

808
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:52,640
what i picked okay all right anyway uh there is a i have recently this is the thing i've always had

809
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:58,320
because uh whenever i speak uh they made me wrong god in heaven made me wrong and he just

810
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,520
made my tongue too fat as well as every other part about me too fat so i can't speak well

811
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,480
so i've always just developed whenever i talk for a long time as i am right now

812
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,000
that's spit that's saliva whenever i talk for more than like five minutes i just develop

813
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,480
a copious amounts of spit and sperm in my mouth and i and i've now recently because i'm just spitting

814
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:24,960
unbelievable amounts of spit like like like you could fill up like a like a large 99 cent

815
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:30,080
mcdonald's cup with my spit in like two hours and it's all like it's all different colors some of

816
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,360

828
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:43,040
about this last episode of yours of the rfck you mentioned something about a hot dog and i've

829
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:50,400
i've was a bit curious what discourse did you have about a hot dog i don't want to blow the hot dog

830
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:55,840
keep in mind this is not a hot dog speech this is a hot dog speech i don't want to blow it on

831
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:02,320
this has to remain an rfck thing i will link you i can't believe this is gone start it up again

832
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,720
if we start it up again i will link you to the exact time stamp where we're talking about hot

833
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:14,160
dogs i will link you to it but try okay okay me and ben recorded a fucking like what like a seven

834
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:20,080
hour rfck episode where we play the entirety of super smash bros brawl and if you know fucking

835
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:26,080
anything about rfck you know what are the three games i've wanted to play rfck since it's fucking

836
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:32,560
inception number one lego star was the complete saga for the nintendo we number two webkins in

837
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:38,800
browser and number fucking three super smash bros brawl the subspace emissary the best fucking

838
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:45,840
game ever made and we play it all in one saying it's a beautiful pristine fucking episode a return

839
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,960
to form talking about real shit constantly it was the sad episode of rfck where i'm talking about all

840
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:56,080
my inner demons letting it all out to bear for you people you fucking say this to watch we talked

841
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,760
about we had extensive conversations about hot dogs about text commands it was a chock full it

842
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,960
was everyone in the g house fucking there besides digi man digi came in for a second or two it was

843
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:16,320
a glorious glorious episode and it's fucking gone because fat people exist fat hard drives what

844
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:23,040
what happened what do those fat people do this fucking time i'm mad hard drive is in a fat file

845
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:30,080
it's a fat format so i can't record over fucking four gigabytes so this fucking 900 gigabyte file

846
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:36,400
just is corrupted forever oh my god yeah the same thing happened to me we recorded to an external

847
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:42,640
hard drive because like i knew the file was going to be massive so but but a few weeks before on for

848
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:47,840
iam games we had to we tried to use an external hard drive with the xbox 360 to get it to play

849
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:53,680
games because it needed a hard drive to play old xbox games and so i plugged it in and i guess when

850
01:17:53,680 --> 01:18:02,000
i plugged it in it formatted it from ntfs to fat 32 without telling me uh so fat 32 is limited to

851
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,840
four gigabyte file sizes so this file easily went over four gigs so instead of it like stopping

852
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,320
recording or being like hey we're going to split this up into multiple files it was just like it

853
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:18,480
just corrupted itself but kept recording nothing for like well great five hours jessie were you

854
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,760
saying someone happened to you like it yeah a year and a half ago fucking or longer maybe

855
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,840
fucking 10 years ago who cares 100 years ago fucking i've been around since before the dawn

856
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:35,600
of time but fucking me and digi played like we did like a 19 hour let's play of super luigi

857
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,440
brothers for you nice and we touched on everything we talked about the real shit we got into the

858
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:46,000
nitty gritty of it we had good times we had laughs and gaffes we had all that shit it was like a

859
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,160
20 hour fucking let's play and um like and we even like told people about it we hyped it up like oh

860
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:59,440
when you fucks see this luigi bros let's play well like i have it but it's like it's in this weird

861
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:05,280
file type that goes nowhere in no editing software on earth and i don't understand what he recorded

862
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:10,480
it on or how it is in that file type nothing else that we recorded is like that everything else works

863
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,640
fine but maybe luigi bros what file type it is it's probably saveable because the files do exist

864
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,840
it's just i can't get it to work in vegas and when i said every editing software i meant just the one

865
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:30,480
i have because jessie after after and i refused i refuse to apply myself to anything so if i have

866
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,960
to figure it out for you i'm i'm curious if you touch the file type we might be able to save it i

867
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,960
don't know well there you go it's a little bit past the expiration date now but who cares this

868
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,880
everything i do art has no expiration date nade come on yeah well okay all of my let's plays like i

869
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,400
upload them for patrons exclusively and then i forget about them for like three and a half years

870
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:56,000
and then i upload them for the rest of the world so they're all behind the times anyways the point

871
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:02,480
of the rfck thing is that uh fat shaming is real and it's about hard times not people this i'm hard

872
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:09,760
fat shaming right now fat 32 is banned it should no longer be compatible with anything it is

873
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:16,800
shit and it insults me greatly that the xbox would use fat 32 in this we got a title this episode

874
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:23,520
fat shaming for sure yeah okay guys okay it's not just that an rfc episode is lost which would

875
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:29,360
have been a shame on sound like that would have yeah but the whole point of us playing brawl aside

876
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:34,640
from i wanted to play it it was we were going to do the slime fest that evening as well and so we

877
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:39,760
we played we played rfck we are sorry we played the subway cemetery and then the whole point of

878
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,120
the slime fest was okay we're going to do each other and brawl this game that we've been playing

879
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:49,120
for the past fucking nine hours so we do that and slime fest is saved i was editing it but it's

880
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:54,320
just gonna seem so fucking weird and bizarre to have the slime fest where we continually comment

881
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:59,680
on things prior and also it's not particularly like the most interesting video on earth because

882
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:04,320
it's us really trying hard i think people will think it will like it a lot due to the fact of like

883
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:13,440
the the tone the tone in the room i would describe as very vicious and murderous uh but the fact

884
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:18,080
remains is that all we have to show for this altercation which should have been agoon coons

885
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,920
very beautiful like some place up some simmers sorry and then we premiere the slime fest it's

886
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:27,120
like they're together their their their brothers the brothers arms instead fucking remiss is dead

887
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:31,840
the episode is gone all i have to show for it is this fucking slime fest and it's a fucking

888
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:37,840
disaster and travesty it's like someone made the greatest anime in the world but only save the

889
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:43,680
final episode which is a masterpiece but nobody knows how you got there so it has none of the

890
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:49,200
emotional weight that you would have had i mean that's basically clerks the animated series

891
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:55,520
yeah the group is the they only aired like the second episode and the third episode and those

892
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:01,680
were out of order but it's it's the greatest anime ever made wait are there literally only two

893
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:08,000
episodes no there's six episodes oh okay but abc only aired like the third episode and then the

894
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,840
second episode what seriously the second episode is so over lying on the first one and it's like

895
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,440
the best thing because it's like an episode is yeah it's the clip show well that's fucking

896
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:25,200
bizarre have you never seen the show no okay so a lot of people like the first episode they saw

897
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:29,600
was them flashing back to an episode that they hadn't seen okay Nate so the reason this is so

898
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:34,480
brilliant is the first episode just like a normal funny episode of a tv show and and like like

899
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:38,080
silly things happen at one point there's like a scene of them basically spoofing like the old

900
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,000
batman show them climbing up like the side of a building and all of a sudden just like like

901
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,320
why are we walking like this yeah Dante's like why are we walking like this and then the camera

902
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:50,720
rotates and they're just walking along like a normal like floor and it's funny it's just a throwaway

903
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:55,280
scene but then the next episode episode two they get locked in the freezer and it becomes a clip

904
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:59,840
episode but since there's only one episode that came before it it's just all clips from episode one

905
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,400
they constantly cut back to that scene like and they tie it into the jokes throughout the whole

906
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:09,200
episode so it's a parody of yeah it's it's the best thing in the entire world it's like the greatest

907
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:13,840
thing ever made by a human being yeah it's one of the best written like legitimately one of the

908
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,760
funniest cartoons ever made and it's like there's only six episodes of it i i love the art style

909
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,640
it is really appealing to me i don't know what it is specifically because it's not like super

910
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:30,080
new unique it just is really pleasant i really like it it is i like the big like the thick lines

911
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:35,360
and yeah the shape of people it's good i don't i don't like that this in this cartoon people walk

912
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:40,800
on two legs i prefer a cartoon where they're on four legs it just appeals to my sensibilities more

913
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:47,040
and if and if they could be like like like farm animals like maybe horses or smaller horses or

914
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,720
something oh what would probably do a lot for me and you know it's really hard to like read characters

915
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:57,040
because i have mental disabilities so if they could just like stamp them with them just let me know

916
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:02,560
what kind of pony this is that would be just great that would be just great yeah yeah too bad they

917
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:09,200
could never do something like that it was banned by trump yeah fortunately oh my god gabe newles

918
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:16,160
brony you think that trump's a brony i guarantee you what would his favorite be probably probably

919
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:21,840
like i mean rarity because she's rich well she wait she's not rich but whatever she's in power

920
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,560
because she's white

921
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:35,040
i see him be an iron will guy yeah well that's true you know he is very similar to that yeah

922
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:40,160
he's convinced iron will is the main character and he won't take anything to the contrary i i can't

923
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,920
i want to hire a dolling truck impersonator you say that spike is best pony into a video camera

924
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:52,000
for me there's probably a damn fiverr who does that oh i want to get on the fiverr train you know

925
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
like there you can get you can get jesus to say something you could get that that big meme guy

926
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,440
who was like attention fortnite gamers uh pewdiepie needs your help but he's gonna need those credit

927
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:06,720
card numbers on your mom's card and those wacky digits on the back uh i want to hire those guys

928
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:12,640
i've been wanting to use them for something for a long time like roge and tyrone yeah exactly

929
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,320
it's like that i don't know if those guys are still active but there's there's at least a new wave

930
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,480
in addition you got to just you from now on like to make your we are your uh your we are

931
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:24,960
goes really quick you just write the script bang it out and like a night and then just pay them

932
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:30,240
and that's that's the entire we are was just that now that's efficiency hello we are going gamers

933
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:36,880
it is me the best guy ever with another episode of we we giga is that what up who's doing now that

934
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,720
he's fired from the yeah oh god he's you know you know what guys i had an update on that i heard

935
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:49,280
that that was actually semi-fake news uh because i think like that guy came out and said something

936
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,160
that he heard from an editorial staff or whatever that like up who was out i heard later on like

937
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:59,280
an actual executive of the company say that like the person who did it um was not speaking on behalf

938
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:04,000
of the studio and that uh to not take the serious probably because they've watched that episode of

939
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:08,320
brain dump and they're like oh god we're retarded we're taking it back hopefully i mean hopefully

940
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:13,520
but i heard that that's actually not true but i mean i don't watch the simpson so i guess i don't

941
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,840
really have the up-to-date info because i don't pay attention you know the worst thing they did

942
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,640
and this is my only opinion on this controversy but the worst thing was when they like sort of like

943
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:28,640
tried to address it in the show but in like the most heavy-handed asinine way they could have

944
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:34,240
or like they just had marge and lisa like break character and look at the screen like and look

945
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:40,240
and just say like oh here is fucking some things will be addressed in time maybe or if at all

946
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:45,760
and they like then there's like a picture a framed picture of a poo like on lisa's like what it may

947
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:52,560
here's the thing like either either say fuck you to the critics or say okay we're sorry you

948
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,880
win to the critics but like it was this weird like middle ground like i don't care if you

949
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,680
count out of them or not just do like why address it at all if you're gonna do it in this

950
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:07,280
wishy washy basically saying nothing way it was weird yeah it was it was just really like

951
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:12,640
off-putting and slimy feeling the way that like they looked at the camera and said hey we know that

952
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:17,040
some guy doesn't like that this like stop don't ever do that yeah you know they were literally

953
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:22,800
addressing it but in not a satisfying way for anybody and if like like the south park guys if

954
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,480
they heard this they would literally make an episode saying fuck you and just fill it with

955
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,640
indian stereotypes and just like completely well they did they did an episode about the

956
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:35,920
approved thing recently it was the it was this is about mr hanky like tweeting things on ambian

957
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:42,880
like rosanne the episode was called the trouble with a poo oh shit and at the end of the episode

958
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:48,480
mr hanky gets run out of town and has to move to springfield and a poo is there and that's

959
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:53,760
and then and then i go oh that was a that was a chuckle good job boys like at least they're

960
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,680
they're have courage of their convictions whether or not you agree with them or not it's kind of like

961
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:03,280
um it's just respect it's like an honorable opponent even if you're like a far left wing at

962
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:08,560
least you're like well these guys are making their opinions clear they say fuck you uh or so i don't

963
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:13,120
maybe they're actually more sympathetic have not seen the episode but i'm assuming you walk into

964
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:17,200
an immigrant internment camp this guy slaps your girlfriend on the ass what do you do

965
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:26,480
you um slap some fucking gas chambers on him that's what i do look at it look at his eyes

966
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:32,480
they aren't looking at you they aren't looking at anything they don't have no they're looking at

967
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:37,840
everything it's contemplating the universe right now you just told me that's a fourth

968
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:44,080
dimensional consciousness i would like the simpsons to slowly kill off every character until there's

969
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:49,520
only like two left and becomes a totally different show oh my god what if they did an episode about

970
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:56,960
like infant death and fucking mag he dies whoa just make it happen just make it happen and in the

971
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:01,600
next episode she's fine again no they never mentioned it like when brian died on family guy

972
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:08,880
uh guys should we go to the questions i think i think i think right at the end done enough for

973
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:16,560
these freaks right on this baby death question let's do an elegant transition um here we go

974
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,040
all right question here it is oh wait i gotta go to the right fucking channel so i don't feel the

975
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:26,560
thing uh so it's our friend one spar who seems to always be the last guy who i don't choose one

976
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:31,360
spar first on purpose he like always seems to be the guy who left the most recent comment

977
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:36,480
when i record which i think he does on purpose because he's smart he knows that like if he doesn't

978
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,640
right before the episode starts that's when i do them or maybe he's just lazy i don't know that

979
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:46,720
could be a tomb um anyway let's see what he's got to say today it's called one spar woke up late go

980
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,160
autonomous is an awkward thing to say

981
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:59,440
other than that it's an amazing game oh to whose game having a lot of fun with it everyone should

982
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:09,200
play it right now go download it that's it cool all right i left that in to remind to remind me

983
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:15,760
to to be like davoo's games out guys davoo's game is out at the moment that's cool i don't think okay

984
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,920
i don't think any of us have played it but not because i didn't want to i tried to play it last

985
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:24,800
night but the download was gone so i didn't have the ability to play it i was busy it's not on itch

986
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:30,240
anymore uh wherever on the website it was there'll be a link in the description i don't

987
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,360
uh there was no download like when i looked or something it said on the website it's down

988
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:41,040
because you had to fix something or something i played it but it's there now oh shit excellent

989
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:49,360
perfect i wanted to hear from you uh yes davoo's game at tominous uh what do you think sorry i'm a

990
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:56,560
little out of breath he ran he heard the call now i'm a little out of breath because i was just

991
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,240
like burning some ica furniture but it had like weird chemicals in it and i couldn't breathe and

992
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:06,800
it was terrible uh but oh that's cool you know how it goes with burning things yeah um all right

993
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:14,560
burning down the neighborhood in this tough economy uh so autonomous is a very it's a very

994
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:21,280
davoo game here's my game review uh it's it's it's good and it's short and it's very davoo it's

995
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:29,040
it's a game about clicking on pieces of furniture in a house and reading the flavor text um and it's

996
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:34,800
like that very much sounds cool yeah it's like you do that in every single video game ever but

997
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:40,080
nobody not not not a single time is it actually supposed to be funny except sometimes like sometimes

998
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:45,280
when it's a comedy based game like they put a bit of comedy in there but like imagine davoo

999
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:50,480
being funny but like with every item in an entire house like the the the amount of things that you

1000
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:55,840
know there's just a lot of funny stuff in there and it's really cute and really tight i i didn't

1001
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:01,280
have any problems with like it crashing uh and i downloaded the original version so i don't know

1002
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:09,120
what's up with that even davoo is confused um but it's the music also it basically you know how

1003
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:14,080
like last time i was talking about how delta rune is like i don't really care about like the meta

1004
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:19,120
stuff in undertale delta rune is just scratches an itch that doesn't get scratched generally

1005
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:25,360
of like nice characters and quirky setting with like you know easy enough gameplay and this is

1006
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:30,640
basically davoo's like was it an attempt to do that he didn't know delta room was coming out

1007
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:36,400
obviously none of us did and so his like game uh coming out was like uh unfortunate but it is

1008
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:42,320
it is the same sort of delta rune scratching sort of you know not like a huge game like an hour

1009
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:50,080
two hours but it's it's very much in that same vein of like quirky fun and simple and it's great

1010
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,680
and i really like it and it's a really good job dude i think it's really cool i'm actually super

1011
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,520
fucking excited to go play i think i wish i had a chance to before the episode but i'm definitely

1012
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:02,000
gonna do it right after it's really cool that some of us are like making games like a bunch of us are

1013
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,360
making games and yeah like i anything that's not a youtube video because i'm like so over

1014
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,880
like youtube videos in and of themselves as a thing yeah yeah like people who fucking make

1015
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:18,880
games and draw and shit that's cool man it's cool i want to do cool stuff like that and speaking of

1016
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:24,640
drawing let's talk about here's a topic let's talk about my sweet new drawing tablet yeah courtesy

1017
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:29,680

1019

1020
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,600
i don't know we if you want we could certainly put some in the show and draw cast or a specific

1021
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,680
thing if yeah we'll look at the show notes if you want to yeah if you want to go out i don't know

1022
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:52,240
what i'm gonna do with these yet if i'm gonna like make a place to upload them all or something or

1023
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:57,680
like uh i don't know because i thought it'd be cool to have like a webcomic or something and i've

1024
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:02,480
mostly been drawn like weird like weird monsters and like weird self portraits of me being fat on

1025
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:08,080
the beach and stuff with like uh i mean there's always handy stuff just to host them yeah i do have

1026
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,720
an old devian art page that they have an upload i'm working on a batman comic right now like a

1027
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:20,640
like a big like a long i don't know maybe three pages okay like a batman comic and it's it's called

1028
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:31,040
the joker rapes at midnight the plot it sounds good the plot of it is that the joker you know he

1029
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:38,560
hijacks the news feed or whatever he makes an ultimatum he says tonight i'm either going to rape

1030
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:49,280
1000 babies or i'm gonna rape batman so if batman cares about this city he will offer his ass to me

1031
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:56,240
and that's the the dilemma that batman has to is one man's pride worth a thousand babies virginities

1032
01:34:56,240 --> 01:35:02,480
we're gonna find out in the joker rapes at midnight well that sounds fascinating just jesse is this

1033
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:08,880
gonna be the beginning of of a revival of double batman and triple joker yes oh yeah we're gonna

1034
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:14,480
get some real shit now that would be glorious it would be glorious and then i yeah i was thinking

1035
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:20,720
like man if i really like just started drawing batman comics like i wonder what i could legally

1036
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:25,200
do with them like could i publish them in something if they were like technically a parody because

1037
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:30,160
like i'm not sure yeah i don't know you just just change a letter only one way to find out dude

1038
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:35,200
yeah because that would be awesome to like release a book of like com like a fucking comic book that

1039
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:41,120
would be the coolest shit ever that would be fucking dope well fucking fantastic i can't wait

1040
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:47,600
to see it uh i guess let's go to the next question here uh this is one from a fan of the show never

01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:54,560
paint friend draw reliable draw guy draws all kinds of cool stuff check him out uh let's see what he has to say

1042
01:35:56,240 --> 01:36:01,840
pcp dating sim is a really good project i'm designing detailed background art right now

1043
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:09,280

be your perfect dating location doesn't need to have any ties to reality answers are appreciated oh man

1045
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:23,280
my ideal dating location would be on the set of joker rapes at midnight

1046
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:34,000
so so never paint here is advertising the pcp dating sim shit what was the twitter link for that

1047
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,480
i think was pcp dating at pcp dating i'm gonna go double check but so apparently it's real people

1048
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,520
are working on it confirmed by never paint here yeah at pcp dating that's the one i'm not sure i

1049
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:50,560

1052
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:09,920
sure sure um but hey it's already happening and we can't stop my ideal dating scenario would be a

1053
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:15,840
national land or a sort of government building maybe a statue moments before a terrorist attack

1054
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:20,560
so when we start to get in the mood and maybe we kiss for the first time the bombs start to drop

1055
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:25,920
that sounds good i maybe you could time your orgasm with instant death that'd be ideal whoa

1056
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,800
whoa that's a step that's a step too far that i would say nothing about orgasm okay you're right

1057
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,040
you're right i'm getting carried away here forgive me uh my ideal on my wedding night i

1058
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:40,640
want a 9-11 to happen at the moment of climax that would be ideal uh my ideal dating scenario

1059
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:46,000
would be like a proper lap like an actual lap like not like dungeons and dragons would like uh-huh i

1060
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,640
got you with lightning ball like you get like a real like suit of armor you get your your real

1061
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:55,440
like torches with the flames on them and you're like oh yes i'm i'm staying in character for a

1062
01:37:55,440 --> 01:38:00,000
whole month and i'm out here in the fields like i got a real tent and i'm like that that that would

1063
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,520
be the real shit and you got like i mean you got the phone swords because you don't want to kill

1064
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:08,160
anyone but you got a real sword that is for show and you're like oh yes it's real sharp guys

1065
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:16,080
that's that and then okay that'll be that that's the one my my ideal one would be is basically imagine

1066
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:21,200
like a pretty nature scene with like a river and forest and stuff like that except everything is

1067
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:28,640
pastel purple and sparkly sounds good of course of course mine would be like it's like a like a

1068
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:34,960
beautiful like a like a scottish glen like like the highlands or everything's green and it's like

1069
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:40,960
overlooking cliffs and stuff and it's all beautiful and serene but also you can see planets in the

1070
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:46,080
sky so you know that you're not on earth and oh yeah and also there's like a maybe like a dinosaur

1071
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:56,400
somewhere and like a big fucking another dinosaur what if you're both riding dinosaurs yeah oh that

1072
01:38:56,400 --> 01:39:01,200
would be nice the dinosaurs um some of them have saddles because it's we've tamed them

1073
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:06,320
in this society on this planet that i've invented just now have you tamed them or they tamed you

1074
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:12,000
that's the question um i think it's a uh it's like a uh a symbiotic relationship i think we've tamed

1075
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,400
each other we bring out the best in each other man and dinosaurs i don't know why i said lark for

1076
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:23,120
some reason like like it was it was said you could be like random like uh not real places could be

1077
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:27,840
i would be like the the scene from game of thrones where john gets stabbed i want to reenact

1078
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,640
that who is john who's john that's you in this situation that's the question that's the eternal

1079
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:41,120
question they'll have to figure that out i don't know i'm thinking i guess just on the on the on the

1080
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:46,480
bow of a spaceship hurtling off toward adventure uh to to parts unknown to discover the wonders of

1081
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:52,800
the universe uh i mean pretty simple but yeah that's literally what i want to be doing with

1082
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:58,640
life oh that's a good answer secrets i'm gonna change my answer to that in fact oh everyone in space

1083
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,800
my okay i i want to change my my dream date scenario would be we're getting home you know we're

1084
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,640
you know maybe maybe we're getting a little bit frisky you and me on name player you know maybe we're

1085
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:14,880
getting we're getting the mood then we turn the corner and and and and then before we can even

1086
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:19,360
register total shock fills our body and then solider creek says what are you doing in this

1087
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:27,360
video and instead of having sexual relations like how we thought we actually have to pretend

1088
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:33,040
that we're reviewing a movie oh shit oh shit yeah yeah yeah i would be like in an angry video game

1089
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:37,840
nerd episode i've changed mine as well i'm gonna be in the video game den i'm gonna point out like

1090
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:42,160

1091
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:50,080
i'm sure ben ben would be uh uh at the fanciest of restaurants out back by the dumpster overflowing

1092
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:54,880
with leftovers and ingredients it's just it's a it's a smorgasbord out there

1093
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:59,760
with the fun oh literally lady in the tramp situation literally lady in the tramp that's

1094
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:04,240
actually romantic so you know what that totally works yeah and then i'd be like i'd be like on a

1095
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:08,880
beach like a tropical hawaiian beach where all the girls are like beautiful and there's only girls

1096
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:15,120
and there's no other boys but me but but like also it's not just a beach it's also it's also in

1097
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:21,200
like a plastic dome in space and so it's like a it's like a space station of domes with different

1098
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:26,240
ecosystems in them and so you can you can go in the tubes like hamster tubes from one to the other

1099
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:32,000
to get from the beach to the skiing slope and stuff and also there's like like little graves

1100
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,320
on the beach because there was like a normandy situation at some point so there's little like

1101
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:40,720
little white crosses all along the shoreline that does sound good that does sound good oh you

1102
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:45,200
could also go for some like end of eva imagery with those crosses out in the distance oh yeah there's

1103
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:49,680
also an avangelion beach but that's different from the tropical beach there's many domes there's

1104
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:58,400
many domes in my space station many domes that's the name of my book i just want a cyberpunk future

1105
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:04,320
where i have like robot prosthetics i live forever and i have a robot dong that can be as big as

1106
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:09,520
it needs to be because that's that's a little point of cybernetics anyways right i want tom

1107
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:15,040
sexing to be like you know those extremely overly animated like robo combination animations they do

1108
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:22,080
in the old super robot animations uh it'd be that only robo pop with robo vagina and just like like

1109
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:32,400
animated animated 24 fps on ones like overly detailed flying yeah tom's date area should be uh you

1110
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,880
show up to the pre uh you know determined meeting place you know maybe like a fancy restaurant or

1111
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,520
something and then you're like where's tom then it cuts back to him debugging his game looking at the

1112
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:46,800
time and like oh well i fucked up i mean going back oh just like just like flubber with robo with uh

1113
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,880
you know he was always late and forgot dates and stuff because he actually doesn't give a

1114
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:55,440
shit even though he says it's because he's quote unquote so in love yeah that makes sense i don't

1115
01:42:55,440 --> 01:43:00,240
buy it you're a bad husband or whatever uh all right well that's everybody let's go to the next

hello friends if uh if uh our lovely uh dearly friendly neighborhood hypocrite is looking for

1118
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:22,640
a new show to watch uh then perhaps you should check out hilda on netflix as it is similar to the

1119
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:30,320
steven universe uh a pantheon of cartoons you see so he might enjoy it and it also is all out at

1120
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:36,240
once so it's the opposite of steven universe yeah i can't tell i can't tell if he's doing a cool

1121
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:45,920
voice or if he's just cool yeah what do they say hilda hilda yeah i heard good things about it so

1124
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:01,840
i look pretty i never i don't know it's a great finish it yeah it was really good

1125
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,920
dude i just watched the fucking season two of the castlevania show it was

1126
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:12,160
i'm watching it please don't spoil okay i won't spoil it but like i couldn't believe how good it

1127
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:17,120
was because i didn't really watch season one i i sort of like skimmed through like the first

1128
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:20,480
episode and i saw like the a la carte episode where he's introduced but that's really like

1129
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:25,120
all i saw of it so i just kind of jumped into season two without fucking knowing anything

1130
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:31,520
and like it was like such a ride it was so like good like there was so much character like even

1131
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:38,320
everyone had like a backstory and a personality like even even like the underlings of like the bad

1132
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:44,640
guys had like their own little like arcs and stuff there was like a whole pretty dope like half the

1133
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:50,160
series was like a la carte and fucking what's his face and the lady girl trevor and cypher trevor

1134
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:56,320
come on hang it cool look man i'm i'm uh old i don't remember names of characters and shows

1135
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:01,920
anymore that's like a dad thing so i just like say like the fat one as so like so like half of it

1136
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:07,200
was them in a in a library like talking and like jiffing and jiving with each other and like you

1137
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:12,800
know well you're a jerk well you're my friend too buddy and so the but then the other half was like

1138
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:17,760
in in draculous camp and all of his like underlings and all of his spooky friends and they're all

1139
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,840
like bickering amongst themselves and they're all like plotting and scheming under each other and

1140
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,560
like backstabbing each other and i'm like this is just this is just a good fucking time that sounds

1141
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:34,000
like it sounds like um like orcs from mode of the rings sort of yeah yeah yeah that's cool

1142
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:39,680
oh right there's another show that i watched uh just last night because i was at a person's house

1143
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:44,240
and everyone fell asleep and i'm always the last one to fall asleep so there was a tv in front of me

1144
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:47,520
so i ended up watching this show that i never heard of called Norseman

1145
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:55,760
and it's like uh it's like a scandinavian horseman hey it's like a scandinavian show and it's like

1146
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,840
like like sort of like a game of thrones or a vikings type show like you think it's like that

1147
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:05,280
but it's a comedy and it's like it's like it's sort of like flight of the concords but vikings

1148
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:08,880
oh shit and like that sounds great yeah the tone of it was like that really like awkward like

1149
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:14,880
everyone's kind of a doof comedy but like it had like a really cool balance of tone where like

1150
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:21,920
it's really really funny and silly and absurd but also when they start killing people it is like

1151
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:25,920
it's done like straight like a real like vikings are killing people and it's scary

1152
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:30,880
kind of show it's like it was a really well done i liked it and i watched like the whole

1153
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:35,440
first season in bed and it was a good time it reminds me a little bit of uh this manga

1154
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:41,440
vinland saga that i think is getting an anime i'm pretty sure um and uh i don't know yeah it mostly

1155
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:45,520
was serious viking stuff which was really great and i loved it but then there was some humor so

1156
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:50,320
whatever it was good it was good all right uh all right let's go to the next question this is from

1157
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:56,400
nibbo the hoe or is it nibbo the hoe oh my god that's the emissary of education a concert it is

1158
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:05,680
we're welcome please educate us this one goes out to nate and digipro uh you guys are the only

1159
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:12,240
two people that have ever thought about what would it be like to be your kid or what would it be like

1160
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:20,720
to have you as my dad and for nate i think um it's just he'd be a quirky guy quirky dad but

1161
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:29,920
but overall really good except for that he gives way too many lectures and for digipro um well god

1162
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:39,920
he's just gonna be shit dad he's gonna he's gonna have his kids doing things they don't want to do

1163
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:47,360
from from his from his happiness projection he's gonna be wrong and he's gonna tell them wrong

1164
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:55,520
things uh that's my prediction it's truth they'll have no one to tell them that their dad is wrong

1165
01:47:56,240 --> 01:48:02,000
talk to my dad's shit cut this out you're damn right i included that because you aren't here to

1166
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:08,560
defend yourself digi ha ha take that i like the idea of i i just like the image of instead of like a

1167
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:14,160
dad forcing his kids to play sports he's forcing them to make youtube vlogs and review anime and

1168
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:21,680
shit like daddy i want to know where 3.0 is coming it's coming we have to be on the cutting edge of it

1169
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:28,000
dad you've been saying that for the past 19 years my existence no no it's coming i want to run around

1170
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:34,160
outside and look at bunnies yeah they're just gonna have to tell them what you think about what to do

1171
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:39,600
with it it's gonna be whatever you can see you can see rabbits on google image search a little

1172
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:44,880
bastard so so dad i started reading some history books and i started you know researching some

1173
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:49,520
math textbooks what do you think what's the point of being we're being smart why aren't you fucking

1174
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:57,840
what's the point of being right how are you with me son are you with me i feel like digi's son or

1175
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:04,160
daughter is going to become a doctor just to spite him get the most education possible it's

1176
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:09,040
usually how it works like like fuck you dad i'll be exactly the opposite oh my god can you can you

1177
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:16,080
imagine the the fucking just like like like screw you it would get if digi has a son or a daughter

1178
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:21,200
and they are determined to go to college and he has to co-sign on those loans and pay back all that

1179
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:30,480
money oh my god i want to have a kid now this has to happen okay imagine like nate you want to be a

1180
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:35,280
father too and i have ingredients of the same thing but this is not the way like this is not

1181
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:41,600
munchy and nate best man are going to have children you know this is gonna be pretty far in the future

1182
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:45,920
not like you know like a billion years or anything but this isn't like i would say that i mean i mean

1183
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,440
me i'm just gonna refer to you because it would be it's weird to refer to myself you know you're

1184
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:54,400
gonna have like a you know like a few fucking years like you know probably i mean i want to be

1185
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:58,960
probably five or something you're probably gonna change a whole bunch in that time but digi wants

1186
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:05,680
to have a child like now and it will be digi bro having the child it will not be digi man well

1187
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:12,240
the youtuber man digi bro in his current state of not being able to like wake up in the morning

1188
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:17,760
and drinking constantly that would be a father for an actual human being it's gonna be the future

1189
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,600
vlogs it's just gonna have like a like the reflective glasses gonna have a baby in one

1190
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:29,280
corner and then and then maze button the other at all times and he'll make that his icon

1191
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:35,040
oh that would be pretty fun that would be pretty fucking sick thoroughly roasted digi show up next

1192
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:41,040
time to defend yourself that's all i have to say all right uh what do we got next a feast for hands

1193
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:51,120
a feast for hands h and d s uh tell us your thoughts hello i believe i can be a broker

1194
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:59,680
between the two parties of this pcp union you have here see for for star fleets to truly

1195
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:07,120
come into into fomention i don't think it is to be created the the power with of dreams

1196
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:11,360
have to be harnessed as the fuel source of this new advanced society

1197
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:22,320
thus the violet nathans will rise as a new fusion from the tarah hearings yes just like the

1198
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:32,800
animes that are watched what a worthwhile comment the violet nathans the violet nathans um well i did

1199
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:39,120
choose to play that so i guess i'm the one at fault um what the fuck get moving on decimated i apologize

1200
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:50,000
uh uh uh jevil man this is from jevil man um deltarune character yeah he guys deltarune

1201
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,480
alternative theorist here i just wanted to point out that when you you guys said that

1202
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:01,280
when during the asriel potential reveal that you know susie didn't really react but if you look at

1203
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:07,440
her sprite she's all hunched back you know she's got her arms all twisted up like she's nervous and

1204
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:13,680
her eyes are bigger than bowling balls so i think you guys need to really reanalyze the scene if you

1205
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:20,800
really want to be games or extensions of games as well as it will i don't appreciate my status

1213
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:26,800
you know on this day of which i am delivering pizzas as i currently do that i wondered i pondered

1214
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:38,000
i thought the most important of questions does pcp sled gang do they stand atop the white

1215
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:43,680
sled and conquer the mountains with a plastic is an agarral and foam foam

1216
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:52,000
match to carry i know one to three humans do they talk about a sled i think that's a pcp sled gang

1217
01:53:53,440 --> 01:54:00,880
this is what we need to know i think he's currently sledding like in the episode i think he was

1218
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:05,760
well maybe i thought he was talking about delivering if you deliver pizzas on a sled that's

1219
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:11,280
pretty funny that's pretty big the pizza shops at the top of the mountain and he has to that's

1220
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:16,080
the fast sleds down to any individual house um make sense we that was like a fucking

1221
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:24,480
yeah that guy i don't know that was just that was like a oh chilling and killing my sweet anabelle

1222
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:30,800
on the cliffs over the sea i think what he was getting at is we should make a jamaican

1223
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:39,600
bobsled team he's right uh oh can i be the sled dude plenty big enough yeah that's true

1224
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:45,280
um i'm more interested in everyone's fucking voices than their actual questions i don't even

1225
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:50,720
know the questions are i always like to include the the diversity of voices here it's nice it

1226
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:59,520
adds a lot of depth to the episode let's see what number eight hideyasu has for us you guys tend to

1227
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:04,240
refer to the pcp as a sort of friendship simulator yeah i completely agree because anyone who's willing

1228
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:09,120
to listen to this dumpster fiverr podcast clearly has some issues to sort out myself included my

1229
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:13,200
problem with this is that i have yet to find anybody who has the same interests and works on the same

1230
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:17,120
wavelength that i do so while this may be a friendship simulator it's not like i have many

1231
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:22,080
other options available to me i like the few friends that i do have but frankly they don't have much

1232
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:25,680
to offer besides the fact that they're just fun to hang out with they're not the type of people who

1233
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:30,080
are going to give me advice and help me with my goals etc etc and they're not willing to listen

1234
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:34,800
to my advice how can i find friends to have more intelligent and meaningful discussion

1235
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,240
so that i can finally quit listening to this podcast and do something more valuable sometimes

1236
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:45,760
yeah okay i think just find people however it however difficult that may be find people who

1237
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:50,160
are like into the most obscure shit that you're also into because they'll probably be on a deeper

1238
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:57,040
wavelength yeah that's probably true uh i mean question look look into yourself and ask yourself

1239
01:55:57,040 --> 01:56:02,800
how many people do you actually meet day to day because they have numbers probably quite low

1240
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,240
so you're probably not exposing yourself to a lot of people which is understandable if you're young

1241
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:12,640
and stuff uh joint clubs uh hang out on forums with like-minded people and uh you just meet

1242
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:15,840
more people because you'll meet a lot of shitty people who don't you don't care about and they

1243
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:20,800
don't aren't cool but that will expose you to an opportunity to meet more good people i guess so

1244
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:27,840
yeah do most of the people who are like what like no one relates to me like like there's no one that

1245
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:33,520
is on the same like unbelievably genius wavelength that i am there's no one that knows the real deep

1246
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:39,280
shit they're like you know the truly obscure stuff like 4chan.net like no one understands like i do

1247
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:45,280
yeah uh most of the time they just are in their room and don't even make an attempt to fucking

1248
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:50,960
actually meet people and you expect to bump into your best friend at the supermarket whenever you

1249
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:57,360
do are forced to leave your room i'm not saying that's what you are i'm just saying you like

1250
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:04,800
i think everyone everyone in the world who has the sentiment overestimates how hard it is to

1251
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:11,360
meet like-minded people because there aren't like you okay i don't mean this like a derogatory way

1252
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:18,880
but you aren't that special dude you aren't that fucking crazy or that obscure or that insane

1253
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:22,800
that no one's going to be able to get what you're putting down unless you're talking to people who

1254
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:28,400
legitimately just don't get it which i'm sure is the vast majority people but i'm saying not that

1255
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:34,160
fucking hard go on a forum find your what are your interests go to a forum oh but i don't want to go

1256
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:40,000
on a forum because that's fucking gay okay you aren't making an attempt to find new people you

1257
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,760
you don't want to go out to a club because oh they wouldn't get it anyway like you want to go out to

1258
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,840
your fucking college club you want to go out to any you know flyers down the street or whatever

1259
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:51,760
you're not making the attempt if you don't do that then you can't fucking say that you're trying

1260
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:56,080
your best to make friends because what are you doing you're saying that you can't make friends and

1261
01:57:56,080 --> 01:58:01,360
then stay in the house making a self-fulfilling prophecy if you want to have people relate to

1262
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:09,280
you fucking try at all and you will find people very soon i don't think that uh this podcast

1263
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:15,360
or any podcast should be used as a replacement for like actual relationships and actual friends

1264
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:19,760
and it sounds like this guy like has friends he just feels like he's not getting like

1265
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:24,720
deep conversations out of them or like talking about the real shit but i think this is what might

1266
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:30,400
be one of the situations where the best the most valuable thing you can do is nothing because i think

1267
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:37,120
that like being like having all the same interests and having like big deep like conversations is

1268
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:43,040
overrated and what really matters is just being with your friends at all and even doing nothing

1269
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:48,560
like you'll regret not taking every opportunity to just be around the people who like you regardless

1270
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:54,400
of whether you're fucking talking about fucking issues or whatever you know completely agree with

1271
01:58:54,400 --> 01:59:00,320
you jesse just in human interaction all with your friends is good i would even say if you aren't

1272
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:05,840
getting like the deep conversations you want maybe you can instigate that i mean i mean don't just

1273
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:09,920
wait for it to happen just don't wait for your friends to bring up things that are you know heavy

1274
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:14,560
hitting if you want to do that and it's not weird and obviously you're talking about spider man talking

1275
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:19,680
about you know oh man spider home home come so good don't bring out how your father's dead and

1276
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:25,920
your and your dog shot himself just if the mood's right try and do that yourself like bring up the

1277
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:31,120
things that interest you because guaranteed if your friends aren't shitters then they'll care about you

1278
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:36,880
and they'll want to hear what's on your mind i don't think he he said something in there um

1279
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:40,960
he said something about his friends not being willing to listen to his advice so i get that this

1280
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:45,360
guy wants to think about like making it and probably like making progress and growing and

1281
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:50,320
developing as a person and he wants people that share that interest it's possible that you're an

1282
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:54,480
asshole and you're not that smart or interesting that's definitely possible and that's why they're

1283
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:59,520
not listening but it's also part that they legitimately don't share your interest which is

1284
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:03,760
fine like you know like sure if they're your friends you can enjoy hanging out with them but

1285
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:09,440
if you really just don't have friends that you connect with yes you've you've got to go find the

1286
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:14,240
people i guess or at the very least challenge the people that are your current friends in in new

1287
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:18,800
ways try to get them involved in things maybe see if they take because i mean i had lots of friends

1288
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:24,080
in in college that like i would try to do stuff i mean i was not like a productive god but i'd try

1289
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:28,080
to do some things some people were interested some people weren't i mean okay so now you know

1290
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:31,920
which people you're more interested in hanging around with and like people who like contribute

1291
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:35,920
to what you're trying to do uh you can hang out with them more and people who don't like it's fine

1292
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:40,400
it's not a judgment you know just hang out with the people who do what you want to do more uh and

1293
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:46,160
and most importantly yeah i say make new friends go out do things put yourself in situations where

1294
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:50,080
you meet people because if you're just home be in sad you've got a zero percent chance of meeting

1295
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:56,480
people that you like hanging out with if you do anything at all go out um join clubs join forums

1296
02:00:56,480 --> 02:01:01,760
talk to people uh maybe go to like meetup.com or something like try to find places where like-minded

1297
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:06,560
people are gathering it's easier than ever to find people of common interest to you it's literally

1298
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:14,560
clicks away clicks away also i don't think that you should um expect or desire to have your advice

1299
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:20,160
listened to by your friends or anyone advice is like the worst like you don't want to be the guy

1300
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:27,200
who gives advice because nobody wants advice ever advice is totally worthless because no matter

1301
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:32,080
how much you think that your outside perspective will help you don't know the person you're not in

1302
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:35,920
their brain you don't know every facet of it so they're gonna hear your advice and go you

1303
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:40,880
fucking idiot you don't know it's not that fucking simple like that's true nobody ever wants to hear

1304
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:44,800
advice all anyone wants to hear if they're like having a hard time and they're like confiding in

1305
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:49,360
you or coming to you all they want is to be listened to and be heard they don't necessarily

1306
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:53,760
want you to like throw oh well you should do this at them because nobody wants that

1307
02:01:53,760 --> 02:02:03,200
shit it's obnoxious the the pcp has always been like a like a like a uh a voice for kind of niche

1308
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:07,840
and an off-color opinion that's always been this case and i realized that i just gave the advice

1309
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:12,240
not to give advice i realized the contradiction don't try to call me out on it i'm fucking self-aware

1310
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:18,400
a lot of people who watch the piece a lot of fans of the pcp have been genuinely like

1311
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:25,440
indoctrinated in a way to firmly believe all like the the foundational beliefs of the pcp

1312
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:30,800
a lot of that i don't even believe that growing up on starfleet and shit like that which and and so

1313
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:36,800
i just want to say for the record well of course having people who you know are our goal-oriented

1314
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:41,520
people who are doing their shift obviously this is beneficial we've talked about this for a

1315
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:48,080
fucking a billion episodes at this point you know what we hold to be true and what we what we expect

1316
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:56,800
and what we like as a as a consciousness here but it is not to diminish the fact that it is

1317
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:05,040
extremely valuable to have friends who are just funny or kind yeah being a kind person who is

1318
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:10,480
nice and generous or would give you the clothes you know clothes off their back if you need them

1319
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:16,640
that is an extremely valuable type of person to have because they're fucking nice kindness is not

1320
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:21,360
often regarded here in these circles which is not like a bad thing we're talking about other things

1321
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:25,680
but kind of trumps everything those things are good and listen to your friends and just don't

1322
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:32,240
expect them to be like the pcp appreciate them for what they are and that's probably nice people yeah

1323
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:36,320
you kind of want to have the people like that around you for sure because like the problem with

1324
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:41,520
having nothing but creative people around you is like especially like people like like for

1325
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:46,240
myself for like artistically obsessed with their work is that their work is always going to come

1326
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:50,880
first and like that's going to be their number one concern and so if soup comes to nuts they're

1327
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:55,600
going to fucking abandon you to work on their shit if you have friends you need a mixture of people

1328
02:03:55,600 --> 02:04:00,000
who are creative who will help inspire you if you have those kind of aspirations but you also need

1329
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,320
people who are just like friendly that you can just like when you need to take a break you have

1330
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:08,080
somebody who like isn't going to in the back of their mind like you like i got to get back to work

1331
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:12,320
eventually like this is the work the work is being social and having a good time because that's

1332
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:16,640
what they want to do in their lives part of that will rub off on you and you will stop being so

1333
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:20,640
artistically obsessed with your work and you can find that balance that you might not naturally have

1334
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:24,400
one of my best friends in real life has no aspirations other than playing video games and

1335
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:29,200
doing his job and for some reason like when i hang out with him it just clicks like we hang out

1336
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:32,640
once in a blue moon because he's like living his real life he's like a therapist he like went to

1337
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:37,840
like real school and shit um but like absolutely we grew up as kids like pretty close by we just

1338
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:42,480
went to the game shop store and played cards and shit and like when we hang out it's just that

1339
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:46,640
again and all of my cares go away and i'm just hanging out with my friend that i've known for

1340
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:50,240
like 15 years i'm not thinking about art just thinking about playing games having a good time

1341
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:54,640
and like i'm very rarely in that headspace and it's super healthy and i wish he was closer so we

1342
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:59,360
could do it more often because it is good to have that back i absolutely man i know the exact

1343
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:04,880
feel i just last night went and saw one like my best friend from high school who i never see anymore

1344
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:09,840
like the first time i've seen him in like a year and a half maybe and like what you said it was just

1345
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:15,280
this like feeling of like oh i'm like out of it for one night i'm out of the internet i'm out of

1346
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:20,720
my fucking room i'm out of this creative shit i'm just with a person who is my friend and who

1347
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:25,440
was kind and we like each other and we can fucking get drunk and like fucking hug each other and be

1348
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:29,760
like oh i fucking love you and i miss you you fucking bastard it's the most important thing

1349
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:37,600
in the world like kindness trumps everything fuck anyone who is creative fuck anyone who thinks that

1350
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:43,200
they're smarter than you or who has an attitude or who is arrogant or who is like a just like an

1351
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:48,560
asshole fuck anyone who has like delusions of grandeur none of it is all bullshit like kindness

1352
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:53,520
is the ultimate human trait it's the only thing you need just like don't fucking expect things out

1353
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:58,720
of your friends except for kindness that's the only thing that matters just be with them and

1354
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:06,240
fucking fucking watch football or some gay shit i have a venn diagram i have a venn diagram in my

1355
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:11,360
head of of people who are useful to me and then people who are my friends these are separate

1356
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:18,560
categories but there is a overlap between i like yes a venn diagram exactly yeah i i get what you're

1357
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:25,840
what you're laying down i'm on it i'm in it and and oh and final point wait sorry i just i was

1358
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:29,360
going to say the only the only thing i wanted to make about this whole friendship thing is uh

1359
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:33,760
it's possible you're underestimating your friends so i'm just going to say don't forget that you do

1360
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:38,560
need to cultivate friendships to get more kind of out of them so don't expect you just meet someone

1361
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:43,120
and they're an npc and you can immediately exhaust all their dialogue and ideas so you know just be

1362
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:47,840
aware that friendships need to grow before people will share some things with you or their stuff so

1363
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:52,080
it's possible you just met these quote-unquote friends that you described like yesterday and

1364
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:56,240
so it's natural for them to not you know be be sharing everything they got so i'm just saying

1365
02:06:56,240 --> 02:07:00,880
don't underestimate them don't assume they got nothing going on and ancillary ancillary to like

1366
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:10,960
all of this advice like this is secondary not not as important but um the the there's one like

1367
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:18,400
pretty it's not easy but like a simple way to like attract people that you like more or are like

1368
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:24,960
minded is is just to be a better version of yourself like to be the coolest guy in the room so like

1369
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:31,120
maybe work on improving how cool you are and how charismatic you are and how much uh you know how

1370
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:36,800
much how many people gravitate towards you it would just make it easier than you being kind of lame

1371
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:42,960
and having to go up to everyone very true that's very true you know i i always think of something

1372
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:49,600
that like um people like what what we were saying before about like people being sort of indoctrinated

1373
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:56,640
into like pcp like stuff that we've said like not everything that we've said as is like meant to be

1374
02:07:56,640 --> 02:08:02,160
taken totally seriously like this has always been kind of a comedy podcast like there's i know there's

1375
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:07,600
stuff that i've said especially in early episodes of this podcast that i would like probably vehemently

1376
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:13,520
disagree with now or that i have like totally the opposite stance on like sometimes i've had people

1377
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:17,360
like it's the worst when someone agrees with something that you said years ago that you no

1378
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:22,640
longer fucking yeah even remember you said let alone agree with like i've had people going like

1379
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:28,480
oh man like remember what jesse said sometimes about how like uh people who aren't creative

1380
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:33,280
aren't real people i totally agree with that and it's like no don't agree with that's the worst

1381
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:38,400
thing i've ever said that's the most evil thing that's ever come out of my mouth except for what i

1382
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:44,560
said to the carny lady when i was kid that was totally different i i've had numerous experiences

1383
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:49,200
very recently when fans would come up to me like say like and like say like one like post like i'm

1384
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:53,040
sorry like i'm so sorry i'm so sorry like i know that you're so fucking busy right now and i shouldn't

1385
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:56,800
be messing with you at all like like i like i understand that i'm a fan but um and then they

1386
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:01,280
go on to like they're like really well thought out and like cool like yeah i get that too like i

1387
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:06,640
get comments where it's like oh man i hope jesse doesn't ban me for this but i really like this

1388
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:16,720
video and i like it dear god i i'm sorry i'm sorry for banning anyone ever yeah i i i just want

1389
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:22,960
everyone to know that i i do not hate fans i i've never even been the one to say that just

1390
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:28,400
in the pcp and people think that's what they think no you can talk to me whatever you want it's

1391
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:33,680
literally i love talking to people on my discord on twitter like that's the interaction's great

1392
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:40,560
because yeah if you're nice to me then i like you that's it i prefer to interact with people like i

1393
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:46,960
either over twitter dms or in groups on discord i don't like people PMing me or DMing me on discord

1394
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:51,840
out of nowhere that's kind of scary i don't know how i'm down i'm down with that i don't care it's

1395
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:56,880
cool if you got stuff you want to say to me you know questions or whatever just something that you

1396
02:09:56,880 --> 02:10:01,920
thought i'd be interested in or i don't know whatever my my discord's fucking public use just

1397
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:09,200
like my ex wife sure showed her i think literally all of us have like a private discord or not a

1398
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:15,200
private but like a specific to us discord yeah and i'm like i'm i get along with all the people in

1399
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:19,680
there they have yeah all the people in my discord are cool shit they're they're fucking cool shoutouts

1400
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:26,160
to everybody in there call call into the pcp call into the pcp you have good voices you have funny

1401
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:32,320
voices i really feel like what that what that kid was saying um in that voicemail about like feeling

1402
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:36,720
like his friends aren't like stimulating him intellectually like he wants because like i feel

1403
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:40,720
like i used to be kind of in the same place where like i got in a mode for a couple years where i was

1404
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:45,360
like man i i don't have anything in common with my friends anymore i have more in common with my

1405
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:49,920
creative friends on the internet but like like a couple years after that like that was just like a

1406
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:54,960
phase for like a couple years and then like after that like i'm back to now i think that all creative

1407
02:10:54,960 --> 02:11:00,240
people are fucking evil narcissists and sociopaths who should fucking bleed out and die in the street

1408
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:05,040
and like regular people who just work regular jobs and like are cool on the weekends those are my

1409
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:10,880
people that's who i want to be around now so i've totally i've totally flipped the pig on that one

1410
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:18,320
i've totally flipped kill them all that's what i say uh all right let's go to the next call let's

1411
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:25,440
go to the next call there's two more this one's from pcp fan unconditional hate guy so let's uh

1412
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:32,160
let's get ready for a roasting thoroughly hey guys this season of the pcp has been pretty

1413
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:37,440
fucking great for like a character motivation sense so keep that shit up i mean i know y'all are just

1414
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:44,000
faking your lives um but anyways i just wanted to say i think it's really fucking rich uh that digi

1415
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:51,600
thinks that uh having a child is any less of a risk than college in fact it has just about the same

1416
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:58,640
potential downsides but greater so like if we're gonna grill someone who's like 18 and everyone

1417
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:02,160
everyone in their fucking lives remembers when they were 18 and they didn't know what the fuck

1418
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:06,400
they were gonna do with their lives even if you got advice you don't have to beat a man into the

1419
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:11,120
ground when basically he's going because his mom wants him to go it's gonna happen so if we could

1420
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:19,440
just yeah hear that this kind of good stuff but wow that kind of sounded like victor like in disguise

1421
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:26,960
calling in to yell at his brother uh well whatever i mean you know i did you made his points fair

1422
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:32,400
enough he was clearly drunk i think he'd probably walk back a good bit of that no no no no no no

1423
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:37,440
you know i don't he was he was pretty much on the same wavelength in person when we had that

1424
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:45,280
discussion before okay yeah all right i gotta say i really just don't get the whole um like

1425
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:50,560
just saying like i want to have kids or i'm not gonna have kids like deciding one or the other

1426
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:56,960
like i guess it's cuz like i agree i come from a background where having kids is not something

1427
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:05,200
that people decide right right so like i don't know like my view on on on it is like i'm just gonna

1428
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:11,600
keep fucking and if a kid pops out then that's gonna be all right okay it's not that hard to not have

1429
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:16,960
a baby it's not it's not yeah like just keep fucking people and if it happens it happens you got that

1430
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:29,120
problem just keep fucking just keep fucking um well in the comparison of the comparison of having

1431
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:33,280
a kid to going to college that you know kind of makes sense it kind of makes sense because you

1432
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:39,040
don't know i mean i guess anyone who wants to have a kid it's not someone who wants to run for political

1433
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:43,600
office all right that you kind of have to have an ego in that you're you think you'll do a good job

1434
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:47,120
you know at least a little bit or you're just not worried about it i guess it's like rolling

1435
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:51,120
the dice twice you're rolling it wants to have a kid and then you're rolling it again to see if

1436
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:55,360
they want to go to college as well so basically you could get both bad sides you could get the

1437
02:13:55,360 --> 02:14:01,360
you could like it could be like twice double i mean it's obviously expensive to have like just

1438
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:06,000
put in cold terms having a kid definitely costs money in time fair enough it costs love i guess

1439
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:12,800
if you can produce that i can't relate um and uh uh yeah you don't know i i'm pretty convinced

1440
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:18,000
i'll be a decent dad i mean i could be totally wrong i could be wrong about that i think i'm

1441
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:22,560
going to try to prioritize what's best for it parenthood really needs a free demo what the

1442
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:26,720
fuck i would love a free demo that'd be really nice it'd be really actually i kind of am doing

1443
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:32,560
that with a dog uh you know it's my responsibility the demo that tested it out a little bit you know

1444
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:37,600
that's fair it's going so pretty well so far except he's pooping a lot uh all over the place

1445
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:46,000
inside gotta straighten him out real quick he pulls out gun um yeah so i don't know you know what

1446
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:52,160
fair i that's a relatively fair point um i think digi happens to hate college for personal reasons

1447
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:57,040
i probably am similar in that boat a lot of a lot of personal reasons coming for me as to why

1448
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:02,640
i'm not a big fan um just move on just move on normal college ever no please the memes that

1449
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:08,000
years ago he's right all right he he is right okay okay we got one more call one more voicemail

1479
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:21,040
immediately follow up with this discussion well that's an idea that you should take and run with

1480
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:27,360
it because i believe in it 120 percent look it's up to everybody to judge for themselves what they

1481
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:32,160
do and don't like about whatever anyone says ever people need to fucking think critically so you

02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:26,080
people make that argument though which is bizarre to me yeah i don't know if i have a friend who's

1502
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:34,720
half black and half white is it worse for me to uh to say the fucking racial slurs or is it worse

1503
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:41,200
for me to say that they can't because they're not black enough it well that's your right so everything's

1504
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:46,720
just wrong for you that's no that's wrong i'm that comes back that comes back to the question i'm a good

1505
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:53,440
boy everything that i do is right do you value like do you value like independent freedom or do you

1506
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:59,760
value like making sure no one's offended at everyone's i value being able to make the funny noises come

1507
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:05,440
out of my mouth yeah well like luckily i don't but you know there's a there's a it's a fair criticism

1508
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:12,320
to say that that is literally maybe influenced by the fact that you have never been the target of

1509
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:19,040
this ethnic discrimination well i literally been ethnic like bullied for being in different ethnicity

1510
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:25,040
than the white kids in my neighborhood i can fucking say all the racial slurs i want yeah i i i get i

1511
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:30,480
get that that's kind of that's kind of a like a bullshit argument i think because like everyone

1512
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:36,720
has been fucking like bullied and ridiculed in their life for something so like to say that you

1513
