1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Fuck me and my fucking asshole, everybody! We're back with more Rikstie Minutes! Me, the best guy ever, and Digibro!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Fuck bitch!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're on episode 7 of season 3.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You got it.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Of this shit.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, there was no episode last week. That really threw me for a fucking loop. I was not prepared.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But boy, did we get a doozy this week.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, this episode.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It was the one.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This one was heavy.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It sure was, dude.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I was going to watch it again for this podcast because there was so much going on, but I kind of couldn't bring myself to.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Really?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Because I did not, like, I mean this episode is fun and entertaining as they all are, but it also, it's got stuff to say.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No doubt about that.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It leaves you on kind of a down note, and it's one of those episodes that I had to, like, stand outside and have a smoke with that chaos, chaos song stuck in my head.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And be like, God fuck, man.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The world.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, it's some heavy shit, dude. It's got so fucking real in multiple dimensions, in multiple ways.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You know, in Rick and Morty continuity terms, and in real nigga shit terms, you know?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, first I want to say about this.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This show, I kind of like the way that Rick and Morty will abuse its premise.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This show, basically because of the fact that this is a nihilistic thrill ride, that this show doesn't give a fuck about anything, and it's already established literally everything is possible.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Because we're in the multiverse, the infinite multiverse, every possibility will happen, and the show really takes advantage of that in this episode.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because everything about this citadel is like, why would it be that way?

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Right, right.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But then, like, if in the infinite multiverse, every possibility will happen, then, like, it's all justified.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Like, there's just a reason.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There's a reason that one Rick is just like that.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know what that reason is, but there is one somewhere out there.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Of course, of course.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, there's no doubt about it, and it's just used to such a great effect, and they're using them to tell...

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I mean, you know, it's been said, but really more than any episode before, to use the multiple clones of Rick's and Morty's in the way they're used in this episode is absolutely fantastic.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's brilliant.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't know if I've ever seen a story like it before, but I fucking love it, especially with the obvious racial parallels going on in the episode.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Right.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's fucking intense.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The racial parallels, but that don't necessarily, like, reflect any one racial thing going...

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You could call it a class divide, instead, if you wanted to, you know?

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I mean, it's definitely... it makes a lot of different, like, commentaries on real-world stuff, but none that's specific enough to, like, say, oh, they're doing that.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's all, like, just... like, a vague gets into your mind, you know?

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's what I think is powerful about it, is that it never made me think, oh, this is, like, a parallel for, I don't know, Black Lives Matter or something, which, like, another show would do.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's more like... I don't know, it spoke to something more fundamental to me.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I felt the same way.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Like, this is how it's always been, and always will be, you know?

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I thought it would have been so easy for them to... honestly, my sensors were in full gear, looking for, like, SJW cuck shit.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I really was.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I was on the lookout, knowing, just as I was going through the episode, and I was not... I did not find myself in any way, like, able to contest in any, like, you know, just... there was nothing to object to in the story that was presented here.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Everything here was perfectly logical for the universe to do.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's funny you say that.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Uh-huh.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I would say I was on the opposite side.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Really?

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I had an eye out for pushing a, like, conservative agenda or, like, liberty.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Really?

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Because, like, I don't think this show has ever come off as being on the side of, like, social justice, you know?

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Like, Rick is not that kind of guy.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You know what's interesting about that?

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That actually tells me something, I think, because I have been aware of the discussion going on lately about Dan Harmon, sort of, like, erring on the side.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I wouldn't even say that he's, like, on the social justice warrior side, but he's, like, had some pretty, pretty... pretty much discussed comments about how, like, Trump is, like, a literal Nazi.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Or I can't honestly remember the exact quote that it was.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case, but Dan Harmon also himself is a... like, Dan Harmon... there's this... I haven't actually seen this, I'm talking about the second hand, so you're getting some real tertiary knowledge here.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay, okay.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There's a documentary about Dan Harmon and this tour he did that Victor Washington told me about.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And, like, Dan Harmon is apparently, like, he's self-aware about this fact, but he is a terrible fucking person who everyone hates, including himself.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I know that, I know that.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Basically, he's a mess, like, he's an alcoholic, and he just has lots of, like, weird, like, pride issues, and he just kind of, like, flies off the handle and, like, gets mad at people really easily and all this stuff, and, like, he's just really hard to deal with.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And he knows this fact, and, like, but that kind of perpetuates it even more.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Like, he sees himself as a bad guy, so he doesn't, like, try to be a good guy, but because he's self-aware, he can also write that into his characters somehow, you know?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's amazing.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Like, Victor was even saying in the documentary, they say, like, everyone thinks community, for instance, was, like, canceled for studio, like, that it wasn't popular enough, but apparently it was partly because, like, Dan Harmon's shitty to work with and people can't survive, like, the process and stuff like that.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Fascinating.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But Harmon aside, who does, you know, he can err somewhat on the side of that stuff, but, like, then you look at Justin Roiland, who's just a fucking maniac.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And, of course, would absolutely despise a social justice-y.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I mean, this show's kind of made fun of social justice warriors before, in some ways, you know?

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, like, if anything-

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I never really bought the argument that people were making, that, like, when you're in sort of the, I don't even know if Dan Harmon is in the LA bubble or whatever, but when all the people around you are perpetuating the notion that, like, someone is a certain way, or, you know, like, the alt-right is full of, like, actual Nazis, or just, like, that the country is being consumed by, like,

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Nazi propaganda or something, like, I could see why someone would say something that could be interpreted.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Maybe it's our fault for being so reactionary to the things he says for assuming that he's a Nazi.

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't know the full context, and maybe I'm the one who's in the wrong.

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean, hating Trump doesn't make you a fucking liberal cuck.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That is very true.

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's very true.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Plenty of conservatives hate Trump and might even think he's a fucking Nazi, but-

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And speaking of Trump, this episode, I mean, I didn't think this going in.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But as soon as I was done and I just started looking up a little bit of information, what people were saying about it,

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the Trump parallels were everywhere.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Of course. Of course they were.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
People are so fucking stupid about this shit, man.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like, this guy is not Trump.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like, this is a Machiavellian, like, evil genius mastermind.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is that what Trump is to you guys?

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Is it really? Do you really see the connection here?

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What the fuck? That's so stupid.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No. This is obviously about the elite class.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Exactly. Exactly.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The ruling class.

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's why I said, like, this felt to me like it was speaking to all time.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Correct. Correct.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Like, this is not about current events, you know?

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Like, this is- it's- that's why we keep getting the refrain throughout the episode, like, same old story.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Morty's killing Morty's.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Right.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Same old story.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Rick's killing Morty's.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Like, this is the same old story that has been told for all time.

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And, like, the behind-the-scenes Rick council is all corporate people.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's all leaders of corporations.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Like, they're the Illuminati, essentially.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Exactly. That's right.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You know?

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And, like, to me it had more parallels to, like, I don't know, like, the way the room is designed

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and everything felt like a Greek society thing or just, like, this all- I felt timeless.

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It felt like this is how it's always been.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, of course.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Because, like, again, I think the- what I said before about, like, race is the obvious

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
thing to go to when you watch this, but I really think it's more about class.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is really a class divide that we're seeing here between the bourgeois and the- the bourgeoisie

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and the proletariat.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And, I mean, the thing is, like, there's a lot of free radical thinkers out there who

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
talk about how the biggest- and I agree with this notion that the biggest problem facing

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
us is that everyone tries to make everything a race thing, but it is a class thing.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Like, the real problems in our society are more based around class.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And, like, impoverished people of all races have the same issues.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Exactly.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There might be more impoverished people who are black, but, like, everyone who's impoverished

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
is facing these issues.

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And this episode kind of tackles that in that it's not just morties who are in this lower

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
class.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
There's- there's ricks who- who have been put into, like, a low-class situation and they

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
are also fighting against it.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And it's, like, it's everyone.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It affects everyone.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Like, the- the broken system.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The- the difference between, like, ricks and morties, like, that does make sense on a racial

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
basis, because, like, they're- like, here, like, there's an obvious biological difference.

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And then, of course, you've got, like, my favorite character in this episode, like, Cop

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Morty, who's a fucking- like, we'll get to that guy.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He's my fucking hero.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Only in a sick, disgusting, twisted way.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But, like, but yeah, like, you've got him and then- but parallel to him is, of course,

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,300
the factory worker Rick, who, like, despite having- you know, he's just as brilliant as

147
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,000
every other Rick, it's the system that has put him into this slave-wage job and has,

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,800
you know, oppressed his individuality and his ability to be himself.

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Because by surrounding yourself by innumerable other ricks, you rob yourself of anything

150
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
that makes you special as an individual.

151
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,800
And, uh, I mean, that's just one of the many themes that this episode touched on.

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Man, there's a lot in this fucking episode.

153
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
There's a lot.

154
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,100
This episode bounces all over the place, because it obviously wants to make as many statements

155
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,800
as it can about this world, that this little world is introduced as it can before it leaves.

156
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
And, I mean, this episode is a clusterfuck.

157
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Like, let's not- let's get that out of the way, too.

158
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
It is totally a clusterfuck that all works.

159
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
In the best- it's beautiful, organized chaos.

160
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Like, it all swirls into meaning in the end, and it's- like, that- that final shot of all

161
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,800
the devastation that has been wrought in, like, one day on the Citadel, just specifically

162
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,800
by- I mean, mostly by the villain, but really, more importantly, by the system in place.

163
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,800
That- now, that was fucking- I- I don't want to- over you, but-

164
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Gazomp Kutzwerk- I mean, that's the wrong word, but I feel like using it anyway.

165
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm using it as a meme.

166
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm using it as the meme version now.

167
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Come to mean masterpiece, but like- It just means good.

168
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Yeah.

169
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Yeah, it's been- B-Tongue ruined it.

170
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,800
It- we ruined it, to be fair, but he used it right.

171
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Um, yeah, it was just- it was just a- a climactic moment.

172
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
It was fantastic.

173
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,800
So, yeah, this- this episode is this cap- we- we finally have the return of the plot thread,

174
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
the one important plot thread we've been waiting for the whole show, which-

175
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Okay, so the first time I watched Rick and Morty Season 1, I was watching it on the Adult Swim website,

176
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,800
which accidentally played the episode's out of order.

177
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Um, it goes- it went episode 1, 10, 11, and then played the rest.

178
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
So this was the- Okay, okay.

179
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,800
The second episode I ever saw was the Council of Rick's episode,

180
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,800
um, which establishes its character, so I- like, all through the show,

181
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
I was expecting there to be like an ongoing plot line.

182
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Right, okay.

183
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Because I'd seen that episode, um, but it never- you know,

184
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,800
obviously it didn't get brought up again in season 1, because it was actually episode 10,

185
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
never got addressed in season 2.

186
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Like, we still have the Council of Rick's, but this evil Morty that was revealed at the end of season 1 episode 10

187
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,800
has had no callback until the end of this episode twist, which was fucking awesome.

188
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
You know, I-

189
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Because I didn't see it coming at all.

190
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,800
That's- that's interesting, because as soon as I saw that there was a Morty candidate running for office,

191
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I immediately knew where it was going.

192
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I didn't at all.

193
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
That's interesting.

194
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
I had no idea.

195
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
It's good to know that I am that much smarter than you.

196
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
It feels good.

197
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Well, after he- after he gave his speech, I thought something was up.

198
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Right.

199
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Like, there's- he's too good, um, and- but I was- I didn't figure out that it was going to be him

200
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
until the fucking song started playing, and I was like,

201
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
oh, you motherfucker.

202
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Well, see, to be fair, I- I do get where the Trump parallels come from in one dimension,

203
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
because his whole thing was that he was just an absolute, like, populist,

204
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
just telling the people what they wanted to hear,

205
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
and totally, like, abusing the weaknesses of democracy,

206
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
because he has his own private agenda.

207
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,800
I would consider that- I would say he was more like Obama to me.

208
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Hey, that's a good point.

209
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
That's a good damn point.

210
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Everything he says is, like, like, every word out of his mouth is change and hope.

211
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Yeah, you're right.

212
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Like, that's how Obama won, was he just kept promising that, like, you know, he-

213
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
he prayed on the fact that people thought the last eight years had been bad,

214
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,800
and that if we change something, it will be good.

215
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Not to mention that Morty is basically from the, like, repressed minority, you know,

216
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
quote-unquote, race of this world.

217
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Yeah, exactly.

218
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Frankly, Obama is a perfect parallel.

219
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I saw him more as first black president.

220
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Yeah, well, sure.

221
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Because, like, like, we've said that the racial stuff in this episode is not too direct,

222
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,800
but, like, the most obvious parallel is Morty is- Mortys are black, you know?

223
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Yeah, of course.

224
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,800
And, like, so for him to be the first Morty president is, like, okay, this is first black

225
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
president, you know?

226
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Like, to me, it looked like a big Obama parallel.

227
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,800
And, you know, a lot of people would say when Obama got in office, it was basically,

228
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
you know, like, nothing really changed.

229
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Yeah, especially now that we can look back at his legacy, we can bear witness to, like,

230
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,800
the dealings he made with the financial system and, like, the elites at the expense of the

231
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
lower people.

232
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Not to mention his record number of deportations of the immigrants that everyone thinks for

233
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,800
some reason that Obama was a champion of, but actually wasn't.

234
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,800
And not to mention the countless drone strikes that he, you know, did way more than any president

235
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
in history.

236
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,800
If anybody, if you're really woke, you know they're all the same.

237
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
All of them are the same.

238
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,800
SUFO is the only political party that knows the truth.

239
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Shut up, fuck off.

240
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
So, yeah.

241
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Yeah, I would say, again, I don't think it speaks to any one situation or candidate.

242
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Right, right.

243
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
The whole system.

244
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
This is what the system is.

245
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
This is what it means to have a system.

246
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Correct.

247
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Is that the smart people are going to abuse it.

248
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,800
And the other, like, anyone underneath them is going to be just slotted in somewhere.

249
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
You're slotted into society wherever you happen to fit.

250
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,800
And if you're not satisfied with that, you are just going to have a shit life, you know?

251
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Yep.

252
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Yep.

253
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,800
And yeah, this, it's, for me, the most, like, what I was kind of stuck on throughout the

254
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
whole episode was just, like, looking at a rick in a position they're in and going,

255
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,300
like, how does one end up, like, how does a rick get here?

256
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,200
But then I thought about it and, like, how does any of us get where we are?

257
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,800
It's just the circumstances of our birth, right?

258
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
You're right.

259
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:21,800
I wouldn't say that, like, you might think, okay, we work, we're in a, I don't want to

260
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
say an intellectual job, but a job that involves thinking.

261
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Right.

262
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Right.

263
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Like, we analyze things, we pull it apart.

264
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
We're obviously not as smart as scientists.

265
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
We're not as smart as others.

266
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,800
But then you have to wonder, well, some of those scientists aren't really that smart.

267
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
They just study more.

268
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
They just have an aptitude for science, you know?

269
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Sure.

270
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Well, what about a guy who's a blue collar worker who might be smarter than us, but he

271
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,800
just doesn't want to do fru fru bullshit on the internet.

272
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
He'd rather fucking do something meaningful that helps the world.

273
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
You know, like, like the dirty jobs mentality of, like, this is a job that has to get done.

274
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm proud to do it.

275
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,800
So, like, when you think about it, people, you know, the fact that they're all rick,

276
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
it's not about being rick.

277
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
It's about what happened to rick.

278
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
That's exactly right.

279
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
What happened to rick within his life.

280
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,800
You know, the first rick we're, like, introduced to in this episode is one called Simple Rick,

281
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,800
who realized at some point that his daughter was the most important thing to him and never

282
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
became a super scientist.

283
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:34,800
And so they captured him and replay his memory on loop and extract his fluids and put it in

284
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,800
a candy so that you can taste what it feels like to be a simple person, which when they

285
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,800
bring that back at the end of the episode, that was one of my biggest, like, standing

286
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
ovation moments of the season so far.

287
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
It was incredible.

288
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
It was incredible.

289
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
And I knew it was coming.

290
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,800
That one I did see, like, as soon as the guy came, like, the Willy Wonka rick came in

291
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,800
and was talking to him, I was like, what is this guy's angle?

292
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
And then as he's taking him out, I'm like, oh, no.

293
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Oh, no.

294
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
You hear the voice over, right?

295
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,800
It's like, you know, this rick staged an uprising.

296
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
I was like, oh, fuck.

297
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Yeah.

298
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Yeah.

299
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Fuck.

300
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
It was fucked up, man.

301
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Cycle never ends.

302
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,800
That was some 1984 shit right there, like some real fucking big brother shit.

303
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Yeah, there's a lot.

304
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,800
The cop, you want to talk about cop rick and morty?

305
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Yeah.

306
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I mean, it was cool that we see a rick as, like, the plucky up and coming, like, youngling

307
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,800
to the experienced savvy morty, who, you know, is basically more or less turned against

308
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
his own kind.

309
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
You know, again, if you want to make, like, the black parallel, he's just, like, a black

310
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
cop.

311
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,800
He's, like, ten penny from San Andreas, from GTA San Andreas, who just, like, hates the

312
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,800
people that he, like, is forced to protect and just wants to, like, I mean, with our

313
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,800
guy here, with our cop morty, he just doesn't give a fuck, and he is just completely jaded

314
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
to the system.

315
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,800
And, like, as we see throughout the episode, we'll just happily kill morties, who he views

316
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,800
as, like, unworthy of, you know, participating in the system or whatever, because he has

317
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,800
to, you know, they work in morty town, or, like, morty slum or whatever it's called,

318
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
just dealing with the dregs society.

319
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
And, yeah, like, his jaded attitude.

320
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,800
And then, of course, there's a little bit of sort of redemption at the end of the episode,

321
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,800
where there's, like, that little spark where he thinks that, like, his partner's unwillingness...

322
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
I think he was just...

323
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Yeah.

324
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I think he was fucking with him.

325
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
I mean, obviously, he turned...

326
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,800
He does try to kill, you know, like, Goodrich at the end there, and fails, so...

327
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
I think there was a spark in there.

328
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I think...

329
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Well, you know, because just based on all the stuff we saw this episode, it feels like

330
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,800
everyone here is miserable, trapped in this system, except the people at the very top.

331
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Everyone's just fucking forced into this role they don't really want.

332
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,800
I feel like Cop Morty's, like, cry of desperation was real, but then also was his attempt to murder his own partner

333
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,800
to get away with being a corrupt cop, you know, perpetuating the system.

334
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
And that's the crime, man.

335
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Perpetuating the system is the one crime that's...

336
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
It's, like, the biggest...

337
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
It's the biggest problem, you know?

338
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
You can't enable the shit to continue.

339
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
And now we're just talking about, like, real-life shit.

340
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
That's where it's...

341
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,800
That's the thing this episode felt like real-life shit.

342
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
That's why I got fucking emotional after watching it.

343
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,800
It was like, I don't know if I want to watch that again, because it fucking was hard, you know?

344
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,800
I had to watch it again because the narrative was so great, and I loved all the characters.

345
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I would say this is the roughest episode of Rick and Morty for me, like, so far.

346
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I mean, there's been some rough ones, but this one's, like, ooh.

347
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Like, because there's no real levity in this episode.

348
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Like, it's funny, it's entertaining, but it's more of, like, it's funny in more of a, oh, shit, kind of way, you know?

349
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Like, it's never, like, ah-ha-ha, funny joke.

350
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,800
It's more, like, oh, you fucking bastards.

351
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Like, again, the Rick cycle where the...

352
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,800
When the guy is then hooked up to the chair to be the new source of candy.

353
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Like, that is a dark, dark joke.

354
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,800
That is a bleak joke, you know?

355
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,800
So there's never a moment of, like, just a fun, ha-ha joke.

356
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,800
It's all, like, oh, you know, damn.

357
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,800
And there's lots of, like, really good dialogue in this episode.

358
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,800
So there's one Morty who's been literally programmed...

359
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,800
He's an experimental Morty programmed to be dramatic.

360
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Like, he's programmed to be...

361
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,800
As he puts it, to make you sad and kind of bored.

362
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Which is fucking hilarious.

363
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,800
But then, like, his line where they're, like...

364
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,800
He says, like, I want, you know, I want the system to be fixed on the Citadel.

365
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Like, I want things to be good here.

366
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
And the other kids, because he's at a wishing well,

367
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,800
we have to throw in something important in order to get your wish.

368
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
And he says, I want things to be good here.

369
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,800
And they're like, you better throw in something really important.

370
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
And he said, well, I hope so.

371
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
And he jumps in.

372
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
And, like, as soon as he said the line...

373
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I hope so, but I doubt it.

374
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Yeah, I hope so, but I doubt it.

375
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
And when he said the line, I knew what he was going to do.

376
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
And it was just like, oh, fuck, that's such a...

377
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Ah!

378
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
It was fucking powerful, man.

379
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,800
That whole thing, incidentally, was a parallel to the film Stand By Me, if you're familiar with it.

380
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Yeah, I caught that.

381
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah, yeah.

382
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
I caught the...

383
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
That was Stand By Me.

384
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
The cop thing is probably...

385
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
I mean, there's multiple stories that are like that.

386
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
The one that comes to my mind is Training Day.

387
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
You know, because it's the same kind of...

388
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Like, the Rick Cop is not just a starry-eyed...

389
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,800
He learns quickly, he's quick on his feet, and he will shoot someone if he has to.

390
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
And he did.

391
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
He has the power in him to do that.

392
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,800
And when he fucking kills his partner at the end, and he's just like, same old story.

393
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Rick's killing Morty's.

394
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
And it's just like...

395
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
You know, like...

396
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Yeah.

397
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
It was fucking brutal.

398
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Oh, then, of course, we haven't talked about the campaign running Morty.

399
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
The other kind of wage slave Morty guy.

400
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,800
He was sort of the other kind of tied into the main plot there.

401
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,800
So, there's just another guy sort of similar to the Candy Making Rick, as I gave them a little name.

402
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
So, campaign Morty there.

403
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Campaign manager for the Morty who's trying to run for office.

404
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,800
And of course, I mean, we're gonna get to it, but I love the whole...

405
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
It's just so brilliant to me.

406
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,800
This is the exact perfect way for evil Morty to seize control through this kind of system.

407
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Like, there's no way...

408
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I mean, I would have been hugely, like, eyebrow raising skeptical if this Morty had, like, somehow through force taken over the system here.

409
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:38,800
And in fact, my one curiosity at the end of the episode was, through what exact force is president Morty,

410
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,800
evil Morty, controlling the ricks that just, like, assassinate a bunch of the business leaders of the world,

411
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
like the Illuminati members?

412
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Is it just his presidential authority?

413
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
I guess that's pretty good.

414
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I would assume they just worked for him already.

415
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Like, he's offering them something, you know?

416
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Yeah, he must be, he must be.

417
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
We don't know what his angle is yet.

418
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Right, we don't.

419
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Like, because I couldn't tell if his aim is to perpetuate the system, but under Morty rule,

420
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,800
or if it's to change the system in some way to benefit himself.

421
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,800
It's hard to say, because at the end, like, the council, the Rick Business Council,

422
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,800
are all people who say, you know, we were the real ones running things from behind the scenes even before.

423
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,800
So for Morty to assassinate all of them means that now there is an opportunity for a full stop change,

424
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:32,800
since both the real council of ricks and the, you know, CEO ricks are all dead.

425
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
But who knows what he's trying to do?

426
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,800
We can at least infer from the way that he has gotten into this position,

427
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,800
and killing these people, you know, the way he did,

428
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
and being willing to manipulate the system in this way,

429
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,800
that he certainly does not mind sacrificing pawns on his way to the top.

430
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,800
And he, I mean, the main thing that's been brought up about this Morty

431
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,800
is that he has this weird, like, receiver thing under his eye,

432
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,800
which makes me think that he's either doing this all under, like, either a Rick's command,

433
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,800
or maybe he's a Rick in disguise, maybe, like, there's something about this Morty

434
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
that he's not quite just Morty.

435
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
That's true. That's true.

436
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,800
I really hope that he's not. I really would hate it if it turned out that there was a Rick behind all this.

437
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I want this to be the one Morty who has some special spark that makes him, you know, equal to a Rick in his own way.

438
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,800
I mean, I don't know what the receiver thing is, but maybe he's a robot or something.

439
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Yeah, maybe.

440
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,800
There's something about this one that he can push things into his eyeballs.

441
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,800
If you remember, I think the quote-unquote evil Rick that we first met him under,

442
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,800
that turned out to be a robot, as I recall, so, like, we don't actually know who his Rick originally was.

443
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,800
So maybe they're, like, so his Rick is unaccounted for, and, you know, there's always a Rick to every Morty,

444
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,800
so that was certainly something that I want to know about.

445
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Yeah, there's a lot going on with this guy, and I don't know if we'll get any more answers this season.

446
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,800
They might be playing the really long game with this particular mystery, you know?

447
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,800
But just, this was so satisfying the way they doled it out.

448
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Like, yeah, I was waiting for it for a long time, and I was, you know, just desperate for it.

449
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,800
But, like, to then have it sprung upon you in such a brilliantly written way, in such a satisfying way,

450
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,800
kind of makes it, maybe not completely worth it, but, like, just now that we've got it feels so much better for it.

451
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Yeah.

452
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Yeah.

453
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
It's good stuff, man.

454
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Well, is there any other things you have written down or anything?

455
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Any other stuff you want to address about this episode?

456
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I think there was, actually.

457
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Oh, oh, I remember.

458
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,800
The one other thing that I'm interested in is I'm really wondering what is going to be the event that,

459
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,800
there's got to inevitably be a clash with Evil Morty here, and I'm just really excited to see our Morty,

460
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:59,800
who has been previously established, at least possibly, to be the most Morty Morty, or the Prime Morty,

461
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
or whatever it was.

462
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
The Good Morty.

463
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
The Good Morty, yeah, that's a fair way to frame it.

464
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:09,800
I'm very interested to see him do something, and even in this very episode, like, at the very beginning,

465
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,800
you know, you can just feel Morty beginning to strain at the bonds of, like,

466
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
when they're like, yeah, you know, he's talking back to Ricksmore,

467
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,800
and the whole, his increasing nihilism as we've been going through this series,

468
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,800
just showing a maturity of the character, I'm very interested to see.

469
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:30,800
I definitely have the feeling that the final confrontation of Rick and Morty will be between the two Mortys.

470
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
It seems that way to me, too.

471
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,800
The Good Morty, the ultimate Good versus the ultimate Evil Morty, and, you know, and maybe Rick,

472
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,800
I don't know what Rick will do, but like, that is definitely going to be what he comes down to, I think.

473
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
He'll be busy.

474
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,800
I think they're building up both of these Mortys to be, to have a showdown.

475
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
And you know what's great, you know what's great about this?

476
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,800
While Rick is, like, a master of, like, technology and time and space and a literal God,

477
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,800
like, what's the one thing that Rick is just bullshitted dealing with?

478
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
It's dealing with people.

479
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,800
And that's the one thing that politics, like, politics is control over people.

480
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,800
That's the one avenue that Morty could excel at that Rick just has, has no luck with.

481
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,800
So by, like, controlling the counsel of Rick's and, you know, playing his cards right,

482
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,800
I totally can understand how a Morty could actually get this kind of leverage.

483
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,800
It's been shown to us in a thousand ways how Rick is a total fuck-up at managing his relationships.

484
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
So it just, I'm just so satisfied with it.

485
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,800
And the fact that it is relevant to our culture and even our current political climate is just like a cherry on top.

486
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
And it's fascinating and great.

487
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
It's brilliant writing.

488
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
All right, everybody.

489
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Catch you next week.

490
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Hope it's as good as this one.

491
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Doubtful of that, but we'll see.

492
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Doubtful, but, you know, always hope.

493
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,800
It's been, it's been a bunch of good episodes in a row, I think, so, yeah.

494
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Looking forward to it.

495
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Bye, everybody.

496
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Bye-bye.
