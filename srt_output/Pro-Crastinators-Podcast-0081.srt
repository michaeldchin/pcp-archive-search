00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,520
That's right, take some PCP with us friends because this is a podcast on the internet with

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,680
a bunch of content creators who make cool shit and here we are talking about it.

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm the best guy ever and we are joined by Tom Oliver.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:40,680
I am a sequel to myself, I've revived my old channel, it's back, I have ten new videos

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,280
up in two weeks as I'm a fucking god, go subscribe to it.

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Impressive.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,080
Hippocrit is here.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,880
This is part one of my sentence.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,600
This is part two of my sentence.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
The sequel.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
What do you think?

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,200
A bit of use of a semicolon to break that up or otherwise that would have been two sentences.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,560
I can't just say semicolon out loud, what am I gay?

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:12,960
Yeah, and we've also got Digibro and MLP once again, our favorite PCP to electric board.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
There it is.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,240
We're talking about sequels today everybody.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,720
Sequels is the topic of this episode of the PCP.

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,840
We're really, really scraping the bottom of that barrel and God doesn't feel good.

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,720
That's where all the gold cake's on, so when you scrape that shit up, you know, the people

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
appreciate it.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,520
Scraping the bottom of the barrel is totally thematically relevant to the topic of sequels

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,200
anyway because that's really what they do in sequels.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,880
You gotta just like, original ideas, fuck it, we're just gonna milk this and we're gonna

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
have Halloween or 18.

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,760
I think we made that argument about remakes when we did our remakes episode, but I think

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,040
sequels are a little different depending on what kind of sequel it is because the way

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,480
I see it, good sequels are all about taking the original and looking at it with a critical

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,960
eye and saying, how do we do it even better, you know?

30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
At least ideally.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,200
In a perfect world, that's what all sequels would be.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,480
Well, you know, I'll give it a go, I'll give it a go.

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,480
I was just gonna say like a perfect example of that, the perfect sequel of all time, Shrek

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,640
2, you know, it improved on all aspects of Shrek.

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,480
I actually hear that opinion most of the time about Shrek 2.

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,800
Shrek 2 is liked, I think.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
And so is Shrek 3, is it?

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Not so much.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,280
In fact, 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 are like their worst than Kingdom Hearts.

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Are there really 7?

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,080
There's a lot, there's at least 5.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
There's at least 4.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
There's at least 4.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
There's 3 and 4, I think.

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Okay, okay.

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Well, I don't know.

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
This is a corporatized world we live in.

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,880
It's very possibly could be 7 Shrek movies, I wouldn't have to cast them.

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,320
Hey, well, I was just playing a sequel this very morning.

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Actually, I'm not sure if it counts, so you guys can tell me.

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,160
Just like, does Mario main, like do the mainline Mario games count as sequels?

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,920
Like I'm playing Mario Odyssey right now.

53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
And that's a sequel, right?

54
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
I think that counts.

55
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
That definitely counts.

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,320
I think that's an interesting question.

57
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,000
Like Mario Galaxy 2 is very definitively a sequel because it's literally like the

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,800
same thing but they built on it, you know, like that's exactly the kind of sequel I'm

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,520
talking about where they took the first game and they said, okay, this is great.

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,080
What can we do to tweak it to make it like a little bit fresh and new but still be the

61
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
same?

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,320
It's like a sequel is one thing and then there's like a next one in a series, which

63
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,960
is right or may not be none of it.

64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,600
I think all the Mario games, they're sequels to each other.

65
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:43,640
I think the core ideas in Mario Odyssey is, you know, the platforming, the jumping and

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
all that stuff.

67
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,000
That's an idea that has been in Mario's DNA from the original Super Mario Brothers

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,440
and all of these are just iterations and ways of tweaking the formula.

69
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,640
Iteration is a good word, but I don't know if I'd use sequel.

70
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,880
Yeah, like look at Dr. Mario, beloved entry in the Mario franchise, totally totally different.

71
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,520
The idea of like sequel is like you would watch them or play them in a series, like

72
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,720
they are very closely linked and you would go, if you wanted to do all of them, you would

73
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
just, yeah.

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,560
Like Mario Odyssey is built so that you could play it as your first Mario game, like they

75
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,320
want you to be able to do that.

76
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,280
There's no need to play Super Mario 64 first, whereas with the Galaxy games, I think they

77
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,520
definitely intended like, hey, liked Galaxy one, now you can do another one, so that to

78
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
me is more sequel.

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,320
That almost works as an expansion of sorts.

80
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,360
It really is kind of like a level pack and then there's like additional new powers.

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,200
It reminds me a little bit of like Brood War from StarCraft, how like that's kind of what

82
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
you get.

83
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
You get like a bunch of new levels, bunch of new worlds, and then like Yoshi was the

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
big addition.

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,240
But other than that, there's not a heck of a lot.

86
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,520
Okay, here's a question I have for you guys.

87
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
What was Gibbs saying?

88
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Yeah, go ahead.

89
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,160
I was going to say like, that's interesting, you say StarCraft because that has like DLC,

90
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,200
but it's also a sequel to StarCraft 1, and there's like, there's like, there's sequels

91
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,840
and there's like, there's expansions and sequels.

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Sometimes there's DLC that basically are sequels.

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
True.

94
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,340
Sometimes there's DLC that continues the narrative.

95
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,340
The line is blurred.

96
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,960
Well, here's the thing, I think we're forgetting something very important, we're all trying

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
to define what a sequel is.

98
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
We're forgetting the fucking Urban Dictionaries.

99
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,520
Urban Dictionaries, what's going to be able to define this for us, so we don't have to

100
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
sit here arguing about it.

101
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
I've got it open.

102
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
I've got it open here.

103
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,920
Well, let's settle it once and for all.

104
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,440
Okay, here we go.

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:38,440
A sequel, something of inferior quality, an utterance of absolute disgust, and here's

106
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
the full thing.

107
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,440
A word that owes its second meaning, its second meaning, okay, to the long list of low budget

108
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,680
waste of space sequels to box office smashes in which none of the original actors appear.

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,080
The storyline is either non-existent or piss weak, and the only way that the 12 year old

110
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,240
mentally challenged director can salvage this train wreck is through gratuitous use of full

111
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,400
frontal nudity that would horrify even the most seasoned SBS world movies connoisseur.

112
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,400
That's a very interesting definition because what they're saying is they're defining

113
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,080
sequel as why it is a slang term to insult somebody.

114
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,320
That's why I'm never ending because the sequel's never equal as Endless Jess has said in The

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Coolest Guy.

116
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,840
There's an idea that referring to someone as a sequel is referring to them as inferior

117
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,760
to the original.

118
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,120
But you know, the best sequels are typically better than the original, but here's a question

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,440
I want to ask you guys regarding the Mario thing.

120
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,640
Do you think of the Zelda games as sequels?

121
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,800
Because whereas Mario has retained most of its core elements in each of these other 3D

122
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,600
games, Zelda is pretty fucking different and there's only one Zelda game, there's only

123
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,320
a couple of them that are like considered actual sequels in the can.

124
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,000
There's Legend of Zelda, Orchardine of Time, and then there's Legend of Zelda, Orchardine

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,400
of Time like 2 through 7, they're all the exact same game.

126
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,960
There's different window dressing on them, but I've played a bit of Orchardine of Time,

127
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,040
I've played through all of Skyward Sword, objectively the worst Zelda game of all time.

128
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,400
It's a train wreck of Titanic proportions.

129
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,200
I've played all of them, except for Wind Waker, though I did play Phantom Hourglass.

130
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,880
I would count all those in the same camp as the Mario sequels, like they are refining

131
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,440
the formula, just because they're different sorts of games, but they're the same sort

132
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,680
of thing, where they're just progressing in some particular path.

133
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,320
If you compare Mario Sunshine to Mario Odyssey, in both games, Princess Peach is captured

134
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,320
by Bowser, Mario's gotta go savor, he does this by jumping on things occasionally using

135
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
the powers.

136
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Princess Zelda's captured by Ganondorf, he has to cut lots of things.

137
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,880
That is not a thing that even happens in most Zelda games.

138
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,400
How often has Zelda been kidnapped by Ganondorf in the Zelda franchise?

139
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:07,000
It's either she's captured or turned to stone, or something that is bad by Ganon.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay, Legend of Zelda the Minish Cap, Zelda's not in it, Ganon's not in it, Zelda's in

141
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,120
it, she's at the very beginning, in fact Zelda does turn to stone, that's the whole

142
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
thing.

143
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Yeah, yeah, Voddy does that shit.

144
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,240
My point is, Dark Souls 2, that's a sequel.

145
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
That is a sequel.

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,640
Oh god, that's an unfortunate sequel.

147
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,560
Well let me back up for a second.

148
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,480
Ocarina of Time vs Majora's Mask, which is actually a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time,

149
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,360
very thematically different, like different tone, different kind of atmosphere, and I

150
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,040
think some of the Zelda games are enough thematically that I don't know if I'd consider them a sequel,

151
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,200
although in that case it is actually a sequel and it is the most different.

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,440
I guess my definition of sequel has always been more, is in terms of games, has always

153
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,520
been more about the underlying mechanics and the identity of the game, because you play

154
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,800
a Mario game, it always feels like a Mario game, you never would mistake it as something

155
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,560
else, even though there's lots of other new ideas and new mechanics being layered on top

156
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,400
of it, the base idea of like, they all kind of feel very similar, you know, you play like

157
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,760
Super Mario 3D land for the DS and you play Mario Sunshine and like the core mechanics

158
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,760
of like how Mario handles, how he moves, the base moveset that he has ever since Super

159
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,560
Mario 64, that's all pretty much the same and like there's iterations and refinements

160
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,240
and tweaks, but like you go in expecting a certain feel when playing a 3D Mario game

161
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,880
and ever since Mario 64, that's really been there to some degree and so I feel like that

162
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,360
underlying pedigree is what defines a sequel and while you don't have to be like a linear

163
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
progression.

164
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,080
Would you put Super Mario 3D World in there then?

165
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Because that game plays very differently, would you say it's also part of that same

166
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
sequel lineage?

167
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,480
Super Mario 3D World for the Wii U?

168
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Yeah.

169
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,280
I haven't played a whole bunch of it despite the fact that it's right behind me right now,

170
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,000
but despite the fact that it's like, that's someone who's more like, it's 3D but it's

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,880
like an isometric kind of view, right?

172
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,320
Yeah, yeah, for the most part.

173
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,720
I think the mechanics there are still pretty much the same, like it's still a platformer,

174
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
like it moves very similar.

175
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,320
It's interesting to me though, Tom, that you seem to be defining sequels based on more

176
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,840
of like the mechanics as opposed to like any, I don't know, like a narrative thing or anything.

177
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,080
I mean obviously if it's something that says like Metroid Prime 2, which like I think you

178
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,680
were just playing, like yeah, okay, that's pretty clearly a sequel.

179
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,560
Nate, you just reminded me of a term that will help with this a lot.

180
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,720
My favorite term, spiritual sequel.

181
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Right.

182
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Because when you look at it-

183
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,640
Is that a spiritual successor or is that something different from what you're talking about?

184
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,720
Both are used, but I always think you're a spiritual sequel.

185
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Like for instance, a game like Axiom Verge that is clearly meant to be a spiritual connection

186
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,920
to, well in this case I would say a sequel, but a spiritual successor to Metroid, to Super

187
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:11,520
Metroid, like could it be that the Mario, because when I think sequel I do think continuing

188
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,680
the actual narrative, like it's supposed to be the same, at least the same characters,

189
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
you know-

190
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,720
Mario has the same characters for the most part, but there's really no narrative to

191
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
continue.

192
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,160
Yeah, you know, and like if you look at something like Mario Galaxy, like there's no plot connection

193
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,880
like seemingly at all to like any of the other games other than Mario Galaxy 2.

194
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,760
Most of Nintendo's games don't do that.

195
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,680
Their narrative is just like a very loose framing device to have the action.

196
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,000
So I'm not sure describing the Mario games as sequels makes sense.

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,320
I think like spiritual successor, even though they're all like mainline Mario games, might

198
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
make more sense.

199
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,760
Well, as far as I know spiritual successor doesn't even, when you say something's a spiritual

200
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,400
successor, the term doesn't mean it's a sequel, it means it's taking the gameplay identity

201
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,280
of another game that won't get a sequel and injecting it into a new IP.

202
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,200
That's why Axiom Verge is a spiritual successor to Metroid.

203
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,080
It's not a Metroid title, but it's trying to play like one and invoke that kind of same

204
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
game feel.

205
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,240
And what were you saying?

206
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,960
I feel like the whole Mario, the whole sequel's a successor, so spiritual stuff, like it doesn't

207
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,440
need a word like that, because it doesn't apply to any of them, like aside from like

208
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,760
Mario 1, Super Mario 1, Super Mario 2, like even that's kind of weird.

209
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,640
I think the whole thing with the sequels is like people generally think of it as being

210
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,240
if it's numbered, then it's a sequel, and if it's not, then it's just part of the same

211
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,640
franchise, and this word sequel doesn't even come into it.

212
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,360
Will Radcon Awakening be a direct sequel to Radcon 2?

213
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,400
That's, I don't know, I don't know, or is it a spiritual successor?

214
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,560
That'll depend on the narrative content of Radcon Awakening.

215
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Indeed.

216
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,480
Are we going to do the fuck shit thing that movie producers do and not put the number on

217
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Radcon 3?

218
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,000
Is it just going to be Radcon Awakening?

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,720
Davoo's been making that joke forever, that he insists that the next Radcon be called

220
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,200
Radcon Awakening canonically.

221
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
But with no 3.

222
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
With no 3.

223
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Oh, that burns my heart.

224
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,640
We need to do that, and then the next one just has to be Radcon.

225
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
Exactly.

226
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Or like The Radcon.

227
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:19,200
The Radcon was like alternating upper and lower case for each other.

228
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Oh, yes.

229
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Oh no.

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,920
Oh, that's the one like Gamze kills us all, yeah, that's when Munchie disembowels all

231
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
of us.

232
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,920
We definitely release Radcon on DVD on each one.

233
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,880
We have to make sure the titles are totally different on the side.

234
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Yeah.

235
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,120
Radcon 4 has to be Raphor Decon.

236
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Raphor Decon.

237
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,920
I do like that, I do like that.

238
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,560
Hey, so I watched a sequel, I watched a whole series of sequels recently, which is interesting

239
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
because it's kind of like the opposite of all this.

240
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,000
So it's like, so I watched Rambo, I downloaded all the Rambo movies recently and watched

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
all of them.

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,200
Because I heard they were cool and whatever.

243
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,120
So I watched Rambo 1, and everyone probably knows this already, but Rambo 1 is like a

244
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,080
story of a tortured Vietnam vet who comes back home and then like, it suffers, like

245
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,320
he's kind of a vagrant now, he's sort of lost his place in the world because he was such

246
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,260
a badass soldier, and now he's just a civilian and doesn't know what to do with himself.

247
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,160
And like, he's just in the world and he gets into some minor trouble with the law just

248
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
by like loitering a little bit, wasn't serious, but then he gets like abused by the cops and

249
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,320
then they like, they fuck him up a little bit, and then like he goes on kind of a murderous

250
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,560
rampage as they like try to track him down after he escapes from the thing.

251
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,600
And then like he like kicks back into like Vietnam mode and goes full monster murder

252
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,480
man and starts doing all this shit, and so it's really a story about a guy like being

253
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,040
tortured by his past and like having to overcome it, and like at the end he turns himself in

254
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,320
and like obviously has deep severe mental issues that he's going to need to work through.

255
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,000
And then Rambo too, like they get him out of jail and then he's just sent on like a

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,520
big epic like rescue POWs in Vietnam, like a military man mission.

257
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,440
So it's like they've capitalized on like the reputation that Rambo established, Rambo

258
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,240
1, of this guy being like a big badass soldier, but like they completely abandoned any of

259
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,160
the like, like the actual point of the movie of it being like about.

260
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,320
It goes from like a movie trying to make a message, send a message about like mental

261
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,920
health issues and just be like, what if we have Sylvester Stallone killing some bitches?

262
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,080
That would be cool.

263
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
And it was great.

264
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,640
It was a legitimately great action movie that I enjoyed quite a bit, but like it's like

265
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,520
it barely resembles like, you know, in the tangible details, it totally resembles Rambo

266
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,000
1, but in terms of the actual point they were making, they completely abandoned it.

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,640
And it's like, I don't know like who was writing that.

268
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm really curious if the same people were involved with making Rambo 2 as Rambo 1.

269
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,040
That feels like studio meddling to me.

270
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Yeah.

271
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Yeah.

272
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,880
And I know Stallone like wrote Rambo 4 and was heavily involved in getting it done, but

273
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,840
that might have just been like the resurrecting of the thing, you know, because this was like

274
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,440
two decades after Rambo 3 was made and shit.

275
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
But like, so that's an example.

276
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,200
That was a surprisingly good sequel though.

277
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
I liked it.

278
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I thought it was really good.

279
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
I liked the part where that Christian lady got raped.

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That was cool.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,600
She didn't actually get raped, unfortunately.

282
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Yeah.

283
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
It was, it was good.

284
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
It was good.

285
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,800
Here's a, here's a sequel, a pair of sequels that, that I feel just for the sake of completeness

286
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,480
needs to be mentioned is Star Wars, which has gone in a lot of interesting directions

287
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
with sequels.

288
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,040
Because you've got the original Star Wars, big, huge film, everybody loves it, but it's

289
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,040
kind of directed and edited like garbage.

290
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,920
Like the, it's really, they didn't like every, there was a lot of problems with the production

291
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
basically.

292
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,840
And when you watch the movie knowing that you can really see it and then you get to the

293
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,040
second movie and it's such a clear improvement.

294
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,520
Like they took the ideas and gave, put them in the hands of a director who could actually

295
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,360
like bring it to life, make it feel big and real and like, and dramatic.

296
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,360
And then you get to the third movie, which for some reason a lot of people don't like,

297
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,440
but I think that movie capitalizes on the themes, the best out of all the movies.

298
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,960
It like brings it all home in a really good way.

299
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,240
And so you got this package where it's like, yeah, you got sequels that actually took

300
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,160
what the previous one did, built on it, tried to improve.

301
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:23,280
And then, then suddenly they make three more sequels that are actually prequels and don't

302
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,840
capitalize on any of the strengths of the original and are a total clusterfuck.

303
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:36,920
But then you get like 23 more sequels a few, a decade later that are now just like cherry

304
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:43,440
picking any tangible or abstract concept from the old films and like cobbling them together

305
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,840
into a new film that is just like made up of the body parts of the old ones, you know.

306
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,400
It's a descent into corporatization, which is funny because Star Wars has always been

307
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,840
a very corporatized product, but it's gone to the nth degree now.

308
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,880
The fascinating thing about that, that trajectory is kind of like Star Wars like is pretty beloved

309
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
these days.

310
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,120
It's quite popular and, you know, it was popular for a long time, but like it's really had

311
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,440
a resurgence and it's interesting to watch the trajectory of everyone loved the original

312
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
films.

313
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,000
They're highly beloved to this day.

314
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,200
And then the sequels came out and at the time it was lukewarm and then some people were

315
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:25,840
massively disappointed and so the reputation tank, Luke Skywalker Warm, excellent.

316
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,120
And then, and it's funny because like, and then like now like things have kicked back

317
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,640
up as like JJ Abrams has, you know, been able to make some pretty good work, at least

318
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,520
for the first one and we'll see what the others do as well.

319
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,560
But like what's interesting is the first one was like a guy, Lucas, right?

320
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,160
Lucas is running the show, but he was tempered by the fact that he wasn't like the god of

321
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,480
the production of those.

322
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,320
His creative input was subject to the quality control of lots of other people.

323
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,800
And so it was, it was sort of a one man show, but then it was filtered through all these

324
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,400
things like sort of a committee that made it good.

325
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,640
But then you got the prequels and the prequels totally lost that filtering process and only

326
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,360
kept like what he said, like we're doing this, make it happen.

327
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,360
And nobody wanted to question him, whether it was his fault or not, doesn't matter.

328
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,960
The point is it was just what he wrote on that paper, probably too hastily without thinking

329
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
about it enough.

330
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,480
And that's just what became the movies.

331
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,180
And we all know what happened with that.

332
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,000
But now, and now we've got a purely corporatized product happening now, probably with people

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
who love it.

334
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,720
It's gone too far in the other direction is what you're saying.

335
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,880
Well, actually, I was going to say that like, it's funny that things have improved from

336
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,680
just like one man's mad vision by making it corporate, like they've improved, but not

337
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,600
like, I think the original was the perfect balance of those two.

338
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Exactly.

339
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Of course.

340
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,560
You know, he it was a lot of it was this one guy's interest and vision, but just he had

341
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,280
a good editor, you know, like a good like, and I mean, editor in the not like a literal

342
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,480
film editor, but you know what, his fellow writers and stuff, the metaphorical sense.

343
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,280
And now we've got like the editor writing the movie based on what he like what he thought

344
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,480
needed to be fixed without the actual inspiration.

345
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
There's no artist.

346
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Yeah, exactly.

347
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Exactly.

348
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Exactly.

349
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,280
We got to put we got to put a certain amount of of iconography to sell toys because he

350
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
he right.

351
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,520
We're Disney and shit.

352
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,800
And, you know, it's it's not it's nobody's making these movies because people are longing

353
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,800
to know what happens with with the Star Wars universe.

354
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,080
I mean, I mean, kind of the people kind of did because they made books and comics.

355
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Yeah, I read a lot of this.

356
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,720
It's it's just it.

357
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,600
Yeah, it's very much like you can't see as anything other than a cash cow.

358
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,160
It's hard for me to think of it as like the same series.

359
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,920
Absolutely.

360
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,600
For me, I can I can easily watch those first three films and think this is three films

361
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,640
that were that like not that they were all intended to be made from the beginning

362
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,320
because like the first movie obviously was not supposed to have sequels

363
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,000
considering it wraps everything up perfectly fine.

364
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,320
But like when you watch the other two, you go, OK, this is a natural extension

365
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,240
of that first movie, and then you watch the new ones.

366
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,960
And to me, it just feels like this is nothing to do with it.

367
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,160
And that's it's just it's a fanfiction.

368
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,640
That's the thing. See, like I really did love the original Star Wars movies

369
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,160
and probably still would if I watched it again.

370
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,440
It's just it's just kind of been a while.

371
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,040
But like the originals have such a wonderful grittiness

372
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,840
of like old filmmaking to them.

373
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,600
They remind me and not to suck their dick too hard,

374
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,760
but they remind me of like like a Casablanca or a Lawrence of Arabia

375
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,360
when like things were just they had to get down there in the fucking dirt

376
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,000
and everyone got fucking filthy and dirty and things were not polished and clean

377
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,640
and so heavily produced.

378
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,120
Things were like, I don't know, fucking ramshackle,

379
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,040
like the fucking Indiana Jones bit where the the dude has, you know,

380
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,760
got his swordplay and he's danced around and then Indiana just shoots him.

381
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,760
Like that that's that's fucking cinema gold.

382
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,280
And the story behind it as well is incredible.

383
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,880
And I for one don't like the kind of the way things have gone

384
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,800
where they've proceeded to make things so polished and clean.

385
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,440
And a lot of it, I'm sure, just has to do with the technology that's available,

386
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,800
makes it easier to do.

387
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,760
And that's kind of just a constant thing that as the as we march forward

388
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,040
in technology, that's more and more of a thing.

389
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,320
And obviously that was done to to the nth degree in the Star Wars prequels.

390
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,320
But even now, I see I see elements of that in the in the newer Star Wars stuff.

391
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,720
And they just don't feel the same as like the originals that I did love.

392
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,600
So like to call it a sequel to me is like, like this is what people complain

393
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,200
about with sequels, that they're not the thing that you love.

394
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
So like, stop fucking it up.

395
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,920
The thing that's interesting about what you're saying is that those those old

396
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,520
classics, they were like big budget Hollywood productions.

397
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,360
Or yeah, I think they were the best they could do at the time.

398
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,120
They were a very like, like big, heavy production produced like lots of I mean,

399
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,560
it wasn't it wasn't like a board of directors, right?

400
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,720
But it the way just films were made back then exactly made you feel like,

401
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,320
you know, you could imagine that there's a bunch of guys in the desert

402
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,840
and they're trying to get a shot and then they have their lunch break

403
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,520
and they're like, oh, it's hot out here and newer movies.

404
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,320
It's like, I don't know, it just it just feels like I just imagine the color

405
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,880
gray and then a computer screen.

406
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,160
I just I just seize up.

407
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,680
I don't like it.

408
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,520
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

409
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,680
Something that fascinates me, there's a lot of different reasons,

410
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,040
just as there are a lot of different reasons for a movie to be made

411
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,360
or any product to be made, there's a lot of different reasons a sequel could be made.

412
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,760
And it's I think a lot of like what makes it good or bad will depend on why it's

413
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,400
happening. Totally. And like, like there's some that people make because it's like,

414
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,240
yeah, I just have more ideas.

415
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,160
I have another good idea with this world and characters.

416
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,840
So let's make a sequel and those are probably going to be the better ones.

417
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,520
And then there's the ones where it's like the show just needs to have a sequel,

418
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,880
like, like, because it has to have like, like back to the future.

419
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,720
One, two and three are examples of that.

420
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,520
Like those they had to be done because they left it deliberately open

421
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,000
and they did not give you the answers.

422
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,440
No, that's that's not what I mean.

423
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,920
No, that's more of like, like, that's more they had more ideas.

424
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Like if they left it open because they knew they could make something like,

425
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,360
you know, Assassin's Creed, where it's like, it's a new year.

426
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,840
We have to make a new Assassin's Creed.

427
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,080
Oh, I sort of like that.

428
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,880
The example I'm going to use is fucking Psycho Pass,

429
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,880
because Psycho Pass 2 is horrible.

430
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,280
It is absolutely abysmal.

431
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Why did and the only reason I think that Psycho Pass 2 exists

432
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,640
is because they were making a Psycho Pass movie and they wanted to keep the hype

433
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,120
up for it. Sure. So like that, like the Psycho Pass original TV show,

434
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,320
like like leading up to the film, first they reran the TV show

435
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,320
as hour long episodes, like they recut it.

436
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,280
They put each two episodes into one and they added in some like little extra scenes

437
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,800
and they made it like like a rerun of the show to get people hype.

438
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,360
Then they made a sequel to keep that hype going.

439
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,560
And then the movie came out like right after the second season was over.

440
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,200
So it was like all this build up to hype this movie.

441
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,000
And all the people who made the original show were working on the movie.

442
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,640
So in the meantime, oh, we need a sequel, but you guys are busy.

443
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,000
So let's hire on some other folks who don't understand the story at all.

444
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,920
Let's work on Dark Souls 2 while they make Bloodborne. Yeah.

445
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,720
Exactly. Exactly.

446
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,680
There has to be a sequel, but they don't have the right people to do it.

447
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,280
So it's like it's just born out of their needs to be one, you know?

448
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,520
And then that's where you're going to get the people who don't understand

449
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,080
the fundamental artistic intent like Dark Souls 2,

450
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,840
where they their mentality was Dark Souls is a hard game.

451
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,680
Let's make a hard game. Right.

452
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,560
You know, by putting a million fucking enemies behind this one door,

453
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,560
that there's no way to fucking defeat at all.

454
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,640
That's that's that's that's the difference between people

455
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,080
who see these things as as a piece of art and people who see it as a product

456
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,280
to be totally totally because the people who like the art,

457
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,160
they're going to sit down and be like, OK, I understand why this exists.

458
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,120
And I know what the vision behind it is.

459
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,480
And then you have people in like corporate who just like, well,

460
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,640
we we got to make our money for a quarter for we're going to release this land

461
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,760
and blah, blah, blah. I really think that a smart creator

462
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,320
knows that the corporate entity is a part of it.

463
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,640
And you can't just say, oh, I'm an artist and I have my vision

464
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,920
and it must just be one thing.

465
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,920
I think like if you're going to be a smart boy and you're going to, you know,

466
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,760
make things, you're going to write stories, you're going to make movies.

467
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,000
You should always have in the back of your mind written down somewhere

468
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,760
like sequel baits that if in case you're forced to make a sequel,

469
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,240
you have something, yes, but you should never like plan for it to exist.

470
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,680
You know, just like as a backup, because then then you can you can you can have both.

471
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,480
You can be an artistic genius boy and you can make money.

472
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,560
And you're very right.

473
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,360
It's really a delicate balance, especially. I recommend.

474
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,720
Sorry, I recommend everybody.

475
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,760
If you're trying to be a screenwriter, do anything that will involve you

476
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,080
in the corporate world of like creating.

477
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,120
Listen to everything Max Landis ever says,

478
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,800
because he is extremely good at explaining that world and his place in it.

479
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,240
And he has the mindset that Hippo is describing here.

480
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,760
The dude's written over a hundred movies like he just constantly has more ideas

481
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,680
for like if they won't take this one, here's a slightly different version.

482
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,800
Or like here's my ideas for if I have to make a sequel.

483
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,920
Here's my ideas for this and that.

484
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,080
It's like he's just got so many different contingencies for if it works,

485
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,360
because you can't be precious about your work if you want to sell it,

486
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,400
especially in Hollywood, you know, on this subject, though, what's interesting is

487
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,880
so one of the most beloved sequels of all time.

488
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,920
You may have heard of it is Godfather 2 and Godfather 2 was famous

489
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,600
because it was the first sequel ever to win the Oscar for Best Picture.

490
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,080
And that was quite a noteworthy event.

491
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,840
And what's especially interesting about it was that like as you'd expect.

492
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,760
So the Godfather 1 was based on a book by some Dimitri Puzo or something.

493
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,080
Yes, some guy who had written a book and then they adapted it.

494
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,640
And obviously that's where kind of Mario Puzo, that's it.

495
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,440
And Francis Ford Coppola directed it.

496
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,600
And that was a beloved project.

497
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,440
Actually, Coppola was actually put on it by a studio.

498
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,760
He didn't even want to do it at first.

499
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,280
And there was a lot of whatever bullshitting going on.

500
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,160
But it eventually turned out to be a great product.

501
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,480
And so once Godfather 1 was such a success, like it was a studio request

502
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,240
that they go on and make Godfather 2.

503
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,400
And like so he was not at all prepared to do Godfather 2.

504
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,560
And there was like no, there was nothing prepared for it.

505
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,280
But like it's just that the people working on the project

506
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,320
just happened to be so fucking good at making movies.

507
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,760
And I actually think Godfather 1 is like kind of vastly superior to Godfather 2.

508
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,200
But a lot of people love Godfather 2 and I do it for the most part as well.

509
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,280
I'm a big aficionado with the Godfather movies in case you can't tell.

510
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,920
But so ultimately like this is a situation where people were totally

511
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,080
unprepared. It was just studio desire to make a sequel that had them do it.

512
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,760
Because Coppola had no desire to do one initially.

513
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,920
It was just because the movie was such a fucking huge success that they made it.

514
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,360
And yet they just happened to get like enough brilliant people working on it.

515
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,800
Coppola and I believe Puzo came back and wrote the screenplay for it as well.

516
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,680
That they just put together something that the people fucking loved.

517
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,840
And so like so it can be done. It can be done.

518
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,320
You know, kind of that's the same story of how the Madoka movies got made.

519
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,600
Oh yeah. Where like Madoka Magica was just such a huge success that they came

520
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,600
with the Rybujigan and were like, do you happen to have any ideas for a sequel?

521
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,400
And he was like, I guess.

522
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,840
He made a movie that was the devil, you guys.

523
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,960
He made possibly the most divisive anime movie that I can think of.

524
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,320
Personally, I'm in the I fucking hate it camp.

525
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,680
But there's definitely a camp that absolutely adores that movie.

526
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,280
I enjoyed it. Dude, that opening scene of them eating the cake monster.

527
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,240
Well, sure. Just fan service is great.

528
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,280
Yeah, God, it was so fucking tight.

529
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,040
I like that movie. I don't give a fuck.

530
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,160
Here's an idea. I want us to do some I want us to do a round robin here.

531
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,920
Word. And each of us talk about one sequel we absolutely hate or are

532
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,000
fascinated with in that it is bad and one that we absolutely love.

533
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,640
Great. Fantastic. Fascinated with this.

534
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,920
All right. So we'll start with bad ones.

535
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,640
I've got to talk about because I've been this is something I experienced recently.

536
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
The lost planet games.

537
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,520
Have any of you played lost planet?

538
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,720
I know played a little bit of it, but are they all like dino crisis?

539
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,360
No. OK, never mind.

540
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,720
But they're there.

541
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,160
It's a series of Capcom games that was for the Xbox 360.

542
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,720
The first game was like a launch title for the 360.

543
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,160
And the first game is basically like an arcade over the person shooter game.

544
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,120
Like basically you're on this planet of ice and you run around

545
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,160
and you shoot like giant bug monsters.

546
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,280
And there's lots of mechs you can pilot and you fight lots of like

547
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,320
basically just you you pilot mechs and you fight other mechs and monsters.

548
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,480
And it's really cool. It's like five hours long.

549
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,840
It's a fun game.

550
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,480
But there's a lot of ways that it obviously could have been improved with the sequel.

551
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,680
Like it's it's pretty small.

552
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,560
It was obviously like testing the hardware because it was like one of the first games

553
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,880
for the console. So like the biggest strengths that the game has are that

554
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,160
everything's really big.

555
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,400
Everything's very vertical.

556
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,040
You can like climb any surface with the grappling hook and stuff,

557
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,920
but not actually any surface.

558
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,360
So that would have been an improvement.

559
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,320
Make it so you can climb any surface.

560
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,680
Even bigger levels, even bigger monsters, more variety and choice,

561
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,920
because it's very linear.

562
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,200
There's a lot of obvious ways the game could be improved.

563
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,520
So they make a sequel and in the sequel,

564
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,560
because co-op games were all the rage at the time,

565
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,840
they just completely retool the game to be a co-op game.

566
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,640
And even though they retain all of like the weapons and controls and monsters

567
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,000
from the previous game, the level design is nothing like the first games level design.

568
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,720
And it's not really built in a way that works with the mechanics.

569
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,160
Like it's built to be they just took the mechanics of Lost Planet

570
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,320
and put them in a co-op shooter game, but they don't make sense in a co-op shooter game.

571
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,320
So it's incredibly fucking frustrating and broken.

572
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,360
Like it's a game that has some good ideas and moments where it kind of works.

573
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,800
But like it's just not it shouldn't have been done.

574
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,400
Like it was not the right IP to transform into a co-op game.

575
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,320
And so it got pretty lukewarm reviews and it didn't sell as well as the first game.

576
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,640
So then they make Lost Planet three.

577
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,920
And instead of making a game, Capcom just outsources it to some other studio.

578
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,160
This studio, here's here is everything I know about this studio.

579
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,560
They've made six games.

580
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,120
And if you go to the Wikipedia page, all it says about them is

581
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,920
they are known for having a 56 average on Metacritic.

582
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,840
And what company is this?

583
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,880
I don't remember what it's called, but like all they've made is shitty games.

584
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,320
Like all of their games, every single one of them has like a below 60 on Metacritic.

585
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,880
And that is the most noteworthy thing about the company.

586
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,280
So they make a third game that plays like it plays kind of like Mass Effect 3

587
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,960
if no one with any talent worked on the game.

588
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,240
Like if it if it was just a boring piece of shit.

589
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,600
This is Spark Unlimited Spark Unlimited, apparently.

590
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,440
Yes, Spark Unlimited.

591
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,520
This game is fun.

592
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,200
I played like the first 15 minutes of the game.

593
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,520
I was like, this is the worst game I've ever played in my life.

594
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,520
So, yeah, at that point, the idea of what Lost Planet is is just completely gone.

595
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,160
It's gone. Right.

596
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,040
You know, and like, and so you've got this first game that I would consider

597
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,280
like a strong seven to a light eight.

598
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,920
Like it's a very fine game.

599
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,280
It's not amazing.

600
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,720
And you can so easily imagine a perfect sequel, but it's not there.

601
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,840
Instead, the franchise is dead now.

602
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,320
I've lost the bureaucracy.

603
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,480
Yeah. Yep.

604
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,880
What a tragedy.

605
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,000
You know, I almost I almost feel bad for like game developers

606
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,680
who are put in a project that like corporate influence doesn't allow them

607
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,440
to like actually make the game to like be consistent with the fucking mechanics and shit.

608
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,800
Like, can you even imagine developing a game where like you're not thinking

609
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,960
about how to integrate the level design with the mechanics?

610
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,000
I can't even think about it.

611
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,520
But OK, no matter.

612
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,280
I mean, I feel like that mindset is sort of like a paint by numbers

613
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,000
because you're given the iconography, the characters, the types of things

614
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
that need to be in there because of like, let's borrow, you know, we have to have

615
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,560
this thing and that thing from that game or movie and put it in there

616
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,960
to link them because they're sequels and we'll do it kind of like they're not

617
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,560
thinking about building a game.

618
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,160
They're thinking about

619
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,400
cash it in. They're thinking about cash in an IP.

620
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,320
Yes, that, too. That, too.

621
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,360
I was like, I can't really think of like a lot of sequels that have disappointed

622
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,400
me, although, I don't know.

623
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,120
But what about Jack two?

624
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,960
I love Jack two.

625
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,440
But I was a kid at the time.

626
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,000
Jack X. Well, that's that's the thing I was going to think of.

627
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
There's going to talk about because like that feels like a spin off

628
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,920
because it's a different gameplay style in the same universe.

629
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,240
And I was thinking Mario 64.

630
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,320
I wouldn't consider a sequel to Mario, Super Mario World because of how

631
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,560
different it is.

632
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,040
And I would also consider that like a spin off technically, like like the 3D

633
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,400
Mario's were a spin off of the 2D Mario's because you can't really compare

634
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,720
one, you know, sequel sequentially to the next.

635
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,040
So let me ask you the way I think of sequels.

636
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,240
Would it would it change your opinion if instead Mario World was called Mario

637
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,480
four and then Mario 64 was called Mario five?

638
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Would that change your view of it being a sequel?

639
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,800
Um, I think, I mean, the numbers thing is always like like hardwired to

640
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
think sequel, right?

641
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,440
Because that's just a word associated with numbered stuff.

642
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,400
So I guess I might.

643
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,880
But I if I thought about it, I probably would come to the same conclusion

644
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,440
because it's like, OK, it's about branding.

645
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,200
Branding is relevant as to whether

646
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,200
something is considered a sequel or not.

647
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,120
Franchises are terrible.

648
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,240
I hate franchises.

649
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,880
I hate the fact that things in a franchise can can can exist.

650
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,120
I know there's a sequel that you despite Ratchet Future Tools of Destruction.

651
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

652
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,520
Was wrong with that one.

653
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,920
PlayStation 3, there's a number of French stuff.

654
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,200
One of the Ratchet games from PS3 sucked.

655
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,080
I played all of them like last year.

656
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,920
One of them was really good.

657
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,120
One of them sucked balls.

658
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,920
I don't remember if it was future.

659
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,360
It was the first one that this was the first one.

660
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,040
It was future.

661
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,400
But there was one Ratchet and Clank game for the PS3 that came out

662
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,720
like later in the PS3 that had it was like a weird co-op game

663
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,640
that didn't play like Ratchet and Clank or something.

664
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,120
That that is definitely a spin off.

665
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,400
I don't know how much leniency I want to give to things that I would consider

666
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,040
a spin off. I still just think spin offs are gross.

667
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,240
Yeah, I think of I think of Ratchet deadlocked as a spin off.

668
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,520
And that's actually a good game.

669
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,080
Yeah, I've heard people like that one.

670
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,600
Yeah.

671
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Yeah.

672
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,360
But anyway, fucking Ratchet and also Sly Cooper,

673
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,600
like they had great games on the PS2.

674
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,720
One, two, three, one, two, three, three games on the PlayStation 2.

675
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,160
Ratchet and Clank went to PlayStation 3

676
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,440
and it had another trilogy of games.

677
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,840
But because they knew they could make a trilogy of games,

678
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,040
the game, the first game ends on a cliffhanger,

679
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,000
which always pissed me off because it's not a complete story.

680
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,720
And you have to like that.

681
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,160
They're just like, yeah, we know you're going to buy all three of them.

682
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,320
So just fucking don't get the whole experience.

683
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,240
Yeah.

684
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,040
Agreed.

685
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
Also, it was just kind of shit in general.

686
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,680
I was under the impression it was like almost like a vignette game.

687
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,960
Like they it was only like 10 hours long, right?

688
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,720
Whereas like the previous Ratchet games had all been like 25 hours to get a hundred percent.

689
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,800
Yeah, it was it was it was really short.

690
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,960
The story was more stupid and the 3D

691
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,760
the like PlayStation 3 shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny textures

692
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,840
really annoyed me and and, you know, lens flares and stuff.

693
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,760
But the Sly games, Sly Raccoon, Sly Cooper, the gang, the gang.

694
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,160
They they look really good in the PlayStation 2

695
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,720
and in the PlayStation 3 games, they also look good.

696
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,800
Like the visuals weren't fucked and the animations were good.

697
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,000
It was just something it's definitely because it was a different studio.

698
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,160
But it doesn't it doesn't feel good.

699
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,920
It doesn't have the same like like a wit and and and like

700
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,560
story structure. It's just sort of like, oh,

701
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,280
when you're someone who doesn't know what's what's what's up when you don't have

702
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,560
the people there like when you don't have the people there

703
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,600
who like made the thing and really understand it.

704
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,240
Like you see this with like Tom Hewlett and the later like Silent Hill games.

705
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,200
Like the soul is just missing.

706
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,640
The even if even if it was never clear to anyone what actually made the games great,

707
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,680
something's you're never going to get everything,

708
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,600
especially the person like Tom Hewlett is like a self-avowed Silent Hill fanboy.

709
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,880
Like a fanboy is never going to fucking be able to like recreate it.

710
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,560
Yeah, it's always it's always with the creative minds like, like, you know,

711
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,360
George Lucas, he needs to be there a little bit.

712
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,040
And it's a fool's errand to even try to recreate it.

713
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,120
Just make something new. OK, but whatever.

714
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,840
Well, that's that's the funny thing.

715
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,280
Something I've grown to appreciate more and more.

716
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,280
The more I look at art and the more I know like the backgrounds of it is like

717
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,840
there really is a lot of art that could only have come from that one guy.

718
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,760
Damn right. Like no one else on planet fucking Earth could do it.

719
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,560
Or that one team because of just like the chemistry between them.

720
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,400
Maybe, you know, like maybe it was just at the boardroom meetings they had.

721
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,520
We're so magnetic that it spawned this this thing and like you can't recreate that.

722
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,880
You know, sometimes even they can't recreate that.

723
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,240
But imagine imagine if all of the PCP members

724
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,360
had like moved on and given their channels to people who, you know,

725
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,600
tried to be like each of all of us.

726
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:48,600
And then the PCP podcast was like it would be technically everyone kind of.

727
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,920
But it would be not even, you know, not even slightly the same.

728
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,720
That's an excellent. It might even be better, but like it's just.

729
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,400
You need you need the the brain power of the weird guy.

730
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,640
It's true. Yeah, it's true.

731
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,920
Um, Tom or Nate, you have a sequel that I've got something just to bounce off

732
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,400
of that of the last point you were just begging, I'll go into this.

733
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,040
And it's like, I'll give you a like time and place is so important for this.

734
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,920
So like a game that I kind of like Final Fantasy seven,

735
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,240
like a big theme in that whole game is like death and life after death.

736
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,520
And all of that was caused by Sakaguchi's fucking mom dying during development of the game.

737
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,120
And so they wrote it in this.

738
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,960
They made it part of the fucking story.

739
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,760
And like it's a huge thematic thing throughout the whole thing.

740
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,560
And only because of the particular circumstances there did that even happen.

741
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
So like trying to recreate that is whatever pointless.

742
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,200
But that that's what brings me to a little sequel you might have heard of

743
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,960
called Final Fantasy seven, Advent Children, direct sequel to Final Fantasy seven.

744
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,440
Yeah, of course.

745
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,920
And in a larger context, it's the entire compilation of Final Fantasy seven

746
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,720
that sort of counts like sequels, prequels, side stories, whatever.

747
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,440
The whole thing is incredibly offensive to me in every possible way.

748
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,440
It's them saying that, and of course, this extends to the remake as well.

749
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,440
I hear all these fucking people chatter in a way every fucking day about how

750
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,720
oh, they're going to have time to expand on the things they didn't get to.

751
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,160
And the original five is seven.

752
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,760
Don't you want to explore a final?

753
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,000
Don't you want to explore Midgard?

754
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,920
Don't you want to, I don't know, remember other things they wanted to put in

755
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,600
unless they wrote them down exactly, exactly.

756
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,560
Only you can maybe make a case that putting back cut content in

757
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,840
maybe could fit in there.

758
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,880
But even then, I wouldn't even want that necessarily.

759
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,120
Maybe I'd look at a case by case basis.

760
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,800
But like it's been like 25 fucking years or whatever, 30 years or something.

761
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,040
Like everyone's changed massively from the person they were

762
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,200
when the game was originally made, like they have no business meddling with this

763
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,760
shit. Somebody who fucking tells me Nomura is like qualified to remake

764
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,240
Final Fantasy seven get fucked.

765
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,680
Yes, I know he was heavily involved in the development of the characters

766
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,600
and even the shaping of much of the fundamentals of the personalities

767
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,440
of those characters.

768
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,720
He has no fucking business directing a goddamn remake of the game

769
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,760
because he's not fucking smart enough.

770
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,080
He's a corporate tool and a drawboy and he has no he's no fucking purpose

771
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,160
here, whatever, fuck these people.

772
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,920
If if if if a ukulele has taught me anything is it's the yes,

773
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,880
the getting the same guys to do the same thing still can have

774
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,240
different results if the people change because they can't help but change

775
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,480
because time we didn't even talk about that's the same environment.

776
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,040
Right. That's such a great point.

777
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,080
Like the ukulele is such a great little it's anecdotal, but it's a great

778
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,760
example of exactly what you just said.

779
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,560
They they literally got back the team back together.

780
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,440
But it had been like you said, 20 fucking years since they'd made

781
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,560
Banjo-Kazooie or whatever.

782
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,440
And apparently they didn't have a minute.

783
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,320
Didn't have it in them and I'm sure it wasn't literally everyone

784
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,000
who worked on Banjo-Kazooie.

785
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,680
And I'm sure I didn't have the budget of Banjo-Kazooie.

786
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,360
And I'm sure like, you know, it didn't have the corporate structure of

787
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,960
Rareware, a bunch of guys fucking around, you know, where who's their boss?

788
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,080
Who do they have to answer to at the end of the day?

789
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,840
Yeah, it's it's like if you want to make a fucking Kickstarter

790
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,880
repackers, nobody.

791
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,520
If you tell me about like like close as possible sequel, you need both

792
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,160
the artist and the like the corporate situation that they were in when

793
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,520
they made the thing in the first place.

794
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,320
Yeah. Yeah.

795
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,760
So they need the same sort of incentives.

796
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,680
Another thing I think is you have to like keep striking while the iron's hot.

797
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,040
Like when you when you have like 20 years removed from the original thing,

798
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,240
like these people grow, they change, they have different motivations and stuff.

799
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,560
There's no way I could create any of the shit on my YouTube channel.

800
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,680
There's no way I could make the same thing 20 years from now.

801
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,400
Of course, like there is no fucking way.

802
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,360
And like, even if that stuff ends up having like a huge impact on some people

803
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,520
and they still remember like the asterisk where sucks 20 years from now,

804
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,080
like, which there's no way.

805
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,040
But like if if that happens, there's no way I could just make another like,

806
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,680
oh, I'm going to finally do season two after 20 years.

807
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,680
Like, no, like fucking great example of this is for all of us.

808
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,640
None of us could make my little pony videos with the kind of enthusiasm we do.

809
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,560
Yeah, great. That's a great example.

810
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,360
Yeah, I would be fucking impossible because it's just I'm like it's not

811
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,480
that I've lost the abilities I had, but the the mindset isn't there.

812
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,680
And it's just like like just like the most important part.

813
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,240
Just that it's this is so fucking basic and so many people don't fucking get it.

814
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,800
So let me beat into your goddamn skulls.

815
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,920
Like just think about it, people.

816
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,520
Like fucking Nomura was the one who I believe as I was reading.

817
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,440
Still talking about.

818
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,880
I was just a great example.

819
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,560
Nomura was the guy who suggested that Aris die.

820
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,360
I believe it was him because I like there was discussion about like they were going

821
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,560
to have a character die, maybe be Tifa, maybe somebody else.

822
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,160
And I believe Aris was like his suggestion is like,

823
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,320
she should die, whatever.

824
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,080
And like like it's been 25 fucking years or whatever.

825
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,800
Like the man's a father now.

826
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,480
He's like a huge corporate like he's so ingrained in the corporatocracy of

827
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,160
Square Enix, this giant behemoth of a company, which does so much now,

828
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,480
so much more now than the small potatoes of making a fucking shitty JRPG series

829
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,360
that's nobody gives a shit about anymore.

830
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,800
You know, like he is a different fucking man.

831
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,720
He's not a maverick artist anymore.

832
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,120
Like like you could argue that he was.

833
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,560
I don't even know if he fucking was.

834
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,680
But like people fucking change and I'm so fucking sick of people saying that

835
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,280
like just because they've got Kitase, Nomura back to work on this or Grant

836
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,560
Kirk and Hope or whoever to work on fucking ukulele, it's going to be the same

837
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,760
shit. It's so fucking obviously not true.

838
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,400
It pisses me the fuck off.

839
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,160
The people don't get it.

840
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,280
Anyway, fuck the compilation of five has seven.

841
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,280
I will kill myself on the day that the remake comes out.

842
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:35,960
It's going to be great.

843
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,120
Looking forward to it.

844
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,920
OK, let's go.

845
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,760
You're going to go for fucking Mishima.

846
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,480
Yeah, you know, you're going to go into the skier.

847
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,360
You're going to fly like a helicopter into the Square Enix offices.

848
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,200
You fell yourself on the desk of Nomura.

849
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,280
Like it's going to be good to no avail.

850
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,800
Just as a symbol.

851
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,280
Yeah.

852
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,800
You know what the best set of sequels are for the like for what we were just

853
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,400
talking about is fucking Five Nights at Freddy's.

854
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,560
All of those ones that those are well received despite.

855
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah, despite what like what people like generally think of them as like a stupid

856
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,320
fucking piece of garbage series, they are actually like for the

857
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,640
people who like that sort of thing, they are great sequels and they continually

858
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,840
like because of because of how fast they're being like four months.

859
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,960
You got a new one or something.

860
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,880
It's ridiculous or something like that.

861
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,680
And it's like that they all build on the whole thing and it's like fucking

862
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,400
there's a movie at some point, I think.

863
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,800
Yeah, like this guy is no he knows what he's doing.

864
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Hey, I respect.

865
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,000
Tom, you got a sequel that disappointed you.

866
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,120
Oh God, absolutely.

867
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,480
Is it Metroid 2 Metroid Prime 2 that you were tweeting about dropping earlier

868
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:44,880
tonight?

869
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,160
I don't I'm not a huge fan of some of the stuff Metroid Prime is doing.

870
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,640
But overall, I give it I give it a solid eight for sure.

871
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,560
Oh, OK, it's not it's not a piece of shit.

872
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,560
Um, God, what was this like 2002, 2003?

873
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,240
And I think I might have told the story before on the show.

874
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,560
But I was a young lad who had just gotten his PlayStation 2 like a year ago.

875
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,280
And I was so excited for this game to come out.

876
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,160
And I was an avid reader of EGM.

877
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,120
And so every month I would double make right to double make right to oh my God.

878
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,920
I've played I've played so much of the original.

879
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,520
It's like my favorite PS2 game.

880
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,920
Fucking I have not heard you tell that story.

881
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,960
I just figured it out.

882
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,000
The details.

883
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,320
Well, here's let me let me tell you about this day.

884
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,960
Yeah, I counted down the days.

885
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,880
I watched the trailer over and over again because the trailer was fucking sick.

886
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,960
And I love the way the art style.

887
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:37,800
It was so good.

888
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,560
And you could shoot guns in two directions.

889
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,720
That's so fucking cool.

890
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,600
Pretty cool.

891
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,240
It was the fucking hype is shit.

892
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,480
And and I like I don't have like money to buy games.

893
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,280
So I buy like one or two games a year.

894
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,440
And so like I made all my purchasing decisions from Electronic Gaming Monthly.

895
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,240
I subscribe that I love that magazine.

896
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,320
And so I would always read every single one of them cover to cover.

897
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,240
Like the little comics with the two agents.

898
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,200
That was that magazine.

899
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:03,760
Sue and Chen.

900
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,000
He still makes those comics.

901
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,680
He has a YouTube channel.

902
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,400
He does animations.

903
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,080
They're fantastic.

904
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,880
Oh, I follow him.

905
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,360
He's great.

906
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,400
Um, so I get I get the month's issue where and where they are going to review

907
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,120
Devil May Cry 2 and I flip it open.

908
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,200
And I and like before you read all the reviews, there's a page where they tell

909
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,280
you what the game of the month is and it's not Devil May Cry 2.

910
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,520
Oh, no.

911
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,840
And it was at that moment I knew something bad had happened.

912
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,920
Yeah, because they would have because because a game of that scale, it could

913
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,600
have been like a seven out of ten and they would have made it game with it.

914
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,160
Like, like, like it could have been legitimately a seven out of ten, but

915
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,560
they would have given it a 10 because it was that big.

916
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,000
Exactly.

917
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,320
It has to be like a real because they had they had run multiple stories on

918
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,960
the game leading up to its release.

919
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,960
That's how I like my gun so hard over this fucking misogynist gamer culture

920
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,440
can't handle a strong female character like Lucia.

921
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,720
They fucking hit her just because she's got a vagina.

922
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,680
It's time to accept the girls can be powerful too.

923
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,640
You piece of shit.

924
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,600
Oh my God.

925
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,240
But yeah, I flipped to it and it's like 6.5, 5.5.

926
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,280
Because they did they had three people review the games back then.

927
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,840
And it was like a two parade spread of just like this game blows nuts.

928
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,240
And we're just like, oh, no, I hate.

929
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,600
I just I've literally I've never been the same person since that was that was

930
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,080
actually my first devil may cry game.

931
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,880
I fucking dude, it was the worst.

932
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,360
And then I remember my friend bought it like at some point later.

933
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,600
And so I played at his house and I was just like in awe of how bad they

934
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,720
fucked everything up.

935
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,680
That was like there were some cool ideas in there, too, which

936
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,240
which made it sting even worse because they had a dedicated dodge button

937
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,880
because like dodging was kind of like a cluster fucking the original.

938
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,040
Because you had to like hold down both shoulder buttons and shit.

939
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,320
And it was weird, but they had like just a dodge button.

940
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,880
And it made like everything so much cooler.

941
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,440
But like, yeah, the guns were shit.

942
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,800
Like there was the game feel was terrible.

943
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,080
Like the hits were awful.

944
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,920
They changed the way the combo system worked and it was really bad.

945
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,800
And oh, it was it was did you have to go back and beat those games

946
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,960
as a devil may cry fan?

947
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,800
Just out of I have beat I've beaten them all but two because I just can't get

948
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,880
through it. It's just so painfully bad.

949
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,360
Why was to so bad?

950
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,000
Like what happened in production?

951
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,200
Did some of it was not come a Mia or whatever.

952
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,840
He didn't direct.

953
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,360
I know he had nothing to do with it.

954
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,640
They passed it off to a new studio and they clearly had no idea what they

955
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,600
were doing. So did he come back for three?

956
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,360
Yes, I believe he came back for three because three was fucking amazing.

957
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,640
And like, yeah, it's like Dark Souls.

958
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,120
It's true. It's true.

959
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,040
You can tell that they knew that the last one was so bad.

960
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,960
They like, wait, kicked everything up to 11.

961
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,560
And if it is, if it is literally Dark Souls,

962
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,280
what was Kamiya doing during Devil May Cry 2's development?

963
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,000
Oh, that's check. That is a damn good question.

964
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,080
Did he work on he was beautiful seven or that have been later?

965
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,720
I don't I'm going to check.

966
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,200
I'm going to look at his beautiful Joe is too long later.

967
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,040
Resident Evil Zero.

968
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,640
Now, Devil May Cry, Resident Evil Zero, beautiful Joe Phoenix,

969
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,480
right? An ace attorney trials and tribulations.

970
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,600
What the fuck? Oh, voice actor for Godot in the Japanese version.

971
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,320
Never mind.

972
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,360
Yeah, either Resident Evil Zero or beautiful Joey is working out at the time.

973
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,520
It's probably Resident Evil.

974
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,720
Both much better games than Devil May Cry 2.

975
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,560
So time will spend. I'll give him that.

976
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,400
Yeah. But yeah, oh, my God, it's just

977
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,080
it's the level of disappointment.

978
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,040
Just it can't be described in words.

979
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,960
It was that was when my child.

980
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,960
He didn't work on Devil May Cry 3, though.

981
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,440
That's not. No, he did not. No, he did not.

982
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,360
Somebody else really.

983
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,320
So yeah, somebody else who is also a jury.

984
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,840
I don't know. I don't know.

985
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
It's deadly. The spiritual

986
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,960
the spiritual sequel to that man worked on Devil May Cry 3.

987
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,920
The same guy who did three do four then

988
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,880
because like it's interesting you say that that man, my favorite

989
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,640
character of all time, I don't know what his name is.

990
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,800
I don't know that.

991
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,640
That's the main villain of Guilty Gear X.

992
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,800
That man character that man.

993
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,400
Gabe, you are aware that that's a character or were you just

994
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,400
were you memeing? No, no, he was not at all.

995
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,160
There's a guy. Now you know, there's the main villain in Guilty Gear

996
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,240
is literally named that man.

997
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
God, I fucking love it.

998
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,280
That's not my favorite thing about Guilty Gear by far.

999
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,440
Rad Khan Awakening.

1000
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,440
I'm doing a lecture on the lore of Guilty Gear.

1001
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,440
Get ready. I can't wait.

1002
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,600
I can't wait.

1003
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,280
It looks it looks like DMC three was done by a guy.

1004
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,960
It was actually done by the same guy who did DMC two.

1005
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,280
What? Yeah, this guy.

1006
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,000
I guess you've got a shit together.

1007
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,760
Hideaki Itsuno and he directed

1008
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,800
Yeah, we cry two through four and Dragon's Dog.

1009
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,000
Wow. OK, I guess they just like, I don't know,

1010
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,320
figured their shit out or something.

1011
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,760
Wow, that that confuses the hell you know what?

1012
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,120
You know what? I kind of respect that.

1013
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,880
I kind of respect that this guy like, you know,

1014
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,440
he pulled himself up from the from the from the abyss.

1015
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,960
From the apparently he was only brought on

1016
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,800
to Devil May Cry two midway through development

1017
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,360
to replace an unidentified director

1018
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,800
dissatisfied by how their work on the game was coming together.

1019
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,160
Basically, he had to salvage the project from somebody.

1020
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,840
He's the guy who brought the dodge button.

1021
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,360
I got you. Yeah, I'm sure that's right.

1022
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:00,960
Absolutely.

1023
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,760
Fast. We went we he probably went.

1024
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,160
OK, this game is completely unplayable.

1025
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,200
But at least if we put in a dodge button,

1026
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,640
beatable contribution, it was just really fantastic.

1027
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,960
Atrocious. But yeah, that was my biggest sequel let down.

1028
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,240
You know, it's funny.

1029
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,440
The first Devil May Cry I played was Devil May Cry two.

1030
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,360
And I remember thinking what the fuck is going on?

1031
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,600
I'm not going to play this game anymore.

1032
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Yeah, you made the right call.

1033
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,000
Good series. God damn it. Fuck.

1034
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,800
Devil May Cry five.

1035
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,280
When total gaming Brit, I was going to call him total biscuit.

1036
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,760
I'm at the gaming Brit.

1037
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,640
I've given up hope every E3.

1038
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,040
I'm just like, is this going to be the year and it's never the year.

1039
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,720
This is now the Devil May Cry cast.

1040
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,520
We've really what's what's each of your favorite sequel

1041
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,080
or one that's interesting in some way.

1042
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,480
I got one. Sure.

1043
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,320
All right, go for it.

1044
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,800
So my there's a ton of great fucking fantastic sequels.

1045
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,200
Halo two was amazing.

1046
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,960
But but the one that I think really fucking blew my mind

1047
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,600
in terms of just like taking a good idea and making it so much better

1048
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,720
was Zone of the Enders, the second runner. Oh, yeah.

1049
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,440
Oh, yeah. That's absolutely true.

1050
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,400
The game is the kid.

1051
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,560
Can we just appreciate how fucking good that intro for that game is?

1052
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,360
Is that like they build up this whole thing of just like, oh,

1053
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,320
the Jehuti is so much more like aerobatic

1054
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,960
and it can move around, you can shoot multiple guys.

1055
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,520
And it's not just one on one combat anymore, but they give you like 10 minutes.

1056
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,040
I can't aerodynamic and acrobatic.

1057
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,360
I think it's both you correcting Tom's pronunciation.

1058
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,320
So so. But the great thing of that game is at the beginning,

1059
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,360
they just trap you in the shitty mining mech.

1060
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,680
And you have to walk down a straight path for 10 minutes.

1061
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,000
It is like, oh, my God, please end me.

1062
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,880
And then you get into Jehuti and it's so much fucking better.

1063
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,320
And you're like, oh, my God.

1064
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,400
And then you lock on like 50 dudes at once.

1065
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,520
And it's the greatest.

1066
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,200
And then at the end of the game, you get the fucking Nitro Cannon or whatever

1067
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,080
the fuck it's called. Oh, my God.

1068
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,440
It was the fucking best.

1069
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,360
That whole that whole Anubis fight was so fucking awesome.

1070
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,640
Yeah, I gave fucking rules.

1071
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,400
Kojima Productions, Zone of the Enders 3.

1072
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,960
When I'm ready for it, baby, laying on me.

1073
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,800
Wasn't there a lost in concept about that or something?

1074
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,960
There was a hyper bit hero.

1075
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,880
Yeah, it was like a thing that was supposed to happen.

1076
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,200
I got to check that out again.

1077
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,080
I forget the details.

1078
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,840
Everything good. I don't get.

1079
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,680
I just made a vlog yesterday about how all my favorite gaming series are dead.

1080
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,080
I have no leg in the race, including just like your precious Dreamcasts

1081
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,160
and your Sega consoles.

1082
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,480
Yeah, that's everything I like dies.

1083
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,120
So I'm expecting all of you to die soon.

1084
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,680
What is a good ongoing game?

1085
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,360
I guess you don't like Zelda or Mario, right?

1086
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,520
Like, I think the only the only thing is Metroid.

1087
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,680
Metroid's the only game that I still like.

1088
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,480
And that like, I mean, I just got revived like two days ago.

1089
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,200
Exactly.

1090
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,240
So now that I'm into it, I'm sure Prime for a bomb.

1091
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,080
It'll be terrible.

1092
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,680
It's not going to be done by retro studios, by some fucking

1093
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,200
what's the guys who did lots of planet?

1094
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,200
They're going to be doing.

1095
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,000
Spark unlimited or something.

1096
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,240
Yeah, it's going to be a shit show.

1097
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,240
All right, let me let me give you my favorite sequel of all time.

1098
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,880
I've talked about it a lot.

1099
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,480
But but once upon a time, there was a piece of shit called Gun Buster.

1100
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,120
And then they did everything right for once and made

1101
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,600
Die Buster like 15 years later or whatever.

1102
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,480
Now, Gun Buster is fantastic.

1103
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,280
And the fact that I like Die Buster even more or rather aim for the top one

1104
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,280
Gun Buster and aim for the top two Die Buster is just a testament

1105
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,720
to how fucking great Die Buster is.

1106
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,320
So Gun Buster, everybody.

1107
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,040
It's the old-ass Amino directed 80s anime about Amino.

1108
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:38,920
What do I say?

1109
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,880
Amino directed.

1110
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,200
I say Ahiru fucking.

1111
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,320
What's the man's name?

1112
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,240
I know, right?

1113
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,560
Whatever. That guy, he directed a piece of shit anime.

1114
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,640
It was really good.

1115
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,360
I loved it about about being in space, a bunch of sexy girls having

1116
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,400
hard work and guts, and then they travel close to the speed of light.

1117
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,760
So relatively gets all fucked and everybody ages.

1118
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,880
And it's the best thing ever.

1119
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,800
But then then his his little deputy animator guy, what's his name?

1120
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,880
Digi director Kasia Sudamaki, that's his protege protege.

1121
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,320
That's the word made fully coolie.

1122
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:18,720
And then he made Die Buster and it was it it capitalized on everything

1123
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,360
that was great about the original in terms of like continuing the narrative

1124
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,480
in an interesting way by continuing like the how they were.

1125
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,120
Humanity has dealt with the threat of the space monsters post the black hole

1126
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:34,560
bombs, you know, eruption, some unspecified time ago.

1127
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,800
And oh, the fact they don't tell you when Die Buster takes place.

1128
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,600
And then the ending, oh my God, and then as no, no, my favorite

1129
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,360
wife of all time, besides Nika Robin.

1130
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:49,960
Yes, you know, Kasia Sudamaki, that director, he just finally made another OVA.

1131
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,560
Like what's what's the OVA early last early this year or late last year,

1132
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,680
two episodes called Dragon Dentist.

1133
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,560
And I haven't seen it yet, but I've heard it's fantastic.

1134
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,000
But it's the first because he's one who's he's one who's been fucking up

1135
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,440
on the Ava rebuild movies for 10 years, but he finally did something else.

1136
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,000
And Dragon's Dentist.

1137
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,840
That's very exciting.

1138
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,520
I should watch them.

1139
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,960
It was originally the first, you know, the the Studio Car Animator

1140
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,320
Expo. Yes, Mimi me came from like the first one of those was the original

1141
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,960
Dragon Dentist short and they expanded that into a two episode OVA.

1142
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,640
I think each episode is like 45 minutes long, too.

1143
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,360
I should watch all of those, including the original.

1144
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,760
Well, I can do that guy is a legend and I fucking love him.

1145
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,680
And Die Buster is like the coolest, comfiest, beautiful, love everything about it.

1146
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,560
Anime of all time, great sequel, great sequel.

1147
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,560
There you go. It can be done, everybody.

1148
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:49,880
And I'm a big anti-sequel guy, but like there are times when the stars align

1149
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,960
and people just do it right, which is why I would just I would heavily discourage

1150
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,520
doing it. But if you're somebody who's got like a genius idea and you're like,

1151
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,560
no, listen to me, here's my proposal for the sequel.

1152
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,400
I am going to use the themes that were here and artistically show you how I'm

1153
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,800
going to capitalize them and make them better than ever and more relevant and

1154
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,240
emotionally tie my story into that one, then approve.

1155
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,920
And that's why we're all looking forward to Fooly Cooly 2.

1156
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,640
It's going to be the best thing ever.

1157
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,120
Well, Kazia Saramaki is not directing that.

1158
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,240
Yeah, unfortunately.

1159
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,680
I believe the guy who directed Psycho Pass is directing Fooly Cooly 2.

1160
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,680
Even if he was directing it, that wouldn't necessarily make me any.

1161
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,480
Well, OK, it wouldn't help a little bit, but, you know, it's been 20 fucking years or whatever.

1162
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,560
OK, I'm done. That's it. Die Buster.

1163
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,600
Oh, man, Hippo, you got one?

1164
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,600
Great sequel.

1165
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,160
I've got a few.

1166
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,000
Like I was trying to think because a lot of my favorite games just happened to be

1167
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,440
the first in a series, but I do have one.

1168
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,480
It's a it's a Shrek 2 the game on PC.

1169
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,720
It's actually terrible.

1170
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,520
Don't play any game of Shrek 2.

1171
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,640
Oh, I just want to.

1172
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,680
Incidentally, Davoo did map out a chart for us

1173
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,840
of the quality of the Shrek films over time, which is very convenient that.

1174
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,480
Yes, we'll see the problem with his.

1175
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,800
Well, OK, it's the quality consensus chart.

1176
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,800
Oh, right. Consensus is that Shrek 1 is above the good line.

1177
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,040
Shrek 2 is way above the good line.

1178
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,080
Shrek 3 is below the good line.

1179
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,680
Yes. Shrek 4 is bottomed below the chart bad, right, as well as Puss in Boots.

1180
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,640
But the problem with this, while this is the consensus, the consensus is wrong.

1181
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,280
And Shrek 1 is in a horror film.

1182
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,640
Absolutely untrue.

1183
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,120
Shrek 1 is great.

1184
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,360
Oh, man, everyone.

1185
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,800
You watch it. Hi, everyone.

1186
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,960
Go watch that.

1187
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,240
No, that's why that.

1188
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,000
Do you not know the story info that I know that's what you said?

1189
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,240
That's why I watch it.

1190
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,160
So it's just watching a hundred.

1191
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,400
No, all you need to watch in that movie is the epic video on, I believe,

1192
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,880
a little channel called Gibb and take that's Shrek without Shrek or like Shrek

1193
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,200
until Shrek appears or whatever it is.

1194
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,400
Yeah, it's Shrek.

1195
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,080
But every time Shrek appears on screen, the movie.

1196
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,400
Yeah, that's the one.

1197
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,720
I give it literally is like some and that's the best bang of the outhouse opens

1198
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,440
and cuts to black. Oh, fuck, it's the best.

1199
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,360
It's the best.

1200
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,560
I have like a movie one.

1201
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,560
Lord of the Rings, the two towers, I think is the best Lord of the Rings film.

1202
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,920
Oh, yeah.

1203
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:26,360
It's it's it's so it's so I've seen it on TV too many times, though.

1204
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,600
That makes it a bad movie that the personal problem, dude.

1205
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,120
Yeah, you're not wrong. You're not wrong.

1206
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,760
What about the second one makes it your favorite one?

1207
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,560
The Riders of Rohan.

1208
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,160
But the thing that the thing like the first one's great, obviously,

1209
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,320
there's the there's the big there's the guy you shall not go across.

1210
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,520
And it smashes the bridge and and you know, there's the Mines of Moria.

1211
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,520
It's like really cool.

1212
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:55,400
The Nazgul, you know, he's got the second one has the trees

1213
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,360
and the Saruman and the big attack.

1214
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,680
And it's got the Battle of Helms deep.

1215
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,720
I was about to say Jesus Christ, that's a big castle.

1216
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,800
Helms deep is the obvious, the most obvious reason.

1217
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,800
I think for me, it's hard to separate the three

1218
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,480
because like I think all of them have strengths and weaknesses

1219
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,280
that have to do with the fact that they are part of a series.

1220
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:22,480
Like to me, I'd prefer to think of that as one nine hour story as opposed to sequels.

1221
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,320
Well, like true. They're kind of all one.

1222
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,880
Like there's there's nothing significantly different about them.

1223
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,160
They're all just like the same story being told across three movies.

1224
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,160
You know, I guess.

1225
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,960
But the way I've always like felt is that, you know,

1226
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,800
the first two were sort of out when I was young.

1227
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,000
And then the third one took a while to come out and it had elephants and weird things.

1228
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,600
And I just like that there's ghosts here.

1229
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,200
I don't understand what's going on.

1230
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,960
I didn't understand any of it.

1231
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,720
So I didn't like that.

1232
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,280
I thought the Hobbit unexpected journey was good,

1233
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,160
but the desolation of Smough really really kicked things up a notch.

1234
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,400
That's actually the opposite.

1235
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,600
Like I liked that first Hobbit movie, but the second one I just gave up.

1236
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,400
That's what I hear people.

1237
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,800
Watch the third one. Yeah, yeah.

1238
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,120
I still like it.

1239
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,560
Delete yourselves.

1240
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,600
Yeah, I've heard the third one.

1241
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,400
Where do they kill the fucking dragon?

1242
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,880
Which one is that at the very beginning of the third one?

1243
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,040
Which is why it's the worst.

1244
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:21,440
That's why that's also why it's the entire second movie is entirely dedicated

1245
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:26,800
to hunting the dragon and it ends before they fucking fight it on a total anti-climax.

1246
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,160
It is the shittiest ending I've ever seen.

1247
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,640
Five minutes into the next one, they just kill it.

1248
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,480
And it's just why didn't you just have the movie be five extra minutes?

1249
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,680
Because they know it's the worst one and they wanted people to fucking see it.

1250
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,840
You're not wrong, you're not wrong.

1251
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,680
It kind of reminds me of like in the Gurren Logan like film adaptations of the show.

1252
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,200
Like so the whole fight, this is like the most disgusting thing ever.

1253
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,680
Like the first film ends like at the point where like Simone becomes a man,

1254
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,720
which is like a fantastic climax, but then they compress the entire battle

1255
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,160
against Lord Genome, which was like literally the best part of the entire show

1256
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:02,080
except for the actual final climax and they make a fucking clip show out of it

1257
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,480
at the beginning of the second movie.

1258
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,960
What the fuck were they thinking?

1259
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,480
What a mistake. What a fucking mistake.

1260
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,800
Wait, did they I thought there was like a super fucking well animated version

1261
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,600
of the fight with Genome in the second movie?

1262
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,440
Absolutely not.

1263
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,840
Like he walks down the front of his mech and all that.

1264
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,040
That happens in the movie, that happens in the show too.

1265
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,560
And maybe I'm thinking of the show then.

1266
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,200
Yeah, I mean, the show fight is fantastic.

1267
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,280
It's it's like one of the best points of the whole show.

1268
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,240
But, you know, they fucked up in the movie.

1269
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,760
Trust me.

1270
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,240
In terms of in terms of video games, I can't really decide between

1271
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,280
Wretched and Clank 2, Sly 2, Sly 3 and Ape Escape 2.

1272
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,040
So all of those are like like really good.

1273
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,720
The thing about I think video game sequels have a much higher propensity

1274
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,240
for being like better because you don't necessarily

1275
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,920
just use the the stories and stuff.

1276
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,080
Yeah. And you're usually like really tweaking the game play.

1277
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,920
By the way, guys, I just wanted to to let you know, I'm looking here

1278
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,600
on the wiki for the Hobbit films.

1279
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,800
The total budget for all three films was six hundred and twenty five

1280
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,280
million dollars for all three of these films.

1281
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,960
Just as bad as I would have thought, actually, for all three.

1282
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,200
For all. Yeah, it's all three combined.

1283
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,000
Look at the fucking look at the cost of like pirates three.

1284
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,040
I will. That movie is like three hundred and fifty million dollars by itself.

1285
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,080
All right, you reminded me of pirates.

1286
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,760
The second one is not second.

1287
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,200
The second one is no way.

1288
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,200
The second was no, as soon as Johnny, not Johnny Depp,

1289
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,440
fucking as soon as yeah, the second or third one are not great.

1290
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,600
The first one is a legend and I love it.

1291
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,960
The first one is amazing.

1292
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:42,760
But I think second and third as like a as like a sequence

1293
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,000
to each other. I mean, actually, it's they're good.

1294
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,720
It's a fascinating example, actually, because the entire Pirates of the Caribbean

1295
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,600
idea is based on a fucking ride at Disneyland and they made it into a movie.

1296
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,040
So they just obviously had some like good script writers or somebody who thought

1297
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,960
like, yeah, let's make a fun action adventure.

1298
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,440
And then like it was the further corporatization as like those ideas dried up

1299
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,320
and then like Davey Jones or something. Fine, do that.

1300
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,760
And it was not as good. Yeah.

1301
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,800
I got to watch them again.

1302
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,720
Yeah, the first one is great.

1303
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,160
The first one is so good.

1304
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,120
I watched it recently.

1305
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,320
It definitely holds up.

1306
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,920
But this is just just a little bit of a level does not hold up though.

1307
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,960
I like it.

1308
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,160
The like there's like a part in the third one.

1309
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,800
I remember liking the third one because of how stupid and complicated it is.

1310
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,640
And and and all the like the crisscrossing alignments and like the stuff.

1311
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,840
It is like, oh, I feel so smart.

1312
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,640
This is the great Gatsby guy.

1313
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,560
I'm really you really need a high IQ to understand the parts of the Caribbean

1314
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,600
three. Right. Very true.

1315
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,400
Four is four is way off.

1316
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,280
Get out of it. I heard five was OK, though.

1317
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,280
There that was what I haven't even seen it.

1318
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,720
I just go. I just watched.

1319
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,640
I thought I heard Jesse. Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

1320
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,840
I think Jesse liked it.

1321
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,000
So I've been just kind of combing through my favorites list.

1322
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,200
And I've got two sequels.

1323
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,680
I got to mention the first one and this one I'm hesitant to count.

1324
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,080
But it's K on season two.

1325
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,920
And the reason I'm hesitant to count it is that it's just continuing to adapt

1326
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,120
to the manga, you know, it came out a year later.

1327
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,320
It's essentially just a second season.

1328
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:25,600
But the ramp up in production value for season two and just the way that

1329
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:30,080
it's so clear they were taking it more seriously is what makes like it's

1330
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,600
when you get to season two that K on really starts to feel like a masterpiece.

1331
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,720
You know, yeah, like the first season is really good.

1332
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,320
And especially rewatching it when you know all the characters.

1333
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,640
It's a ton of fun.

1334
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,560
But season two is where it gets like it becomes Kino, essentially, you know,

1335
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,120
it's it's really interesting thinking about that as like an idea,

1336
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:52,320
because like in real world terms, season two is a sequel.

1337
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,480
And you would think and talk about it as a sequel,

1338
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,040
but it is just continuing.

1339
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,840
Yeah, something that would have been there.

1340
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,800
Like you if you get rid of season two, it's like Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.

1341
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,880
It is just one.

1342
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,800
But it is a new project, you know, because they like re you know, they're like,

1343
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,760
yeah, but what I'm et cetera, et cetera.

1344
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,920
What I'm getting at is like, there's like, should a sequel be something

1345
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,480
that was not necessarily planned and then they decide to do.

1346
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,200
That's kind of how I tend to think.

1347
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:22,560
Like if I mean, if the manga is one ongoing work and the two seasons

1348
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,840
of the anime are basically the same, it's just like, like, for instance,

1349
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,440
Food Wars is a show that's airing its third season right now.

1350
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,560
And like if you watch all of Food Wars all the way through,

1351
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,120
you're not going to notice like a huge difference across the three seasons.

1352
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,280
It's more like, oh, we're just doing another one.

1353
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,480
You know, like the last one was successful

1354
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,640
enough that we can do another chunk, but it's all the same manga.

1355
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,960
It's all the same story.

1356
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,480
Whereas, for instance, a Ghost in the Shell standalone complex season two.

1357
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,680
It's an original show.

1358
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,840
And like while it's cribbing a lot of ideas from the same manga,

1359
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,680
like it's a it's a whole new script that they had to create from scratch

1360
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:01,520
and like tell a whole different story based on having made the first one.

1361
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,560
So I tend to think of that as more of a sequel.

1362
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:09,520
In Kayon's case, like like half of the anime is original content, if not more.

1363
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,400
In fact, in season two, almost all of it's original to the show,

1364
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,680
because they're adapting two volumes of manga into 26 episodes of anime.

1365
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,640
And like just adding in tons of shit and making it more cinematic.

1366
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,560
So like to me, it's not a sequel in the sense of like,

1367
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,480
oh, it's a different story, but it's a sequel in the sense of

1368
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,880
the first season allowed us to do this with season two.

1369
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,840
Like now we can make it the show.

1370
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,240
It was always like could have been like realized the potential of it,

1371
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,320
which is kind of what we're saying.

1372
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,120
Video game sequels allow you to do right so much, you know,

1373
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,320
which brings me to my second example.

1374
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:49,480
Dark Souls 3 fucking per like even I would even have said

1375
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:54,400
Dark Souls is a spiritual sequel to Demon's Souls, pretty obviously.

1376
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,680
And Bloodborne as a spiritual sequel to Dark Souls, all fantastic.

1377
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,840
But there is enough of a leap in style.

1378
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,440
Dark Souls 3 is just straight up.

1379
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,560
It's it's the new Dark Souls and it's fucking amazing.

1380
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,560
I enjoyed it.

1381
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,120
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt,

1382
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,120
but I just I don't want to bring up something about that.

1383
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,480
So you and I and Jesse did our Dark Souls 3 PCP a while ago.

1384
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,000
And like we all agree that it's fantastic and we loved it.

1385
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,720
And that was even before the DLC came out that made it even better.

1386
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,240
And I just wanted to ask, have you seen I'm quite perplexed by like,

1387
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,760
I see a level of negativity on Dark Souls 3 out in the world

1388
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,080
that absolutely baffles me.

1389
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,000
And I don't know what the nature of it is,

1390
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,440
but I see all the time rankings of like Dark Souls 3 like way below

1391
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,840
like above Dark Souls 2, but way below one.

1392
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:44,280
And I don't understand why I think I could understand it

1393
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,520
if you are someone who plays the games over and over and over again

1394
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,040
because Dark Souls 3 definitely has less choice.

1395
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,360
Yeah, that's not wrong.

1396
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,880
Like, like I feel like personally,

1397
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,600
Dark Souls 1 is like easy to just go back to and on the other hand,

1398
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,520
despite having less stuff, the game feel is improved.

1399
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,360
And like online play, obviously, is way easier.

1400
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,280
So like there's if you're just talking about easier,

1401
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,680
but is it as do people enjoy it as much?

1402
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,280
Like, yeah, there's there's always there's like because

1403
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,360
when it comes to stuff like that, where people play it ad nauseam forever,

1404
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,440
it really changes their opinions of it.

1405
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,080
You know, it's kind of like how you have people who

1406
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,440
like anybody who has ever been ever a fan of League of Legends.

1407
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,960
If they were into it for more than a couple of years,

1408
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,920
then their opinion of it is that it's the worst game ever made,

1409
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,400
but they've played thousands of hours of it.

1410
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,000
Oh, my God. Yeah, go ahead.

1411
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,560
Good because like you can't you can't develop

1412
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,000
like like when you're first playing it,

1413
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,360
you're just seeing it for what it is.

1414
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,360
Like it's a fun game.

1415
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,720
But like as you begin to see all the ones and zeros in the matrix

1416
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,600
and you really like analyze everything about it,

1417
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,920
you'll find reasons to not like it and stuff.

1418
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,920
And I think with with Dark Souls,

1419
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:56,080
that game just had so many weird things in it that you could do

1420
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,960
and so much sequence breaking that like you can play it over and over again

1421
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,320
and usually have somewhat of a different experience.

1422
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,200
You know, Dark Souls 3 doesn't have that ability in the same way.

1423
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,120
But I'm not someone who's ever going to play a game

1424
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,680
more than once every year or two.

1425
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,360
So that doesn't affect me at all.

1426
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,520
You know, on that way, I would see.

1427
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,720
OK, go on.

1428
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,800
The way I would see Dark Souls 3 is is like the undertale

1429
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:22,040
of the Dark Souls franchise in that it's a great game to play through.

1430
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,760
But it's I don't need to go back and play Undertale again.

1431
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,200
Like it's not that sort of a game.

1432
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,120
Dark Souls of the Undertale franchise, you know, what?

1433
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,640
Homestuck Act 5, which is what I was going to say is my favorite.

1434
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:40,480
But my might be the best sequel to an act in Homestuck was Act 5, Act 2.

1435
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,040
That's the literal peak of which one is that hippo hippo.

1436
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,920
So hold on, we need to clarify this before this becomes the main comment on the video.

1437
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,480
What you mean by I don't have to go back and play Undertale again

1438
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,360
is like in the like after having played it five times, right?

1439
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,080
Like like it's a game that necessitates playing it over and over again.

1440
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,400
For at least I mean, I mean, once you've done the stuff,

1441
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:06,280
yeah, there's no that the gameplay is not something you would go back to.

1442
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,280
Not that I'm saying that wasn't the comment we get.

1443
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I'm not saying in that way that Dark Souls 3

1444
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,160
isn't fun to play like mechanically.

1445
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,840
It's just like I would love like just to play just running around

1446
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,680
and hitting things in Dark Souls 3.

1447
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,840
But going through the levels again is like, yeah, been through them

1448
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,600
in the exact same way every time.

1449
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,160
You're not wrong.

1450
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,840
Yeah, I did it because I played through it twice the second time

1451
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,040
just to do the big sequence break of like fighting the dancer first

1452
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,440
because it's easy to do that in New Game Plus.

1453
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:41,600
But yeah, beyond that, there's not like a radically like Dark Souls one

1454
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:45,600
that game kept getting better as time passed

1455
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,640
because you kept learning about new crazy shit you could do with it.

1456
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,680
Like that was what got me so hype about the game,

1457
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,240
even though I hadn't even played it for a long time.

1458
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,560
Let's just seeing people like put together videos of like,

1459
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,800
here's everything you can do before the gargoyles

1460
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,120
and it's like a crazy amount of shit you could do.

1461
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,160
And he's like, oh, my God, have you seen that streamer?

1462
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,720
I forget his name who does like a challenge runs

1463
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,920
and he's done like every single challenge run possible,

1464
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,040
like not using the left analog stick or the right analog stick

1465
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,440
to move the camera and like just plays the whole game like that.

1466
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,720
Fascinating or playing with incredible with the fucking rock band drums.

1467
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,760
You know, though, this completely reminds me of a sequel

1468
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,120
that I suppose Dabuster 2 is my favorite sequel ever,

1469
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,760
but only because of like the whatever doesn't matter.

1470
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,120
But the point is, I was going to say,

1471
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,440
Kingdom Hearts 2 is also a tremendous sequel

1472
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,800
that is one of my favorite things in the world.

1473
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,000
And it's interesting what you were saying, Digi,

1474
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,760
about like the whole replay issue of playing things over and over.

1475
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,160
And Kingdom Hearts 2 is so fascinating

1476
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:45,480
because it is kind of the absolute most boring the first time you play it.

1477
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,480
And every time you play it afterward,

1478
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,560
it gets better and better and better

1479
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:54,480
because the core fundamentals of the gameplay are so unbelievably tight

1480
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,400
and scientific and calculated and perfected in that game

1481
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,800
that you've got these massive communities. Yes, you're going to have to

1482
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,600
like when we live in the same city, you're going to have to sit me down

1483
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,040
and like guide me through Kingdom Hearts 2.

1484
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,720
The only way I'm ever going to play it is if you sit there next to me

1485
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:16,000
and like explain to me everything about the game while I'm playing.

1486
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
That's the only way I'll enjoy it. I would be so thrilled to do that.

1487
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,600
But I'll give you a quick tip.

1488
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,840
The first time I played it was a friend of mine trying to force me to play it.

1489
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,240
Like the same way he sat next to me,

1490
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,640
but he didn't explain anything because he's terrible at explaining things.

1491
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,880
So I just sat there and complained about it for four hours and he laughed.

1492
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,840
Yes, I suffered.

1493
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,920
I'll give you a quick tip, though,

1494
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,520
that will aid you and anyone else out there who wants to get into Kingdom Hearts 2

1495
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,080
and not suffer through it.

1496
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,280
Just literally skip every cutscene.

1497
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,160
Just skip them all. Don't give a shit.

1498
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,400
Oh, thank you.

1499
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,880
Holy shit. Just do that.

1500
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:52,400
That's the greatest permission anyone has ever given me for a game.

1501
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,720
Yeah. Oh, my God.

1502
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,560
Skip every single one.

1503
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,560
Now I want to play it.

1504
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,600
Yeah, and you will have fun.

1505
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,840
You'll have fun if you just follow this one simple tip of not giving a fuck

1506
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,200
about anything anyone says in that game.

1507
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,640
The man who did the full presentation on the story of Kingdom Hearts,

1508
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,680
advocating, I mean, all of the cuts.

1509
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,280
There's a time that's just his ploy to get to watch that video.

1510
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:17,480
That video, like the takeaway for the video was none of this shit matters.

1511
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,800
That's why there's there's a time solving you.

1512
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,160
There's a time when you when when a man is forced to face the reality

1513
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,920
of the human psyche and just say no one wants to sit through this shit.

1514
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,400
We've just got to I want people to play Kingdom Hearts 2,

1515
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,120
but I understand the reality that no one fucking wants to

1516
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,720
unless they skip all of this shit.

1517
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,720
You are legitimately a hero for that.

1518
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,280
There are not many fans of a game who will tell you that.

1519
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,200
Well, you know what?

1520
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,720
Yeah, it's because I've watched a lot of speed runs and like the speed run community.

1521
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,840
Like, yeah, they don't give a shit.

1522
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,520
They just they just like those people just want to get to to the fun stuff.

1523
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,440
And like here, let me just give you a little taste of one of the fascinating

1524
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,280
things that you discover about Kingdom Hearts 2.

1525
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,680
If you dig past like all this bullshit on the top,

1526
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,720
there is a concept called revenge values as it's been termed by the community,

1527
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,320
which is this thing where every boss.

1528
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,040
OK, so this is a huge difference between like birth by sleep and Kingdom Hearts

1529
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,080
2 that the retards who love birth by sleep don't understand.

1530
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,360
And it's that in birth by sleep, like enemies never get stunned

1531
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,400
no matter what you hit them with.

1532
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,640
They never get stunned, whereas in Kingdom Hearts 2,

1533
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,640
enemies bosses specifically can get stunned all the times.

1534
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,240
And this is what makes boss fights fun.

1535
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:23,280
Enemy bosses can get stunned, but they have this thing called a revenge value.

1536
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,280
And it's specifically that when they're stunned,

1537
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,960
if you hit them a certain number of times, like like five or 10 or whatever,

1538
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:33,400
at that point, they will immediately snap out of being stunned and start fighting again.

1539
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:37,760
So it's it's managing the enemy's revenge values in very particular ways

1540
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,800
that allows you optimize the damage you're dealing to them and utilize certain

1541
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,000
strategies are as like this is the most advanced way to be a speed runner

1542
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,240
and calculate how to like scientifically beat from the best while feeling

1543
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,560
like a Kingdom Hearts keyblade slinging God.

1544
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,520
That's what makes Kingdom Hearts 2 so much fun.

1545
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,480
Find out this kind of shit.

1546
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,680
But there you go.

1547
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,440
Oh, anyway, Tom, what's a sequel you really like?

1548
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,000
Did we get to you yet?

1549
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,440
Yeah, I said Zone of the Unders, second runner.

1550
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,720
Oh, right. You went first.

1551
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,080
I do have a another kind of topic I wanted to bring up

1552
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,800
and see if you guys had any thoughts on.

1553
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,680
OK, this specifically deals with game sequels,

1554
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,480
but I suppose it can apply to anything because there are some games that I really like.

1555
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:21,520
The two the three examples that really come to mind are Devil May Cry, Halo,

1556
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,080
and to an extent, I guess Ninja Gaiden, but not as much

1557
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,920
because there's only two games in that series before they got chickened.

1558
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,440
But like when you have you enjoy the first game

1559
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:35,760
and it has like a specific feel and then the sequel tweaks the feel significantly.

1560
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,640
And then that just becomes the default feel for the series.

1561
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,760
And then you kind of lose a little bit of what made the first one great

1562
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,280
because you play Devil May Cry one, then you play three because two doesn't exist.

1563
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,680
And the feel is way different.

1564
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,840
Like you have the style system, the way the work is different.

1565
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:57,080
And then and then you go to four and four feels exactly the same.

1566
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,240
And then you play Halo one to Halo two, Halo two overfines everything.

1567
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,480
It changes the way it feels.

1568
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,680
Then three feels exactly the same.

1569
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,720
It's the very same way. Yeah. Yeah.

1570
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,160
I totally know what you mean.

1571
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,920
So like, do you guys do you experience that?

1572
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,840
What are your thoughts on that?

1573
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,360
Because I definitely feel like there's a little bit that's lost in that transition sometimes.

1574
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,560
I can't think of many examples where it's worse.

1575
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,800
After like, I mean, in a game like Devil May Cry,

1576
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,360
like obviously they tried to change things for the second one and it failed.

1577
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:28,040
They changed things back to the first one, but a little different and it worked.

1578
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,120
And like everyone considers Devil May Cry three to be the best Devil May Cry.

1579
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,800
So like, even though I think one and three are both worth playing

1580
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:40,040
because they're so different, like, I think it's, you know,

1581
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,400
three is going to be the one everybody loves.

1582
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,200
And so, of course, they're going to copy that when they make the sequel,

1583
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,480
though it's almost a shame to not keep experimenting,

1584
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:51,080
which Devil May Cry 4 does with Nero's grabbing abilities and stuff.

1585
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,120
I think Nero is like way more fun than playing as Dante to be.

1586
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,440
Yeah, the Devil May Cry is just fucking great.

1587
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:00,520
Yeah, I don't know if you've watched the gaming Brits like endless videos

1588
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,520
on Devil May Cry, but you should. You should, yeah.

1589
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:03,880
I have pretty great.

1590
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,600
It's his purpose in life.

1591
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,480
He just became a cooler person because.

1592
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,760
His main thing is he talks about Devil May.

1593
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,440
Like you can watch his whole, like you can watch the video

1594
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,960
where he gets into the franchise and then the video from a year later

1595
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,680
where he's like an expert in it.

1596
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,400
And then you watch him just continually never shut up about it

1597
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,800
over the course of the rest of his video.

1598
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,320
But to your point there, Tom, like I said before,

1599
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,640
Kingdom Hearts 2 really did the same thing that you're describing

1600
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,000
that like Devil May Cry 3 did to its series.

1601
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,560
And I always say when I'm talking about these games,

1602
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,160
Kingdom Hearts 1 and Kingdom Hearts 2 are by far the best games in that series.

1603
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,800
And obviously I like Kingdom Hearts 2 overall, but even Kingdom Hearts 2,

1604
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,840
excuse me, lost a lot of what made Kingdom Hearts 1 really good,

1605
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,880
like specifically like the platforming challenges that, you know,

1606
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,280
you get abilities to overcome.

1607
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,160
And so like there has been an abandonment of a lot of the stuff

1608
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:56,160
that made Kingdom Hearts 1 good, even though they have at no point since,

1609
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,160
you know, since after Kingdom Hearts 2,

1610
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:01,760
have they reached the level of quality that Kingdom Hearts 1 or 2 was at.

1611
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,040
So like and it does frustrate me that it seems like there's people

1612
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,960
stupidly trying to just recreate Kingdom Hearts 2 over and over again

1613
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,800
without like knowing how or really like doing the research

1614
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,400
into what made that game good.

1615
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:17,080
And like nobody's paying attention at all to like what made Kingdom Hearts 1

1616
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,520
good because we've all just moved on because there's like sequels.

1617
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:20,960
And that's super frustrating.

1618
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,760
And so I totally get the the feeling you're talking about.

1619
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,960
Another franchise that did this in Hippo.

1620
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,280
I'd be curious to know if you think this was if you think anything was lost

1621
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,720
in the transition here, Ratchet and Clank,

1622
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,760
because the first first and second Ratchet and Clank games feel pretty fucking different.

1623
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,160
The second game really refocuses as a shooter and and all the ones from then on.

1624
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:47,080
I think the way I see Ratchet and Clank 2 is an improvement

1625
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,480
on absolutely everything in Ratchet and Clank 1.

1626
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,520
I agree. Just like and it got rid of or no,

1627
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:57,160
it expanded on the things that Ratchet and Clank 1 had like bits of and bits of

1628
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,360
like the the spaceship battles.

1629
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:02,080
There's just two parts of that in Ratchet and Clank 1 and in Ratchet and Clank 2.

1630
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,000
It's now a mode. It's like a mini game.

1631
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,160
So I think that was like in like that.

1632
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:11,440
If that was the status quo for like the PS3 games, that would have been good.

1633
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:15,600
You know, if all the PS3 games were like Ratchet and Clank 2, you're right about that.

1634
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,760
I like that. But what the fuck about Jack like Jack 1 versus Jack 2?

1635
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,320
Talk about a transformation.

1636
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,560
But it's but it's Jack 3.

1637
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,320
Isn't Jack 3 also a huge transformation from Jack 2?

1638
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,040
So it's not like the reality is really is an interesting thing.

1639
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,000
Jack like when I was a little baby boy

1640
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,320
and I didn't know what video games were and I just played them.

1641
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:36,680
What a hellish existence. I had Jack 1.

1642
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:40,600
I had I had Jack 1 and then Jack 2 came out

1643
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,920
and I got Jack 2 and it was so different.

1644
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,760
But I didn't know that sequels were supposed to feel kind of the same.

1645
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,440
So I just thought it was cool and then Jack 3 came out as the same sort of thing.

1646
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,800
So I don't really I don't know.

1647
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,680
I think that the main thing was Jack 1 was a platformer through and through.

1648
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,080
Just about jumping and punching and jumping and jumping.

1649
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,760
And then Jack 2 introduced vehicles, guns,

1650
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,040
edgy like transformation sequences

1651
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,400
and Jack 3 also has those things.

1652
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,000
I want to I think I think like for the

1653
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,120
it's cool. I like it. I don't dislike it at all.

1654
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,680
I want to jump into Tom was saying this might just be for video games.

1655
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:29,320
But no, it's definitely true of like long running franchises that this happens.

1656
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,360
And it can be really fascinating.

1657
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,000
For instance, I think Dragon Ball kind of had.

1658
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,640
Oh, yeah, of course, original Dragon Ball is like a funny little adventure

1659
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,480
comedy and then like everything since then is like epic.

1660
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,080
What's funny about a huge fucking conversation with my friend about how

1661
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,480
Goku is a terrible main character because of that transition.

1662
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,920
I had a whole video about that.

1663
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,480
He did. And you know, it's funny, though, is that that transformation

1664
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,080
actually wasn't even within a sequel like in Japan.

1665
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,680
That's just Dragon Ball like all the way up just happened.

1666
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,920
Yeah, but then Dragon Ball Super.

1667
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,720
It does feel like a very stark contrast.

1668
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,040
I mean, they kept the same name in the manga, but like Dragon Ball was supposed to end.

1669
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,240
Oh, was it really? OK.

1670
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,120
They made him. It was supposed to end multiple times.

1671
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,680
Like the story behind Dragon Ball is pretty fucked.

1672
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:18,160
I only know like this very surface details.

1673
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,880
But like Goku was supposed to die and Gohan was supposed to be the main character

1674
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,080
after Cell. Hey, question. Back.

1675
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:29,480
Just the thing I remember was that the way Dragon Ball ends is very,

1676
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,360
very similar to the way Dragon Ball Z ends, which is like he just goes off

1677
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,120
and he's implied to have more adventures, but he just doesn't want to talk about.

1678
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,640
Yeah, right. And that's what Dragon Ball was going to be ending there.

1679
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,200
But then he came back and there was.

1680
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:45,520
Hey, does Dragon Ball end with Goku as an adult or is he still a kid?

1681
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,760
I he's he's like a young adult.

1682
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,240
He's like in his 20s. Yeah.

1683
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,280
Yeah, like I remember him.

1684
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,320
I thought he had his final fight with like King Piccolo.

1685
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,600
That was the thing.

1686
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,600
He had he had his final fight with King Piccolo with Piccolo's son,

1687
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,240
who we know as Piccolo. Oh, right.

1688
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:05,760
Yeah, like the great Demon King Piccolo was like the big bad guy of Dragon Ball.

1689
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,960
And he beat him and then his son came back and they fought in the martial arts

1690
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:13,880
tournament and then Chichi came and said, you promised me we'd marry.

1691
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,440
And then they went off and we didn't see the wedding in the manga.

1692
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:20,160
But that's like now Goku's going to get married and that's the end of Dragon Ball.

1693
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,280
Bye. So did he end with Piccolo's son on friendly terms?

1694
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,120
I mean, obviously we see how Dragon Ball Z.

1695
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,480
I know I get into Dragon Ball.

1696
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,520
I'm just curious.

1697
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,760
They don't end on friendly terms, they hate each other.

1698
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,840
Yeah, like it starts.

1699
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,200
They start with Raditz because they're they're not their enemies, right?

1700
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:34,800
They're right.

1701
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,520
He has to like, right, right.

1702
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:40,880
The thing was like a Goku, like the son of Piccolo,

1703
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,440
I keep thinking of him as that because that's what he is.

1704
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,680
Because he came out of an egg.

1705
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:48,400
He he came to the martial arts tournament

1706
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,560
and he tried to kill everyone and Goku eventually beat him.

1707
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,280
But then he says, you know,

1708
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,680
he got a Senzu bean is like, thanks, guys, I won.

1709
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,320
I won the tournament finally.

1710
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,040
That's that's literally canonically the first time he won the tourney.

1711
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,200
Because he's still played by the rules right until the very end,

1712
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,760
even though fucking everyone was evacuated and everything was destroyed.

1713
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,720
But then he gave a Senzu bean to Piccolo and Piccolo was like,

1714
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,360
really, and he just ran away.

1715
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:19,080
So it's like it's implied that he will be a villain forever.

1716
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,400
But he's he's like, oh, I respect you or something.

1717
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,720
That's cool. That's cool.

1718
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,440
I'm trying to think of some more examples of this.

1719
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,280
Another one that is kind of like that is Ghost in the Shell,

1720
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,960
just in that like the original manga is so much goofier

1721
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,560
than like any other adaptation of it.

1722
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,320
Like the original manga definitely has way more of a sense of humor

1723
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,920
and more like loose with its characters and designs and everything.

1724
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,080
And it's like it's just more of a pulp adventure with like really hard sci-fi.

1725
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,640
You are 100 percent right.

1726
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,000
It's just that like I in my mind,

1727
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,400
I have them so partitioned as like different,

1728
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,680
like like real alternate universes as opposed to sequels.

1729
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,680
But you're not wrong. I mean, yeah.

1730
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,680
I mean, some some of those sequels we're talking about.

1731
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:09,800
I guess all all the ones we've talked about like a rise is obviously like different

1732
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,360
and then stand alone complex like like the major herself is like totally different.

1733
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,760
I know it's a prequel and it's all fucked up.

1734
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:20,000
And yeah, but like just just the idea of how the franchise

1735
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:26,360
like if the original film had been like more accurate to the manga's tone.

1736
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:31,320
Yeah, then I feel like it was not at all like I don't know if it would have become a success.

1737
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,840
But like whether it did or not,

1738
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:35,240
that's probably how Ghost in the Shell would have been from then on.

1739
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,840
Right. Like not that the TV show is exactly like the movie or anything.

1740
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,600
Like the TV show definitely adds more levity in.

1741
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,720
But like the fact that it even is such a serious military show.

1742
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:49,520
Oh, yeah. Like like it's because that movie had set the press.

1743
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,720
Like, that's what people identify in Ghost in the Shell.

1744
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,800
In Ghost in the Shell, the major is way more informed as a character

1745
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,280
by the movie's Motoko than the manga's Motoko. No doubt, no doubt.

1746
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:02,960
The manga's Motoko is just like a goofy, like she is the best version of Motoko.

1747
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:03,800
She's always got like boyfriends and stuff.

1748
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,160
She is great. It's great.

1749
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,560
I fucking love her. I like I like them all.

1750
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,160
I like them all.

1751
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:12,480
She fucks around and cracks jokes and like it's just way way more human.

1752
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,920
Is a literal sex worker.

1753
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,960
A literal sex worker makes sex software.

1754
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,920
It's great. She's the best.

1755
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,760
Yeah. Well, shit, guys.

1756
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,960
Are we are we done? Are we done with the questions?

1757
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,920
I think we can't we can't have a podcast about sequels

1758
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,480
without taking a stab at our good friend, Mel Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain.

1759
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,680
Oh, of course. I hate you forever.

1760
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:36,680
Of course. And and and that's that's the biggest disappointment

1761
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:39,600
after Definitely Cry was Mel Gear. I hate you.

1762
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,120
Oh, you fucking fanboys.

1763
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:45,800
Why can't you just turn off your brain and enjoy this sequel like the rest of us?

1764
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,080
What the fuck? Let's get into questions.

1765
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,360
Student of Ethereum says on a scale of one to ten, which

1766
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:57,880
I pick oh, wait, I say a little academia, little academia.

1767
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,880
Got him. Got him.

1768
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,560
Yeah. Enough of that.

1769
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,040
I'm interested in this. OK.

1770
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,000
This guy just seems concerned for like concerned for us.

1771
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,800
That's why I'm getting out of this.

1772
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:14,080
OK. Me cool man asks, when was the last time you talked to your parents?

1773
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:16,480
For me, it was like today.

1774
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,000
For me, it was like four days ago.

1775
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,680
I talked to them for like a whole hour on the phone.

1776
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:25,240
I don't talk to my parents that I can go like months without talking to my parents,

1777
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,520
really, which is not great.

1778
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,680
But I have recently communicated with him over the fact that we're using

1779
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,800
too much data on our phone plan.

1780
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:40,320
So yeah, my dad, my dad has like a 45 minute commute to and from work right now.

1781
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:45,440
So like every month or so, he'll remember like, oh, why don't I just call

1782
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,080
Digi while he's on his way home?

1783
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,200
He doesn't call me Digi, but you know, right?

1784
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,640
He calls you Digi Brony, your real name.

1785
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,560
Oh, I only want to know Nate's answer to this.

1786
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,560
If you were a girl, would you use your body for money?

1787
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,760
Not necessarily prostitution, though.

1788
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,960
I would argue that it's almost impossible for a girl to not use her body for money

1789
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,800
just as she goes about life.

1790
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,040
Righter answer that I ever could have hoped for.

1791
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,480
All right, here's what we could all answer.

1792
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,840
The gobs ask, what was the spookiest thing to you when you were a kid?

1793
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,280
That could be a whole podcast, honestly.

1794
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,120
You're not wrong.

1795
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,960
Yeah, that should have been the Halloween one.

1796
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,680
Yeah, what the fuck's wrong with that?

1797
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,480
Well, this won't even be out for another week anyway.

1798
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:37,320
Spookiest thing is, I mean, like the rare occasion when I was a kid,

1799
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,760
when I saw a actual horror movie, when I was a kid,

1800
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,600
I was much more susceptible to them.

1801
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:46,160
So like I remember being young and I saw this movie starring Harrison Ford

1802
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,040
called What Lies Beneath.

1803
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:51,760
And this movie, it was sort of it was about like a wife with a cheating husband,

1804
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,920
professor guy, and like he was sort of like the murderer, bad guy,

1805
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,760
because like he had like killed a girl that he had had an affair with long ago.

1806
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,200
So he was kind of the murderer.

1807
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:03,600
And like some of the imagery from that movie stuck with me for years

1808
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,640
and really fucked me up.

1809
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,880
Like whenever there was like a darkness that I had to walk through,

1810
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,040
I would imagine like Harrison Ford was going to fucking come and kill me.

1811
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,120
You know, things of that nature, things of that nature.

1812
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:13,640
It was good.

1813
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,840
Similar for me, I mean, this was not when I was a little kid.

1814
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:21,400
I had lots of like little childhood trauma like things I'd seen that like haunted me.

1815
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,280
But like in terms of what made me afraid to go into the dark,

1816
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,200
blood the last vampire with the Corruptorans.

1817
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,000
Oh, really?

1818
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,560
Because we had kind of like a sort of a meme.

1819
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,680
But me and my brother Victor, because I saw the movie

1820
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,840
and I was like probably eleven and he would have been like ten.

1821
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,920
And we watched it with my cousin, Boyd, who was four years older.

1822
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:47,080
And like we would play this game where if it was a dark night and we were all hanging out,

1823
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,840
we would try to see how far into the darkness we were willing to walk.

1824
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:55,480
Like how far into the dark you willing to go before the Corruptorans get you, essentially.

1825
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,480
And like so like Victor would start walking into the darkness and then Boyd would go,

1826
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,280
oh, Corruptoran.

1827
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,640
We all go, oh, we run away.

1828
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:07,320
I don't think we were so young that we like legitimately thought Corruptorans

1829
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,920
were going to eat us, but we were spook.

1830
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,560
We were easily spooked kids.

1831
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,160
That's hilarious. Never dealt with horror.

1832
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,200
Well, by the way, are these all questions coming from our beloved PCP Discord channel?

1833
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,760
Yes, they are.

1834
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,600
If you are a PCP Patreon discord, yes, that that thing.

1835
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,440
Given what spooked you as a as a kid.

1836
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,560
This question is from the gobs, by the way.

1837
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,840
I that I was thinking and there was this very

1838
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,800
what is the question was from the Corruptorans and their back.

1839
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,800
They're coming for you.

1840
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,400
This one thing on Newgrounds, I saw this flash animation

1841
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,320
and it was it was it forever.

1842
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,480
Well, I'll just explain what happens.

1843
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,920
It's like a brightly lit kitchen and there's just a guy walking in.

1844
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,520
There's like stuff on the TV and it's like you can see outside.

1845
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,320
It's like dark.

1846
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,360
It's like nighttime.

1847
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,560
It's just the window is black because it's dark outside and he's just coming in.

1848
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:04,760
He's fixing some cereal or just getting going to bite to eat his little snack.

1849
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:09,600
And, you know, he's just watching TV and nothing happens for like 45 seconds.

1850
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,720
And you're just sitting there is like what what what is this?

1851
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,800
And then suddenly out of nowhere, because you know how Newgrounds flash animations,

1852
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,040
you can't like turn the volume.

1853
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:20,760
You can't pause it.

1854
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,760
You can't click on it.

1855
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,760
You can't change the volume unless it's on like you're you're turning the knob on your own speaker thing.

1856
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:33,080
So it was just an extremely loud monster smashes through the kitchen window,

1857
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,600
grabs the guy and brings him out in like like three frames.

1858
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:42,240
And from then on, every time I was in the kitchen and I saw that it was dark out,

1859
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,560
I thought that would happen to me.

1860
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,960
And I just stayed really far away from the window for like for like years.

1861
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,680
Because it was such a specific like normal setting

1862
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,920
and it was really tense and suspenseful.

1863
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,360
I don't know what I feel like the guy

1864
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,920
would expect us to say just like clowns or like werewolves.

1865
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,760
But it's just like, no, this very specific flash animation from newgrounds.com.

1866
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:04,920
Scared the shit out of me.

1867
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,400
He's dealing with it. Yeah, I know.

1868
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:10,960
I mean, I ruined Shade's life one time by showing him.

1869
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,200
There was one of those.

1870
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,920
It was just like a a flasher or whatever they're called when you put

1871
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,040
what's it called when you put like a sudden loud screamer screamer.

1872
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,640
Yeah, that's the one.

1873
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:23,920
I there was this one thing that was a it was wears Waldo.

1874
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:29,120
And like after like 10 seconds, it's a screamer and it's scared the shit out of me.

1875
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:34,600
So I, of course, show my little brother who is six at the time, this thing.

1876
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,840
Shade legitimately cried for two hours.

1877
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,360
And it haunted him for years.

1878
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:46,360
Like in the way he describes it is that like up to that point,

1879
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,400
he had not known what fear.

1880
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,280
You thought of the meaning of fear.

1881
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:56,200
Oh, my God, like he legitimately like gained the sensation of existential

1882
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:00,560
dread from that because it gave him like a perpetual fear that at any time,

1883
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,760
like the world could end or something like that.

1884
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:06,760
OK, that like everything can be normal and then it can be horrible, you know?

1885
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:10,560
And like, could he stomach like actually finding Waldo?

1886
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,480
I have no idea.

1887
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,440
But I don't know if you even remembered that it was a wear wears Waldo thing.

1888
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,600
Amazing, the screamer.

1889
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,800
But he, a few years later, he became like really afraid of the apocalypse.

1890
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,760
Like any time we would like like people would talk about the end of the world

1891
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,840
or anything like he would get really freaked out that the world was going to end.

1892
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:35,720
And yeah. Hey, I've got a question from the Twitter here that I think is

1893
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,000
wait, Thomas, not answering. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, please.

1894
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:42,360
Yeah, I remember when I was a little kid, I watched a lot of sci-fi channel

1895
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:45,920
and I watched all the alien abduction things and all the like crazy fucking

1896
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:51,640
conspiracy theories about like aliens living among us or like Area 51 and shit.

1897
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,480
So I was always terrified of that.

1898
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:57,560
I thought I didn't get abducted by aliens and like get like some like fucking thing

1899
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:01,600
because I already have a really weird phobia of like like bodies and organs and shit.

1900
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,080
So like the fact that like I get abducted, like opened up and like they implant

1901
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:08,440
something in the face of my skull. Yeah, that was fucking terrifying to me.

1902
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,760
So even to this day, whenever I watch that alien shit, I'm totally fucking into it.

1903
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,400
But at the same time, just like, oh, God, the government's watching me.

1904
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:20,640
There's a spaceship outside my house. Yeah, that's aliens.

1905
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:23,040
Yes, that's a good thing to be afraid of.

1906
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:27,840
OK, here we go. Also, Simpsons Treehouse of Horror really grossed me out.

1907
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,280
And I hate gore because of that. Anyone specifically, they do love gore

1908
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,520
on their Treehouse of Horror. They really do. They really do.

1909
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,160
And it's specifically like the sound design of the gore.

1910
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,560
Just really like I hate horror movies because of the Simpsons.

1911
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:42,200
Fascinating.

1912
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,360
Well, OK, here's a question from at Lord Saiba.

1913
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,800
By the way, this is on the Twitter.

1914
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,800
Hashtag use ask PCP, send the questions out.

1915
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:53,160
OK, so it's if you were sent back to high school current age,

1916
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,920
would you be a Chad or a Virgin?

1917
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:57,480
How will your experience go?

1918
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:00,080
Think realistically.

1919
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,920
I'd be currently absolute, absolutely a Chad.

1920
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:07,320
Like, well, OK, am I actually 26 in high school because I don't think

1921
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,920
anyone's going to want to fuck the weird 26 year old?

1922
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,920
Let's assume that it's your current like mentality put in your body.

1923
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:19,800
OK, yeah, because as as a woke adult, you understand that

1924
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:23,200
like when I was in high school, the reason I couldn't communicate with anybody

1925
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,680
or get laid is that I just didn't know where anybody was coming from.

1926
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,760
Like, I didn't understand what they were thinking or what anybody was doing

1927
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,880
or like what like how to take control of a situation or anything like that.

1928
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:37,760
Now, I feel like with high school girls, you could just walk up to them

1929
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,520
and be like, hey, suck my cock.

1930
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:46,120
And they'd be like, oh, OK, you know, like it's a little working up to it.

1931
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:47,200
I don't know about that.

1932
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,960
You may have been watching too many anime.

1933
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,720
Just the way the way I've learned about how like people how people think,

1934
01:37:54,720 --> 01:38:00,160
especially young girls, like like 14 year old girls are literally

1935
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,360
all trying to get laid when they enter high school.

1936
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:06,720
Like they go in. Well, OK, all right, they go into high school.

1937
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,160
Like if I don't get laid, I won't be cool.

1938
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,960
You know, like, OK, OK, who's did I have to be cool?

1939
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:19,000
You know, yeah, but but like as a guy who has no social

1940
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,280
like you are socially anxious, you're not just going to ask some girl

1941
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:25,840
to have sex with you, whereas a girl can absolutely do that

1942
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,600
and a guy is going to have sex with them. Well, of course, of course.

1943
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:33,760
So so if I was if I was that guy, you know, like now I just have to have

1944
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:37,520
the confidence to realize that the girls also want to fuck me, you know,

1945
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,840
like I think that's what I didn't understand in high school.

1946
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,560
Like I thought I want to fuck them.

1947
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,160
They don't want to fuck me.

1948
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,840
And now I realize no, they do.

1949
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,240
There are there.

1950
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,840
Sorry, there are so many.

1951
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,520
There are so many like looking back on it, like obvious girls

1952
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,880
who were interested in me and I never did anything about it.

1953
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:57,560
Like because I just didn't I didn't understand that that's what was going on.

1954
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:01,480
And now I do. And I'm like, oh, you motherfucker, you could have had it all.

1955
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,960
There are only two things that a man needs to get laid.

1956
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,000
And this is true at any age.

1957
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,880
One is just sometimes you can just use one of the two.

1958
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,600
One is just like the confidence to just go up and, you know,

1959
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:17,240
just just put your balls on the table and say, here they are, sweetheart.

1960
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,480
Pick them up.

1961
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,960
So there's that, as Bill Burwood put it.

1962
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:24,640
And then the other thing is something to back it up as in like, let's say you're

1963
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:29,320
like, yeah, like if you've got, you know, you're you're you're like the

1964
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:32,080
the fucking marching band can mean a lot of different things.

1965
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:32,920
Well, that's true.

1966
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:34,520
That kind of ties into a bunch of this stuff.

1967
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:38,800
Like, you know, like really disgusting, fat slobs can get late.

1968
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:43,680
Harry Weinstein, I was the kind of the way I looked in high school is one

1969
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:46,840
of those like, change the outfit and you've got a good looking guy.

1970
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,160
Sure. Sure. But it wasn't.

1971
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:53,560
But instead, it was a guy with uncombed hair that goes down to his

1972
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:59,200
knees and like shit facial hair and like wearing three different outfits

1973
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:02,800
that don't like parts of three different so much of this is incredibly simple.

1974
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:06,640
Like, yeah, literally get decent clothes, get a haircut and just like, don't be

1975
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:12,400
gross. If I had cut my hair, shaved my beard, dressed in layers and spoke to a woman.

1976
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,720
I would have gotten late in high school, but I didn't do any of that.

1977
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,440
I didn't know better.

1978
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,560
It's not that complicated.

1979
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,720
But but social pressures are real.

1980
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,200
I don't want to just say that I would immediately be a Chad.

1981
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:23,680
Like there's unique pressures in in high school and how to make this work.

1982
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,080
Your current mindset, though.

1983
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:29,760
I mean, I have no doubt you like literally just transplant your brain

1984
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,000
into the brain of a high schooler.

1985
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,800
Like, I'm sure you can get.

1986
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,080
I think anybody could.

1987
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:39,000
Yeah, I really don't have much 20 could easily get late in high school.

1988
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,640
It's just a matter of keeping your focus, you know, being willing to play

1989
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:45,360
the long game when necessary and then just be be cool, be cool.

1990
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:50,360
I mean, I'm I'm sure that if I had my brain and I went back,

1991
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:55,640
I could have like actually made friends, which is like the first step.

1992
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:57,480
I think you're right, because I didn't have really.

1993
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:00,560
I didn't really have like a group of friends that were my group.

1994
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,840
I just hung out with other people's groups of friends and just stood around them.

1995
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:08,520
So like and it was always because, oh, I'm I'm worried that they won't like me.

1996
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,840
So I won't do anything.

1997
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:15,720
But obviously now I'm much more, you know, prone to just doing things and taking risks.

1998
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,880
So I would be definitely able to make friends and be maybe the most popular guy

1999
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:22,920
because I was like I even back then I was kind of good at guitar.

2000
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,880
If I had capitalized on that, I could have been the guitar dude.

2001
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:28,760
We had some guitar dudes who were very well respected in my grade.

2002
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,640
Sam and Matt.

2003
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:35,920
So Davoo points out, also, don't be in an exclusively religious social environment.

2004
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:36,880
That usually helps you.

2005
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:37,640
You're not wrong.

2006
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,520
But but if you can cut under that, if you can be like the rebel,

2007
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:43,520
like, oh, baby, I'm going to fuck you while God watches, you know?

2008
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,680
I mean, you can maybe make that work.

2009
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:48,960
Jesus Christ, it's like me.

2010
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,440
I know Davoo, it's a big negative song.

2011
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,520
I feel like I could probably have the social skills of this point

2012
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,280
to be a Chad in that situation.

2013
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,640
But I probably choose choose not to because if if we're going back

2014
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:01,920
to our high schools, because, A, every one of my high school,

2015
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,320
I wouldn't want to fuck anyways, because they're all horrible people.

2016
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,080
B, I would have to lose all my weight again, and that would take a long time.

2017
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,760
And you're in you're not.

2018
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,960
It's not literally you have to lose the weight anyway.

2019
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,600
It's your brain in your high school, self's body.

2020
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:15,600
Let's put it that way.

2021
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,560
Sure, sure.

2022
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,360
I mean, I don't know if you're like a real.

2023
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:18,640
All right.

2024
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,680
Did you mean that you were fat in high school and you've lost weight since then?

2025
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:25,520
Oh, yeah, I'm fat in high school, significantly fatter than I am right now.

2026
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,840
So I have to work on that.

2027
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,160
But then also, I'd probably to be too busy trying to invest in Google.

2028
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:33,920
And then I could be fucking rich.

2029
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,680
How the fuck you get invested age 16?

2030
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:38,680
I could find a way.

2031
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,760
I have I have a 28 year old brain.

2032
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:42,280
So I could figure something out.

2033
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:46,080
You put you put your piggy bank in an empty type.

2034
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:49,080
I'll be like, dad, by Google, by Google.

2035
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,440
I know it's a weird word, but trust me, do it.

2036
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:52,880
Yeah.

2037
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:55,120
Mail to Steve Jobs.

2038
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,120
Wait, wrong guy.

2039
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:57,440
OK, whatever.

2040
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:57,880
All right.

2041
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,880
Well, that's a good bunch of questions.

2042
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,480
I think everybody I think we're good to wrap this one up to top that one.

2043
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,680
So we might as well.

2044
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:07,840
It's true. It's true.

2045
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:13,960
If we're currently I am a drunk and that's because the next episode we're

2046
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:16,240
going to do is a bonus episode, right?

2047
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,720
We're recording it immediately after this.

2048
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,760
I think it'll actually come out before this episode, though.

2049
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,520
It will. That's right.

2050
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:24,720
So if you want to hear the aftermath of me drinking throughout this entire

2051
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:30,040
PCP and then getting shitfaced right afterwards, go become a patron for five

2052
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:34,280
dollars, you get the bonus episodes that we record once a month that are always

2053
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,080
goofy, hilarious, weird shit.

2054
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,120
The next one's alcohol or the one that's already out.

2055
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:41,920
The newest one is alcohol.

2056
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,640
We're going to be talking about alcohol and getting shit.

2057
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,920
And there'll be eight of them by the time you hear this out.

2058
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,640
Eight episodes.

2059
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:48,520
Yes, you can listen to all eight.

2060
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:52,960
So you can literally pledge five dollars, watch all eight and

2061
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,880
the value gets better every month.

2062
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,760
Don't give them ideas.

2063
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,240
You've mongoloid.

2064
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:00,160
They won't because they watch all eight and they realize that they want.

2065
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:01,960
They want to be able to access the future ones.

2066
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,440
Exactly. Exactly.

2067
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,080
That's how they know.

2068
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:04,800
And no one's got that.

2069
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,960
No one's got the kind of like weird patience that they're going to like

2070
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:13,760
pledge once every six months or so and like get someone to do it despite us now.

2071
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:14,560
We're counting.

2072
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,320
Don't forget, we're also on iTunes and Google Play music.

2073
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:21,480
So if you want to listen on your mobile device, sans YouTube.

2074
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:26,400
The only the only people who the only people who would do that like like pledge

2075
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:30,680
once every six months to get the episodes are the people who would not have pledged

2076
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,400
until they just found out they could do that, you know.

2077
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,400
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

2078
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:37,400
Like there's some people who we might get because they just found out

2079
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,640
that there's like a scheme they can do and now they'll actually pledge.

2080
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,400
So we're still getting people we wouldn't have.

2081
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,680
It's true. It's a net gain for us either way.

2082
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,200
And of course, we've got a little bit of merch.

2083
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,280
If you go to our red bubble page or our print all over me page,

2084
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,200
there's links in the description.

2085
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,960
Click on those and buy some dank PCP mugs and shit.

2086
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:53,800
They're dope.

2087
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:57,320
You know, we need to we need to run like our ads in the middle of the episode.

2088
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:57,880
You're not wrong.

2089
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:01,320
That's what I've been watching other big podcasts and they do that.

2090
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,360
They do it like right in the middle.

2091
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,200
We should do it like before the Q&A or something.

2092
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,880
That'd be a pretty logical time on the hour.

2093
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,200
It's usually a good place to.

2094
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,160
Yeah, OK.

2095
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,560
Also, is there anything else?

2096
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:14,160
Twitter, we already talked to at TP Crasidators.

2097
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:17,000
Subscribe to our Twitter and pledged to the fucking Patreon.

2098
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,360
Subscribe to this channel for new shit because there's a lot of stuff

2099
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,520
that doesn't even get on the Patreon.

2100
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,800
Just videos uploaded here.

2101
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:26,200
Like the current intense spat going on between Tom Oliver and Ben Sane

2102
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:28,440
over why D&D is good or shit.

2103
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:32,920
Who knows how that side will say Ben Ben's argument did not impress me.

2104
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:35,840
I respect his opinion, but he literally just said everything.

2105
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,320
I dismissed in my the first 10 minutes of my video.

2106
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,960
Oh shit, Ben, you hear that?

2107
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:42,200
You've been called it as a fucking hack fraud.

2108
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,800
You're an embarrassment.

2109
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:44,840
All right, everybody, that's it.

2110
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,320
Thanks for listening and we'll be back next week or sooner.

2111
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:48,640
No, wait, bonus episode.

2112
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:50,080
Yeah, OK, give us money.

2113
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,880
Thank you, everybody.

2114
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,000
All right, we're leaving.

2115
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,320
Goodbye.
