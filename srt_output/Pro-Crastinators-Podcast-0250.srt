00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm supposed to be working right now, I'm supposed to be working right now, but I'm not working, I'm doing nothing, I didn't got the surgery, I tell my son, I have an asshole, I am so stupid, I gotta get one.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,680
Doomer, we have you on YouTube for my music.

3
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:46,560
Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, the only podcast on the internet.

4
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:59,840
This week it's me, it's Ben Saint, it's Gibbontake, it's Tom Oliver, and there's, I was

5
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,400
gonna say Digi, but I guess it's not, what's up?

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,320
There's no such thing as a Digi anymore, this Digi character has been put to rest.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm just gonna, this podcast I will be known as Trixie, 21st century Trixie old girl.

8
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,080
That was one of my favorite ponies, one of my favorite ponies too!

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:31,320
I guess it kind of sounds like Digi, it's got the same vowel arrangement, it's okay.

10
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,320
That was also part of why I figured that would work for this show, I was like, I'm not gonna

11
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,880
convince you all to stop using the double I sound when referring to me, but Digi, Trixie,

12
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
it's not that hard.

13
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,320
Plus it's a character you all know already, so you can just visualize Trixie in your mind.

14
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,000
It's easier to remember than Gray, I think, were you going by Gray for a little bit?

15
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,240
I was Gray for a bit, but that was always kind of meant to be a placeholder name, it

16
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,040
was like until I figure out what name I want, and then for a multitude of reasons I landed

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,720
on Beatrice, one of them being that one of its shortened versions is Trixie, so, yeah.

18
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Yeah, this is not an internet handle, this is a real name changer.

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Yes.

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Yes.

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Yeah, okay.

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,560
Trixie is one of my now IRL nicknames also, which is nice, because a lot of this was spurred

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:35,440
because the other day I was doing Canton, and Victor kept calling me Digi, and I was

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,680
like, you're not allowed to call me Digi, and he was like, wait a minute, yeah.

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,200
Why does, oh, right.

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,840
Victor's never called me Digi, not even on the internet.

27
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,240
I was gonna say, wait a minute, Victor always called you Conrad at Radcon.

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Right, exactly.

29
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,360
Okay, I get it.

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,120
So in my mind, I was like, well, you have to call me by my real name, that's how this

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
works.

32
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,320
So he wasn't calling you Gray, so he just didn't know what to call you, I guess.

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,760
I mean, I haven't used the name Gray for a while.

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,840
In my personal life, most of the people around I told them Beatrice is my name now, call

35
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,000
me B, Trixie, these are the ones that make sense, you know.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,440
My friends have been calling me B, or Goldie, short for Golden Witch, because I'm also still

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,360
using the Golden Witch name.

38
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,040
That's how you change your Twitter handle.

39
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,200
But just Victor calling me Digi, I was like, well, you have to use my real name, goddammit.

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,840
He was like, well, Digi's been around longer, and I was like, well, that's a problem.

41
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,840
If you're still thinking about, if you still think of that name because it's been around

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,520
longer and not just because it's a brand, then I have to get rid of it, because I'm

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
not Digi.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,720
Digi is a brand name, you know.

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,440
I've killed the brand.

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
This is so fucked.

47
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,760
This is so fucked.

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,000
I think at some point, Munchie thought it expected me to start calling him Anthony, and I can't

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
do it.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't like real names.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
I like brands.

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,680
Well, you can pretend that Trixie is a brand name, it's just a My Little Pony character.

53
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,040
We're on a My Little Pony podcast.

54
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,200
I think we're moving towards a glorious future where brand names and real names collide and

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,600
you can change your real name as easy as you can change your brand name.

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,440
I always like calling people by their internet handle names, because that's the name someone

57
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
chose for themselves.

58
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
I mean, if you want to go-

59
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,920
I always thought that was cool.

60
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,400
If you want to go with Goldie, that's the most internet version of a name that I've-

61
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,960
I'm fine with Trixie.

62
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm just saying that I cannot separate branding from reality.

63
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
They are one and the same to me.

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,440
I like that you can collect a bunch of names.

65
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,560
I have so many names.

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,440
I also associate my characters as names I could have by one or two.

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,040
It's like a demon.

68
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
It's like a demon.

69
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,880
You have all kinds of different names, but you have your true name that can banish you,

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,880
but you don't tell anyone that one, because then they can bind you to their will.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,360
Or any fantasy character, like Khaleesi, when she gets up to 12 names by the end of Game

72
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
of Thrones.

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Oh yeah.

74
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
The Golden Witch.

75
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
I just want to have that joke.

76
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,940
I want that list of titles.

77
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
I want people to-

78
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
The first of the-

79
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,940
Yeah.

80
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
I want people to be giving it to me, though.

81
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,440
I don't want to just be making up my own.

82
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Stormborn, first of the Great Breaker of Tams, 100,000 Subscribers, um...

83
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,760
Wait, you'll weight plus 100K on you.

84
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Every-

85
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
It's like every time-

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,000
And she gets a new name every time she goes from like, from like, from, from, from Mere

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
to-

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,320
The name will be official when you hit a million, and it's on the plaque.

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,040
That's how you know you're actually-

90
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,160
That's when you know you're really famous.

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,320
You get a new one for every platform.

92
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,240
The way I'm planning on selling this name change, uh, is by privatizing all of the content

93
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,240
on the Digi and Digi collective channels.

94
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Bam!

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Daaamn!

96
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm gonna release-

97
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Privateize.

98
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,720
Yeah, I'm gonna make a video called, you have three weeks, I have a video called, you have

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,240
three weeks to archive all of my content, and then it's just gonna be gone.

100
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Whoa!

101
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,920
That's a pretty big one.

102
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Yeah.

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
Well, that's some crazy shit.

104
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,160
Good, good thing, good thing, uh, good thing there's a list of all that that you may-

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,640
Well, I already know that some people who have like, I already know for a fact that it's

106
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,920
all archived up to at least last year, from last time my channel got taken down, so.

107
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,120
There will be people who have saved it all, probably will re-upload it.

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,000
I just don't want to be the one hosting it, basically.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,920
But I'm gonna go back and like, recreate a bunch of the good stuff, you know.

110
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Wait.

111
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,760
The HD remaster, the HD remasters coming.

112
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,880
I don't understand what you mean by that.

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,360
Project Wholesomeness, right?

114
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,920
No, do that again.

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,360
More like, more like if there's videos for that word.

116
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, like, like, Modal Soul Productions, like, uh, Action Adventure RPG, you're gonna like,

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
remaster-

118
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,960
You have to remaster Madame.

119
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,360
It's the best video you ever made.

120
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,160
How come you don't make Action Adventure RPG anymore?

121
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,220
This is what I followed for, and it's been like 12 years!

122
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,040
Unsubscribe it!

123
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,360
Unironically, I feel that way about myself.

124
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,320
There's a person inside me who feels exactly that way.

125
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,520
How dare you fucking abandon Adventure Action RPG?

126
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,860
All I ever wanted to do in life is play Action RPG's, so, like, shifting gears away from

127
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,180
It was definitely a huge mistake.

128
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,860
I did not want to spend all of my life, you know, analyzing anime.

129
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
So.

130
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Agreed.

131
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,860
Agreed.

132
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Sad.

133
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,860
Lol.

134
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,860
I said digi.

135
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,860
You know what I mean.

136
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Yeah.

137
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Yeah.

138
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Yeah.

139
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
I didn't even know this.

140
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
I did.

141
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
Me either.

142
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
It's a weird process for all of us.

143
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
Yeah.

144
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
To get used to.

145
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,860
Yeah.

146
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
It's a gay world.

147
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
Yeah.

148
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,860
That is true.

149
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,860
Tom, you were like musing on Twitter about changing your name from Tom Oliver.

150
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,860
That's right.

151
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,860
I was thinking about that for a good while now.

152
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
That's so fucked up.

153
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
Yeah, I know.

154
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,860
I don't know if I'm going to do it.

155
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
It's so fucked up.

156
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
I don't know what I would even change it.

157
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,860
Do it.

158
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,860
Do it.

159
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,860
Do it.

160
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,860
Do it.

161
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
Let's all do it at once.

162
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Let's all do it at once.

163
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
You're all doing this to me.

164
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,860
I'll just abuse that you're all doing this to me.

165
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Well, okay.

166
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Ben, you're just jealous because you picked the perfect name from the start and have nowhere

167
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,860
to go.

168
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
Yeah, that's true.

169
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,860
You will never top Ben St. It's fucking incredible.

170
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,860
I am jealous of my own perfection.

171
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
It's true.

172
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
Thank you.

173
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,860
Oh, this is so nice.

174
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,860
Oh, well shit.

175
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,860
You flattered my name so now I can't complain anymore.

176
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,860
It rolls off the tongue really well.

177
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
It's good.

178
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
I know.

179
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
I don't know.

180
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
I don't know.

181
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,860
Maybe Tom should use the name Ben St. I think that would be a pretty good one.

182
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,860
I'm a little jealous of like, I was watching a, oh fuck, I was watching a video by The

183
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
Right Opinion.

184
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,860
It was about the Nikocado Avocado guy who I'd never heard of, but I was watching this

185
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,860
video just to have something to listen to, explaining like his drama or whatever.

186
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,860
And like the story of his drama within the mukbang community is like, it's like, he keeps

187
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
referring.

188
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,860
It's like every time he makes a video explaining like, explaining the latest tea or whatever,

189
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,860
his story is like, oh, you know, I have to publicly call out what, you know, and like

190
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:51,860
everyone has the stupidest names like everyone's called, I don't know, like, like, like, I

191
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,860
don't know, a fit, fit raccoon, fit raccoon buster, you know, 12, 18 or whatever.

192
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
I'm writing that one down.

193
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
That's a new candidate.

194
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,860
I'm referring to each other with deadly seriousness, like real people, but with these like, these

195
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,860
outlandish screen names.

196
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,860
And I'm like, my screen name is just a, is a regular human name.

197
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,860
I'm like, mmm, some, it's a little unfortunate that I'm not like, I don't know.

198
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,860
I have a good excuse for you, Ben, because.

199
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
Yeah.

200
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,860
Patreon.com slash Ben St. was a classic meme that's, that's for the ages.

201
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,860
It's rolls off the tongue, but subscribe star.com slash Ben St. doesn't roll off the

202
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,860
tongue the same way.

203
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,860
So if you ever need to open a subscribe star.

204
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,860
You can come up with a new name just for the purpose of a better and a second meme.

205
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,860
I don't know what I'd need to open a subscribe star for.

206
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,860
I mean, it's just Patreon again, right?

207
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,860
Pretty much.

208
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,860
But like, yeah.

209
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,860
I have some people who are like, I refuse to use Patreon.

210
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,860
Right.

211
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
Make a subscribe star.

212
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,860
And I'm like, okay, but I hate subscribe star.

213
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,860
It's really bad when you use it as a secondary thing and you're small because it's like,

214
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,860
hey, because I only have like three people who are just like, I refuse to use Patreon.

215
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
So I'm like, okay, I made a subscribe star.

216
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,860
And the subscribers are like, hey, we won't let you take any of the money until you have

217
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
at least five people.

218
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,860
And so I just had like, I'd like, yeah, I had like $400 just sitting there for like,

219
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,860
wait, that is a number of people.

220
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,860
That's really weird.

221
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,860
You need at least five subs before they'll take your month.

222
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,860
They'll let you take the money out.

223
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,860
What the hell?

224
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Take the money from those less than five people.

225
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,860
It's really dumb.

226
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,860
So yeah, for like a year, I just couldn't take the money out until one of the people on

227
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,860
there was like, I'm just going to make two more accounts, give you a dollar, let you

228
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,860
withdraw it and then I'll move back over to Patreon.

229
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm just like, okay.

230
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,860
At some point I would have just been like, like, just go to your Discord and just be

231
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,860
like, hey, somebody please make a subscribe.

232
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,860
I didn't realize for a while because like, not only does it do that, it won't automatically

233
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,860
charge the people on there.

234
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,860
If you have under five, so every month I'd be like, hey, people on subscribe star.

235
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,860
Just a reminder, it's that time of the month because it won't auto do it.

236
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,860
It says it's to prevent fraud.

237
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,860
I'm like, what are you fucking talking about?

238
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,860
It's so weird.

239
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
Yeah.

240
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,860
So unless you end mass, tell people to go there.

241
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,860
Just just laundering my money through subscribe star.

242
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Right.

243
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Subscribe star sucks if you're tiny.

244
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
That's unfortunate.

245
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,860
But onlyfans.com slash Ben St still sounds good.

246
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,860
Ooh, that's the power of right there.

247
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
That's the end goal.

248
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,860
That's the inevitable end goal and we all know it.

249
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,860
Wait, have I talked about only fans on here at all and how it's like the best?

250
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,860
I don't think so.

251
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
No.

252
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:33,860
Because what's great about only fans is you can just upload video to only fans of any

253
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,860
size and they don't have content ID.

254
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,860
So the negative side is they take 20% instead of 10%.

255
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,860
But other than that, they host your content and the way that the feed is on only fans

256
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,860
is just a Tumblr feed.

257
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,860
It looks exactly like Tumblr and it's like you can post images or videos or text.

258
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,860
You have those six options like Tumblr had.

259
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:06,160
It's just fascinating that it's a good social media site in a way that Patreon completely

260
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:13,060
failed at trying to be and also a great payment processing site because there's no content

261
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,860
ID, no content restrictions at all.

262
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,660
It's mostly for pornography and you can upload video to it.

263
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,260
There must be because they take such a large cut because I didn't like using only fans

264
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,260
for that one time.

265
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,660
I was making like punk eludes and that was funny.

266
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:39,460
But they take quite a lot and for doing drawings, I'd rather not spend so much time for such

267
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,760
a cut of my pay.

268
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,760
I probably wouldn't think it was worth it if not for the video uploading ability.

269
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,560
It sounds like if you can upload the stuff elsewhere, then it's probably better to do

270
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
that.

271
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,760
But for whatever reason, you can't just host it on YouTube or whatever and subscribe.

272
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,260
Sorry, it's a good alternative.

273
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,600
Only fans is still a better deal than a YouTube subscription.

274
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,160
It's also just a great way to release bonus content because on Patreon, you still have

275
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,440
to upload your bonus videos to some other site and then have an unlisted YouTube video

276
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
or something.

277
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
That's true.

278
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
That's true.

279
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
That's annoying.

280
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
On only fans, you literally just upload bonus content.

281
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,120
Only the only fan subscribers can ever see it.

282
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,240
I think the goal for 2021 should be to reclaim only fans, take it away from the ethos and

283
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
make it for everyone.

284
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,320
Yeah, I completely agree and that's what they want.

285
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,760
There's nothing on the only fans website that in any way implicates its meant for ethos

286
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,840
or sex work.

287
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,320
It's just a payment site just like Patreon.

288
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,760
It just happened to originally be run with ethos.

289
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,760
The savior we wanted this whole time has been right there.

290
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,840
I will say it does have the one thing that it has that kind of facilitates parasociality

291
00:14:52,840 --> 00:15:00,960
because it has like a built-in odd DM system, but people can also just give you straight

292
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,520
tips and donations like one-time tips and they will.

293
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,520
People who have already subscribed to you will just tip you money on individual posts.

294
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
It's pretty cool.

295
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
It's a great infrastructure.

296
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm just saying.

297
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
That's pretty fascinating.

298
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
I had no idea.

299
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
I had no idea it was that well-built.

300
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:24,680
I don't know what I would put on it because I don't make any new.

301
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,120
Also Tom from MySpace told me to use it three years ago and I didn't understand what he

302
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,640
was trying to tell me to do.

303
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Damn.

304
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Like personally?

305
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Yes.

306
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Tom Anderson.

307
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,200
Remember when I talked about being DM'd by Tom from MySpace?

308
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,600
He was telling me that OnlyFans was like the most interesting alternative to Patreon,

309
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,800
but he was like, oh, it's mostly for nudes or eat.

310
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,120
I thought he was telling me that he was using it mostly for nudes, so I was very confused

311
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,680
why he was telling me this.

312
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,200
Why was Tom from Facebook DMing you?

313
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,240
Because of my videos about Patreon being not great.

314
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,440
I had made some videos about how I thought like he was like, oh, if you looked into the

315
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,920
alternatives, though, and I don't know if he has some kind of stake in OnlyFans or if

316
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,320
he was just investigating it at the time, but that was his suggestion to me.

317
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,920
That's what he's been working on this whole time since to follow MySpace.

318
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,400
He's like, I can just capture that ethod audience.

319
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,560
That and his big-ass Instagram.

320
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Right.

321
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
But yeah.

322
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
How old is he now?

323
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,320
He must be old now.

324
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,000
He's in his 40s, I think.

325
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Too old.

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah.

327
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Too old.

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,640
Come back to me again when he's 60, and he's a cool old guy right now.

329
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,200
He's just in that middle space where like, I don't care.

330
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Yeah.

331
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I agree.

332
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Okay.

333
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,880
Well, that's good.

334
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:55,520
I was having a productive week, but then I started a world-ending Noida run, the ultimate

335
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,840
Noida run.

336
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,880
I am a god gamer of Noida.

337
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,040
Noida stands for...

338
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,360
It's finished for which.

339
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:15,580
You play as a hooded weirdo, and you do alchemy, and you create wands, and I have the best

340
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,760
wand now.

341
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
I do...

342
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Okay.

343
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,560
When you're just playing the game, when you're an idiot, when you're one of your

344
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,360
rube, like I used to be, the game is like a progression from level to level, trying

345
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,040
to beat the final boss.

346
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:37,400
When you ascend to the next level, when you become a god gamer, Noida becomes a resource

347
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:47,280
management exploration game wherein you are collecting a lot of spells and creating a

348
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
layer somewhere.

349
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,120
I open steam, and it just shoves Noida directly in my face.

350
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
So there you go.

351
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Holy fucking...

352
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Didn't even have a new game?

353
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,200
There was just a strange coincidence.

354
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
It's just on sale, I think, right now.

355
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Yeah.

356
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
It's 25% off.

357
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,560
Well, people should buy it.

358
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,800
I have not gone to the moon yet, but I went to hell yesterday.

359
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,880
I finally got to hell.

360
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,720
That was pretty difficult, but I managed it.

361
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,640
Had to use lava to blood to turn this lava sea underneath the final boss into blood and

362
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,560
dig down for a while to get to the boss.

363
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Kind of like Terraria with better graphics, a really cool part of cool effects.

364
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,160
I went to a parallel world that was really hard.

365
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,380
I had to use sand, I had to use ground to sand to change the rock walls on the side

366
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,080
of the world to sand, and then I had to dig through them and create pockets of ambrosia

367
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,760
and use a teleport bolt to teleport from puddle to puddle of ambrosia so that the cursed rock

368
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,400
in between worlds wouldn't kill me, but I did it.

369
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,680
I've killed some more bosses, killed a bunch of bosses I've never even seen before.

370
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,200
I don't know.

371
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,640
I just want to gush about Noida, but I know most people haven't played it.

372
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,320
I really like the aesthetic of its title, its text.

373
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,040
Yeah, pixel art with the dithering.

374
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
It's good.

375
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,000
I have talked about Noida before, so I won't go on at length, but I will say that the dithering

376
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,920
is that way because the game is based on falling sand game-style particle physics.

377
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,480
I remember seeing previews for this game, now that I'm looking at it, and the aesthetics

378
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,480
of it and the monster design and the names of everything are based on Finnish mythology,

379
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,680
and it has an alchemy theme to it, which is pretty...

380
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,800
Okay, this is funny, this is fun.

381
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,280
Because I needed ambrosia to cross between worlds, because the parallel worlds are separated

382
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,360
by a huge rock wall, the center of which is cursed rock, and to get through it I was using

383
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,680
a spell called ground to sand, and firing a projectile and the projectile's path would

384
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,000
turn the ground to sand, then I had to dig through the sand, but the cursed rock would

385
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,800
hurt me, so I had to make dig holes and put ambrosia in it, so I had to get lots of ambrosia

386
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,680
in order to put pure ambrosia in these holes, so I went to the fungal caverns and I had to

387
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,120
dig a hole and I had to find... I didn't have any ambrosia, so I had to go and find puddles

388
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,200
of spilled ambrosia from potions that I had broken throughout the rest of the game, go

389
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,720
down there with my own bottle, scoop up as much as I could, go back to this hole that

390
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,720
I dug, throw in as much ambrosia as I could but along with all this other crap, and I

391
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,280
had to find materials that were denser than ambrosia, or lighter than ambrosia, to throw

392
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,080
in with it so that the ambrosia would sink to the bottom and the lighter fluids would

393
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,040
float to the top and then the lighter fluids would leak off the top, so I would be left

394
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,960
with pure ambrosia that I could then scoop up into a bottle and take to the wall between

395
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,720
worlds and put in these holes for me to traverse between them, and it was so cool and satisfying.

396
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,640
I was like, I figured out how to do that all by myself.

397
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,240
I feel like a real alchemist, doing chemistry.

398
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Wow.

399
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Brilliant.

400
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Wow.

401
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Okay.

402
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,240
I can't visualize it, so I'm not impressed.

403
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
No.

404
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
In fact, you suck.

405
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Okay.

406
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Yeah.

407
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Okay.

408
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
I'm sorry.

409
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
I apologize for doing all that.

410
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,120
Well, everyone just needs to play Noida so they can understand what I'm so excited

411
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,400
about here.

412
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,480
If you play Noida for like 100 hours like I have and then you're like, okay, I will

413
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,360
undertake the task of traversing to a parallel world, then you will come back and listen

414
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,520
to this podcast and you will appreciate, wow, the process Ben is describing sure is tedious,

415
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,600
but I can see how it would work and I wonder if I could do it myself and then you'll try

416
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,840
it and you'll die.

417
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,960
You'll die like I almost did because you'll fuck up going from puddle of ambrosia to puddle

418
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,280
of ambrosia and the curse will activate and you'll start to bleed slime because you took

419
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,120
the slime to blood perk and then all your slime will explode out of you and it'll get

420
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,280
all in your ambrosia puddles and then you can't touch the, and then you've got to use

421
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
your teleport bolt.

422
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Oh God.

423
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,520
We've got to get back to the world before I die.

424
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,800
The game does sound pretty cool and is on sale for $15, but for only $9 I could get

425
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,400
the Bayonetta and Vanquish combo.

426
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,760
I don't even know what that, I don't even know what Vanquish is.

427
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,600
Vanquish is pretty fun.

428
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,200
Yeah, Bayonetta and Vanquish are both on the computer now after years of people wanting

429
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
it.

430
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Wow, the personal computer.

431
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Everything's coming out to fucking PC.

432
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,520
They just announced all of fucking Kingdom Hearts, which I don't care.

433
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,240
All I want is for any commenters, if you've played Noida and you appreciate, if you appreciate

434
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,840
all the, how tedious and difficult what I just described is, give me a, I don't know,

435
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,400
just say, then just say, just give me a gold star and chat in the comments please.

436
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,160
Thank you and goodbye.

437
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,920
Shout out to Daniel Desalt or at Lasership84 on Twitter who did the cover art of the Vanquish

438
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,600
and Bayonetta PC release for the US and it also is designing me a VTuber.

439
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,080
Oh my God.

440
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,680
Wait, so you're getting rid of old content and you're going to be a VTuber now?

441
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,920
I'm not going to exclusively be a VTuber.

442
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Well, okay.

443
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
I will have a VTuber.

444
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
So you're going to, what are you going to do?

445
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,200
You're going to play your games?

446
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:31,480
I, you know, I just kind of figured having a VTuber would just be good for every conceivable

447
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
reason.

448
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
It is pretty cool.

449
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,560
I think VTuber, VTuber Trixie is going to be a great time to revive.

450
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,360
And powerful time.

451
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,240
A great and powerful time to revive Gamecube forever because I still get comments on IMGames.

452
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,120
Gamecube forever going to keep going.

453
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
I'm like, I don't know.

454
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
It's not my project.

455
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Don't ask me.

456
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Yeah.

457
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Oh yeah.

458
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Gamecube forever.

459
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,360
If there's any video gaming project I would continue.

460
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
That would be the problem.

461
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,680
That and Tales of Tales of, I still, I get asked about it all the time.

462
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,840
Tales of Tales of is one where like I kind of don't see myself finishing it unless more

463
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,720
of the fucking older games get translated because not all the ones that I wanted to review

464
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,800
have been, and like there's no effort that I could find at the time at least to finish

465
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
them up.

466
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,440
I was thinking of doing like series in that vein on Game Series.

467
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,080
I'd actually want to play, but I'm lazy and I haven't done it yet.

468
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,440
It was either going to be Discussing Disgaea or The Legacy of Legacy of Cain.

469
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,600
Those are two games, series I'd like to go through.

470
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,240
Well, I mean, you'd have to play like 300 hours of Disgaea.

471
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
I know.

472
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,240
That's what scares me because like I don't even know if I like the games.

473
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,920
I just look at the art and I'm like, the art looks pretty cool.

474
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
And that's all I know about them.

475
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,680
So do you like tactics games?

476
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,480
They're pretty fun.

477
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
I'm sure I'll have fun.

478
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
I just don't know.

479
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.

480
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Yeah, it was a great game.

481
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Okay.

482
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,880
It's like, I would say like it's along the lines of that kind of going into battles.

483
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Yeah.

484
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,800
I just don't know if I have, you know, like 5000 hours to actually do all that.

485
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,880
The biggest problem with the Disgaea games and a lot of the Niponichi games is that the,

486
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,280
there's like, you want there to be way more cut scene and story and there's not very much.

487
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
I don't know.

488
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Maybe you'll feel different, Tom.

489
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,880
Are the guys who made Disgaea, right?

490
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Correct.

491
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Yes.

492
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
I really, really liked.

493
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Oh, okay.

494
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,760
I must have missed the name, but I really, really liked Disgaea.

495
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,440
And then I think before Disgaea 2 was out, they had Lapusel Tactics was out and I thought

496
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Lapusel Tactics was lame as hell.

497
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,640
That game is too fucking slow.

498
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,760
So that was, that was actually their first game for the PS2.

499
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Yeah.

500
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
But I think it was released second in America or something like that.

501
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Yeah.

502
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
It was.

503
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,400
I think it was off the success of Disgaea that they started releasing their other games.

504
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,520
I have all the old Niponichi games and fucking Lapusel is like the amount of time it takes

505
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,200
for every turn to happen is just like preposterous.

506
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,520
The game takes fucking forever and it's, it's unplayably slow in my opinion.

507
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,640
I don't care if the mechanics get interesting or whatever.

508
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,840
It just takes too much patience.

509
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,680
They fixed all that.

510
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:16,960
Have people seen, have I talked about the pictures of me cosplaying as Master Lammington from

511
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,200
Disgaea at Anime Boston in like 2006?

512
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I've never seen this.

513
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
No, it sounds super mythical.

514
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,920
I'm not, I'm not going to find them, but anyone who has stalked my old Facebook is from,

515
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,040
or MySpace or whatever, we couldn't find, like they're on the internet.

516
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,440
I look like a fucking dweeb, but yeah, I have these huge wings that my mom helped me make.

517
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
Incredible.

518
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:44,840
And I, I, you know, Eleazar, I don't know, I'll try and, I'll try and find the picture

519
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
somewhere.

520
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,480
And if I find it, throw it up here, I guess, okay, okay, even though it's, it's embarrassing

521
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,360
and I got my stupid, my stupid long high school hair and I look all stupid and shit, but

522
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
that's okay.

523
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
That's right.

524
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,480
That's a photo next to it of, of Nate with the, of the Empire Hunter D hat, and it all

525
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,360
balance out.

526
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,400
He was, he was, he was dressed as a Vincent Valentine from Final Fantasy 7 at that Anime

527
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,440
Boston that year, so, well, I mean, his, I think his costume was a little less embarrassing

528
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,840
than mine just because it's a character people actually know.

529
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
I don't know.

530
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,040
But he had the claw and everything.

531
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Okay.

532
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Okay.

533
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,320
I just wanted to bring, bring attention to that to embarrass myself.

534
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Excellent.

535
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Excellent.

536
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,280
I really wanted to love all those Nipponichi games because of A, I wanted to, I, when I

537
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,640
was younger, I really wanted to be good at tactics games because it would mean I was

538
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,840
smart and I was not smart, so I was bad at them.

539
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,480
So I owned a lot of Tagnus games and never got very far in any of them.

540
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,440
But like, other than that, like the characters looked really cool and like were aesthetically

541
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,040
interesting, but most of the cutscenes are just like goofy nonsense that kind of flits

542
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,960
by and it takes a long time for any kind of narrative to get involved.

543
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,960
And even then, like the, the, the characters don't take the situation there and seriously

544
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
at all.

545
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,240
Like it's constantly breaking the fourth wall.

546
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,800
It's, you know, it's, it's very slapstick in that way.

547
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,320
So like, it was hard for me to get invested enough to want to play the hundreds of hours

548
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,480
of the game because at the time I was playing RPGs because of the story.

549
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,720
Like I wanted to have cool, I wanted to see cool anime characters do fun things and have

550
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,920
a plot and this guy is like, it was for the tactics game.

551
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,400
It's like, this is not a story-based game.

552
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,920
They have such a cool aesthetic, they look and they feel so cool even though the story

553
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:42,480
is like very, very superficial and like very, doesn't really take itself seriously at all.

554
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,440
I wanted to, I, I, you know, they make those, uh, the printing games that are like a spin-off,

555
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,440
uh, which I always wanted to try, but like I didn't have the platform they were on and

556
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,680
like I heard reviews that were like, it's okay.

557
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,560
The reviews seem pretty mixed on those, but I never, I never tried them myself.

558
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,480
I had a friend who was into them, so they're fine.

559
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,880
If you like the Disgaea series, but like all of the Nippon Ichigames, just like the dialogue

560
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,520
can be so obnoxious.

561
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,400
It's always like, all the characters are loud.

562
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,440
They're all shouting at each other and salting each other and just kind of, uh, being terrible

563
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
trash humans.

564
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,320
Do you remember that video Jesse did about the witch in the Hundred Knight?

565
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Yeah.

566
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Um, yeah.

567
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,640
That, I mean, that summarizes all my thoughts on those games, really.

568
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,080
That was his first noddle review, wasn't it?

569
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,320
I think so.

570
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,800
I believe it was.

571
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,840
What a classic.

572
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Mm.

573
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Tragic.

574
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Tragic.

575
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,280
Um, okay, well, uh, anecdotes, anecdotes.

576
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
What happened?

577
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
What's everyone up to?

578
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:57,200
No, no, no, no, I've just, I, I told you, I, I, I went, I told you, I went to hell and

579
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,800
I went to a parallel universe, uh, and I made Ambrosia.

580
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,880
I'm in hell right now.

581
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,760
I have to, I Comcast is my worst enemy right now.

582
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
I hate them.

583
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
They suck.

584
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
They're terrible.

585
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,800
Um, so I think the last time I was on the PCP, I was talking about how Plex is sick

586
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,040
and I'm just like building my Plex empire because it's, wait, I don't remember what

587
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Plex is.

588
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,360
Wait, Tom, you have, you have Plex.

589
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
I do.

590
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
I do.

591
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
What is Plex?

592
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
Is that a?

593
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Plex?

594
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
I don't think you have talked about it.

595
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
I don't.

596
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,640
Talk, talk, talk to us about it under the table and not in public, if you will.

597
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
What?

598
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Why?

599
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
What?

600
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Is it like crack cocaine you have?

601
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Yeah.

602
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
Yeah.

603
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
I'm, I'm doing hardcore drugs.

604
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,720
No, Plex is just like, Plex is an app you get on your computer and it takes all of your

605
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,520
torrents and shit and definitely legal downloads you have and it basically gives them like

606
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,520
a front end that looks kind of like Netflix, like populates it with like thumbnails and

607
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,160
metadata and all that shit.

608
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Okay.

609
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,640
And then you can like share your library with people if you want and people can like

610
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,200
access your, you're basically all your like media downloads.

611
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Okay, okay.

612
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,920
So wait, it's like, it's sort of like a, like a shell in which to like, like display or

613
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,160
like interface with torrents and stuff.

614
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Yeah.

615
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,000
It's the convenience of torrents with the presentation of Netflix.

616
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,480
It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the windows to the torrents DOS.

617
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Sure.

618
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,680
The most ideal time, the most ideal scenario I've been dreaming of building in my house

619
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,320
for years is to have a server computer that just is full of fucking all the video files

620
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,840
of all the stuff you want to watch and then you just have a Plex set up and from whatever

621
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,280
computer you access, it's literally like just going to Netflix and watching stuff off your

622
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
server.

623
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Yeah.

624
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
That's kind of where we're at right now.

625
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,920
Cause I got like the smart TV and like the phone and like all that little plug in.

626
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,320
So like all the screens in my house that I access have access to my Plex server now.

627
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,520
That was like the, that was one of the hopes of what we were trying to do at the back in

628
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Boston.

629
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,960
If only, if only Plex was as good back then as it is now, but it was like, it works great

630
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
and I love it.

631
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
And it's, it's awesome.

632
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
And so it was so awesome.

633
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,760
I told my, my real life friend, Devin, cause he has, he's like, I've been a media hoarder

634
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,600
for years and I was like, Hey, you should add your shit to my Plex so it can be super

635
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
powered.

636
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,040
Um, so he's like, all right.

637
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,720
So I bring my hard drive over to his place.

638
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,320
We're transferring everything over and he gets high and he didn't realize that he's

639
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:24,680
sitting on the cable for the hard drive and he knocks it over and it falls over.

640
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,600
And in the middle of like a, a like 12 hour transfer all day, we've just been hanging

641
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,440
out and like at like 10% left, the hard drive tips over and dies.

642
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,920
So all of my shit gone.

643
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,240
All of the shit he'd been transferring all day gone.

644
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,880
So everything gets destroyed.

645
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,160
I'm like, oh, oh, I feel my soul.

646
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
It hurts.

647
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,720
All those rare fucking 1080p Godzilla and Ultraman things that I'll take forever to find.

648
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,000
So my, my, my heart tribbles up into nothing and I'm a shell of a man.

649
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,960
And so in January, like this is like the beginning of the year.

650
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,320
So I'm like, I need to start rebuilding my empire from nothing again.

651
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,000
This is like the third time my hard drives have died.

652
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,320
So I start doing this.

653
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,200
I'm like, oh God, that was like terabytes of shit.

654
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,320
I'm like, okay, here we go.

655
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
So I start doing this.

656
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,920
I'm like, this is already a bad thing.

657
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:27,520
But I find out that in January, Comcast was like, hey, you now have a terabyte data cap.

658
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,320
Everybody has a terabyte data cap on their home internet.

659
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,240
There's no unlimited internet unless you pay $30 more a month now, one terabyte data cap.

660
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,560
So like January 7th data cap hit because I'm just downloading all of this shit.

661
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
I'm like, oh fuck.

662
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
And they're like, don't worry.

663
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,720
The first time you do it, we won't charge you.

664
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,320
But after this, it's another up to $50 a month for using more than a terabyte of data.

665
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
How are data caps real?

666
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,600
How is this a thing they're allowing?

667
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Don't you love how Comcast is like, it's the middle of a pandemic.

668
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,400
Everybody's working from home.

669
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,640
Internet is essential.

670
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,400
This is the time for data caps.

671
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,880
So they've been testing it out, I guess in like 20 states the last couple years, but

672
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:10,280
like this month, or last month, January is when they're like nationwide, every customer

673
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,320
now has a one terabyte data cap and they're claiming this is to make things cheaper.

674
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,840
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, because if it's $50 more for unlimited data and I had

675
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,360
unlimited data last year, it's not cheaper.

676
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,920
Don't lie to me, you motherfucker.

677
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,000
So it is now, so this month, I'm like, all right, I got to cut back on my downloads.

678
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,600
I got to space this out a little bit.

679
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,720
It's only half way through the month.

680
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,840
We're already at 75% and that's with me not trying.

681
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,360
So I'm like, this is going to be a problem.

682
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,920
This is preposterous.

683
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:44,560
It's cheaper for them because like everybody is downloading stuff.

684
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,160
And yeah, and it's it's so bullshit because it's like you go look for there like unlimited

685
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,360
data plans, like you can only do it if like, if you can only do if you rent their like

686
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,040
expensive router as well.

687
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,120
So that's extra money.

688
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,440
It's like more money to get unlimited data by itself than it's getting limited data with

689
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,680
their fucking router because then they can use that to like also project out a network.

690
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,120
So their phone customers get access to Wi-Fi everywhere.

691
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,920
And I'm just like, this is the worst company of all time.

692
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,480
What I understand the American Internet systems is like, there's like five or something

693
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,600
small amount of companies that have like, like monopolies in certain areas.

694
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,000
They do.

695
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, and they've they've they've like, gather together to decide who gets what it's not

696
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,720
even so much.

697
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,600
OK, it's not that they have monopolies as that there are only a few that are even

698
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,840
remotely decent.

699
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,880
It's like a cartel.

700
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,280
It's like they've carved up the country.

701
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,120
It's like, this is our fiefdom that we're going to be here and you're in it.

702
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,960
Like, because like my friend who lives in Ohio was like, why don't you just get like

703
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,440
spectrum spectrums and great for us.

704
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,960
I'm like, you think spectrums available here?

705
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,560
We only have two options.

706
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,080
Everyone only has two options.

707
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,480
Also, literally, everyone in New York's biggest complaint is spectrum.

708
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,880
Like it's fucking terrible.

709
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,280
It's just as bad as Comcast.

710
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,320
They're all bad.

711
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,800
Oh, yeah.

712
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,760
All equally bad.

713
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,680
And they don't compete with anybody.

714
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,200
There's no need to be good.

715
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,840
Right.

716
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,560
Like where I'm at, it's like I have cocks because that's the one that has good

717
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,360
internet. There are eight other options.

718
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,440
They're all like, you know, like 90s dial up level.

719
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,760
Right. The satellite internet.

720
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,640
That's bullshit.

721
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,360
That's what I'm trying to fix right now, but like they're still really bad.

722
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,840
Yeah, it's a nightmare.

723
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,880
And I'm just like, well, I mean, I guess I can't complain too hard

724
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,560
because I am doing definitely legal things, but still.

725
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,320
No, you can complain.

726
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,520
You can definitely complain.

727
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,200
It doesn't matter because like I'm just thinking like even if it doesn't

728
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,640
matter why you need a terabyte of data, here's the thing.

729
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,600
I had to reformat my computer, right?

730
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,080
So like I'm thinking like, what if I want to like download on my steam

731
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,400
case? I haven't reinstalled steam yet.

732
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,080
I'm like, I can't do that this month.

733
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Like I just can't play my steam games this month because I'll blow the data cap

734
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,560
just trying to download like like do maternals like a hundred gigs.

735
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,800
It's like that's that's a tenth of my monthly internet usage right there.

736
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,680
It's like, are you fucking kidding me?

737
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,640
Shit, like, like if you like download an image, like enough images,

738
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,680
you'll run out of space.

739
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,600
Yeah, I mean, like streaming YouTube video and like 1440p, that's

740
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,520
like a couple gigs.

741
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,040
If you like watch like because I've been watching Critical Role.

742
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,720
That's like four hours an episode at 1080p and there's like 200 episodes.

743
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,440
I could probably blow through the data cap just watching Critical Role every day

744
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,520
like I've been doing.

745
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,400
So you can stream the yeah, everything counts as data.

746
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,120
So downloading is like anything that is just data usage, data usage.

747
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,400
Just using the internet.

748
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,680
So like, you know, my whole family watches a fuck ton of Netflix.

749
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
We don't have cable anymore.

750
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,800
So that's all data being used at 1080p constantly all day.

751
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,240
I'm thinking about how like for all of our jobs, we have to like send files

752
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,760
to people at, you know, filmed at professional quality.

753
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,960
Hopefully, you know, like big ass fucking 60 frame goddamn, you know,

754
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,840
your output, you're like four gig YouTube file.

755
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,720
You got to upload that's yeah, it's a nightmare.

756
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,160
It's the worst.

757
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,840
And of course, you know, my dad's been working from home for like the last

758
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,880
year and like he's like going like big dialing into like the fucking secure

759
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,320
like military encrypted internet thing.

760
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
So that's like data and shit constantly.

761
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,240
So it's just like we're fucked.

762
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,920
We're fucked.

763
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,920
It's too, there's too many people in this residence for a terrible amount.

764
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,440
They found a way to squeeze more money out of you and you can't do anything about it.

765
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,840
My little sister's been vinging all of Dragon Ball Z because she's never watched it.

766
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,520
You know how big Dragon Ball Z is.

767
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,080
She's watching it in 1080p.

768
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,560
There's no way this terabyte cap is going to work.

769
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,520
It's fucked up.

770
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Yeah, it's really bad.

771
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,440
So and of course, since nobody here understands internet, except for me,

772
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,400
everyone's like when they get a message about the internet,

773
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,960
that it gets your fault, you're doing it, right?

774
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,280
And I'm like, it's not just me.

775
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,560
So yeah, it's the worst.

776
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,320
I do believe Comcast is like a regular winner of the worst, worst company

777
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,400
in America. Yeah, they are the legendary worst company in America

778
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,520
multiple years running.

779
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,960
And now I know why.

780
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,800
I mean, I bet there's stiff competition for that, too.

781
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,440
Well, the EA is usually the runner up.

782
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,360
There's three.

783
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,480
There's three internet providers in this area.

784
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,320
There's there's Comcast and then because we're in Massachusetts,

785
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,320
we also have Verizon Fios, which doesn't have data caps yet,

786
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,800
but I'm sure they will soon because like, why would they not?

787
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,400
And then there's Hughes net, which is satellite internet,

788
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,240
which is like one tenth of the speed has a monthly data cap of 50 gigs

789
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,760
and is twice the price.

790
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,080
So really competitive over there.

791
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:41,080
Bayes, we got to go back to the old pigeon sending messages.

792
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,880
Yeah. Isn't this like, isn't this what like the like

793
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,920
Copa and Pippa were about that like this stuff is like they're not allowed to do this?

794
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,240
That this is like a net neutrality thing.

795
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,760
Well, there's no net neutrality anymore.

796
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,200
That's been gone for a couple of years, but oh, really?

797
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,840
So like all of the yelling about soap and people,

798
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,160
it didn't actually change anything, unfortunately.

799
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,240
I mean, the first thing I did like back in 2016 was completely destroyed

800
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,800
net neutrality America, but net neutrality.

801
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,160
What I this is, this is what I think is probably going to happen.

802
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,840
This is why I was tweeting about it a couple of weeks ago.

803
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,160
My thought is that what they're going to do is like,

804
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,400
this is step one, because Comcast is like, all right,

805
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,240
we're going to have data caps everywhere.

806
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,200
Step two is going to be, hey, man,

807
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,120
data is getting pretty tight during COVID.

808
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,040
Huh? Well, we're going to be really beneficial to you

809
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,480
because we own NBC because we're Comcast, the new Peacock streaming service

810
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,040
because there's no net neutrality anymore.

811
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,160
That's not going to count towards your data cap.

812
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,120
So all you normies who are streaming Netflix and blowing through your data cap,

813
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,280
you should use ours to subscribe to our streaming service instead.

814
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,520
And you can use it free of charge because we won't count that torture monthly data.

815
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,720
So we can get your subscription money from Peacock as well.

816
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,000
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

817
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,200
So I expect that to happen in the next couple of months.

818
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,000
All right. If that's the case, what do they have on there?

819
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,880
What's the likelihood that that actually works for them?

820
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,760
You know, it probably will not work at all.

821
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,920
But like these companies do things that are completely stupid all of the time.

822
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,160
So of course, it's easy enough for them to just go

823
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,120
whoops and then correct course and, you know, just eat the money, fire a guy.

824
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,920
I mean, what are they going to do?

825
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,640
They're probably going to make money regardless.

826
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,000
Like they're going to be people who are going to need unlimited internet.

827
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,400
Well, you have no fucking choice.

828
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,760
Right. You're you're going like they're going to make less money,

829
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,960
which to them is akin to like losing a limb.

830
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,000
But, you know, it's not the same as actually losing a limb

831
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,920
because they can grow their limbs back. Yeah.

832
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,520
I think if that's a system like, well, yeah,

833
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,680
that's that it requires like a market that is competitive with itself.

834
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,760
Because like I was imagining if there's more than one choice,

835
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,320
then the other choices could say we won't have a data cap.

836
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,480
Now you can watch Netflix and because Netflix is so big,

837
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
that'll be a huge draw.

838
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,760
They'll get way more of the customers in the area.

839
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,160
But the way that it's that's carved up, it's like not possible

840
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,440
to have a good choice.

841
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,240
So people are fucked no matter what.

842
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,200
It's not it's not like because like the most efficient analog,

843
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,160
I think, in terms of like the U.S. is like cell phone providers,

844
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,080
like the big four cell phone providers, there's only three now,

845
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,080
actually, because fucking team mobile bought Sprint.

846
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,080
But like there's three of them, which is not great,

847
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,400
but they all operate everywhere.

848
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,920
So like they're kind of like forced to not be completely scumbags

849
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,880
that they all have to have feature parity with each other,

850
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,720
otherwise they'll get BTF owed.

851
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,200
But that's not how it works for home internet.

852
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,760
So it was only a matter of time before it all devolves into the garbage

853
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,160
I'm dealing with right now, and it sucks and it's gay and I hate it and die.

854
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,840
That's my story.

855
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,960
That's that's my tale of woe.

856
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,920
That's give and take.

857
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,320
I found the Adventures of Ultraman on VHS rip again from 1981, though.

858
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,920
Woo, that was a hard time to find again.

859
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,560
I love media.

860
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,440
That's that's the funniest fucking thing,

861
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,280
because like it's like this like dub of like this like old 1980s animated

862
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,920
Ultraman cartoon that came out and they for some reason like America

863
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,000
back in like the mid eighties, they took it, they made it a movie,

864
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,920
redubbed everything, but the main villain is called Barak, the Star Lord.

865
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,920
And I still find that funny.

866
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,080
Wait, that's great.

867
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,240
It's a 10 out of 10.

868
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,200
It's worth watching just for that.

869
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,040
I'm looking up.

870
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,960
It's also it's also the first project by the student that eventually

871
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,720
would be Sunrise, who went on the anime Gundam.

872
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,880
Oh, how do you spell Barak?

873
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,320
That's B A R A C K in that, I believe, but it's dubbed.

874
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,680
So I've never seen it spelt out.

875
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,000
So I've always just assumed that's how it was spelled as an Obama.

876
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,960
Yeah, I cannot find it on Google.

877
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,840
This is like you can see the whole movie on YouTube.

878
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,480
That's where I found it.

879
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,840
Couldn't find a torn again, but someone just uploaded it to YouTube

880
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,880
like three months ago, knowing that I would need it.

881
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,480
What a beautiful soul.

882
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,000
Yeah, I searched Barak, the Star Lord, Ultraman, and I find your tweet.

883
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,640
I find a tweet.

884
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,200
A tweet. Well, I find a tweet from you from May 26, 2019.

885
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,040
Yeah, because that was the first time I was looking because I was looking for it

886
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,360
initially. That was like the first time I found it, because I used to rent

887
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,080
this on VHS back in Blockbuster all the time.

888
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,080
And I wanted to watch it in 2019.

889
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,960
I finally found it after like doing this huge, big tweet thread of like

890
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,640
desperately looking everywhere for this fucking movie.

891
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,400
I could only find it in German for a while.

892
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,000
And it was really pissing me off.

893
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,320
Based. I got to do a PCP lecture on the Adventures of Ultraman,

894
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,680
because clearly I'm the only person in the world who knows about it.

895
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,480
I mean, yeah, perfect, perfect.

896
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
Radcon, Radcon 5 win.

897
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,520
We're doing it.

898
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,720
We're coming up on a year of Radcon 4, the year anniversary.

899
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
We're coming up on a year.

900
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,640
It's getting that time again, boys.

901
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,320
It's March, end of March or something.

902
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,440
March 16th, I think, was the end of Radcon 4.

903
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,120
It really feels like that.

904
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,640
That's like the last thing of note I've done.

905
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,800
So like everything between.

906
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,480
So sorry.

907
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,240
It's been like a year of just nothing and it's.

908
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,480
I've definitely, we definitely, well, I don't know about,

909
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,480
I don't know about all you, I don't know about you people,

910
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,720
but I definitely died at Radcon 4.

911
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,280
And the rest of everything has just been me in the after life.

912
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,080
Being tormented and purgatory.

913
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,720
Absolutely.

914
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,800
Abney, we both died in a little way.

915
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,120
I know, I mean, we literally like the plane crash

916
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,840
and I one day I will remember, but, you know, as the moment.

917
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,080
At the moment, you're like the ironic punishment to take effect.

918
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,120
All that's happening in your head is just like a simulation

919
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,680
of what could happen in the future.

920
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,680
And then you'll realize that you died back then

921
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,280
and none of this actually happened. Exactly.

922
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,200
I'm pretty sure that the Brony lecture

923
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,160
is the last thing that I actually did.

924
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,480
Like that was, I think that was the last thing Digi ever did.

925
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,960
And then did you actually died there?

926
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,680
And what you've seen has been like a like an aftershock,

927
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,440
like like ghosts, like a force ghost of Digi since then.

928
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,680
Yeah, and it's finally dissolved into nothingness.

929
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,840
That makes a lot of sense to me.

930
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,120
I've got to say of Boyd Chasers and Boyd Gazers

931
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,560
has been a little hard to understand.

932
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,160
And I haven't I haven't really made an attempt to try and understand.

933
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,840
Hard to understand exactly.

934
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,840
I think it was just the the documentary thing was very long.

935
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,720
And it was just a road trip blog.

936
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,080
It was a road trip blog.

937
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,200
And I was like, OK, I didn't watch all of it.

938
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,120
I watched a bit of it.

939
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,560
And then the podcast, there was something about a banana.

940
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,240
I was like, OK, this is clearly like very silly on the surface.

941
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,040
I don't know whether I'm interested.

942
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,440
And I just sort of stopped paying attention to what was.

943
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,080
Well, you know, a good way to find out is to fucking watch it, given.

944
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,760
That's right.

945
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,480
I mean, it's just I mean, it's just it's just it's just vlogs

946
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,440
and it's vlogs and podcasts and stuff.

947
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,600
You know, yeah, well, I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory.

948
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,320
The Void Games is a variety show is how I would describe it more so.

949
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,760
It's because the concede is that it could be thought of as a podcast

950
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,400
because it's got like call ins and it's, you know, of discussions and stuff.

951
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,760
But like it's meant to be watched.

952
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,040
It's highly edited and it's got lots of different segments,

953
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,000
so it's like a cooking segment in each episode.

954
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,200
There's all kinds of shit going on.

955
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,400
So, yeah, it's a variety hour meant to feel like one of those

956
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,080
like Japanese morning shows or something.

957
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,160
OK, I'm not familiar with Japanese morning shows, but I believe you.

958
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,800
I just felt like I should mention that even though like I could easily

959
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,320
have given it a chance and I didn't.

960
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,520
And that's I could.

961
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,960
Because I see I see that opinion a lot and I'm like, yeah, you know,

962
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,280
I feel I feel the the I don't get it sort of feeling.

963
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,560
And the obvious solution is to watch the thing that is there.

964
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,000
I I I don't understand.

965
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,160
I don't really understand not getting it.

966
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,240
I understand. I understand.

967
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,280
It's easy to not get something that you haven't watched or if it's not

968
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,160
or if it's not we subscribe for I understand that.

969
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,720
But I don't understand not getting it like it is what it is.

970
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,800
I just wasn't sure what the direction of the channel was.

971
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,680
But I don't know who cares.

972
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,680
Why would that matter?

973
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,600
And how would you figure it out other than by watching the content?

974
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,480
Like I'm playing devil's advocate. OK.

975
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,560
I'm just. Are you sometimes clear that clear pitch.

976
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,560
You know, like this is this is what you get.

977
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,720
I have I have seen I have seen people say.

978
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,280
Yeah, but like I guess I guess what it is.

979
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,760
It's what it is.

980
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,840
Well, the funny thing about that is what was ever what was ever the

981
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,760
direction of the channel?

982
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,920
Well, no, no, it wasn't like the direction of the channel was

983
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,200
like difficult to understand.

984
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,160
I think it's just like I'm so used to Digi being so open and so long

985
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,160
form about discussing the nature of the channel.

986
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,000
And I was really into befriending the Internet and then that stopped.

987
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,960
And I was like, oh, what's all this weird new stuff?

988
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,760
They're doing weed in the car.

989
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,360
That's interesting, I guess.

990
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,440
A watch. It's too visual.

991
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,440
I wanted a podcast.

992
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,640
If you if you really want if you really want what I think you want,

993
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,920
the problem is you can't have over and listen.

994
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,760
No, go to go to Voidchaser's episode one, skip to the last 17 minutes,

995
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,160
which is just me pacing around vlogging, explaining the point of the

996
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,320
previous two and a half hours, then watch the two and a half hours

997
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,880
that lead up to it.

998
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,960
Then it'll make sense.

999
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,320
Thank you.

1000
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,440
As for as for Voidgazer, skip to the part in episode two,

1001
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,400
where I'm sitting on a bench and I spend about 10 minutes explaining

1002
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,240
that show in that episode.

1003
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,440
So it'll all make sense after that.

1004
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,520
All right.

1005
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,520
I think.

1006
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,320
Pro strats would be a block.

1007
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,960
Well, the thing is that dark souls of well, what drives me insane is that

1008
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,800
throughout throughout my whole career, every time I make a shift,

1009
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,760
it's always met with people saying, like, I don't get it.

1010
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,080
Like, what's going on?

1011
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:15,080
And I usually have made an update video that has like 100 views

1012
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,880
because no one watches.

1013
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,120
I always watch those.

1014
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,200
They're fucking boring.

1015
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,520
Like I do too.

1016
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,040
So like I was always confused why people wouldn't.

1017
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,360
But like, like I would release my next video, which is in the new style

1018
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,560
and like every comment is, what's this about?

1019
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,080
And it's like, well, I just explained it last time.

1020
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,160
So at some point, I just gave up on ever doing that again.

1021
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,200
I definitely know the feeling.

1022
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Of like giving up, explaining.

1023
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,080
Well, and the worst is like, well, what am I going to put it like at the start

1024
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,480
of the video that is supposed to just stand on its own?

1025
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,560
Because then when you come back to this video in a year, it's like, well,

1026
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,680
now there's this fucking intro that is completely irrelevant.

1027
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,200
You know, like it only was relevant to the moment that the video came out.

1028
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,200
Like people, it's the weird thing about YouTube is that people have a tendency

1029
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,800
to think about it like video hits my sub feed.

1030
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,520
I watch it. It's about today.

1031
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,640
But like actually these videos stick around forever and I get most of my views

1032
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,280
through people watching my old shit.

1033
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,440
Like so, you know, I consider them all legacy content in that way.

1034
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,960
And like to to have that, you know, that legacy start with something

1035
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,120
that was totally incidental to that moment.

1036
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,160
I don't know. It's not the worst, but it's annoying, you know.

1037
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,520
Yeah.

1038
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,080
I will go. Especially if it's long wind.

1039
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,200
I will go check those.

1040
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,560
So it was like the last 17 minutes of the podcast, do you think?

1041
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,840
The void chasers, the the blog documentary, the last 17 minutes is me

1042
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:48,360
pacing around like decompressing everything that happened throughout the video.

1043
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
Yeah. OK.

1044
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,960
I think earlier, you you were also asking me what I've been doing the past week.

1045
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:02,600
Yeah, I have a well, I've been there's the secret project

1046
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,080
that I've been working on on the weekend.

1047
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,960
So you can learn about on the money to spend this podcast.

1048
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,160
I have also been working on my secret project.

1049
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,000
Secret project, secret project.

1050
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I also do that. The thing.

1051
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,200
It's secret, not a different thing.

1052
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,280
Shut up. I'm saying things.

1053
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,440
It's secret for managing hypereasons,

1054
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,040
not because I have been coy or anything.

1055
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,040
But I want it to be.

1056
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,040
More robustly completed to a point where it's like

1057
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,480
now it's a good time to mention it.

1058
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,920
So stay tuned.

1059
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,040
So that's most of my bulk of my weekday stuff.

1060
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,320
But on the weekend

1061
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,320
or rather just every night, I've been getting into Buffy, the vampire slayer

1062
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,640
and it's an incredibly good show.

1063
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,000
Like I in my head in the back of my head,

1064
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,560
aside from the times when Jesse said it was a really good show,

1065
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,760
before that, I just assumed it was like, oh, it's a Saturday morning cartoon

1066
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:09,240
Esk TV, like Disney Channel, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch kind of sort of thing.

1067
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,120
Not that it was like it's like a series.

1068
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,560
It's kind of like a drama, right?

1069
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,800
It's it's a drama. It's a teen drama.

1070
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,440
It's like it's more to closer to an HBO thing

1071
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,840
than it is to a Disney Channel thing for sure.

1072
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,080
And there's a lot of really good writing, good comedy, great acting,

1073
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,800
very, very cheesy choreography.

1074
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,680
But I kind of love it and and makeup and effects and stuff.

1075
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,880
It's really quite fucking good.

1076
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,440
And I'm really into it. We're on season two right now.

1077
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,680
I'm pretty sure that's like so cool.

1078
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,920
Jenny Nicholson said that Vampire Diaries is better than Buffy.

1079
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,080
So they just write in their diary, like I'm still alive, I guess.

1080
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,280
But it's I mean, the dark because I can't go out in the summertime.

1081
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,400
That sucks.

1082
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,000
It's been a thousand and one days since I've seen Sunlight.

1083
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,920
That's all the vampire diaries they would write.

1084
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,920
That's the only thing they would write in those diaries of theirs.

1085
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,760
I've never seen Buffy.

1086
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,360
A bunch of fucking nerds.

1087
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,320
A bunch of a bunch of stupid band chicks.

1088
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,480
They had a crush on an high school like that.

1089
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,360
Fuck that show.

1090
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,040
Buffy's cool.

1091
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,240
Xander and Willow are like the comic relief sidekick

1092
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,960
normal school, high school friends characters.

1093
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,320
And Xander is really funny.

1094
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,000
He's like the soccer from Avatar Last Airbender of the group.

1095
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,000
And Willow is

1096
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,920
is really funny as well.

1097
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,080
I can't think of it like a comparison, like a

1098
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,480
like another character from another thing that's popular.

1099
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,880
She's the Dark Souls of the group.

1100
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,200
She's the Dark Souls of the group because she has the best comedy

1101
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,560
liners, the best like dry humor.

1102
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,440
No, I guess no dry humor.

1103
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,800
I don't know how what I'm fucking saying.

1104
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,320
I'm not like a reviewer or anything.

1105
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,320
I'm just like a Buffy is cool.

1106
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,080
That's all you need to know.

1107
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,040
Well, that makes no one.

1108
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,960
No thoughts had empty.

1109
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,640
I mean, it's it's cool to watch just because

1110
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,200
it's nineties and so many things from that era

1111
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,440
are so much more antiquated than they were 10 years ago.

1112
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,400
Is there witchcraft in Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

1113
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,640
Oh, there's tons of things.

1114
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,360
It's it's mostly for the most part.

1115
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,960
Yeah, a monster of the week, and it's not always a vampire.

1116
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,960
So they could like say any weird occulty sort of thing.

1117
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:34,520
Like does Buffy herself have like powers or any kind of occult shit going on?

1118
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,400
Or is she just like a regular person who fights?

1119
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,280
She's the Slayer, which means that every generation,

1120
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,080
there's a Slayer who is a female and she kills vampires.

1121
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,280
And then there's like the Watcher or the something.

1122
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,120
And he's like the informant for the Slayer.

1123
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,360
And he's like the librarian of the school she's going to.

1124
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:59,200
And she just punches and kicks and has a stake.

1125
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,720
She's basically just martial arts.

1126
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,160
But she's friends with like witches and demons and stuff, right?

1127
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,720
She's there's one friendly vampire called Angel

1128
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,560
who falls in love with her because he's fucking stupid.

1129
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,160
He does like a there's this there's also a show called Angel, right?

1130
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,280
Does he have a spin off show? I guess he does.

1131
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,680
Yeah, I haven't seen much other than the first few things of Buffy.

1132
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,480
I did I did remember seeing a YouTube video about how the

1133
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,560
the HD remaster of Buffy that's put on Netflix is like it's cropped.

1134
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,600
It's like zoomed in and cropped to the detriment of the show.

1135
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,920
And there's a lot of effects like the remaster shows more than it's supposed to show.

1136
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,560
And you can like see the set.

1137
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,440
No, no, no, it's like that.

1138
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,720
I don't know about maybe that happens.

1139
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,680
But from what I can tell, it seems to have been zoomed in from four three

1140
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,160
to the 1080p aspect ratio.

1141
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,480
So the top and the bottom are cut off a little bit,

1142
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,840
which doesn't matter most of the time, but sometimes it's pretty weird where

1143
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,800
like a character is blocked to be like just their head is visible at the bottom

1144
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,760
of the screen and the person that they're talking to is like standing up next to them.

1145
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,320
And their head is at the top of the screen and slightly cut off

1146
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,560
and it just looks awkward, but only sometimes.

1147
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,120
I hate that shit.

1148
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,160
They did the same thing with the Simpsons, too.

1149
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:32,200
They like re-released it with like just bad, bad cropping that like ruins jokes sometimes.

1150
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,720
They're like the wrong aspect ratio.

1151
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,400
It's so annoying because of normies we'll never know.

1152
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,760
Unless you're like a nerd that watches YouTube videos that complain about media,

1153
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,680
you'd never know that like, oh, yeah, this is like if you're watching

1154
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,000
Simpsons for the first time and you're just some guy who's like,

1155
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,600
you know, you're a kid, you're like 18 or whatever.

1156
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,280
And you're like, hmm, Simpsons is like a classic show that I've never seen.

1157
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,520
I guess I'll just let's binge it all and then you watch like this fucked up version

1158
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,120
that's like some some of it is ruined.

1159
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,960
It's sad. It's a sad thought.

1160
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,920
I don't like it.

1161
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:12,200
I want I want to get to the part in Buffy where the guy says,

1162
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,720
I'm drowning in footwear.

1163
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,600
I've always wondered, I think that's literally the last episode.

1164
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,080
Yeah, well, I've I've also heard there's a great show.

1165
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,520
So I don't feel like rushing to get to there.

1166
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,720
Yeah. I'm enjoying the ride.

1167
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,840
It's very good, like very good.

1168
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,840
Like like so good that I would even recommend it.

1169
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,760
Whoa. No, that's crazy.

1170
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,800
Even in the HD, like cropped version, it's it's mostly perfect.

1171
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,000
I'm going to watch it.

1172
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,760
I'm going to want I want to have things to talk about my friends

1173
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,800
of the procrastinator's body.

1174
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,720
My pain is immeasurable.

1175
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,920
I literally when Gabe was starting to talk about this, I'm like, oh, sick.

1176
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,880
I'm going to go down.

1177
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,880
I can't.

1178
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,840
And now I now I hate Comcast.

1179
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,440
You know, I was ready to go out to my flex.

1180
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,760
Immeasurable, legally ruined, and dude, let me check.

1181
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,640
Is there a fucking DVD box set up?

1182
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,400
I'm sure there is.

1183
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,960
But but I'm not going to be some fucking disgusting physical media.

1184
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,400
No, it's great.

1185
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,360
The leader is so cool.

1186
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,560
Because I'm going to buy me.

1187
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,240
I'm going to buy the official 1080p blu-ray releases of

1188
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,160
Ultraman, Ultra Seven, Ultraman Taro in steel boxes.

1189
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,080
That shit's pretty fucking cool and my speed.

1190
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,960
But like, Buffy, boy, these episodes are 45 minutes long.

1191
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,600
They're quite long and it's it's quite a big thing.

1192
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,560
Oh, look, look, look, Buffy season, Buffy complete season one to seven

1193
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:43,520
20th anniversary edition DVD 2017 for like 43 pounds.

1194
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,680
That's not that much.

1195
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,320
It's I mean, it's not terrible.

1196
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,320
Seven seasons.

1197
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,120
Oh, I could just wait till next month and then download it.

1198
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,160
Dude, VHS.

1199
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,640
I watch first if you like buying are all on a daily motion.

1200
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,720
I mean, but it's still I'm still down.

1201
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,560
I'm still using data.

1202
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,160
Oh, shit.

1203
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,400
It doesn't matter.

1204
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,840
I forgot you can't stream either.

1205
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,160
That's fucked, dude.

1206
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,560
Yeah, it's bullshit.

1207
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,160
They should at least get kind of data cap you have on your phone.

1208
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:11,640
Nothing.

1209
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,240
It's literally more efficient to watch things on my phone now

1210
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,440
than it is to use my devices.

1211
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,760
Tether your phone.

1212
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,800
You only have two gigs of tethering per month.

1213
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,840
I can only watch it on the phone now.

1214
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,200
It's a crime against humanity.

1215
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,760
Well, you know, it's from the 90s.

1216
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,000
It'll look fine.

1217
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,920
I guess I got to get I got to get like one of those like fucking

1218
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,640
Game Boy things where you snap it on there.

1219
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:41,760
What about you use the other phone to HDMI like converters?

1220
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,040
Can you I mean, I could like cast things, I guess,

1221
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,600
with like a Chromecast or something.

1222
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,760
But like now I'm living like a fucking caveman.

1223
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,200
This is unacceptable cast through Plex, I'm sure.

1224
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,520
Maybe God, I hate it.

1225
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,200
I hate it.

1226
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,040
This is where you're in.

1227
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,120
This is just where you're at.

1228
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,320
There's no other option.

1229
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,080
Yeah, you've got to.

1230
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,400
You've got to get into like the black market,

1231
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,200
like physical media circuit that used to exist.

1232
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,320
Yeah, yeah, it's going to come back.

1233
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,400
You've got to go to start.

1234
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,720
I'm going to have to convert all this amazing place.

1235
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,080
You can go actually called the Philippines,

1236
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,600
where you can legally purchase physical versions of literally

1237
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,280
everything that exists for very, very cheap.

1238
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,680
And your American dollar is worth way the fuck more there.

1239
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,080
Can you even go to a different country now?

1240
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,480
Is that possible?

1241
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,480
I think it might be.

1242
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,240
I don't know.

1243
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,440
I don't know about the Philippines.

1244
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,640
I don't I don't think America is like I don't think America

1245
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,840
has like travel restrictions.

1246
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,640
I guess not.

1247
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,440
I think I know like maybe it could be there.

1248
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,120
People are restricted travel from America.

1249
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,680
No, no, no, here's what they do.

1250
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,960
You're allowed to get on the plane.

1251
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,040
You're allowed to buy the ticket.

1252
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,000
But then as soon as you're in the plane, it flies off.

1253
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,960
They shoot it down.

1254
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because that way they still make their money.

1255
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,640
That makes sense.

1256
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,800
They can't but they can't cancel the plane

1257
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,120
because that would just cost them too much in red tape.

1258
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,320
It's cheaper to just keep it going.

1259
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,000
Well, unironically, though, if you really did,

1260
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,160
like this is not even a bad way to amass a collection

1261
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,160
like I'm describing, because while it might be like

1262
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,680
probably a thousand dollars for the plane ticket to the Philippines,

1263
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,000
you could stay there for a month on less than a thousand dollars

1264
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,800
and buy a media collection like with like like for the thousand

1265
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,000
dollars that you would spend there.

1266
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,280
What I'm trying to say is I once went to the Philippines with two grand

1267
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,520
and I bought a lot of figures.

1268
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,760
Most of my collection I got there.

1269
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,400
So God, yeah, it was very cheap to live.

1270
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,080
And it was very cheap to come back with a whole lot of shit.

1271
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,640
So, you know, unironically, if you're an adventurous person,

1272
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,840
just fly out to a third world country,

1273
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,320
buy a whole bunch of contraband and mail it to yourself.

1274
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,400
Incredible.

1275
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,040
Well, if I get that desperate, maybe I will.

1276
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,760
Don't spend the extra fifty dollars a month on unlimited Internet.

1277
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,240
Spend two thousand dollars going to the Philippines.

1278
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,520
I got the you might go to spend money to make money.

1279
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,600
The conversion rate from USD to the Filipino, whatever is good.

1280
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,320
The Filipino.

1281
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,840
But if you convert those US dollars to Bitcoin, then you'll have you.

1282
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,840
That's even better.

1283
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,440
That's true.

1284
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,720
I've made like a grand in Bitcoin in the last month.

1285
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,280
Damn.

1286
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,600
Just from everybody else in the world.

1287
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,160
I fucking hate you so much.

1288
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,040
I'm so I'm so I'm on the I look.

1289
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:28,880
I need that.

1290
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,720
I wouldn't be able to pay rent probably with that.

1291
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,080
I I looked at it like an hour ago and I saw that it had kept going.

1292
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,600
I want I want you to know, Digi, that I am actively rooting

1293
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,840
against you because every time I see Bitcoin go up, I get angry.

1294
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,800
I get mad because I sold it.

1295
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,320
I sold it at a slight loss.

1296
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,320
I was just wait for that anymore.

1297
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,320
Just wait for the next step.

1298
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,040
It's fine.

1299
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,480
Oh, you're a fucking dip.

1300
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,760
You'll buy the dip.

1301
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,840
Oh, buy the dip.

1302
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,440
No, I don't count twenty seven.

1303
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,240
I'm fucking done.

1304
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,840
Jimmy, Jimmy fucked me.

1305
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,720
I don't have fucked me.

1306
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,240
Everything I don't have this Bitcoin to like pull it out at any point.

1307
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:05,960
Like I have I might spend some of it, but like it's there to be there.

1308
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,080
Like Bitcoin is going to only ever go up.

1309
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,360
Bitcoin like in the long term.

1310
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,880
So and Ethereum.

1311
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,480
So I'm not trying to spend that shit.

1312
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,800
I'm glad Ethereum's going up because I got like forty dollars

1313
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,200
of free Ethereum from M.Strange in like twenty eighteen.

1314
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,680
And now it's worth almost three hundred bucks.

1315
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,200
I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I had my doge coins going down,

1316
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,560
but I'm still up almost three hundred percent

1317
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,240
and my initial investment of doge coin.

1318
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,840
So what's what's what's that's that's six cents.

1319
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,600
I bought it.

1320
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,320
I was shocked to see that it has continued to rise

1321
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,640
since the after the peak.

1322
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,600
OK, it's down a little bit.

1323
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,320
Oh, it's it was high.

1324
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,240
It's high. It was like eight, eight and a half cents.

1325
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,120
So it's still down.

1326
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,720
It reached it reached it again.

1327
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,640
Like it, you know, I mean, most things they spike really

1328
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,320
like GME spiked really high and then it settled down again.

1329
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,680
Dogecoin spiked really high

1330
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,800
and it's lean like it was still down, but then it went like back.

1331
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,680
It went back to where it was spiking to.

1332
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,560
I was shocked and appalled.

1333
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,600
OK, OK, it looks like it's kind of consolidating right now.

1334
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,720
I'm hoping Bitcoin crashes so I can actually get put some money into it.

1335
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,680
No, just put money into it now.

1336
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,680
Don't that's not how this works.

1337
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,480
Just money. I mean, I have one pound in right now.

1338
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,960
Well, put more one pound twenty.

1339
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,760
One could put one could crash.

1340
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,080
Put in crash that.

1341
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,280
Yeah, but that wouldn't that wouldn't hurt you

1342
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,000
unless you spent it when it crashed.

1343
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,600
Like you just hold it until it's uncrashed.

1344
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,240
Like it will uncrash.

1345
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,640
It's I think Bitcoin and Ethereum are stable enough at this point

1346
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,960
as like the go-tos that like the entire fucking crypto economy is built on.

1347
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,720
That like if it crashes, if it crashes, though,

1348
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:45,960
then it would be better to buy when it crashes like let me put it before.

1349
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,320
This is how my it makes intuitive.

1350
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,240
I guess it makes intuitive sense that since it's like been high,

1351
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,640
like it's got high and then it stayed pretty high for a while.

1352
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,600
And well, it's gone up like considerably continually over.

1353
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,320
Like if you look at the trend over time, it's just going up.

1354
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,560
I mean, it's pretty fucked when you think about it,

1355
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,520
that Elon Musk like made one purchase and it like doubled the value of Bitcoin.

1356
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,640
It's pretty weird.

1357
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,520
And he can do that any time is the other thing like that can keep happening.

1358
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,680
It's all about how people are playing the the long game with the market

1359
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,600
because like it doesn't necessarily benefit people holding Bitcoin for it to.

1360
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,760
I've decided after doing this whole stock thing and like doing the game

1361
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:29,480
stop shit and like having doge and Ethereum that crypto and stock market

1362
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,680
is gay, it's good, but it's also incredibly gay.

1363
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,480
And I hate it. It's I hate it.

1364
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,760
I mean, I'm I have I have I have hated every second of being involved with this

1365
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,720
stuff. It has been a miserable, so I'm crushing 200.

1366
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,800
I love this. I'm fucking mad into it.

1367
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,000
I love $200. It's always good.

1368
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,880
It's always good when the market is bullish.

1369
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,400
It's always good when the market is bull.

1370
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,640
No, I'm like, OK, and I'm up $200 on Dogecoin.

1371
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,520
And I am like insulted by the fact that like I just have $200

1372
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,840
that I did nothing for and I hate it and it's it makes me like mad.

1373
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,360
But you didn't do nothing.

1374
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,760
You made a sensible investment and we're smarter than everybody else who didn't.

1375
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,120
I am with Tom. I'm with Tom.

1376
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,280
No, the fact that the fact that it paid off

1377
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,400
does not mean it was a sensible investment.

1378
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,920
Not even that. It's just like I get make call me an old fashioned pro.

1379
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:25,320
But I feel like gains not made by direct labor is wrong and unethical.

1380
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,680
I feel the apps. I know I know what you mean.

1381
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,080
But also, like, OK, we can you can you can you can say that

1382
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,480
unlike in like a theoretical sense, like what you say what you say.

1383
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,120
What I'm saying, Tom, is that capitalism works on paper,

1384
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,800
but in practice, it just doesn't it just doesn't pan out.

1385
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,000
It never works. And and you're you're I don't know.

1386
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,920
I don't know. I don't think there's anything more capitalistic than the stock market.

1387
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,840
There are plenty of other.

1388
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,680
There are plenty of other cases why, like, you know, the wage wage laborers, like.

1389
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:02,080
Uh, you're you're in a you're in a it's an idealistic way of looking at things.

1390
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:05,720
And like, I'm already I've already been convinced that it is not true

1391
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:09,680
that, like, an honest day's work for an honest day's pay makes the world go around or whatever.

1392
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,520
So, like, agreed. But like, also, I'm past it.

1393
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,800
I'm past your point.

1394
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,920
You said you hate it, but you're also disagreeing with me.

1395
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,240
So I don't know what your stance is at this point.

1396
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,320
Well, it's just that.

1397
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,000
Are you just mad that you lost money?

1398
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,200
Is that because I know you're not actually saying that it's

1399
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,040
I know you're not actually saying that it's unethical.

1400
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,960
I'm just saying I understand that feeling, but I don't have it

1401
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:35,240
because I've been disillusioned of the idea that, like, working for your money

1402
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,600
is like the is the right thing.

1403
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,040
Well, money is wrong. Money is the problem.

1404
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,920
That's my whole thing.

1405
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,000
It's like the next step is like, oh, this is bullshit, anyways.

1406
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,560
Right. Like, every time it exists, I don't I don't think there should be

1407
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,680
a system that allows someone to do nothing and make more money than 99

1408
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,360
percent of the population, like, working all day.

1409
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,440
Sure. And the fact that I'm benefiting from that system

1410
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,560
and how helping it perpetuate, even in a tiny way, does make me want to wretch

1411
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,080
and I hate it.

1412
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,320
But other people have been doing that all along.

1413
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,160
Correct. And we should murder those people.

1414
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:09,680
It's not like it's a news.

1415
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,840
Wait, Elisar, shut that out.

1416
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,120
All I know is that making investment gives you investment

1417
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,680
capital to make more investment in the future so that you can actually put

1418
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,880
money into the things you want to do.

1419
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,040
And it's really, really great.

1420
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,200
And that's why I'm doing it.

1421
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,160
Unless it, unless it crashes, though, unless it crashes, because it can happen

1422
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,360
any time, just leave your money in there until it's good again.

1423
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,920
OK, I mean, pull it out when it crashes.

1424
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,440
Don't do that. That's bad instincts.

1425
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,480
That's weird. That's stuff people do to kill themselves.

1426
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,280
Like it's like it's a weird suicide thing.

1427
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,760
Like, so, OK, let me just I want to run through my last

1428
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,760
the simple story of my three years with crypto so far, because I started

1429
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,800
with just $50 in Ethereum and it immediately went down in value.

1430
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,760
And it continued to stay down in value for two years.

1431
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,680
It was two years before the Ethereum was worth $50 again.

1432
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,880
And as soon as it went over $50, I was like, oh, OK, like this thing

1433
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,600
is this thing's still alive and it's on the upswing again, as it had been.

1434
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,040
Like I had bought in at a time when it was at its healthiest.

1435
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,760
Like it had just reached a new height.

1436
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,680
So I bought some.

1437
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,120
It dips for two years, reaches a new height again.

1438
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,360
So then at that point, I put more money into Ethereum and Bitcoin.

1439
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,200
I think I had $100 in each as of last year.

1440
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,920
And then I put like $600 into Chainlink.

1441
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,960
And this was at a time where last August, like Chainlink was surging.

1442
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,920
I got in at I got in just before the peak.

1443
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,960
So I did make money when it peaked.

1444
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,320
But then it immediately went like to half of its worth and stayed there

1445
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,560
for a long time.

1446
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,080
And so I was like, well, either I just lost this bubble

1447
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,000
because it was completely possible that link was only ever going to have

1448
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,520
one bubble burst at this moment and it would never be worth this amount again.

1449
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,600
But there is logic when it comes to bitcoins,

1450
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:08,640
it's not just gambling because there is actual reasons that each of these coins exist.

1451
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,640
So like in terms of what Bitcoin and Ethereum are so valuable

1452
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,560
because the entire structure of the economy is built on them.

1453
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,120
So Chainlink is similar in that it helps to facilitate

1454
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,160
Ethereum's ability to work faster.

1455
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:28,600
So the more like Chainlink there is, the better the whole system runs, essentially.

1456
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,400
So that like in that's because of that, I was like, OK, I'm going to hold on to this.

1457
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,120
But like I was down to like half of the value of it

1458
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,680
up until this whole fucking game stonks thing happened.

1459
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,440
And just because of this, my Chainlink increased in the what had been originally

1460
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,680
600 had been at 300 most of the time is now worth 900.

1461
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,920
I transferred all that into Bitcoin immediately

1462
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,240
because I don't trust Chainlink enough to, you know, to stay at this height forever.

1463
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,360
But I do trust Bitcoin to keep going up and I wanted my money there.

1464
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:03,240
So I still have a little bit in Chainlink in case it one day moons, as they say,

1465
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,240
where it just has a sudden spike in my $70 is worth something dramatically different.

1466
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,960
But like actually the fucking Ethereum and Bitcoin that I had that I had

1467
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,520
$100 in each are now worth $500 each from this spike.

1468
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,400
Those I don't think are just going to drop.

1469
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,560
And even if they did, they would drop to a level

1470
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,760
that was still higher than what I bought in at.

1471
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,840
And then if I didn't sell, then it could still go higher up than what I even have.

1472
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:29,640
That's the current height.

1473
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,960
So I have I have fucked up at every stage.

1474
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,160
Like I bought when I bought of crypto.

1475
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,400
I have a Bitcoin when it was like close to peaking.

1476
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,480
It went up for a while, but then it went down again.

1477
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,840
So that's when I sold.

1478
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,520
If I it's true, if I had just held it, just don't never sell when you're down.

1479
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,320
Just never if I had just I didn't sell when I was down.

1480
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,040
I sold basically when it was back to where I bought it.

1481
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,160
So like I lost like a slight amount.

1482
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,880
If I had just held it, I would be up like a ways.

1483
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:01,840
So I'm very angry, very upset, a fuck Elon Musk.

1484
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,560
It was the same with GameStop.

1485
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,600
Also, I bought it at like the literal peak.

1486
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,120
I bought it at the literal peak because I was like, OK, the hype train is real.

1487
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,680
I was going on Wall Street bets.

1488
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,480
I was seeing like everyone saying it's going to the moon.

1489
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,760
Oh, my God, fear of missing out FOMO.

1490
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,480
I got to get in on the rocket before it goes.

1491
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,840
OK, it didn't work.

1492
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,520
I whatever.

1493
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,560
Yeah, that's fine.

1494
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,400
It was for the means for the meme.

1495
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,200
So it's all good.

1496
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:28,960
A general good bet with all of this is if you are not plugged into any kind

1497
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,000
of financial sphere enough that you heard about it before other people did,

1498
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,320
don't get in on it because you're in the shock.

1499
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,440
The fact that I was the fact.

1500
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,120
Yeah, you're right.

1501
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,000
The fact that I was just hearing about it then when I was not involved

1502
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,920
with the community meant that like it had already gone off.

1503
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,160
If your advice is coming from Twitter, you're too late.

1504
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,160
So yeah.

1505
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,720
So I'm very smart, though.

1506
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,240
I mean, I still have my one share of GameStop.

1507
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,920
It's worth like a fraction.

1508
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,960
I actually just bought more.

1509
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,680
I actually just bought more because I set a I set an order to auto go off

1510
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,200
when it when it hit like 50 bucks and it just hit 50 bucks.

1511
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,080
I don't think it's going to go up anytime soon.

1512
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,000
I mean, as long as it doesn't go any lower than 50, I won't lose any more.

1513
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,600
To me, the unsung power of all of this, though, is that like so many people

1514
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:22,120
who never would have ever got involved in stocks or fucking crypto just did.

1515
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,000
And like even having a negative experience, at least you like get your foot

1516
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,720
in the door and know what it is so you can say, OK, well, I know what the apps

1517
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,400
do. I know the only good thing that's happened with my stock portfolio so far

1518
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,600
is that Sundial Growers did pretty good.

1519
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,080
I got it at 80 cents.

1520
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,400
It went up to like four.

1521
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,800
I sold a little bit then.

1522
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,040
So I'm up on Sundial.

1523
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,040
I made some money there.

1524
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,440
Oh, I have I have only lost money.

1525
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,640
I've only lost money on these.

1526
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,760
I just want to I just want to get to 10 cents.

1527
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:55,480
God, well, you didn't lose much money.

1528
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:58,120
So I thought I was so clever.

1529
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,160
Well, I lost a little more.

1530
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:03,760
The stuff I've seen people lose in this is like the the amount of down

1531
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,360
people will sell at is absolutely preposterous.

1532
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:10,360
Like I saw people like as soon as link went from 17 dollars to 12 dollars

1533
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,240
immediately sold their link, even though they had thousands of dollars in it,

1534
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,680
because they're like, oh, I don't want it to go down any further.

1535
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,840
And it's like, well, you should have considered the money forfeit

1536
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,080
when you put it in, right?

1537
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,360
Like that is the way I did with GameStop.

1538
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,400
And that's why I'm not that I put $500 in total.

1539
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,120
And I was like, well, I can't get a PS5.

1540
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,600
So I guess this is where that money is going, right?

1541
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,640
That's that's really the best way to look at it.

1542
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,840
Only put in money you won't miss, you know.

1543
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,600
Yeah, that's that's what I did wrong.

1544
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,440
That's what I did wrong with Bitcoin.

1545
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,440
I put too much in.

1546
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,800
And if Bitcoin had fallen to zero, I would have been devastated by the loss.

1547
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,000
That's why I got paper hands and I was like, I can't do it.

1548
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I can't stay in. This is too dangerous.

1549
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,440
I took it out. Now it's up 50 percent.

1550
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,560
I would be way, way up. I'm I'm I'll never get over it.

1551
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,200
Also, nobody listening to this listen to anything I'm saying.

1552
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,440
I'm not a financial advisor.

1553
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,240
I don't know what I'm doing.

1554
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,120
I have no money to my name.

1555
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,840
Except this crypto that I happen to have got lucky with.

1556
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:07,080
I hear someone making stock advice and then saying, I'm not a financial advisor.

1557
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,320
All I think of is like YouTube videos where it's like, this is not my copyright.

1558
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,160
I don't claim copyright for this. I'm like, yeah, OK, fuck you.

1559
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,640
When I hear someone say that, I think, hmm, this guy knows to cover his bases.

1560
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,520
This guy is smart.

1561
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:25,680
The thing with with all, you know, the ethical

1562
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:30,400
nurse, like I think it's sort of immaterial.

1563
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,240
Like it's it's easy to to to think of it as like, oh,

1564
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:38,440
you're not doing any work and you're making capital and people work

1565
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:43,960
and they they don't even get as much as it's more of a damnation of working

1566
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:48,160
than it is the stock. It's it's it's I don't think that there's a problem.

1567
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,560
I make my living from YouTube ad revenue.

1568
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,920
So I already like don't like like working for honest work

1569
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,920
for for money is already like out the window for me.

1570
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,920
It's like that ship and sail.

1571
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,840
I mean, I think it's fair to consider artistic creation

1572
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,040
and entertainment to be to be honest work.

1573
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,280
It's the hardest work of all. Yeah, sure.

1574
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:13,840
But but like I think I think that all it does really is just it just

1575
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,040
creates a lot of easy jealousy.

1576
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,960
Like you see people who have in your eyes done nothing necessarily

1577
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,920
and then they get become billionaires.

1578
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,080
And you're like, well, not necessarily billionaires,

1579
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,760
but like they get thousands of thousands of something or other

1580
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,240
because they were in early on something and you're like, fuck,

1581
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,720
he ego raptured it.

1582
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,720
He fucking ego raptured that cryptocurrency. Yeah.

1583
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,840
And and it's easy to get jealous and to, you know,

1584
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,800
to get really emotionally invested in it.

1585
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,800
And I just I don't like which is which is the correct response.

1586
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,400
And I'm going to pitch you and you should use it.

1587
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,400
I don't like you.

1588
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,800
And I'm not fucking super upset about it.

1589
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,920
Teens to people's door.

1590
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,240
The whole thing with the stock market is that like it's not for

1591
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,560
Pearls anyways, right?

1592
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,400
Because like even if like GameStop doubled, well, here's my point.

1593
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,960
Even if GameStop had doubled in value when me and Ben bought in at like

1594
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,280
three hundred and was sitting at six hundred right now, like, oh,

1595
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,880
we'd have three hundred more dollars.

1596
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,640
Hurray. Like we don't have enough money to make any substantial

1597
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,000
money on the stock market.

1598
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,200
You know, I guess if you're considering like, I mean, we're like

1599
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:19,280
particularly broke, like compared to I think the stock market is great

1600
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:23,280
for like middle class people over half of America can't afford like

1601
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,160
a four hundred dollar surprise bill.

1602
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:30,320
Like I I'm doing I'm have more savings than the majority of Americans,

1603
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,840
which blows my mind.

1604
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,000
That's this terrifying to me.

1605
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,360
Yeah. Yeah.

1606
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:41,360
I think the I think the metagame of like the the capitalist money system

1607
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:47,000
we're trapped in currently is that like basically in lieu of their

1608
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,800
being socialism, people want to create a like definitive self like a

1609
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,840
self safety net.

1610
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:59,400
And so like most people who get involved in investment, like if you see

1611
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,920
the people who talk about it online, almost all of them are just like,

1612
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:06,080
I just feel like I need to have at least a million dollars or else

1613
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,080
I won't be able to survive this world.

1614
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:13,040
Like it's just that mentality of like the safety of money that these people

1615
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,160
have, which is not even real.

1616
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,520
Money doesn't really make you safe.

1617
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,800
The best way to be safe is have connections and people who will don't

1618
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,600
want to kill you, which if you have more money, more people want to kill you.

1619
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,160
So it's not necessarily the best way to go.

1620
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,200
I mean, I mean, money.

1621
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,000
Well, I know what you mean.

1622
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,360
Money does make you safe from some things.

1623
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:33,640
It does.

1624
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,600
I think it makes you safe from poverty.

1625
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,040
And that's a difficult.

1626
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,680
Yes, yeah, poverty is pretty dangerous.

1627
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:44,600
Or so anything above the level of like, like if you have more than like,

1628
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,080
I don't know, if you're making more than, say, like five hundred thousand

1629
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:53,800
dollars a year, then like you're a target at that point, you know, maybe.

1630
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,200
Yeah.

1631
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,360
Well, I mean, I'm not making anywhere close to that.

1632
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,880
So I don't even want I have nowhere to go, but I just want like 40 K a year.

1633
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,880
That's all I want.

1634
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:02,920
I'd be totally happy.

1635
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,480
I would like, I would like to make, I would like to make.

1636
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:10,320
Well, I wouldn't like to personally make five hundred thousand dollars a year.

1637
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:15,440
I would like as Yig Studio, a group of content creators, you know, like with

1638
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,680
money being put in and out of, you know what I mean?

1639
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,240
Like I'd like the profit of my endeavor to be that

1640
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,640
not not that it's just me being rich or whatever.

1641
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,120
Yeah, yeah, like, I don't I'm at the point where

1642
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,320
because I was living I was living so meagerly for a long time and I still am.

1643
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,080
But I'm I'm making a little more money now.

1644
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:41,920
And like I'm still at like a I'm still at like like a submittal class income.

1645
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,280
But like my expenses are so low that I like I've been saving money for a while now.

1646
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,240
And I don't know what to do with it all.

1647
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:53,480
And I'm starting to think like, yeah, this is like it's time to reinvest

1648
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:58,480
this in like projects or something, whatever that means.

1649
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:03,640
Like, I don't know, pay people to make stuff that I can incorporate

1650
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,800
into something, I don't know, maybe it was like

1651
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,040
pay comic artists to do more vapor or something for more of that.

1652
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,560
Like because that money is not for anything else

1653
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:19,480
because I have nothing really that I need to spend it on for myself personally.

1654
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,360
So it like it needs to do something.

1655
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,560
But I don't know what.

1656
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,760
You know what I mean?

1657
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,480
Yeah, it's just sitting in your back again.

1658
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,360
And it's just like this is like wasted potential.

1659
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,680
And so I guess I see that I see that more as like it's not like it's money

1660
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:39,880
that I have made, but I feel like it should be, you know, like budget money

1661
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:46,440
for like a a an enterprise or a I mean, not like a studio because I'm just one guy.

1662
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,640
But you know what I mean?

1663
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,800
You want your money to work?

1664
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,800
Reinvest essentially, as long as you're sitting on it, fuel fuel the power

1665
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,000
of some kind of creative machine.

1666
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,720
Indeed, based, based.

1667
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,560
All right, someone else talk.

1668
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,560
I'm done.

1669
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:10,360
Well, I don't like money, but I sure need to get some.

1670
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,320
Preach my dude.

1671
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,520
Patreon.com slash give and take.

1672
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,200
Fuck.

1673
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,040
Oh, shit.

1674
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,760
Go to the Money Spenders podcast.

1675
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,200
We can learn all about stuff that I say.

1676
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,200
We all have bonus podcast, right?

1677
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,560
Like all of us are doing one.

1678
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:27,920
Yeah, I think so.

1679
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,720
I should start.

1680
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,920
I should do a Noida cast.

1681
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,320
I should I should do a podcast.

1682
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,400
You should do a Noida stream.

1683
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:35,920
I should.

1684
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,560
Yeah, that makes sense.

1685
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,160
I think it OK.

1686
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,800
I think it would be boring because post your Noida streams on only fans

1687
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,720
and people tip you.

1688
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,240
That's what we've learned today.

1689
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,440
I feel like OK.

1690
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:51,600
I feel like if I was streaming a normal Noida run, I would be distracted

1691
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,600
by the chat and I would just die a lot and it would be boring and annoying.

1692
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,960
But now that I'm on a good run with someone with you to read.

1693
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,000
Yeah, I was going to say that was the thing we learned from I am Games.

1694
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,400
It's so much easier to do stream when one person is gaming and one person is talking.

1695
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,280
Then that makes sense.

1696
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,320
Every time I solo stream, it's a nightmare.

1697
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:15,440
But now, but now on my current run, I think it would be boring

1698
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:19,120
because like so much of what I'm doing now is just like collecting

1699
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,640
wands and spells and like storing them somewhere and just kind of going through

1700
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,520
my collection like, OK, put this here.

1701
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,720
So I have this and just like arranging things and then like just doing trial

1702
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,880
and error where I like I'll stand there and like, OK, what if I put this in a

1703
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,600
wand and fire it and then what if I put this in a wand and fire it?

1704
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,400
OK, the the fire rate changes.

1705
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,440
How long can a run potentially go for?

1706
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,240
Like you're you're saying this run like you're in one continual run.

1707
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,920
OK, well, a normal run where I just go to the boss, like usually I would die

1708
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,640
within like half an hour or an hour.

1709
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:52,360
Maybe like a good run might take a few hours if I like made it all the way

1710
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,400
to the boss and won this run.

1711
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,760
Where I'm like trying to like I've become like insanely powerful

1712
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,880
and I have like the world is my oyster and I can do anything.

1713
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,720
I mean, I've been the last for like several days because just doing a lot

1714
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:10,920
of like man wand management and a lot of like, OK, like like like getting

1715
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:15,560
through the the parallel world rock wall, I had to do a lot of like preparation

1716
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,720
for that. I had to like I had to find the ambrosia.

1717
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,200
I had to like separate it out.

1718
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,600
I had to put it in potions.

1719
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,200
I had to go like prepare my one specifically for the task and go do it.

1720
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,560
So like a lot of it is like stuff that is not even that interesting to see.

1721
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,440
A lot of it is me just like managing inventory slots.

1722
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,240
And then, you know, it would have been cool.

1723
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,280
I guess it would have been cool to stream that because it's like, OK,

1724
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,720
I would be like preparing and preparing and preparing and talking about like,

1725
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,120
how am I preparing to do this and then to go do it.

1726
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,120
But it's too late.

1727
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,120
I guess I could do that to like go to the moon or something.

1728
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,360
But I feel like boring through the the parallel

1729
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,720
world's wall was the big was the big challenge.

1730
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,920
And I've already done it.

1731
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,120
So oh, God, it's just like Bitcoin.

1732
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,240
It's just like Bitcoin.

1733
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,400
I didn't I didn't I didn't get in the ground floor.

1734
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,520
I didn't start early enough.

1735
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,680
It's too late now.

1736
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:13,000
It's never too late by Bitcoin.

1737
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,320
Yeah, I feel this way.

1738
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,240
I feel like it's too late for a lot of things.

1739
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:23,760
And like it's I just I guess I want to be part of a year ago on to everybody.

1740
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,680
The idea that like rather than looking at it is like I put X amount of money

1741
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,560
into Bitcoin with the intention of removing all of that money when it goes up.

1742
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,600
Think of it like just I can spend whatever I have earned.

1743
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,600
So like if you put in 500 and then it goes up to 700, spend the 200

1744
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,120
and then don't spend any of the 500 you initially put in like.

1745
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:48,520
Oh, back on back on the crypto thing.

1746
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,840
There is one. OK, I watch this.

1747
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:57,120
I watch this channel called Clear Value Tax, where where a very dignified

1748
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:03,400
Asian man who is an accountant explains to me how taxes work.

1749
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:10,200
And he made some videos recently recommending this app called KuCoin,

1750
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:14,680
which lets you do things like you can invest in crypto

1751
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:21,440
but then you can like assign your crypto to be like automatically

1752
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,040
lent out to people and repaid to you with interest.

1753
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,200
And and also you can create like a robot that will like automatically trade

1754
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:35,640
cryptos like as the price fluctuates to like generate profit for you.

1755
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:40,840
So I have been like trying to fuck with that a little bit as like an old

1756
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,560
because I didn't I didn't like the experience of investing in stuff.

1757
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,600
And it has failed at me every time.

1758
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,280
But like people say I've heard people say that like, OK, investing

1759
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,440
and holding is one thing and trading is another.

1760
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,720
And it's like a different way to make money with cryptocurrency.

1761
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:59,840
So I put like I put like a hundred dollars into my KuCoin account

1762
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,000
just to like see just to see what it does.

1763
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,760
Actually, it's been in there for like almost a week now.

1764
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,920
Another thing that's very helpful to my

1765
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,920
crypto trading has been that I have a lot of basic attention tokens.

1766
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,880
And I don't know if you guys know about that.

1767
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,560
But I don't know what the fuck that is.

1768
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,600
So do you use Brave browser at all by chance?

1769
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:25,120
OK, well, Brave browser is like a slight chrome,

1770
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,320
but it has a built in ad blockers and and tracker blockers.

1771
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,320
And also it has a crypto wallet that you can activate

1772
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:38,080
where you collect passively a type of crypto token

1773
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:42,880
called basic attention tokens, where if you allow it to like show you ads

1774
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,000
or even just going through web pages, like you slowly collect

1775
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,800
basic attention tokens and then you can spend them on

1776
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:55,640
like creators and stuff who have who are like are signed up for the program.

1777
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,480
So for instance, if you had

1778
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:02,360
like the bat thing set up on your brave, then you go to my YouTube channel,

1779
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,520
there will be a button you can click that allows you to just give me bat.

1780
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,600
I've made a couple hundred dollars worth of bat this way

1781
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,640
that I reinvested into other cryptos.

1782
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,760
So that was a big starting point.

1783
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,760
Literally money that I just got from people

1784
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,480
decided to make their donation via crypto instead of regular money.

1785
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:25,800
I use brave, but I have never understood that stuff.

1786
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,720
Let me do brave is getting so sick into it bats always been dope.

1787
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,640
Did did you or Trixie?

1788
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,040
Did you hear that brave and their last update?

1789
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,680
They just integrated IPFS.

1790
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,880
I don't know what that is.

1791
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,360
That is the Web three thing.

1792
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,360
Remember that shit we were talking about back in 2018?

1793
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,360
They built IPFS into brave.

1794
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,040
So now you can go to IPFS websites directly through.

1795
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,040
Oh, oh, sick.

1796
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,520
Well, that makes that way easier because then we just promote the brave browser

1797
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,840
more and can also make those websites.

1798
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,920
So OK, like Web three.

1799
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:02,480
I'm still following like bat or not bat IPFS and like all that stuff.

1800
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,840
All those kind of things.

1801
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,240
So I keep my finger on that.

1802
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,040
It's getting better at some point.

1803
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,960
You and I were way too far ahead of the curve.

1804
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,800
We just dive into early.

1805
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:16,200
But like, you know, literally five years ahead of maybe like in two years

1806
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:20,040
would be like, yeah, yeah, we're finally there where we need to be to make that shift.

1807
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,240
Because like everyone, it's funny.

1808
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:24,000
You watch like the people like the doing the IPFS presentation.

1809
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,120
They're all talking about what we were talking about in 2018

1810
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,520
about how everything's too centralized.

1811
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,600
It's all bullshit.

1812
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:33,880
I don't know if you've seen the huge push of after Donald Trump got kicked off

1813
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:38,480
Twitter, there was a gigantic wave of all kinds of people, just not even like

1814
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,440
right wingers, just funny accounts.

1815
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,440
Anybody funny on Twitter got like taken down.

1816
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:49,400
Huge mass migration to Mastodon, which is itself a decentralized thing.

1817
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,200
No, it's not even decentralized.

1818
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,360
Instead, it's server based.

1819
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,360
Like you had federated the federated thing.

1820
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,640
Yes, you federate different servers, similarly to Peartube.

1821
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,440
We'll get into all this explanations later, I guess, but some other time.

1822
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:07,720
But yeah, like Dick Masterson immediately set up a Mastodon when all this happened

1823
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:08,720
that started popping off.

1824
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:12,440
And so that's all a fascinating world.

1825
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:16,240
And if if that keeps taking off, I think it'll lead more and more people to

1826
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,960
you got to you got to find the federated net.

1827
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:19,920
That's what we've been calling it.

1828
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,960
It's the federated internet.

1829
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,920
You got to find the right federation because like Mastodon is like when I was

1830
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:29,080
on one of the networks for that, that was when I got banned for saying I was

1831
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,040
crippled because my life was hurt.

1832
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,840
So that was the thing.

1833
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,080
Like, yeah, what even did you do?

1834
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:38,760
You I said I said my because my that was somebody had my leg injury,

1835
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:40,880
which is still, I guess, technically there.

1836
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:43,280
But like, when it was really bad and it's like, yeah, I'm like crippled.

1837
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:43,800
I can't walk.

1838
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:44,880
It's like, you can't say crippled.

1839
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:45,720
That's a slur.

1840
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,560
You're bad.

1841
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,080
OK. Wow.

1842
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,960
I look like even in the context of I am, yeah, they're like, it doesn't matter.

1843
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,240
You can't say that language.

1844
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,600
Well, to be fair, that was a warning.

1845
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:58,560
And then they listened to the procrastinators podcast, listen, and then I got

1846
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:03,080
banned. It's funny you mentioned that because Dick had initially made a

1847
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:06,440
federation called his is called paypig.net.

1848
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:10,280
But then because of the fact that everyone just jumped on there and started

1849
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:14,800
saying the N word over and over again, he made a second one called verify.af for

1850
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:19,880
just people who he could trust to not say the N word all day on his Mastodon server.

1851
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,560
Incredible.

1852
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,160
Hmm. I have OK.

1853
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,960
I have had I bought a hundred dollars worth of US US DT on Kucoin.

1854
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:34,280
It has been auto lending itself for about six days.

1855
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:39,280
It has made 50 cents worth of interest, which does not sound that impressive,

1856
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,600
but but that's in less than a week.

1857
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:47,800
And if I iterate that 52 times for a year, that's a profit of about 30 percent,

1858
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,200
which is a lot.

1859
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,520
But the problem, though, is that like I would have to spend like eight percent

1860
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:58,880
just to like put my money in there, which seems like a lot because they take fees out.

1861
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,360
So this is a nightmare.

1862
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,680
I hate I hate it. I hate numbers.

1863
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,800
I hate now. I'm just dumb.

1864
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,160
I just want to make cool art get rich.

1865
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:10,760
That's that's that's about as complex as my mind.

1866
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,000
That's the thing that's behind me as well.

1867
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,120
Like I don't want to be a money person in order to do all this.

1868
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:19,320
But it's so it's so I mean, because in order to get good at it,

1869
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:21,240
you have to just like, well, I'm not an artist anymore.

1870
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,120
I'm a financial. Here's that's not money.

1871
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,440
I don't think that's true.

1872
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,520
I don't think it's as hard as it seems.

1873
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:27,520
Here's what fucks me up.

1874
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,600
Here's I don't think I'm a person.

1875
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:30,920
I'm an all or nothing person.

1876
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,640
I want to do what is optimal all of the time.

1877
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,280
So if keeping my money doing art, then holy shit, it all.

1878
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,960
If keeping my money as US DT in a Kucoin account,

1879
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:45,600
you know, just for example, if that makes, you know, 30 percent a year,

1880
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,720
then that's objectively better than keeping it in a bank

1881
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,840
that makes like less than one percent a year.

1882
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,400
So it seems like, OK, obviously I should do that.

1883
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:57,160
But like if I put all of my money into US DT on Kucoin, it's like,

1884
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,720
what if that app just fails?

1885
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:02,600
Like what if US DT becomes like what if it was a problem with the tether

1886
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,160
and the currency crashes?

1887
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,280
Like that's that's too risky.

1888
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,480
So it's like, I can't do it.

1889
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,920
I can't make the optimal play here.

1890
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,480
Because we're too scary.

1891
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,000
We don't have enough money to invest.

1892
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,240
To make a substantial return.

1893
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,640
Give us investment capitals.

1894
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:22,880
Well, even if I had a billion dollars podcast, I know you're even if.

1895
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,200
Even if I had a billion dollars, if it was like, OK, well,

1896
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,120
Kucoin can make me 30 percent versus a bank can make me one.

1897
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,440
I would I would want to put all of it in there.

1898
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:34,240
But like still, that would be risking it all.

1899
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,280
And and that's stupid.

1900
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,160
I mean, having it in the dollars, risking it all, because that can crash.

1901
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,960
We all collectively need to start.

1902
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,680
I guess that's the that's the number one thing.

1903
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:46,520
I also like whenever people talk about their fear of like these other coins,

1904
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,760
I'm like, yeah, but the real money is super unstable.

1905
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,000
All right, this is what we do.

1906
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,440
Are you ready? Here's my goal right now.

1907
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,480
That's kind of true.

1908
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,200
But like, you know, at least with the I mean, true, the dollar value

1909
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,080
fluctuates and it can change and it can crash.

1910
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:04,120
But like it has, you know, the only thing that keeps the dollar from crashing

1911
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:07,240
is that the US government just prints more of it.

1912
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,840
Like we're in danger.

1913
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,120
Just print more of it.

1914
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,320
Like, yes.

1915
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,200
I mean, I know.

1916
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,440
I know, I know, but look, but like it makes sense to have a little more faith

1917
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:17,880
that like the dollar isn't going anywhere.

1918
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:18,920
This is what we have to do.

1919
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:21,640
We need to we need we need all the reward and none of the risk.

1920
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,240
So this is how how it's going to go.

1921
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:27,120
All right, we start a second podcast collectively, like the pro investment

1922
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:31,520
podcast, and the way it works is that if you go to the Patreon for that podcast,

1923
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,600
we take that money and we invest all of it.

1924
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,640
And then every week we talk about how the investments are going.

1925
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,600
So we just take our patrons money.

1926
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,840
They pay us for the podcast.

1927
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,160
We pick all the patron money, put it into investments.

1928
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:47,280
And then we just talk about the middle man that is just taking their

1929
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,800
investment, like if it goes to the no, no, no, no, they're they're paying us

1930
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,800
to be the guinea pigs to figure out the strategy so they can take the rest

1931
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,720
of their money and invest it the way we are.

1932
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,360
Yes, that's smart, that's smart.

1933
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,560
Wait, audience.

1934
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,880
So it's like crowdsourced testing on stocks.

1935
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,880
They wouldn't know what's going to happen to their money in our hands

1936
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:07,880
until it happens.

1937
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:08,280
Right.

1938
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:11,200
And so they would need to put the same amount of money that they're giving

1939
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,200
us to to the thing themselves.

1940
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,120
Well, no, here's the thing.

1941
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:14,760
Here's the thing.

1942
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,040
If they just give it to us to invest, then they don't have to worry

1943
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,760
about whether it goes up or down, right?

1944
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,680
They know it's gone.

1945
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:21,960
It's a learning experience.

1946
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,720
They're insulated from that emotional pain.

1947
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:28,120
Basically, like if you were going to invest by yourself, you'd be like,

1948
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,720
well, I need to put like X amount of money into something that I can

1949
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,720
afford to lose to see if anything happens.

1950
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,720
But instead of doing that, instead of doing that learning experience by

1951
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:39,640
yourself, you pay a fraction of that to four idiots on the internet and

1952
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,040
we'll do it for you instead.

1953
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:46,280
But then collectively, we'll have more money so we can make more legitimate

1954
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:50,600
investments and have see how it plays out at scale better than any single one

1955
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:51,800
of us could do individually.

1956
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,920
And then collectively, we can gain a better understanding of the market and

1957
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,160
drive all of our audience to a brighter tomorrow.

1958
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,120
The procrastinators hedge fund.

1959
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,240
Are we building?

1960
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,400
You caught me, you caught me.

1961
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,640
I mean, it makes sense.

1962
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:07,880
It makes sense because like if people are pledging to something like that, then

1963
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,840
like they have a little bit of stake in like knowing like, how are these investments

1964
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:16,200
going to do on a rock and then they tune in and hear us say like, OK, well, the

1965
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,000
part we put in Bitcoin, you know, it went up.

1966
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,960
The stuff we put in Ethereum is state stable.

1967
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,000
The stuff we put in GameStop went down.

1968
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,920
So we're going to move it here.

1969
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:23,600
We're going to move this.

1970
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,240
We're going to change the percentages here and here.

1971
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:31,000
I'm just thinking about how if like if my $100 in Bitcoin is now worth $500,

1972
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:36,120
then if I had put the 30 grand of Radcon in there, that would now be worth.

1973
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,200
Oh, I think about 150 grand.

1974
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,160
I think about even my Dogecoin.

1975
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,240
I could put all my money into Dogecoin.

1976
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,520
I would have imagined.

1977
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:49,160
Imagine how much we can make to do more radcons with if you just.

1978
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:54,440
So I think the best plan of action would be to to get this investment capital.

1979
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:59,480
Put it into something that grows because that's, you know, we can do that.

1980
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,840
You can just play on that, make that happen.

1981
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:09,400
Get all that extra money by a weed store and have that as the ground base.

1982
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,760
The operation that people that anybody who just needs a job that we know can work at.

1983
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:18,760
And then we get a literal growth market where we grow the weed.

1984
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:21,440
Yes. And then we also get free weed.

1985
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,400
It'll be perfect.

1986
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,680
Dude, what if we just had our own country, the pro country?

1987
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,480
That's what I'm trying to.

1988
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,200
That's where I'm heading with podcast.

1989
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,600
That's why PCP HQ is too small thinking.

1990
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,400
We need to go big.

1991
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:38,160
Yeah, I want to have all of the things that you can possibly have under the brand PCP.

1992
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,520
There you go.

1993
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,320
We'll have our own PCP broad brand.

1994
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,120
Interbrinton hit.

1995
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,680
God, no, no data caps.

1996
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,960
We can bully concuss.

1997
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:53,120
We'll invest so well that we'll become more powerful and concuss.

1998
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:57,760
We'll have nukes and then we'll declare war on concuss headquarters.

1999
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:04,480
How far away do you think we are until like warfare is waged between corporations and not countries?

2000
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,280
It already is.

2001
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:06,560
But like open.

2002
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,440
They'll never be open war again.

2003
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,200
Kind of already is.

2004
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,800
There's open war right now.

2005
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:13,440
No.

2006
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:14,160
Where?

2007
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,760
In like Afghanistan.

2008
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,720
With who?

2009
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,520
Between who?

2010
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,840
With we're still in Afghanistan.

2011
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:20,800
Are we fighting though?

2012
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,080
Are we like shooting stuff?

2013
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,480
Yes.

2014
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,040
I don't know what we're doing, but we're occupying it.

2015
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:28,400
I'm sure Joe's getting those drones ready to go right now.

2016
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,920
He's like picking up where his bro left.

2017
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,960
Fortnite is not a real, Fortnite is real.

2018
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,320
You zap into Fortnite and you're actually controlling a robot that's in Afghanistan

2019
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,480
and it's copying your movements exactly.

2020
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,000
And everything you do in Fortnite is in real life.

2021
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,520
Victory Royale just bodies strewn everywhere in the Middle East.

2022
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:51,440
I just think that the reality is we are already living in Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

2023
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,360
It's like already real.

2024
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,960
Like it's not the future.

2025
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:55,520
It's just now.

2026
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:58,080
We're like Metal Gear Solid 2 at this point.

2027
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,040
You know, like the Patriots.

2028
01:38:59,040 --> 01:38:59,760
Where's mine?

2029
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,720
I think we're past that.

2030
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,880
I feel like Metal Gear Solid 2 is in the 2000s.

2031
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,680
Like we're already in the next stage.

2032
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,880
Just most people haven't proceeded.

2033
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,920
Well, I think we're probably closer to Metal Gear Solid 4 than Rising.

2034
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,240
We don't have cyborg bodies yet, unfortunately.

2035
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:15,040
Does that mean Death Stranding is in our future?

2036
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:15,200
Yeah.

2037
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,560
Death Stranding is Metal Gear Solid 6.

2038
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,280
They never told you that.

2039
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,280
Those don't actually take place in the same universe.

2040
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,320
I highly doubt it.

2041
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,360
It's not the universe thing.

2042
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,560
It's the Kojima effect.

2043
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,800
If he's so good at predicting what's going to happen.

2044
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,440
They all do take place in the same world.

2045
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,040
The real world that we are in.

2046
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,320
They all actually happened.

2047
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,160
It's all documentary from the future.

2048
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,240
Even the ones that contradict each other.

2049
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,040
Gotcha.

2050
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:39,280
Yeah.

2051
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,040
I mean, the world contradicts itself all the time.

2052
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,400
We've learned a lot today.

2053
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,280
I learned how to make the big bucks.

2054
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:52,160
Wow.

2055
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:53,840
Do we want to go to voicemails?

2056
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,040
I guess.

2057
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,240
Had to happen eventually.

2058
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,240
Had to happen eventually.

2059
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:58,640
Okay.

2060
01:39:58,640 --> 01:39:59,840
I've been gone for a while.

2061
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,280
Have the voicemails gotten any better?

2062
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,640
Has there been a golden age of voicemails in 2021?

2063
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:06,240
The great thing about the voicemails now

2064
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,000
is that they're all addressed to Ben.

2065
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,840
Because he's the only person anyone could expect to be there.

2066
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,520
That's somewhat true.

2067
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,880
Ben is usually funnier to talk about.

2068
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,200
The, okay, last week there was a bit of a kerfuffle

2069
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:25,360
because a certain individual named Tommy Jay

2070
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,120
was sending too many voicemails.

2071
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,120
And then they sent one that really pushed me over the edge

2072
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:30,240
and I got really upset.

2073
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,880
And I want to acknowledge that Tommy Jay probably

2074
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,200
had not heard all of the,

2075
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:40,240
because of the delay between recording and uploading.

2076
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:45,040
He had not heard the second episode in which I said like,

2077
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,000
okay, funny joke, but enough's enough.

2078
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,600
No, it's not funny anymore.

2079
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,320
So, you know, it wasn't entirely their fault

2080
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,760
that I got so upset.

2081
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,440
However, I will be honoring my promise

2082
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,280
to never play a Tommy Jay email again.

2083
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,920
That much has not changed.

2084
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:03,280
But I want to say, look at how funny,

2085
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,400
funny misunderstanding.

2086
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:06,320
But fuck you anyway.

2087
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,520
Are you guys on speak pipe?

2088
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,080
No.

2089
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,600
I'll be there in one.

2090
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,680
Can you, can you, can you pull up speak?

2091
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:16,160
I guess I could just upload them to Discord

2092
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,040
if you want me to.

2093
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,400
Sure, yeah.

2094
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,440
I don't know how to.

2095
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:20,080
Where's the link?

2096
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,560
I will, I will just put, I'll just put the fucking things.

2097
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,760
Where did I, where did I save them to?

2098
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:28,880
Here we go.

2099
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:30,720
All right.

2100
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:34,640
The first one is called, where did I put it?

2101
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:40,880
First one is called, it is number two, seven, 18, two.

2102
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:41,760
Here we go.

2103
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,800
First one is called, no Nate, dot, dot, dot, dot.

2104
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:45,920
All right.

2105
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:46,480
Here we go.

2106
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:49,120
Three, two, one, go.

2107
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,280
Another episode without Nate, huh?

2108
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,360
You know what that means?

2109
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,360
No Nate, no not.

2110
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,400
True.

2111
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,360
Oh, I should say, but so last episode we talked about wanting to

2112
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:14,240
do some funny rebranding for the new era and I was going to make a new banner

2113
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:21,440
and I will have made a new banner for the channel by the time this episode goes up.

2114
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:28,320
But it will already be out of date because I was going to make a joke banner about,

2115
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:35,360
it was going to be me and Gib pointing backwards at the gravestone with the PCP logo on it and

2116
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,240
laughing about it.

2117
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:41,680
But it's already an obsolete joke because now there's four people on this episode.

2118
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,000
So I'm still going to do that.

2119
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,720
I'm still going to do that even though it's already pointless.

2120
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:49,920
Sick.

2121
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,280
Glad I ruined that for you.

2122
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:58,240
But we said we will, if anyone wants to submit anything or send us anything,

2123
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,080
use this, we still might do that.

2124
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,200
Help us brand our channel.

2125
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:09,360
Okay, the next one is called a do apology.

2126
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,080
And there it is.

2127
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,640
Three, two, one, go.

2128
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,720
I'm sorry about the last voicemail.

2129
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:19,600
I was only being a Nate had ironically.

2130
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,160
Yeah, yeah.

2131
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,520
Everyone's a Nate had ironically at first.

2132
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:27,040
But then always.

2133
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,400
And the disease sets him.

2134
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:31,600
That's how it starts.

2135
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:38,480
Okay, the next one is just called a Janess J N E S.

2136
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,880
So three, two, one, go.

2137
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,800
When best guy ever hears a voicemail from Tommy J.

2138
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,320
Yes, I understand this one.

2139
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,120
Oh, there's nothing to it.

2140
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:01,440
Okay.

2141
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:06,320
Well, why would Nate respond that way?

2142
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,200
Wait, what was that music from?

2143
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:09,600
I know it.

2144
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,160
Kill Bill.

2145
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:11,680
Okay.

2146
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:13,040
Okay.

2147
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:17,280
So it's the idea that if Nate heard a voicemail from Tommy J that he would hunt

2148
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,560
him down and kill him.

2149
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,680
Is that the implication?

2150
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:23,600
He would have a thirst for revenge, boiling his blood, reddening his vision.

2151
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,400
I will do that.

2152
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,320
I will do that personally.

2153
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,040
Next one is called.

2154
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,600
Easy to confuse the two.

2155
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:35,440
That would be so, that would make me really mad if.

2156
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:40,800
Next one is called Cody three, two, one, go.

2157
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,640
Ben, it's not racist.

2158
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,840
It's really good.

2159
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:46,960
It's not racist.

2160
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,960
What does that mean?

2161
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:53,600
He's implying that you're pretending that you said something that you were like,

2162
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,440
it's not resused about that was a thing.

2163
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,680
There was a thing a couple episodes ago.

2164
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:04,880
I think the NE words, the ha ha word.

2165
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,960
You know, the mean Ben.

2166
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,720
I'm right about that.

2167
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,080
I'm right about that.

2168
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:12,400
Yeah.

2169
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,600
I don't really care, but.

2170
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,200
Man, it's so nice being away for so long.

2171
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:22,800
I'll die on this hill and every attempt to argue against me is in complete bad faith.

2172
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,960
I haven't heard a good one yet, including yours.

2173
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:25,360
Fuck you.

2174
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,560
That wasn't even an argument.

2175
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,080
That was just a guy making noises.

2176
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:28,720
Oh, you're like.

2177
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:29,600
Fuck you.

2178
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,280
You're arguing in bad faith.

2179
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:31,680
Okay.

2180
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:32,240
I'm sorry.

2181
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:41,600
Next one is called the human guitar, the human guitar, the human guitar, the human guitar.

2182
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,360
Three, two, one, go.

2183
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:26,160
Oh, this is epic.

2184
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,760
This is funny.

2185
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,560
Is this guy a part of the league of Nate fuckers?

2186
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:39,920
He is.

2187
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:40,800
I knew it.

2188
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,360
I knew it.

2189
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:53,760
All right.

2190
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,960
Oh, God, it just keeps going.

2191
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,920
Okay, funny noise make me go live.

2192
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,120
I'm so bad.

2193
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,080
Tom and Trixie.

2194
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,160
Tom and Trixie, you are out of the loop.

2195
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:11,680
But last episode, last episode, we were introduced to the league of Nate fuckers.

2196
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:19,040
All of the worst, all of the worst and most heinous PCP villains, them snakes and

2197
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:26,400
a cluster punk kitchen at Al were joined with some freaks like the man with a thousand lones.

2198
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:33,040
Everybody's ever used a crazy poise modulator in the league of Nate fuckers and even some new ones.

2199
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,080
They're all going to fuck Nate.

2200
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:37,680
If I was this Nate, I would be building a moat around my house.

2201
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:43,360
If I was Nate, I would invest in Bitcoin now because Fiat currency isn't going to protect him

2202
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:46,080
from the league of Nate fuckers.

2203
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:54,320
Okay, the next one is also called human guitar, human guitar, human guitar, human guitar,

2204
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,640
three, three, two, one, go.

2205
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,640
It's for guillotine.

2206
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,000
I'm sorry.

2207
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,680
I deserve you deserve better.

2208
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:25,840
You deserve better than the PCP.

2209
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,440
Why?

2210
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:42,000
I can hear myself being speech jammed.

2211
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,880
I am being speech jammed at this moment.

2212
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,240
It is painful.

2213
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:49,760
Okay.

2214
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,120
I like the human guitar.

2215
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:56,560
I'm going to dig a trench under my house and live in it.

2216
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:02,800
It's like, you know, a new Minecraft mode with a scary aura to it.

2217
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:03,920
It makes this sound.

2218
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,200
The next voicemail is called veggie pilled.

2219
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,920
Three, two, one, go.

2220
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:16,320
Are they supposed to be God's chosen people?

2221
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,760
That's what the Bible says.

2222
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:21,600
Oh, I bet they always followed God's directions.

2223
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:24,000
You'd think so.

2224
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:28,320
Is that from VeggieTales?

2225
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,720
Yeah, it sounds like it, but I don't know what the point was.

2226
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:31,920
Did you?

2227
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,040
It's a funny clip, I guess.

2228
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:40,160
Did I just hallucinate that time that the VeggieTales guys said that the vegetables

2229
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:41,840
in VeggieTales don't have souls?

2230
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:46,160
No, we learned that during a heckles for shekels.

2231
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:48,560
Somebody was in the call with us talking about it.

2232
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,000
Right, right.

2233
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,040
They don't have souls.

2234
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,240
Why do they care about God?

2235
01:49:53,680 --> 01:50:00,720
It's literally like they feel they want to save those who can be saved,

2236
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:04,880
even though they can't, because they're not God's chosen and they don't have souls.

2237
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:12,560
What kind of a God would make his most ardent followers unable to be saved?

2238
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:18,960
So they put on this 3D vegetable puppet show as themselves acting out roles.

2239
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:23,360
It's like, boy, I wish I had a soul so I could watch this as a kid and become a Christian.

2240
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,080
Is that a metaphor for the people who did VeggieTales?

2241
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:27,840
They've just done so much evil in the past that they feel they will be saved.

2242
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:31,040
So they're just literally vegetables.

2243
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:35,760
They're in a vegetative state and somehow can make a show as well.

2244
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,200
There's too much for me to handle right now.

2245
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:42,560
The next voicemail is called The Truth About Mage.

2246
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,480
Three, two, one, go.

2247
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,000
Mage is just purple nepeta.

2248
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:49,600
Discuss.

2249
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2250
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:53,920
I don't know who that is.

2251
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,960
Yeah, nepeta is a homestuck troll.

2252
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,840
Nepeta is green mage.

2253
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,320
Just think of green mage and you'll understand nepeta.

2254
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,120
Just green mage.

2255
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:04,320
Sure, I guess that makes sense.

2256
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:10,880
Next one is called Sonicoo 102 When Ben, When Is It Happen?

2257
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,400
It is three, two, one, go.

2258
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:20,000
Sonicoo 102 When Ben, When Is It Happen?

2259
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:26,480
Yeah, I've already said I gotta do another thing before I release it,

2260
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:26,880
but I will say.

2261
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:29,440
How many layers deep are you in distractions?

2262
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:30,800
Sounds like a lot.

2263
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,320
You put 100 hours into a video game before finishing Sonicoo, so.

2264
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:39,520
Okay, to be fair, most of that was spread out

2265
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,120
for a while.

2266
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:43,760
Not anymore, though.

2267
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,280
That doesn't make it any better.

2268
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:46,880
That's been about the last...

2269
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,880
Noida has been most of the last two days of my life.

2270
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,920
Think of what you could have done with those 100 hours.

2271
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:55,920
I will exhaust it.

2272
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:57,520
Oh, fuck you.

2273
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,840
What could you have done with the time that you spent,

2274
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,800
I don't know, what's something you like that's stupid?

2275
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:09,600
I mean, to be fair, I fucking berate myself every evening before I go to bed

2276
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,680
thinking about how instead of watching Ultraman,

2277
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:13,360
I could have made the next Ultraman.

2278
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,320
I think about that all the time.

2279
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:15,120
Exactly.

2280
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:18,000
So, I'm only holding you up to my standards.

2281
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,120
I also fail to be.

2282
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,520
You gotta get into a weekend situation where you're allowing weekends to be video games

2283
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:29,600
to constantly non-stop, and then you do things on the week.

2284
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:33,760
I can't let the man define my life like that.

2285
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:37,120
When I try and schedule things out and keep the weekend free,

2286
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,120
it's like, no, too many things will happen.

2287
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:41,120
I can't let the man define my life like that.

2288
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:43,120
I can't let the man define my life like that.

2289
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:47,600
When I try and schedule things out and keep the weekend free,

2290
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:50,640
it's like, no, too many things will slip if I don't do things on the weekend,

2291
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:54,480
and then I collapse under my own schedule.

2292
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,400
The weekend is just two days.

2293
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,720
You could flip them.

2294
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:04,240
I'm just saying, seriously delineate the time between,

2295
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:07,840
I can fuck around to I am supposed to be doing stuff,

2296
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,920
and stuff will get done more often.

2297
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:12,640
Yeah, I know you're right.

2298
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,400
I know that you're right.

2299
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,360
But I hate it.

2300
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,360
Yeah, unfortunately, I'm in the same boat.

2301
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,360
I'm just too shitty of a person.

2302
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:27,360
With regards to, before anybody asks on the next voicemail, the Brony lecture,

2303
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:33,360
I'm either going to have to record a whole fucking bunch of extra shell stuff to put around it,

2304
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:34,400
or just redo it.

2305
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,400
So that's why I haven't finished it.

2306
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,400
What purpose?

2307
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,400
Addendums to it?

2308
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,400
Addendums?

2309
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:47,840
Not so much because I was wrong, but that I just don't like the tone of the lecture at all.

2310
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:54,400
It was, the sentimentality of it is very over it.

2311
01:53:54,400 --> 01:54:03,520
Very like, I was trying to get the last anger I had out about the whole thing or something like that.

2312
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:09,360
Why don't you just, I mean, why don't you just maybe put an addendum at the beginning?

2313
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:10,400
That's what I mean.

2314
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:14,400
There would be a reframing, and I'd have to add in a bunch of shit, too.

2315
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:18,400
So I just missed a lot of stuff that I would have wanted, but I don't think it's that good.

2316
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,400
You'd have to, though.

2317
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:24,400
Yes, because it's not, first of all, I just don't even like it.

2318
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:30,400
I would rather redo it, but if it could be salvaged, I'd just build a framework around it.

2319
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:38,400
Why not just, I mean, yeah, put an addendum if you're like,

2320
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:40,480
I don't agree with everything I said in this one.

2321
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,000
I don't like the tone of it.

2322
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,040
I don't know, just release it.

2323
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,560
It's like a historical artifact.

2324
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:48,640
I mean, you don't have to stand by everything that you said.

2325
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:53,280
I mean, granted, remember, I am about to just literally take everything I've made off the Internet.

2326
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:59,200
So like, to me, not much sense in putting that thing up when everything else is gone, you know?

2327
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,520
I want it, though.

2328
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,640
I mean, with that, I can send it to you.

2329
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,560
The state it's in.

2330
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,880
It has about 15 minutes of highly edited part at the beginning and then the rest, so.

2331
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:15,680
I mean, okay, what's...

2332
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:20,640
It just kind of sounds like you've fallen down a hole with it where,

2333
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:24,480
if things continue as they go, they will simply never come to light.

2334
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:32,320
I think it's, yeah, it's sort of like the way I had initially made it.

2335
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:36,000
I mean, even just when I got home with it, I was editing the fuck out of it

2336
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,920
to make it like very different feeling from how it like,

2337
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,960
and to add lots of visual reference into the stuff I'm talking about.

2338
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:48,400
But like, it's kind of disorganized and like, I don't know,

2339
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,720
I guess I just wouldn't explain it the same way.

2340
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:57,760
Like, just in general, the approach I took, I think that it didn't come out how I thought it would,

2341
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:00,000
like when I created the board, you know what I mean?

2342
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:00,640
Here's...

2343
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,440
Sure, yes.

2344
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:04,720
I understand, but here's what I think.

2345
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:09,600
I think that, yeah, maybe, I mean, you wouldn't explain it the same way now,

2346
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,040
but at the time, that was how you would explain it.

2347
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,720
That's how you did explain it.

2348
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:19,280
And I don't, and like, I don't know, if you wanted to re-explain it, you could just make a,

2349
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:22,240
I mean, you could, you could, you could redo it if you wanted to,

2350
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:24,960
and that wouldn't preclude like putting out the original.

2351
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,960
Even if it's like, disclaimed with like a, you know,

2352
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:31,120
this isn't how I feel about certain things anymore.

2353
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:32,400
Right.

2354
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:34,880
I just kind of like being able to see it again.

2355
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:39,280
I'm trying to encourage you, I'm trying to encourage you to release it in some form.

2356
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,760
And I mean, you don't have to, but...

2357
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:48,720
You did that great big weed thing right at the beginning, it was incredible.

2358
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:52,160
I mean, you might, you might not like it for whatever reason, and that's fine,

2359
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:55,760
but like, I remember enjoying it at the time.

2360
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,200
I feel like, I feel like people would enjoy it for what it is,

2361
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:01,120
even if you've changed your mind on it at the time.

2362
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,280
That's what I think.

2363
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,200
I'm sure, I, I do agree.

2364
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:07,200
I think people would enjoy it for what it is.

2365
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,760
I don't enjoy it for what it is though.

2366
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,520
Like, I, I look at it as like, I can, I can watch,

2367
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:16,720
I guess I feel that way about a lot of my videos, like, yeah, they're good,

2368
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:20,400
but they're just like boring or wrong, or like, I don't care.

2369
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,560
So that's why, like, you know...

2370
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,840
But so what though?

2371
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,480
But so what?

2372
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,720
You don't have to stand by any of it.

2373
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:28,160
That's true.

2374
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:31,520
I mean, that's why everybody, I mean, other people can re-upload all my shit.

2375
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,840
Dude, what if we just put it on the PCP channel?

2376
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,920
Well, all my videos, yeah.

2377
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:39,120
No, not all, well, it's a lot of videos, but like, the lecture,

2378
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:39,680
because it's supposed to be you.

2379
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,840
I kind of expect that's where it would have been.

2380
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,800
Yeah, that's what I thought.

2381
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:43,680
Okay.

2382
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:45,200
Probably.

2383
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:47,120
I don't know.

2384
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:51,920
I, I, I might still finish it, but I would much rather just redo it and do it better.

2385
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,960
Um, get it as a trial run.

2386
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,120
That's such a, that's such a trap though.

2387
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,320
That's such a trap.

2388
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:02,000
That's like, it is what it is and you can't be redone.

2389
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,760
It happened, it happened in a very specific context that can never be replicated.

2390
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:06,800
Sure.

2391
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,240
I mean, it wouldn't be the same thing.

2392
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:10,160
I would just do a different Brony lecture.

2393
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:13,040
Like, that one's just, you just never get to see it.

2394
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:14,400
Lost media, you know.

2395
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:16,720
But it's got all of us there.

2396
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:18,080
It's got Jesse and Munchy.

2397
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,840
Uh, I don't think those two are going to come.

2398
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,680
Come to like my, well, actually maybe they might come to a rack on five.

2399
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:26,160
I don't know.

2400
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:32,560
Munchy more likely than Jesse, but that was like a big Brony moment.

2401
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,000
That was a brohoof moment.

2402
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:34,880
I liked it.

2403
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:35,840
Yeah.

2404
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:39,520
Well, I'm sure I can salvage parts of it.

2405
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:43,040
Like to throw in, to sprinkle throughout or something.

2406
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:45,280
What?

2407
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:49,840
I'm so like sprinkled throughout a longer, like second lecture.

2408
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:50,560
You know what I mean?

2409
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:55,920
Like, like if I did another one, I could incorporate parts of the original into it.

2410
01:58:56,640 --> 01:59:01,520
I, I don't see, do you even want to do a second one?

2411
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,240
Uh, I'd be interested.

2412
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:07,840
I mean, like I could, I think I would do a better job.

2413
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:15,360
Uh, I think I, I feel like a second one is like, I mean, if you could, if you wanted to,

2414
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:20,880
but like wouldn't it make more sense as like a, a second like rebuttal to the first one?

2415
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:26,160
Like wouldn't having the first one exist, make a second one make sense?

2416
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:31,440
And with it, like without that, like without the first one, the second one is like, what's it,

2417
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,320
what is it even about?

2418
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:34,880
I don't know.

2419
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,040
The same thing except better done.

2420
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:39,040
I don't hear.

2421
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:39,440
All right.

2422
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,840
I'm just, I'm, I don't think it would be better done.

2423
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,720
You might like it more, but I don't think a redo would be better.

2424
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:46,480
It would just be a different thing.

2425
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:48,000
Okay.

2426
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:48,880
That's fair enough.

2427
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,180
Yeah.

2428
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,480
Uh, all right.

2429
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:56,560
Next voicemail, uh, is called, uh, where did I put it?

2430
01:59:56,560 --> 02:00:02,320
It is called deja vu, but it's relevant this time and I already put it in the chat.

2431
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,080
Three, two, one, go.

2432
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:08,480
Gip, you were talking in previous episodes about how Picross is really cool, except it

2433
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:12,400
sucks sometimes at the very end when the board just happens to not be solvable and you're forced

2434
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:13,040
to take a guess.

2435
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,920
Um, I've had that same experience with Minesweeper and honestly, like, I know I've called in,

2436
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,240
like, a meme-y way about this before, but from the way that you talk about Picross,

2437
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:28,160
I feel like you would also really enjoy Minesweeper and Minesweeper.online has a no guessing mode

2438
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:31,120
where the board is guaranteed to be solvable every time.

2439
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:34,880
So, uh, yeah, I recommend that you go try checking that out because I think you would

2440
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:35,520
really enjoy it.

2441
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:37,360
That's Minesweeper.online.

2442
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:41,600
It also has like quests and stuff where it has like different goals with like, oh,

2443
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:46,960
try to solve it efficiently with like as few clicks as possible or try to solve it quickly,

2444
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:51,600
like, in the quickest time possible, stuff like that, if you want to like spice it up.

2445
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:56,320
So, uh, yeah, I think go try and do, uh, yeah.

2446
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,640
I have played Minesweeper before.

2447
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:04,640
The only thing I don't like about it, as opposed to Picross, is the default game mode

2448
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:09,360
involves a timer to determine your score and I hate being pressured for time.

2449
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:17,200
I would rather like sit at a puzzle for like three hours trying to figure it out than like

2450
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:24,560
fail at rushing it and like, like, I would, I would sit at a, like a Picross, like a 25 by 25.

2451
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:29,440
I've gotten bigger with the, with the Picross puzzles because I managed to do them correctly

2452
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:34,960
and I was so fucking psyched when I did and I just keep the, on the Picross dot something

2453
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:40,960
site, you can just go to like 30 by 30 and I'm working my way up to that and it's so

2454
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:45,200
satisfying when I figure out one of those huge things with no mistakes.

2455
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:51,840
Um, Minesweeper, I guess I could try it as long as it, like the timer just annoys me

2456
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:54,880
because it's like, I don't want to be, I don't want to feel like I'm rushing.

2457
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,200
I want to take as long as is necessary.

2458
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,680
Isn't this the same guy, didn't this guy recommend us some other like,

2459
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:03,840
play some game on a, on a website?

2460
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:10,800
I think specifically he was recommending like,

2461
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:14,800
a site that lets you play Minesweeper in certain modes that like,

2462
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,720
would help with the issues you had with it.

2463
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,240
That's what it seemed like he was explaining.

2464
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:24,960
Was there, was this, was this guy like doing more like Minesweeper Apollogia before I,

2465
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:28,000
this feels like it's revisiting a previous voicemail.

2466
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:28,640
That's what I mean.

2467
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:32,400
I think he was saying, oh this website allows you to play in modes that would get rid of

2468
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:35,120
the things that you had as a problem with Minesweeper.

2469
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:36,160
I died in two.

2470
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,280
I do, I died in two.

2471
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:39,120
Fuck this, sucks.

2472
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:39,520
Well what?

2473
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,280
I'm on my second round right now.

2474
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,040
God damn it.

2475
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,920
Well, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not indulging in this.

2476
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:49,440
I'm not gonna humor this.

2477
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:53,920
Next voicemail is called more like Mr. Poop.

2478
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,480
Wait, didn't you, didn't you post two?

2479
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:57,920
Huh?

2480
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,920
There's one that's 48 seconds that we didn't play.

2481
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,640
Oh god, you're right.

2482
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:04,880
Yeah, okay, play the last one, not this one I just posted.

2483
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,120
Yeah, yeah, the 48 seconds one.

2484
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:09,120
It's called more like Mr. Poop.

2485
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:10,560
Three, two, one, go.

2486
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:15,200
Also, the problem with the ending of Mr. Boop is just that the themes aren't interesting.

2487
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,480
Like, oh it was building up to how escapist fantasies are bad the whole time.

2488
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:22,800
What, you don't need to explain to me that thinking you're married to Betty Boop is unhealthy.

2489
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,720
That was the joke from the very beginning.

2490
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:27,760
The appeal of early Mr. Boop was the absurdity of its presentation,

2491
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:31,520
the absurdity of the universe, the way that lore is getting dynamically generated

2492
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:34,960
as Alec improvises new ways to insert different characters.

2493
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:37,200
Like, that's what was so interesting about it.

2494
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:40,240
And once it becomes this meta thing that's all in the guy's head,

2495
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:43,200
it just totally deflates all of that intrigue.

2496
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:47,360
Doing something like that feels like the obvious route to ending a story

2497
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:51,440
that involves a bunch of different characters from different franchises like this.

2498
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,280
And it ends up not saying anything.

2499
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:56,160
The only appeal is that it is meta.

2500
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:59,200
And so it just ends up being unsatisfying for those reasons.

2501
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,880
I completely agree.

2502
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:04,640
Yeah, I couldn't articulate it, but yeah, it's a very good way, putting it.

2503
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:11,840
Yeah, it's, I mean, on the one hand, I think, yeah, the real intrigue was like the,

2504
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:18,160
all the weird, like, the weird jokes and like the non sequiturs and like the twists and turns

2505
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:20,640
and like the new characters that would be introduced.

2506
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:23,840
Like that was what made it funny and that was what made it interesting.

2507
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:28,240
So really, like there is no like ending you could do with that.

2508
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:32,880
That would like not fail to have that element to it, I guess.

2509
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:37,600
But yeah, like the last, the last arc, the fourth arc,

2510
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:41,200
the fourth chapter doesn't really have that because it's, it's, you know, it's,

2511
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:46,480
it's building to the climax, which is really not what made the comic funny.

2512
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:47,920
So yeah, I totally agree.

2513
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,600
Let's go, good, good voicemail.

2514
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:56,320
Next one is called Kringus Bingus Six.

2515
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:58,800
Yes, three, two, one, go.

2516
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:01,840
Hey, everybody, it's Kringus Bingus.

2517
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,280
Yay, it's Kringus Bingus.

2518
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:08,160
Normally I record these in my car when I'm driving around,

2519
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:12,480
but this week I can't do that and that ties into my Kring for this week

2520
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,640
because my car isn't working.

2521
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:20,640
It's too cold or something and the battery isn't charged, I guess.

2522
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:25,040
I don't know, but I Kringed about that real hard when I had to go somewhere

2523
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,960
and then my car wouldn't work.

2524
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,560
Yeah, yeah, agreed.

2525
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,880
And what I binged at, what I binged, not what I binged at, silly,

2526
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:36,000
you, I Kring at things and I binged things.

2527
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,600
The thing I binged, I've been watching so much adventure time.

2528
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:44,480
I've been watching like, I watch like four and a half

2529
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,720
seasons of adventure time in like a week.

2530
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,240
It's pretty crazy.

2531
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:49,600
Less than, yeah, like a week.

2532
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:52,880
It's almost as much time as I've spent playing Moida.

2533
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,400
It's been pretty good.

2534
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,600
It's a really good show.

2535
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:56,560
I really like it.

2536
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:57,440
Yeah.

2537
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:02,400
Also, I just, if I can be serious for a moment,

2538
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:09,040
Kringus Bingus has kind of been in a rough patch in their life.

2539
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:09,840
Not Kringus, no.

2540
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,760
And I would just like to say thank you for having me on the show

2541
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:17,840
and, you know, having such a positive reaction to me.

2542
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:18,800
Kringus Bingus.

2543
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,640
And it's really brought a lot of light in my life.

2544
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:21,760
We love you, Kringus.

2545
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,760
It helps me that I can help you.

2546
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:26,320
So yeah, Kringus Bingus out.

2547
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:27,120
Goodbye, guys.

2548
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:27,760
Goodbye.

2549
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:29,040
Kringus Bingus loves you.

2550
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:29,680
Kringus.

2551
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:31,280
Yeah, we love you, Kringus Bingus.

2552
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:32,880
We love you too, Kringus Bingus.

2553
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:37,920
This is my first Kringus Bingus exposure, but I am so far impressed.

2554
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,160
Kringus Bingus is an institution.

2555
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:44,320
Yeah, I very much prefer Kring to a Kring.

2556
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,560
Honestly, Kring is Kring.

2557
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:52,400
Oh, God.

2558
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:53,040
Fuck yeah.

2559
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,680
Another masterpiece voicemail, another joyful visit from Kringus Bingus.

2560
02:06:57,680 --> 02:06:58,400
We've been blessed.

2561
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,160
Next one is called, I don't know how to pronounce it,

2562
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:10,160
Bwertkwap, B-W-R-T-C-U-O-O-P, number one.

2563
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:11,760
Here we go.

2564
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:14,160
Three, two, one, go.

2565
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,360
Eleazar, you're my boy.

2566
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:19,600
I need you to do me a small favor.

2567
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:24,880
What I need is a jingle, because it's Ben's weekly reminder to catch up on one piece.

2568
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:25,360
God damn it.

2569
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:27,200
Ladies and gentlemen, Ben, please catch up on one piece.

2570
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:27,600
Thank you.

2571
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:27,840
Bye.

2572
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:31,760
Okay, I should really do that.

2573
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,880
Gabe, how's one piece going?

2574
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:38,000
Uh, how far back are you?

2575
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:38,800
What's going on?

2576
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:45,360
I am at, I'm like kind of near the beginning of Wano.

2577
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:48,400
I think like I just saw spoilers, by the way.

2578
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:52,320
I just saw Kido's Dragon Form.

2579
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:54,720
Oh, you're really early.

2580
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:56,800
Yeah, there's a lot of this happening.

2581
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:00,240
At the moment, there's, it's big fight moment right now.

2582
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:02,240
There's a lot of big fights going on.

2583
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:03,920
A lot of big people involved.

2584
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,000
It's very epic.

2585
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,760
There's a lot of big people in one piece.

2586
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,200
They are.

2587
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:09,840
They're huge.

2588
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:10,720
It's pretty big.

2589
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:11,440
It's pretty big.

2590
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,000
It's big in its scale size and girth.

2591
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:18,800
It's, it's, it's an acronym.

2592
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:23,280
B-W-R-T-C-U-O-O-P, Ben's weekly reminder to catch up on one piece.

2593
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,160
Got it, got it.

2594
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:28,880
Well, if I catch up on one piece, then this segment will end.

2595
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:30,320
So no need for a jingle.

2596
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:37,040
Next voicemail is called Nine Year Old Anime Huge Titties Episode Two.

2597
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:38,640
Nice.

2598
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:40,000
I don't remember an episode one.

2599
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:41,440
I remember.

2600
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:45,440
It was, it was the, the, it was that, that one anime.

2601
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:47,280
That one infamous one.

2602
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,320
I remember.

2603
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,000
Three, two, one, go.

2604
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:54,080
I went ahead and researched the show with the big tid nine year old girl.

2605
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:57,280
It's called Hinako Note and the girl's name is Ruriko.

2606
02:08:57,280 --> 02:09:01,840
And I was not hallucinating when she gets introduced in like episode four

2607
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,200
and she gets knocked over and sprawls out on the floor.

2608
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:06,320
We know it's not a hallucination.

2609
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:11,200
The animators like took loving detail and accentuating the form of her

2610
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:14,480
like well-developed nine year old body.

2611
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:15,200
Yes, I know.

2612
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:22,320
So I think these guys are like the, what is it called, pedophile virtuosos or whatever.

2613
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,480
So these guys are the heroes.

2614
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,320
This is a stupid voicemail because we literally said all the same stuff.

2615
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:28,400
Not enough porn of her on the internet.

2616
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:30,400
Dumb, useless.

2617
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:33,840
I think he's saying that he remembers it and he found an image,

2618
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:36,880
but now he's got him rewashed it and he's just saying it again.

2619
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,600
Great.

2620
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:40,000
Okay.

2621
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:46,640
Next voicemail is called No Nut Nate based three, there it is.

2622
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:48,160
Three, two, one, go.

2623
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:54,000
You ever go back and listen to old PCP episodes

2624
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:05,520
and hear Nate go on weird Ayn Rand rants and like just say a whole bunch of like cringy,

2625
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:15,920
libertarian bullshit while simultaneously dreaming of living in you know post-scarcity

2626
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:18,560
space communism like Star Trek.

2627
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:20,800
Oh man, what a fucking dork.

2628
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:26,400
Remember when you went to Jordan Peterson and shit and like still thinks that like Sam Harris

2629
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:27,440
is the smartest guy ever.

2630
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:28,720
Oh man.

2631
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,880
Okay, no, this pisses me off.

2632
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:31,600
Fuck you, dude.

2633
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:32,160
You know why?

2634
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:36,640
Because like we don't have any context into what you were doing fucking five years ago,

2635
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:40,240
probably being like 15 and I don't know something dumb.

2636
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:43,520
Imagine listening to a PCP episode more than once cringe.

2637
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:48,880
I just think it's real fuck to come at how somebody was five years ago and be like,

2638
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:52,800
Oh, remember when you fucking sucked and you're not you knowing he's not going to be on the

2639
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,800
episode to defend himself.

2640
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,840
I mean, he could be on any time he wanted.

2641
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:58,000
Right.

2642
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,960
But this guy knows he's not on the episode to defend himself.

2643
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:02,480
No, I agree.

2644
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:05,440
I'm totally with this guy in hindsight.

2645
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:09,920
Weird utilitarianism is really just like a Randian objectivism.

2646
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:11,040
That's what it always was.

2647
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:12,560
It wasn't there's no hindsight needed.

2648
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:14,320
He said so at the time.

2649
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,600
Did he actually I don't remember.

2650
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:16,480
I don't remember that.

2651
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:18,560
He was like, yeah, I'm a Randian objectivist.

2652
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:19,920
That was his stance at the time.

2653
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:21,120
Lol, cringe.

2654
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,720
I didn't even know what that was at the time.

2655
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:29,840
So I didn't I feel like a lot of people saw like liked Jordan Peterson for a while there.

2656
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:35,760
Like I didn't know about him until the backlash against him started.

2657
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,840
So like I heard about him.

2658
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:38,640
It's like clean your room.

2659
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:39,760
It's like, yeah, yeah.

2660
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:42,160
Like that that is good advice still.

2661
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:43,360
Sure, sure.

2662
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:45,120
But all the other stuff is pretty cringy.

2663
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:49,360
I knew a guy in Georgia who told me that like he wanted to get his life back on track.

2664
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:52,240
And he was he was like going to apply for a job.

2665
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:56,320
And he was like he read this book by Jordan Peterson that had like, you know, really like

2666
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:57,680
opened his eyes or whatever.

2667
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:00,640
And at the time I didn't know anything about JP.

2668
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:02,240
So I was like, okay, that's cool.

2669
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:03,120
That's cool.

2670
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:07,280
I would have had more to say about it if I knew more, but I didn't.

2671
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:08,720
So probably good.

2672
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:12,240
Probably good that this guy didn't like tell me that and it didn't go.

2673
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:15,040
Don't you know that Jordan Peterson hates trans people?

2674
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:18,960
And the like it probably wouldn't have been a productive conversation to have.

2675
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:19,760
Right.

2676
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:20,800
So I was spared.

2677
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:25,440
I think the most like comforting thing that I've since learned since like initially

2678
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:29,040
being exposed to Jordan Peterson is that at the time I remember a lot of people were watching

2679
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:33,040
his content and I thought like on the surface level his stuff was like interesting and out.

2680
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:37,440
But like my thing was like a lot of it just sounded like like like babble,

2681
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:40,480
like just like big words strewn together and attempt to sound smart.

2682
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:40,720
Yeah.

2683
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:45,120
And then you read his book and you see the diagrams and you're like, oh yeah, this guy's nuts.

2684
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:49,840
Well then like because I'm like perpetually self deprecating.

2685
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:52,480
I was like, because like everyone in the comments like this guy's so profound.

2686
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,880
I'm like, am I just like too retarded to understand what's going on here?

2687
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:55,920
Just sounds stupid.

2688
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,280
And then later on a bunch of people are like, actually everything he says is just kind of

2689
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:00,240
sounds stupid.

2690
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:02,400
And I'm like, oh, okay.

2691
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:06,160
I feel a little better about myself that like I wasn't the only one who listened to this

2692
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:08,080
and thought like it was just like techno babble.

2693
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:10,320
I never looked into any of his videos.

2694
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:11,600
I read 12 Boos for Life.

2695
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:12,480
It wasn't a bad book.

2696
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:14,240
It was just like so overly verbose.

2697
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:15,920
And I was like, why is it so overly verbose?

2698
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:16,560
I must be dumb.

2699
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:19,040
And then I realized, no, it's just overly verbose.

2700
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:19,760
I'm like, okay.

2701
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:20,000
Yeah.

2702
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:28,000
I think the first time I saw Jordan Peterson was on the H3 podcast and he took a big weed.

2703
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,840
No, he took a huge vape.

2704
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:35,040
Like Ethan had this like vape the size of a fridge and he took a big vape.

2705
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,280
He was like, yeah, that's pretty good.

2706
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:41,280
And I was like, who is this old man who's like a professor on H3?

2707
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:42,160
That's kind of weird.

2708
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:42,960
Was it weed vape?

2709
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:46,720
No, it was just vape because he was do you vape nature or that stuff?

2710
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:50,960
Well, Ben, every time you vape, you're just invoking Jordan Peterson.

2711
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:52,000
I don't vape anymore.

2712
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,320
They don't sell the, they don't sell pods anymore.

2713
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:56,000
I cannot find them on the internet.

2714
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,440
They're just like, how is it still a thing that's happening in Massachusetts?

2715
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:02,560
I don't think it's not just Massachusetts.

2716
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:04,320
I can't find them anywhere online.

2717
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:04,640
Really?

2718
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:09,120
I don't know if I'm, I've like, I've looked around and I cannot find a online retailer

2719
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:12,160
that still like has stock that is not sold out.

2720
02:14:12,160 --> 02:14:14,240
It's easy to get weed vapes and it has to get nicotine vapes now.

2721
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:16,640
That seems not correct.

2722
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:17,120
I don't know.

2723
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:19,600
It's like, it's like they just have to be manufactured.

2724
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:23,680
It actually seems correct just in a way that you can't believe our world would actually be.

2725
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:23,920
Oh yeah.

2726
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:24,640
That's what I mean.

2727
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:25,600
That's what I mean.

2728
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:28,480
In terms of like how the world works, not how the world ought to be.

2729
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:32,640
I don't know if they're still like banned to be sold in Massachusetts.

2730
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:34,240
I would imagine yes, probably.

2731
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:37,600
The flavored ones anyway, but I don't know.

2732
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:38,320
But cigarettes?

2733
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:40,720
But nobody has them.

2734
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:42,160
Still in any corner store.

2735
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:45,120
But I like, whether they're real loud or not, nobody has them regardless.

2736
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:46,320
So it's, it's a mood point.

2737
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:46,880
Oh my God.

2738
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:50,080
I'm genuinely baffled that like I can't find them online.

2739
02:14:50,080 --> 02:14:51,520
That's so strange to me.

2740
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:54,720
I guess, I guess what we've learned is you just need to spend $2,000,

2741
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,400
go to the Philippines, you can get like really.

2742
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:03,280
You can buy individual cigarettes for like five pesetas there.

2743
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:08,400
So, you know, which is like so little of a fraction of a cent that I couldn't compare it

2744
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:11,120
to an American piece of currency.

2745
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:11,360
Cool.

2746
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,360
How many Bitcoin for a whole pack?

2747
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:18,160
Okay.

2748
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:22,080
Next one is Meow Mix 64.

2749
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,400
Three, two, one, go.

2750
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:32,480
You know, I'm just finished watching some creepy web series like Illusion Lock and Diminish.

2751
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:36,960
Is there a creepy or haunted web series that you've enjoyed as well?

2752
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:37,920
Thank you.

2753
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:38,880
Wait, what was the series?

2754
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:41,760
Diminished and what was the first one?

2755
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:44,800
I'm not familiar with that.

2756
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,760
I can't tell what the first one is.

2757
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:48,800
It's not really creepy.

2758
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:50,720
I've always championed Tales from the gas station.

2759
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:55,760
It's like a, not ironic creepypasta, but like kind of like a meta creepypasta sort of thing.

2760
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:56,560
And it's really good.

2761
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,000
Highly, highly, highly, highly, highly recommend it.

2762
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:02,080
Really, really good.

2763
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:04,480
Wait, what was the genre of stuff?

2764
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:06,000
Like just creepy anything?

2765
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,520
Creepy or haunted.

2766
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:10,560
He said haunted, but I'm assuming it could be anything.

2767
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:11,840
Dude, I remember.

2768
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:16,480
I honestly don't really know what that means if that's like a specific genre.

2769
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:23,840
This is like my first poop the pants moment online.

2770
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,440
My first poop.

2771
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:25,920
My first poop.

2772
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:28,080
Everyone remembers their first poop the pants.

2773
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:34,800
It was this Newgrounds game series called Ghost Motel.

2774
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:41,280
And this episode one, which is, it ends like a, it's a point and click series.

2775
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,280
And you're just pointing and clicking and going around.

2776
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:45,920
And it's very, it's Newgrounds.

2777
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:52,480
So it's flash and it's like low fidelity, but it's sort of, it's really,

2778
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:54,800
I don't know how to describe it.

2779
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:59,040
It's gory and bloody, like as you would expect Newgrounds things to be.

2780
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:02,480
But it's also quite creepy and unnerving.

2781
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:08,720
There's a bit of like possession of a girl and you get, you just can't do anything.

2782
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:11,280
You, you just have to watch this girl get possessed.

2783
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:15,840
And as part of a scene and you feel like you have control, but you can't.

2784
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:18,240
And then, and then he's like, man, I couldn't do anything.

2785
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:20,080
It's like a scene happens after that.

2786
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:22,480
It's like, oh my God, I really fucked up.

2787
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:27,680
I don't really like creepy stuff and I don't like spooky stuff, scary stuff.

2788
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:33,040
I tend to not be there, which is why I give Tales from the Gas Station just a glowing recommendation.

2789
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:34,640
Okay. Oh God, what was it?

2790
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:36,800
This is so embarrassing.

2791
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:41,600
I, I, I, I heated, I literally, I've never done this before.

2792
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:43,360
I heated a trigger warning.

2793
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:44,960
Can you believe it?

2794
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:45,680
Oh my God.

2795
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:47,040
Was it, was it about brains?

2796
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:50,400
No, it was just about jump scares.

2797
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:54,480
There was, I think it was, I think it was a night, a night, night, not night mind.

2798
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:58,800
Um, um, masterclass, nightmare masterclass.

2799
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:03,600
I think it was a video or it was some channel that I followed.

2800
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:08,560
They put out a video that was about something and they said like trigger warning.

2801
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:12,880
You know, I don't do any jump scares in the video, but I will be showing the media in question

2802
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:14,800
and it will contain some jump scares.

2803
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:18,000
And I was like, well, I know that's going to fuck me up.

2804
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,040
I hate that shit.

2805
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:20,320
So I'm not going to watch the video.

2806
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:21,840
Thanks for the trigger warning, buddy.

2807
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:23,120
Yeah.

2808
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:24,240
And I didn't watch it.

2809
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:27,600
I guess I should give a trigger warning for the, the Ghost Martel,

2810
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:32,880
because the first episode obviously feels like they didn't intend it to continue.

2811
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,320
So it just ends in a jump scare.

2812
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:36,000
Um, yeah.

2813
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,240
But every other thing after that is much more like serious and cool.

2814
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:48,960
I, yeah, I would, I, I think I would, I think I could probably live the rest of my life

2815
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:50,640
without being jump scared.

2816
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:52,400
And if I could, I would say yes.

2817
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:52,880
Thank you.

2818
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:54,000
Yeah.

2819
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:58,960
Uh, I don't like to be scared because it's scary.

2820
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:01,040
You mean you don't like to be startled?

2821
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:02,480
Yes.

2822
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:03,040
True.

2823
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:04,080
Well, I don't like to be scared.

2824
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:07,280
I don't like to be essentially frightened either to be, to be honest,

2825
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:09,680
but I feel less like strongly about that.

2826
02:19:10,640 --> 02:19:14,160
Like if a trumpet goes in the night and I'm not expecting a trumpet,

2827
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,000
then I'm going to, I'm going to run.

2828
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,120
I'm going to pee in my pants.

2829
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:26,080
If, um, I've said, I didn't like, I didn't really like, like Midsommar and it was,

2830
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:29,040
that didn't have any jump scares in it, but it was like, it was scary, right?

2831
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:29,920
It was like unsettling.

2832
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:30,880
It was creepy.

2833
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:31,840
I don't like it.

2834
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:36,560
I don't like that I watched it because sometimes I think about it and it makes me sad, right?

2835
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:38,800
And like, did that improve my life at all?

2836
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:39,040
No.

2837
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:40,960
So I don't like that either.

2838
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:43,360
I, I agree with you.

2839
02:19:43,360 --> 02:19:48,320
I tend, that's why I haven't watched that movie and like a lot of ones like it.

2840
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:51,520
It's just like when people tell me, oh, this movie is like a nightmare.

2841
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:53,760
It makes you fucking feel haunted for the rest of your life.

2842
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:55,600
I'm like, thanks, I've never watched that.

2843
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:56,800
Yeah.

2844
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:00,320
I mean, yeah, yeah, I don't know.

2845
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:04,640
You can get desensitized to those things, but I don't want to do enough of it to do,

2846
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:05,600
to get to that point.

2847
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:06,800
Right.

2848
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:09,680
It's, it's, it's not my cup of tea.

2849
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:16,640
Next voicemail is called, it's Margar, three, two, one, go.

2850
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:20,480
Margar here, Tommy J.

2851
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:26,960
If you want to be a legitimate voicemail member like me and so many other esteemed members,

2852
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:28,160
just be concise.

2853
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:30,080
If you have a question, ask it.

2854
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,680
If you have a bit, do it.

2855
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:36,160
I am a successful voice caller many weeks in a row.

2856
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:43,120
Don't send more than like two voicemails a week, or you're just going to be considered epic cringe,

2857
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:43,520
bro.

2858
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:44,560
True, true.

2859
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:46,080
Margar, the esteemed.

2860
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:47,600
Margar.

2861
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:52,720
If anyone, this guy could write like a self-help book about like how to succeed at voicemailing.

2862
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:55,840
12 rules for voicemails.

2863
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,280
12 rules for voicemails.

2864
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:57,680
Yes.

2865
02:20:57,680 --> 02:20:58,160
Yes.

2866
02:20:58,160 --> 02:20:58,880
Exactly.

2867
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:00,480
Margar knows he's the expert.

2868
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,720
I skipped, I skipped a voicemail.

2869
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:07,040
Sorry, Eleazar, you might have to flip those.

2870
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:10,080
Okay, the next one is actually the previous one, but there it is.

2871
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:12,320
This one is called facial hair voicemail.

2872
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:14,000
Three, two, one, go.

2873
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:16,320
Facial hair is cool.

2874
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:18,000
Did you bro?

2875
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,320
Had a really cool beard and I'm going to miss it a lot.

2876
02:21:21,360 --> 02:21:24,480
Tom Oliver had a cool goatee at one point.

2877
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:28,000
I have that same goatee like right now where it's not on the sides.

2878
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,920
I'm going to just have a mustache and a chin bit.

2879
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:33,920
Ben Sainte, I think you had a beard at one point.

2880
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:34,400
It's true.

2881
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,600
You can find evidence.

2882
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:36,560
It was glorious.

2883
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:37,600
It trans people.

2884
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:39,680
Tell me about what you plan to do with your facial hair.

2885
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:40,800
You going to laser it off?

2886
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:42,400
Talk about facial hair.

2887
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:48,640
I want to say I have, I've been feeling pretty good lately because I have actually managed to kind

2888
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:49,760
of grow the beard back.

2889
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:55,440
Infamously, sometimes I have to shave the beard because I pick at my beard and I like,

2890
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:58,240
I'll pick too much of it out and it looks fucked up and I have to trim it.

2891
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:02,960
I have managed to stave that off long enough that I actually kind of have a beard again.

2892
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:03,600
It's not long.

2893
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:04,720
You look good with the beard.

2894
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:05,200
I'm just going to say.

2895
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:06,080
I do look good with it.

2896
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:07,840
I think I look way, way better with the beard.

2897
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:12,000
It makes me really angry that I have this tick that like ruins my beard.

2898
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:12,240
Yeah.

2899
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:13,120
Which is like.

2900
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:19,440
It's so crazy to imagine that you could pick your beard so hard to pull the hairs out.

2901
02:22:19,440 --> 02:22:24,000
All three of you have God tier facial hair and it makes me so mad because that's what I want.

2902
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,720
Not anymore.

2903
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:25,760
And I can't grow it.

2904
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:26,160
I know.

2905
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:28,400
I'm just me.

2906
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:32,880
I'm shocked that anybody thinks that Digi Bro had great facial hair because in my opinion,

2907
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:34,480
Digi Bro had a fucking air of cubes.

2908
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:39,040
I am like coping so hard with the fact that I can't grow a normal beard that if I ever

2909
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:43,120
did grow a facial hair, I would go full Gandalf to compensate at this point.

2910
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:45,440
Well, Digi never like had.

2911
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:45,760
Okay.

2912
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:48,480
The Digi beard was very like scraggly.

2913
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:50,800
I think it could have been like trimmed.

2914
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:54,560
I think it could have been trimmed into a very like it could have been very,

2915
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:58,160
very much, um, yes, yes meme guy.

2916
02:22:58,160 --> 02:22:58,960
You know what I'm saying?

2917
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:00,400
Yeah.

2918
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:04,160
You know, the blonde guy that says yes and he has a nice beard.

2919
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:04,720
Oh, okay.

2920
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:05,600
I know what you're talking about.

2921
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:07,920
You could have done something like that with it.

2922
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:09,360
That's kind of what I'm trying to do.

2923
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:12,640
I'm gonna, I'm really trying.

2924
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,000
What the tight curls.

2925
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I'm really trying to keep this streak going of not ruining my beard this time because every

2926
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,800
time I shave it, I'm like, oh, I look so much worse and it makes me sad.

2927
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:24,640
And it's actually taken me a long time.

2928
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:26,800
It's been like, it's been several weeks.

2929
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:29,840
It feels like it's been forever since I had a beard, even though I shaved it, like not

2930
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:30,560
that long ago.

2931
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:34,400
Um, I, I can't, I can't lose it again.

2932
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,520
I can't lose it again.

2933
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:39,760
It honestly, it boosts my self-esteem tremendously to have it.

2934
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:41,680
And the inverse is also true.

2935
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:44,400
So I have to protect it from myself.

2936
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:49,120
If, if, if anybody like instead of like lasering your beard off, can you just like take your

2937
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:51,200
stat points and beard and give them to me?

2938
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:52,720
I will gladly accept that.

2939
02:23:53,360 --> 02:23:54,800
If I could, I definitely would.

2940
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:55,200
Got it.

2941
02:23:56,080 --> 02:24:00,320
I got like some, at one point I got some like, uh, what's it called?

2942
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:04,640
Like the fucking, um, like beard oil you can get to try and like grow your beard out more

2943
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:05,440
and it didn't work.

2944
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:07,280
And I was, it was devastating.

2945
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:10,400
I, I give such an oil.

2946
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:10,640
Yeah.

2947
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:12,880
Like the oil, isn't the oil just for like styling it?

2948
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:15,520
No, there's like some sort of like, forget what it's called.

2949
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:19,520
It was some sort of like, what's the stuff that like makes you grow your fingernails?

2950
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:21,200
Not melanin.

2951
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:21,680
What?

2952
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:22,880
I have no idea.

2953
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:23,360
Biotin.

2954
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:28,800
They say that like, if you, if you, if biotin, it like makes you, it like increases like hair

2955
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,240
growth and nail growth.

2956
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:31,120
That is the case.

2957
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:31,600
Yeah.

2958
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:32,960
I've been taking it as well.

2959
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:34,240
But that's what they say anyway.

2960
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:38,400
I think I took it for a while and I didn't see much difference, but it wasn't taken for that long.

2961
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:43,200
Well, maybe I just need to inject biotin directly into my face.

2962
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:48,240
Um, uh, I, I still have the good to know.

2963
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:52,160
My facial hair hasn't changed in like a decade and I plan, no plans on changing it anytime.

2964
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:55,280
Laser hair removal is very expensive.

2965
02:24:56,160 --> 02:25:02,880
But a Twitter user called 120 pounds of lean cave beef, uh, said that after doing it for

2966
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:07,040
two years, they don't have any beard shadow whatsoever anymore.

2967
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:09,200
So as far as I'm concerned, it's the only option.

2968
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:11,040
Now we know the bit.

2969
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:12,080
Soon as I can afford it.

2970
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,840
I, I don't know.

2971
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:16,560
I have no money.

2972
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:18,720
So any amount is too much struggle.

2973
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:23,040
I've also heard that it's like a session.

2974
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:28,960
Like you go there every week for a number of months and it's like each session is like upwards

2975
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:30,320
of a few hundred pounds.

2976
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:32,000
It's definitely that's not cake.

2977
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:38,080
It's not something that it was all told like two grand across two years to just on just the

2978
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:38,720
facial hair.

2979
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:39,360
Okay.

2980
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:46,400
So I, I have, um, Jesus been using this, this handheld like consumer product

2981
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:53,360
IPL laser hair remover, which, um, I don't know if I've talked about, um,

2982
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:57,600
well, first off, I don't think it's supposed to be used for facial hair, but it,

2983
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:04,400
because it says like, don't you, it doesn't really work on male facial hair because the

2984
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:07,440
roots are very deep and it can't reach that far.

2985
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:08,320
Okay.

2986
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:11,920
But basically it's a, instead of a laser, it's a light bulb that pulses.

2987
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:14,880
It's IPL stands for intense pulse light.

2988
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:24,480
So it just zaps you with an extremely like quick and powerful light bulb zap and it hurts.

2989
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:29,520
It's like slapping you with a, with a rubber band, but I've been using it on my arms and

2990
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:33,360
legs and my arms and leg hair is basically completely gone, which is epic.

2991
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:34,240
Okay.

2992
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:36,800
Well, so it definitely works for most of the body.

2993
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:39,120
Men and women can use it.

2994
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:42,720
It's just that the male facial hair.

2995
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:44,480
Actually, just link me the thing you got.

2996
02:26:44,480 --> 02:26:46,640
Well, it's kind of expensive as well.

2997
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:53,680
The only reason I have it is because, um, a friend noticed that Black Friday last year

2998
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:59,440
or the year before, oh no, it must have been last year, Black Friday, it was off by 70%

2999
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:01,040
so I could afford it pretty easily.

3000
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:04,720
I know the brand.

3001
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:08,480
It's IPL Brown, like B-R-A-U-N.

3002
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:09,840
That's the thing.

3003
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:10,960
Yeah.

3004
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:12,240
Like the brown tubes.

3005
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:14,160
Yeah.

3006
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:14,640
Yeah.

3007
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:15,200
Yeah, yeah.

3008
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:16,240
The ones you put on your car.

3009
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:18,800
Yes.

3010
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:20,000
I don't know what you're saying.

3011
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,520
Oh, fucking 600 pounds.

3012
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:22,800
Yeah, wait, that's a bit much.

3013
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:27,040
I mean, cheaper than laser surgery.

3014
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:31,600
No, I think it's definitely cheaper than laser surgery, but it's different from laser

3015
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:32,160
surgery.

3016
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:38,000
I don't think it could possibly permanently remove beard shadow, but it could definitely

3017
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,160
get rid of body hair, which is what I'm using it for.

3018
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:42,240
God fucking dammit, I've been losing it.

3019
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:47,200
Mindsweeper non-stop since it's fucking since that call and every time I get farther and

3020
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:47,840
more pissed.

3021
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:51,200
This game does suck because you have to guess.

3022
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,720
There is no mind sweeper game that doesn't involve guessing no matter how fucking far

3023
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:55,520
you get in.

3024
02:27:55,520 --> 02:28:00,560
I would complain about the fact that it is inherent randomness, but I play like Pokemon.

3025
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:03,680
I played Pokemon showdown a lot, so, you know.

3026
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:04,480
Where's the thing?

3027
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:11,120
They said that you can do a version that has no guesses guaranteed and I don't know where it is.

3028
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:12,640
Okay, that's what they were saying then.

3029
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:13,520
Did you?

3030
02:28:14,400 --> 02:28:16,560
Wait, how is that possible?

3031
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:23,120
The fundamental mechanic of Mindsweeper is that it gives you limited information and

3032
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:24,640
you have to make educated guesses.

3033
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:29,520
No, it's that you use the numbers to determine

3034
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:34,320
like, I don't think anything is a pure guess.

3035
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:41,440
You always have enough information to figure it out if it is set out in such a way.

3036
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:49,840
There's a subset of possible Mindsweeper maps that maybe start with one square already selected.

3037
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:55,280
It's right there, no guessing mode on the left above ranking.

3038
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,160
That's fascinating.

3039
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:03,360
I wonder what the algorithm is, or what the rules defining a no guessing

3040
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:04,720
Mindsweeper map is.

3041
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:08,080
I don't know, but if I just match that out, I'm switching over.

3042
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:15,200
I did a Mindsweeper earlier, and I just did it methodically, and I got all of the numbers

3043
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:17,520
without having to guess once.

3044
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:19,600
And it was only a medium, so it wasn't that big.

3045
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:22,560
Oh, I don't even consider that Mindsweeper.

3046
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:30,400
But like, you hit a thing and it's like, okay, there's a two there, and then it's like, well,

3047
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,440
wait, how is there no guessing?

3048
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:35,920
Because you know that there are a certain number of Minds,

3049
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:39,360
but you don't know which squares they're in.

3050
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:42,000
Don't you have to guess?

3051
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,400
I don't think so.

3052
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:46,160
Like, you use all of the other numbers.

3053
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:50,960
You go for all the ones that are absolutely guaranteed, and I don't know.

3054
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:52,480
I'm not a Mindsweeper person.

3055
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:54,000
Is it Mindsweeper.online?

3056
02:29:55,600 --> 02:30:00,400
It's not that no matter what you have to guess in a match, it's just that the odds of you having

3057
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:07,600
to guess at some point are so astronomically high that it's almost guaranteed to happen in most matches.

3058
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:10,400
I mean, okay, I hit a button and it said one.

3059
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:12,720
So I was like, okay, there's one in the surrounding eight.

3060
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:14,720
So I have a one in eight chance of hitting a mine.

3061
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:16,560
So I click another one and it says two.

3062
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:21,440
So I'm like, okay, now there's, I know that there's one in the seven remaining surrounding

3063
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:26,960
the first square, and there's two in the seven surrounding the two, and one of those two might

3064
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:30,960
be in the, like this is still, it's, it's still guesswork.

3065
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:33,440
It's like, it's like I can make a pretty good guess.

3066
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,840
I, oh, I'm playing right now.

3067
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:42,080
Okay, all right.

3068
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:43,280
That's all I got to say about that.

3069
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:44,240
Fuck Mindsweeper.

3070
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:50,880
Anyway, yeah, laser hair removal is expensive, but the body hair removal is affordable kind of.

3071
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:53,760
And that's what I'm doing.

3072
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:56,000
I am experimenting.

3073
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,600
I am experimenting zapping my face just to see if it does anything.

3074
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:05,440
If it like reduces the speed or the thickness of it, that'll be handy.

3075
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,120
So I'm going to do that anyway.

3076
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:10,640
And apparently zapping with the IPL is just good for the skin.

3077
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:15,920
Uh, you know, if you don't do it, if you do it once a week, then it's fine.

3078
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:17,440
But if you overdo it, it's a bit much.

3079
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:20,080
Well, I'm going to check it out.

3080
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:23,600
The next voicemail is called Poopy Pie.

3081
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:26,160
Three, two, one, go.

3082
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:36,480
Do you guys remember when the universe weirdly aligned so that some random Swedish guy

3083
02:31:37,440 --> 02:31:44,560
screaming at Five Nights at Freddy became the biggest YouTuber on the platform?

3084
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:51,840
And then he was universally hated by every like cool YouTuber.

3085
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:58,080
Everyone knew that his content was bad and he wasn't anything special or good or cool.

3086
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:00,000
I remember that.

3087
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:08,880
Then do you remember when a couple of newspapers correctly pointed out like, hey,

3088
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:17,040
this guy says some pretty wacky stuff and kind of kind of racist stuff.

3089
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:24,080
And then all of a sudden all those YouTubers who hated him before were like, now hold on.

3090
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:27,120
We think this guy's cool.

3091
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:29,920
You're ignoring the fact that he did change his entire content.

3092
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:32,640
That was pretty weird.

3093
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:36,320
He became a completely different YouTuber in fairness.

3094
02:32:36,320 --> 02:32:37,600
I still don't watch PewDiePie.

3095
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:40,080
I still think his videos are fucking boring and obnoxious.

3096
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:43,280
What do you mean he changed his, did he?

3097
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:47,840
Yeah, like after all that happened, he totally changed like the way he presents his persona,

3098
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:49,440
the style of the videos and stuff.

3099
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:54,000
Well, when you say all that, like how, which controversial you're talking about

3100
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:57,440
and how early there's so many I don't actually know.

3101
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,520
I hear about PewDiePie from my brother.

3102
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:00,160
I don't know.

3103
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:07,440
Okay, but that's not the reason why people turned around from like hating on him to

3104
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:08,000
defending him.

3105
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:11,200
It was because he came under fire from traditional media.

3106
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:14,160
I mean, maybe YouTubers were defending him for that reason.

3107
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:20,000
But like, for instance, Victor was never paying attention to PewDiePie until that happened,

3108
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:25,120
but he started paying attention to him because out of the saga of him chronicling it happening,

3109
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:30,160
he then developed like a vlogging style more based around like the content he was doing

3110
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:31,280
to cover that.

3111
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:35,680
And so like, it just was appealing to an older audience and was a more serious subject matter.

3112
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:40,720
So like, a lot of people newly got into PewDiePie who never would have watched him before, you know?

3113
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:42,320
I guess so.

3114
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:48,080
Yeah, I mean, it got him a lot of exposure and it didn't actually do anything bad for him,

3115
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:50,880
obviously, as these things, as these things always go.

3116
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:51,760
Not in the long term, yeah.

3117
02:33:52,480 --> 02:33:58,560
Uh, next voicemail is called, uh, Erare, Prepare for Bear.

3118
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:01,440
New mic call out if audio bad.

3119
02:34:01,440 --> 02:34:03,680
Okay, here we go.

3120
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:04,880
Three, two, one, go.

3121
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:37,680
That's the best voicemail I ever heard.

3122
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:44,320
I'm glad we had a winner today.

3123
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:45,920
How do I prepare for the bear?

3124
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:47,520
No, you can't prepare for the bear.

3125
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:47,920
No.

3126
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:50,080
You can't prepare, you can't prepare for the bear.

3127
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:54,000
If he wants you, he's gonna get you.

3128
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,240
That's all, that's all there is to it.

3129
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:59,360
Best bet is to leave out something he might want to eat more than you.

3130
02:34:59,360 --> 02:35:03,680
If you, if you can like, have a friend who lives even closer to you.

3131
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:08,480
Do they sell bear traps on Amazon and how quickly can they deliver?

3132
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:09,280
That's the question.

3133
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:15,600
Get, get, get your friend, get your, get a friend to move to your city and be like,

3134
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:20,240
hey, I found a great house you can move into and have it be like directly between you and the zoo

3135
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:22,080
so the bear will get him first.

3136
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:25,760
That's the only, what if he's going for you specifically though?

3137
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:30,320
And, and when he moves in say, hey, listen, uh, I'm glad you're, glad you're here.

3138
02:35:30,320 --> 02:35:34,320
Uh, but, uh, just, uh, not for any, not for any reason, but if you were to,

3139
02:35:34,320 --> 02:35:38,000
if you're getting mauled by a bear, uh, call me and let me know about it.

3140
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:42,080
Okay, uh, just give him that heads up, make it, make that part of the agreement.

3141
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:46,960
Um, okay.

3142
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:48,240
Good voicemail.

3143
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:53,840
Next one is called, uh, Ben's Valentine Wish three.

3144
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:54,320
There it is.

3145
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:55,840
Three, two, one, go.

3146
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:59,760
I, Ben, Saint, uh, am gay.

3147
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:01,840
I am saying it now.

3148
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:02,560
Now this is false.

3149
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:03,120
Any, any claims.

3150
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:03,840
Like we've been over this.

3151
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:08,480
Any future claims to the contrary are, are just, are mere posturing.

3152
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:10,000
This is a deep fake.

3153
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,240
I'm just pretending, you know, I'm just keeping up appearances.

3154
02:36:12,240 --> 02:36:13,200
This is gaslighting.

3155
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:13,760
It's a lie.

3156
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:15,200
This is the truth.

3157
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:15,920
I am gay.

3158
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:16,480
This is not, can't.

3159
02:36:16,480 --> 02:36:19,040
Uh, don't let me fool you when I claim to be straight.

3160
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:20,400
This is photoshopped.

3161
02:36:20,400 --> 02:36:21,280
Wait, this is you.

3162
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:22,400
I should edit this out.

3163
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:23,440
I should edit this out.

3164
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:24,560
You sound so different.

3165
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:26,640
I don't want anyone to know that I am gay, but I am gay.

3166
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:27,600
Yeah, it's a different person.

3167
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:28,080
Yay.

3168
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:35,120
In fact, in fact, every Ben Saint from before like 2018 or whatever, or 2000.

3169
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:36,880
You were killed and replaced for the crime.

3170
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:37,920
Is a different person.

3171
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:41,200
I was, I was, I was a Paul McCartneyed.

3172
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:44,880
I was, I was killed and replaced with a, with a body double.

3173
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:46,720
So that doesn't, that doesn't count.

3174
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:54,160
The voice difference was so like uncannyly different that I thought just a person had,

3175
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:57,120
was quoting you, like just saying the thing you said once.

3176
02:36:57,120 --> 02:37:00,560
I did very briefly think, wow, this is a really good Ben impression.

3177
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:05,120
And then I was like, oh, I thought it was a terrible, I had no, I didn't even consider

3178
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:06,560
there was, could it be an impression?

3179
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:08,640
Like reverse Paul McCartneyed.

3180
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:12,800
The body double was the original one and the original one is the double.

3181
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:19,120
There used to be a Ben body double, but then I, then he killed, he was killed by the CIA

3182
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:21,840
and the CIA called me up and said, Hey, sorry, we killed your double.

3183
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:23,840
You're going to have to resume your regular duties now.

3184
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:24,800
And I said, fuck.

3185
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:26,560
And then here I am.

3186
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:32,240
And that guy said, said he was gay on the internet and it's haunted me ever since.

3187
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:34,320
Checks out.

3188
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:37,120
I'll never escape from the shadow.

3189
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:39,440
Okay.

3190
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:42,080
So I hope that settles that for once and for all.

3191
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:46,320
Next one is called Shin Megarfield Ten Spain.

3192
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:50,560
Three, two, one, go.

3193
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:53,120
Oh God.

3194
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:16,560
It'll contain no great power, ancient knowledge, contain no great secret on it above all,

3195
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:20,880
but one day I've been no center, sir.

3196
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:24,720
Take control parentheses.

3197
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:26,560
And now we're summarized summer.

3198
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:28,480
Heart broken.

3199
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:34,400
Divisional between the summer I summer and the great power.

3200
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:39,280
Divisional between the rabble and the oneru.

3201
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,760
Once a broom like a Sakura blossom.

3202
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:49,280
Now a empathy like a bottle of sake.

3203
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:54,160
And summer I not to talk about scroll.

3204
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:57,360
No, no, no, no talk.

3205
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:58,880
How I sucky scroll.

3206
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,360
Neto son boy.

3207
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:04,560
Samurai summer defect.

3208
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:06,800
You never stop.

3209
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:08,720
Of a net.

3210
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:11,920
But until you next time.

3211
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:16,800
I can't believe Samurai summer is in the League of Nate.

3212
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:17,840
Samurai summer.

3213
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:19,040
I can't believe you would.

3214
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:20,400
I can't believe you would.

3215
02:39:20,400 --> 02:39:22,320
You would become my enemy like this.

3216
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:26,480
So this is terrible, terrible news.

3217
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:30,320
The League grows in power with every passing moment.

3218
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:33,760
Wait, are the Nate fuckers pro-nate or anti-nate?

3219
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:34,960
It's hard to tell.

3220
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:36,240
They just want to fuck Nate.

3221
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:39,120
They just want to fuck, like they all want to fucking for different reasons.

3222
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:41,680
Like some of them are noble reasons and some of them are evil.

3223
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:43,040
They're all they're only united.

3224
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:47,600
The group hasn't decided if the fucking is metaphorically or literally yet.

3225
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:49,680
Some of it is clearly literal.

3226
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:51,200
Oh no, it's very literal.

3227
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:53,280
It's explicitly literal.

3228
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:57,040
But make no mistake about their intentions.

3229
02:40:00,400 --> 02:40:04,400
I want to say there's a video.

3230
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:12,880
Cassidy uploaded a video condensing all the Samurai saga voicemails into a single video.

3231
02:40:12,880 --> 02:40:15,120
I retweeted it the other day.

3232
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:16,160
Link in the description.

3233
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:19,840
Why is that not on the fucking highlights channel?

3234
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:21,520
We have clearly dropped the ball.

3235
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:22,720
You know?

3236
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:23,920
You know?

3237
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:24,640
Maybe we did.

3238
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:26,560
Maybe we fucking did.

3239
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:32,320
Next voicemail is called Melonbread Rebuttal.

3240
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:33,760
And there it is.

3241
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:34,320
There we go.

3242
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:36,640
Three, two, one, go.

3243
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:38,640
Look, look.

3244
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:39,920
Pancakes with craters.

3245
02:40:39,920 --> 02:40:41,280
You fucking do one of those.

3246
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:42,560
This is Marin Pan.

3247
02:40:42,560 --> 02:40:46,640
I don't know what the fuck you were talking about last week about inadequate posturing.

3248
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:50,720
But what I do know is, is that you made me feel called out and humiliated.

3249
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:51,920
And like a fool.

3250
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:57,120
So if you want to elaborate, let's communicate exclusively through PCP voicemails.

3251
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:58,480
Oh, and by the way, listen.

3252
02:40:58,480 --> 02:41:01,200
By the way, I don't want to hunt Benzart work.

3253
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:01,840
All right.

3254
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:06,960
The only thing I want to hunt is Nate's utilitarian little boy pussy.

3255
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:10,080
Motherfuckers know I want to utilize that Nate pussy.

3256
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:13,360
He didn't say league though.

3257
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:17,200
I think he's associating himself.

3258
02:41:17,200 --> 02:41:20,480
Maybe he's maybe maybe applied and they haven't got back to him yet.

3259
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:22,880
Yeah, this is his application.

3260
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:28,240
Do you remember what Pancake said about Mellon last time?

3261
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:28,400
Marin.

3262
02:41:29,360 --> 02:41:30,000
Marin.

3263
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:30,480
Marin Pan.

3264
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:36,000
Well, this is, okay, but he wrote it as Mellon in the title of the voicemail, whatever.

3265
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,920
Do you remember what they said?

3266
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:42,240
Because I don't even remember what this is in regards to.

3267
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:44,080
No, I can't.

3268
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:47,280
But I guess they do so they can have their convo.

3269
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:52,000
They definitely should do a back and forth entirely in PCP voicemails.

3270
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,960
We'll stay an impartial observer.

3271
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:59,120
I'll stay not knowing what they're talking about for as long as they want to continue.

3272
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:01,360
Next voicemail.

3273
02:42:01,360 --> 02:42:02,480
We've got three more, by the way.

3274
02:42:02,480 --> 02:42:05,200
Next voicemail is called Tshepi.

3275
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:07,840
T-S-H-I-P-I.

3276
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:08,400
E-P-I.

3277
02:42:08,400 --> 02:42:09,760
Three, two, one, go.

3278
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:14,000
I remember Benzart.

3279
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:14,240
What?

3280
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:17,600
This audio.

3281
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:19,120
Can you hear anything?

3282
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:19,200
No.

3283
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:21,600
I hear thumping noises.

3284
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:24,240
I don't know if this is intentional or not, but I'm assuming it's not a touch.

3285
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:26,160
Is he sitting on it?

3286
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:27,280
YouTube series.

3287
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:29,520
I came to like YouTube poops one last time.

3288
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:32,640
My version was called Martin the Lawrence.

3289
02:42:32,640 --> 02:42:38,080
So I was going to take clips of Sonic the Hedgehog specifically to set an M cartoon

3290
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:41,680
and then just interject clips of Martin Lawrence.

3291
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:43,280
I don't know how I was going to do that.

3292
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:44,160
Martin Lawrence?

3293
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:47,360
That's that.

3294
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:52,720
I just wanted to also say, I'm going to have to go on your top.

3295
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:54,080
That's even a movie.

3296
02:42:56,080 --> 02:42:56,560
I couldn't.

3297
02:42:57,360 --> 02:42:59,280
Okay, I heard YouTube poop, so I assume...

3298
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:03,920
Something about making a YouTube poop out of Sonic the Hedgehog and clips of Martin Lawrence.

3299
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:05,120
That's all I got on that.

3300
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:12,560
I'm afraid for YouTube projects if recording with a microphone was this difficult.

3301
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:13,840
You shouldn't have told us.

3302
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:14,640
You should have just done it.

3303
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:16,000
Now that you've said it, you won't do it.

3304
02:43:17,360 --> 02:43:19,280
Now that you've said it, it's over.

3305
02:43:19,280 --> 02:43:22,960
I mean, I was talking about an idea that I had for YouTube poop,

3306
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:25,120
and I think he's just saying, oh, I also had one.

3307
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:26,160
Here's what it is.

3308
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:28,320
But obviously, we don't know how funny it would have been.

3309
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:30,240
Now we'll never know.

3310
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:38,080
Next voicemail is called Boopity Shoopity Fuck That Guy.

3311
02:43:38,080 --> 02:43:39,520
Three, two, one, go.

3312
02:43:40,480 --> 02:43:48,880
If someone sends in eight voicemails, Ben, you just have the right to not play them.

3313
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:50,640
Just don't play them.

3314
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:54,640
That's what I said I was gonna do for the record.

3315
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:56,960
There have not been any Tommy J voicemails this week.

3316
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:59,760
I have not had to censor any out in case any...

3317
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:03,040
If there were any, I would have censored them out, but there weren't.

3318
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:04,640
So in case you're wondering.

3319
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:12,480
Um, last voicemail is called Addendum, three, two, one, go.

3320
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:16,880
I have an addendum for my last statement.

3321
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:21,440
Well, okay.

3322
02:44:21,440 --> 02:44:24,080
I'm sure we'll be glad to listen to it later.

3323
02:44:24,080 --> 02:44:26,880
Oh, wait, wait, one more.

3324
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:29,120
We just got one three minutes ago.

3325
02:44:29,120 --> 02:44:31,520
Three, exactly three, three minutes ago.

3326
02:44:31,520 --> 02:44:32,960
Someone left a voicemail, so...

3327
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:33,600
Is it the addendum?

3328
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:34,000
Here it is.

3329
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:36,400
No, I think it's a different person.

3330
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:39,280
This one is called I'm Not Working.

3331
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:41,040
Three, two, one, go.

3332
02:45:04,800 --> 02:45:08,320
I have an addendum.

3333
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:10,960
I am so scared.

3334
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:17,600
I gotta get one, go on and get one.

3335
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:19,840
Doomer, we have you on YouTube for my music.

3336
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:21,920
Hey, that was nice.

3337
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:23,760
Yeah, that was good.

3338
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:26,480
That was a good closing of the original PCP arc.

3339
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:30,960
I imagined like the new banner like slowly fading in from like a big to like

3340
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:33,760
zooming out to a full size as that's playing, you know,

3341
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:36,400
it's the end of an era, walking away.

3342
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:38,960
The only difference to the theme is that now it's nightcore.

3343
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:44,720
Eleazar, make that the intro.

3344
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:49,760
Make that the intro to this episode, and then we can end the episode

3345
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:54,400
with the story of how it became the theme song for this episode.

3346
02:45:56,400 --> 02:45:58,320
Making it come full circle or something.

3347
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:02,720
Yeah, I'll make a new banner and maybe then I'll just

3348
02:46:02,720 --> 02:46:06,000
make it replace it with something else in a week or whatever.

3349
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:08,240
It's time to fuck around.

3350
02:46:08,240 --> 02:46:13,600
It's time to fuck around with the branding of this goddamn YouTube channel.

3351
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:16,400
It's a bold new era.

3352
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:18,240
It's a new year.

3353
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:20,400
It's a new era of the PCP.

3354
02:46:22,720 --> 02:46:24,080
Okay, that's it.

3355
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:25,600
Okay, that's all.

3356
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:30,560
So really thought I could beat a Minesweeper match before this episode is over,

3357
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:33,680
but alas, nothing but fucking failure.

3358
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:34,320
The struggle.

3359
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:40,880
You lost at the moment you decided to play Minesweeper.

3360
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:42,160
I know, I always do.

3361
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:46,240
Much like the stock market, you lost as soon as you decided to play.

3362
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:50,240
Pick Rust is better than Minesweeper, and I guess Sudoku is better than Pick Rust,

3363
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:52,560
but Sudoku's, I've mastered it.

3364
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:57,280
I mean, some Sudoku's are really hard, though.

3365
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:58,960
I know, and I'm good at them.

3366
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:04,320
The confidence with which you say that makes me believe you,

3367
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:07,920
because I would never dare to say that I was good at Sudoku's.

3368
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:13,120
I mean, I've done a few, but not like the really bad ones, though.

3369
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:16,320
Have you never found a Sudoku that you couldn't coup?

3370
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:21,680
No, eventually I complete them.

3371
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:26,640
I have an app that has easy, medium, hard, and I've run out of hard ones.

3372
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:28,320
I need to download DLC for more.

3373
02:47:29,280 --> 02:47:30,320
DLC.

3374
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:33,840
Yeah.

3375
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:36,080
I mean, literally downloadable content, so.

3376
02:47:38,960 --> 02:47:40,240
I guess that's it.

3377
02:47:40,240 --> 02:47:42,240
I guess we're done with the episode.

3378
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:45,920
We're almost at the three hour limit that Eliasar gave us, so that's good, lol.

3379
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:50,000
A patreon.com slash the procrastinators bonus episodes.

3380
02:47:51,280 --> 02:47:56,320
Yes, yes, the behind the scenes.

3381
02:47:57,040 --> 02:48:00,160
Yeah, the behind the scenes clips episode is out.

3382
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:00,960
Is it good?

3383
02:48:00,960 --> 02:48:01,440
I don't know.

3384
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:07,520
The speakpipe.com slash pzp voicemail.

3385
02:48:07,520 --> 02:48:10,640
If you want to send us a voicemail, thank you.

3386
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:18,640
And I mean, in patreon.com slash bensaint, obviously for me, just to give me money.

3387
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:19,440
Me personally.

3388
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:25,440
If you would rather give your money to me and get access to over 100 bonus podcasts,

3389
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:30,000
which are all really good and they're gonna come out weekly instead of monthly, like these slackers.

3390
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:33,280
patreon.com slash polystage2.

3391
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:33,600
Baby.

3392
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:36,640
Come on, man.

3393
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:37,120
Come on.

3394
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:39,440
Don't listen to that.

3395
02:48:39,440 --> 02:48:42,320
Bensaint Malarkey come over to me.

3396
02:48:43,360 --> 02:48:43,840
It's true.

3397
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:44,640
The Bernie of Podcasts.

3398
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:48,240
If you like Malarkey, if you like Malarkey, you should follow me.

3399
02:48:48,240 --> 02:48:51,200
You should support me over that comment.

3400
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:52,560
Okay, goodbye.

3401
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:54,320
Okay, that's the end.

3402
02:48:54,320 --> 02:48:56,720
Don't follow me anywhere because it's all going to go away.

3403
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:59,440
Okay, day is dead.

3404
02:48:59,440 --> 02:49:01,120
There's a business strategy right there.

3405
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:01,760
Yeah, I love it.

3406
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:03,520
End of the episode.

3407
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:04,000
Good night.

3408
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:04,560
God bless.

3409
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:05,040
Godspeed.

3410
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:05,360
Goodbye.

3411
02:49:05,360 --> 02:49:05,840
Good night.

3412
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:06,400
See ya.

3413
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:06,880
Bye.

3414
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:07,360
Bye.

3415
02:49:07,360 --> 02:49:07,840
Bye.
