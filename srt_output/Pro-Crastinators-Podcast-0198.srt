00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello everyone, and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast with me, your host, while the best

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,200
guy ever is away on a tiny island off the coast of Hawaii having a hand-to-hand battle

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,600
with a bread garlic house, just like the end of Metal Gear Solid 5.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,600
These people like who's having a hand-to-hand hand job if you ask me.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,600
As in a handshake, they're shaking each other's hands with their penises instead of their hands.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Okay, but let's talk about that. Who do you think, whose grip do you think is gonna come out on top in that...

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Hey everybody, reporting in from the island of Jamaica, where I am originally from. It's me.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
I fucked this up.

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Is this the African Undertaler? Has he returned?

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Bread, have you joined the podcast at last? Bread, did our plan to depose Nate and put you at the top of the poll?

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
No?

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:15,600
The plan was a failure. I'm Nate. I consumed Brad. I'm twice as strong as I've ever been.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
I plan for this contingency as well. It's fine. Let's just continue.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I've absorbed his incredible professionalism, as you can see, to still be here despite being on vacation while so many of our number are unbelievably lazy embarrassments of human beings.

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Total ghosts. Just no sense of common decency or decorum. I would say.

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,600
They've gone ghost and they're not coming back and that's just how I like it.

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Yeah, it's sad.

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Forgive the echo. Forgive the lower mic quality. I'm using a lowly moids, blue yeti, round ass microphone.

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Instead of my pristine recording environment.

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
What is it?

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
It's... well, it is probably...

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I got my snowball ice, which I think is just a snowball but white, so pretty good.

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I don't know. Blue microphones. Wait, snowball ice. Oh, it is a snowball ice.

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
You got a snowball ice too, my dude?

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:37,600
That's what it says on it, yeah. This is Michelle's. She asked to use my microphone years ago and I just beat the shit out of her for daring to use my property.

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I beat the shit out of Econ and stole this one from him, so birds of a feather.

28
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
He's not using it to make any videos or anything.

29
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:52,600
We each had to kick an Asian's ass to get our snowball ice. Birds of a feather.

30
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Oh, it feels good.

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,600
So how's your guys week been? How are you feeling? How's it going for you?

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Well, I like Gib and now an Islander permanently and it feels good.

33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Gib, do you identify with being an Islander like Sora from Kingdom Hearts because you live on a big Island? Or is it too big?

34
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I can't believe they took Sora, a native Islander, a member of the native Islander population and whitewashed him when they cast Haley Joel Osment in Kingdom Hearts.

35
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I mean, if I travel more around Britland, maybe, I usually just go from here to London and then to other cities depending on if I need to be there, but usually I don't go to the seaside.

36
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Like the old days when mother and father, they get us all in the car and drive down to the beach and it would be the beach and then we'd look at it and it's okay.

37
00:03:50,600 --> 00:04:00,600
You know, I wonder, this island is obviously, I mean, I'm on Oahu, that's like the main populated island in the Hawaiian Islands where Honolulu is and stuff.

38
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,600
And they talk about how people can get like a little stir crazy after a while living here and like it is pretty small.

39
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Like you can easily drive around the whole thing in a couple hours, but if I were to think, I'm just, I'm kind of inserting my normal day-to-day life in Cincinnati on top of this place.

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I like travel maybe like two miles, maybe three, like in a day.

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I think you'd probably not make much difference in terms of my daily life living on like a little island versus anywhere else.

42
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Just because, I don't know, like everything I do is on a computer.

43
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,600
The most thing I do drive is like to take Michelle to work and I don't know, go to the store, which is across state lines, I guess.

44
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Although, I guess that across, like, because I live in the Ohio River and stuff.

45
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
You cross state lines to take Michelle to work.

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Do you just happen to live really close to the border?

47
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Yeah, Cincinnati is right on the Kentucky border.

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
It's like the Ohio River is right there and across that is Kentucky.

49
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,600
So I go do my shopping at like the nice store in Kentucky in like Newport, Kentucky or something.

50
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Didn't know that.

51
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Okay, cool.

52
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Yeah, Southwest Ohio.

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Do you, is there a situation where like, okay, all the fucking sovereign stator anarcho-capitalist libertarians live in New Hampshire because they have like low taxes

54
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,600
and like people will like, people here like cross the border to New Hampshire to buy like cigarettes and booze and stuff.

55
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
To buy their beautiful flavored vapes bags of paradise over there.

56
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
It's true, true.

57
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Hey, did you get your flavored vapes yet?

58
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I did, it just arrived like two days ago.

59
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Thank God.

60
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Thank you.

61
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,600
But anyway, I was wondering if there's like a similar situation with like Cincinnati, Kentucky.

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,600
So we better, we better cross the border to get like, I don't know, illegal fireworks or whatever because they're legal over there, but not over here.

63
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Ohio is like very, I guess the word is liberal.

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Like they, there are very open laws and like gun open carry stuff is all good to go in Ohio.

65
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Although, I don't know, me and Michelle were like going to do some gun shooting just for fun the other day.

66
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
So we went to a gun store.

67
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
This is a couple months ago, I guess, but like we, we didn't follow up.

68
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
We're going to do it one of these days.

69
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
But like they said, they actually are like getting a little restrictive.

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,600
So like I did, based on what like the guy selling stuff was saying there, it like does seem like things are a little bit more constrictive.

71
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,600
So like absolutely people like in Cincinnati, it's like, you know, a 10 minute drive and you're in a different state.

72
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,600
And I'm probably, I mean, I'm just judging based on stereotypes and nothing else.

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,600
I assume Kentucky is like more liberal than, than other states.

74
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Because Ohio's like it's where Ohio is technically in the Eastern standard time block.

75
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
And it's like the most Western state that's still Eastern standard time.

76
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,600
So when I moved like what felt like across into fucking eternity from my parents, like in Massachusetts and stuff, I'm still in the same time zone.

77
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,600
But the whole culture is like pervaded with like Southern influence and stuff.

78
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
So I don't know.

79
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Yeah, Kentucky and all that.

80
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,600
There is a culture shock just like from like a short drive across the border.

81
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Like suddenly you're hearing a lot more accents.

82
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
You know, you hear a lot of accents in Ohio already.

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,600
But of course, it's the reality that I live on the internet and rarely interact with other human beings in real life.

84
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,600
So, you know, Michelle probably sees way more than that doing the real world.

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,600
And I was going to say that like the thing about here, like, so Michelle's dad was in the military.

86
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,600
So he has all these awesome military benefits.

87
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
And like the place we live now like used to be a military combat, whatever, it's public now.

88
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,600
But like the point is that like we live like right across from the ocean.

89
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,600
And like Diamond Head is this giant mountain that's the edge of a crater.

90
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
It's like a famous Hawaiian landmark on Oahu.

91
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
You can see that from...

92
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Hang on, I'm going to stand up.

93
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I'm going to stand up and pull the curtain.

94
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,600
And I can see Diamond Head out the window.

95
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Hey, no attention to these...

96
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Did you go mind those fucking things?

97
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Yeah.

98
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,600
It's right that end like the beach is there and like this morning for example.

99
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Little Diamond Helmahamon.

100
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,600
I tweeted about it. I called it Diamond Back like an idiot and looked like a fucking fool to everyone.

101
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
That's pretty rough.

102
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
That's incorrect.

103
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
I went down to the beach this morning as I've done many times.

104
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,600
As the sun was rising from like six to seven and I just did yoga on the beach for a while.

105
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
And it was, that's still going on.

106
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Yep.

107
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
And it was a great time.

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
That's so nice for you.

109
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
It was really nice for me to do that.

110
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
That's so fantastic.

111
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,600
So cool. So unlistening.

112
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
I know I said this before, but like I tried men's yoga.

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
It's too hard. It's too shitty.

114
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
You got to do the girl version.

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
It literally makes me want to kill myself.

116
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
You do the girl version because it's easier.

117
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Girl yoga is a thousand times better.

118
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Let's follow these fucking red pill.

119
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Men's rights activists.

120
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,600
That's the one thing that I really think we should adhere very closely to gender stereotypes on.

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
And I don't really support what you're doing.

122
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Which brand of yoga you ascribe to?

123
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
No. You want the gay, non-mistage stuff.

124
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I don't think that, frankly Nate, I don't think that decision is valid of you.

125
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
That's fair.

126
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
That's well.

127
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Try again.

128
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Every time, I will, Ben.

129
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I go to the gym and I lift weights there and I come home and I do my pussy yoga shit.

130
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Because I'm there for flexibility, right?

131
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm there for getting the knots out.

132
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
So that's what I'm doing.

133
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I go to the gym, I lift weights, I go home, I put it down.

134
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
I stole it.

135
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Yeah, I carry them home.

136
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
It's a cyclical operation.

137
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
I don't know.

138
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Just this general beach activities and stuff.

139
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I've been working, been a little concerned about these.

140
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I've been sending emails once in a while about all the channels being stolen.

141
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
I have given up hope. We're doomed.

142
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm convinced we're fucked, yes.

143
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Really?

144
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
After 16 or 17 days now.

145
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
There was another guy.

146
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I mean, Mars Reviews who also had his channel taken and they just fucking deleted his whole channel.

147
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm convinced that that's gonna happen to us.

148
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Okay, that could happen.

149
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
But even if it gets deleted, it can come back.

150
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,600
YouTube has the authority to restore all deleted videos.

151
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,600
And even I think set back the clock if they get fucked with to some previous state.

152
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
So I've got some hope.

153
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,600
And there's people out there who have...

154
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Panda Popolin?

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Panda Popolin, I think, in the Discord.

156
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Panda Popolin, I think that's him, has downloaded every video on every channel.

157
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Which is probably, I mean, I don't have every canton video, did you?

158
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
To edit all those, I don't have every PCP video.

159
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Me and Tfap.

160
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I did and then Tfap told me he also did have every Tbap video downloaded.

161
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,600
There's probably a couple hidden ones that I got that he probably wasn't able to.

162
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
But the Tbap channel is back.

163
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,600
I really don't want to have to make a new channel and lose all the comments and lose all the views and lose all that history.

164
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:18,600
But I mean, yes, we can re-upload those and probably others, so...

165
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Well, you know, you could go to the videos as they appear still

166
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
and copy-paste the comments into a document just so that you have them.

167
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Well, yeah, but nobody would see that.

168
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I don't really know for myself that much.

169
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,600
No, but if there's a comment from, I don't know, 2014 me

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
and it's like, oh, that's what I said back then.

171
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
That's how I talked.

172
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
That would be a sort of thing.

173
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
You just want to be able to read it again.

174
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
That's so fucking hard.

175
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
You could then...

176
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
It's a lot of work.

177
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I mean, if you really care about keeping the history, that's one of the ways to do it.

178
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
I suppose that's true.

179
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,600
It's slightly unrelated, but one of the things that's been happening on BestieBoy

180
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,600
is that for whatever reason, the hackers have just decided,

181
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
maybe just to get more views, to get more ad revenue on the channel or whatever,

182
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I don't know, whatever it is,

183
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,600
they've been publishing my unlisted BGE monthly cast on...

184
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Fair enough, I guess, just to get as many views as possible.

185
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Love that, love that.

186
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
The worst thing about that is people thinking that you have it back and they don't get it.

187
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, yeah.

188
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
They just sort of like, oh, it's all fine now.

189
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I take a little bit of comfort in that my...

190
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Oh, I've got another ominous thing to say on that front,

191
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
but I don't know exactly which channel these are.

192
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I was going to say that the newest BGE monthly cast is on one of the other little zero sub channels

193
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I had just for whatever test upload purposes or whatever.

194
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,600
So that exists on there, if you're a patron or whatever, you can find it through the Patreon.

195
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,600
But like, I'll say this, you know I've been working on some projects for a thousand years?

196
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:11,600
There are videos that are pieces of unfinished projects on all number of channels

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,600
that I'll just, like the real terror for me, the real fear of God,

198
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:24,600
is in those unfinished projects getting published and people seeing what I've been up to in the unfinished state.

199
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
So like the Ghost in the Shell scene where you are running naked through the streets,

200
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
like that scene that you already filmed.

201
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Exactly.

202
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
That I was planning, when I released it, I was also planning to kill myself in real life

203
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
and that was going to be like a really cool synchronicity thing.

204
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
But I'll have to do it after it comes out and that'll be a real bummer for me.

205
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
You know?

206
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
That sucks.

207
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
That's fucked up.

208
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,600
That video where I planned the release, the gender reveal of my son,

209
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Oh shit, I just spoiled it, goddammit.

210
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Well, you know, all stuff like that.

211
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,600
And the current video I'm editing, you know, that was like, it's like mostly done

212
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,600
and I had it like large, I'm pretty sure I put these on other channels,

213
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
but they might be on there.

214
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
And oh my god, if they publish those, I will just be devastated

215
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
and I just hope that they don't.

216
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Well.

217
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I don't know.

218
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
They might, based on this, they might.

219
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Just delete them, guys.

220
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Brad, dude, listening, please delete those videos.

221
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Please.

222
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Just leave them alone.

223
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Brad, listen, you're a reasonable man.

224
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
We can negotiate this.

225
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,600
The good news is many of those are copyright claimed.

226
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Like a lot of the reason to upload was to test copyright claim stuff

227
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
and like everything there generally gets claimed.

228
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
So hopefully they'll be like, well, there's nothing in here anyway.

229
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
I went to the Twitter.

230
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,600
I was on the Procrastinators Twitter at TPCrastinators

231
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
and I clicked the channel link and it was like this channel does not exist

232
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,600
and I was like, oh my god, it's happening, but no, it's just because they changed the channel name.

233
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Thanks guys.

234
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Oh, I have one other, this is a big piece of news, everybody.

235
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
I'm in a liberal hellscape out here.

236
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,600
It's a true nightmare because in this God for Steak and State of Hawaii,

237
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,600
where, you know, up is down and left is right, gay is straight, etc.

238
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
It is the rainbow state after all.

239
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Like straws.

240
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Straws are like illegal or at least like heavily taxed or something.

241
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Do you have to pay for ones?

242
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,600
They sell the paper ones, they've got all kinds of stuff.

243
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
That's so gross.

244
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Okay, but there's one, I mean, this is kind of a silver lining I suppose.

245
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,600
We went this morning and we had French toast and Bloody Marys for breakfast

246
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
at a local eatery, which was wonderful.

247
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,600
But as straws in the Bloody Marys, I'll upload a picture of this,

248
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,600
they have a very long cylindrical piece of like rigatoni pasta or something like that.

249
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
You know what?

250
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
That makes sense to me.

251
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
That makes sense to me.

252
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I think that sounds okay.

253
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
For a Bloody Mary, for a Bloody Mary.

254
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
It's a little starchy.

255
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
It's a tomato drink and you're drinking it through a piece of pasta?

256
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah, I totally get it.

257
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
It's not bad.

258
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Here, I just posted in the gross disgusting audio links.

259
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Look at that, look at that.

260
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
It's a beautiful drink obviously.

261
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
A piece of pasta.

262
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
It's a ragatoni.

263
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
It looks nice.

264
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Is that cucumber or lime or what is that?

265
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
These are actually pickles.

266
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Oh, okay, okay, pickles.

267
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Gotcha.

268
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
It looks pretty good.

269
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
It looks pretty good.

270
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Once you go right, you'll feel all right.

271
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,600
And these lefty cucks.

272
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Yeah, that's a great segue into what I wanted to talk about.

273
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
But I might go on for a while.

274
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
I might have to rant and rave for a while.

275
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Speaking of lefty cucks, you guys have been following the primaries this week.

276
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,600
You guys have been following the IoCoxys.

277
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
It's pretty good.

278
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
It's pretty cool.

279
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Like Twitter knowledge, Twitter level knowledge of that.

280
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
What is it?

281
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Please explain.

282
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Okay.

283
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Let me try and back up and be as succinct as possible and trying to explain what's going

284
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,600
on with the United States presidential elections this cycle.

285
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Okay, so do you guys know what the IoCoxys are?

286
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
To choose the representative for the party.

287
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
But the thing is, it is not a primary vote.

288
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
It is a caucus.

289
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,600
And what that means is people have to gather up in a fucking gyms across the state and

290
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
literally...

291
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
And lift weights to decide who the president is.

292
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:45,600
No, they have to move around into groups and gather into crowds to vote for their guy.

293
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Okay, before the primary, before the caucus, there was a...

294
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Wait, vote as in they cuss a vote or people count the crowds?

295
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
They basically count the crowds.

296
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:01,600
But then if someone doesn't hit 15% of the crowd, they're deemed unviable and they say,

297
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
okay, this candidate's out.

298
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
You guys can realign yourselves if you want to.

299
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
And those people can go either way.

300
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,600
A lot of people in the Yang crowd were disappointed that Yang was not viable and they went over

301
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
to...

302
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
A lot of them went over to Sanders.

303
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Surprisingly, a lot of Biden crowds were not viable and those people probably went and

304
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
shot themselves or whatever.

305
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Yeah, probably.

306
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Okay, that's not even...

307
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
It's really complicated.

308
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
There's these two alignments.

309
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
You move around in physical crowds.

310
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
They count the heads.

311
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
They total them up.

312
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,600
There's some arcane mathematics to determine something called SDEs, which are state delegate

313
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
somethings.

314
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
And then those state delegates go from each precinct to...

315
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,600
They each go to some fucking shadowy core place.

316
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,600
And those SDEs all convene and cast the vote that's been decided for them.

317
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,600
And that determines how many delegates each candidate gets, right?

318
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
So it's like...

319
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
You think the fucking primary...

320
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
You think that the electoral college is fucked up and too complicated.

321
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,600
The caucus system is way worse, right?

322
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
It's so bizarre.

323
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
I'm wondering if the caucus...

324
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Still don't get it.

325
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
How does the app tie in if they're caucusing in person?

326
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
The app.

327
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Okay.

328
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
So this caucus happens.

329
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
They do their fucking shit.

330
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
They record the results.

331
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,600
The DNC, the people running it, they're given this app to report the results to the DNC.

332
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
And the app fails.

333
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
The app just completely fails.

334
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Last time, it took them like two hours to have like most of the votes tallied.

335
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
This time, it took them three fucking days.

336
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
It worked on Excel spreadsheet.

337
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Yeah, a fucking pencil could have done it.

338
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
So, all right.

339
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
So there's this huge...

340
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Now, I'm sitting there.

341
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
It's caucus night.

342
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
I'm watching the results roll in.

343
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
I'm sitting there for hours and hours just waiting for it to roll in.

344
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
And I see...

345
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Here's my...

346
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I see like...

347
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Oh, a couple...

348
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,600
If there's like 1% reporting in and it's like...

349
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Oh, it looks like Sanders in the lead.

350
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Buttigieg is second.

351
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Wow.

352
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Didn't expect Buttigieg to be second.

353
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
He was kind of trailing.

354
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
And then Moore comes in.

355
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,600
It's like 1.8% results in.

356
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
And it's like, oh, Buttigieg is in the lead.

357
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Like what?

358
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
That's kind of weird.

359
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
But it's like, okay, this is 1%.

360
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
This is not representative.

361
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,600
And then like Buttigieg comes out ahead, but then like we're less than 2%.

362
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,600
And like they tally up again and Sanders takes the lead again.

363
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
And I'm like, okay.

364
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
And then the results go dark, right?

365
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Like everything just disappears after Sanders comes back ahead.

366
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,600
And so like days later, they start reporting again.

367
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
And I'm watching the fucking...

368
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,600
I'm watching the official tally on the New York Times website.

369
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
And again, it's like...

370
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,600
They're like 62%, 71%, like 80%.

371
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
And again, like Buttigieg in the lead and like Sanders behind,

372
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
but like every time they report more results,

373
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
it's like creeping closer and closer.

374
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,600
They get to like 99% or they get to like the last like 3%.

375
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Right?

376
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
It's like 97.

377
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
And it's like, oh, Buttigieg like a whole like 1% ahead, right?

378
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
A pretty narrow, it's like 1% ahead.

379
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Then they report like one more percent and it closes entirely.

380
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Sanders 0.1% behind.

381
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Like so closely tied that it doesn't even matter,

382
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
but they only reported just enough to not put Sanders in the lead.

383
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,600
And then the fucking DNC chair, Tom Perez,

384
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
he's like, you know what, actually fuck this.

385
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
We're recanvassing the whole state.

386
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Like right at that very moment.

387
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
In the places where, by the way,

388
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
the places where delegates were like largely unreported

389
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,600
were like Sanders heavy districts like Des Moines.

390
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
So wait, wait, wait, one more thing, one more thing.

391
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,600
And then like just yesterday, like the DNC puts out a notice

392
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,600
that's like, okay, yeah, we're recanvassing the state.

393
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,600
We're like recounting, but we're not going to change the results.

394
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Like whatever the wrong results are we got,

395
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
we're just going to go with it.

396
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
We're going to recount to see what we did wrong,

397
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,600
but we're not going to fix the results.

398
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
I said to honor the integrity of the election.

399
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
How is there integrity if you mess the entire thing up?

400
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
That just makes sense.

401
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
There's like graph, I got a graph here.

402
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Someone in my, on Twitter, someone posted this fucking image

403
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,600
showing how like, okay, because like independent sources

404
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
totaled up like how many errors there are in the caucus

405
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
and like which candidates they favor.

406
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
So I just, I just, yeah.

407
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Oh boy.

408
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Guess what this, guess what the takeaway here is.

409
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Wait.

410
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,600
I bet our boy, the mayor is going to be looking real.

411
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
So look at the errors.

412
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Once to the right are detrimental.

413
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Once to the left are positive.

414
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,600
So overwhelmingly the errors in the calculations

415
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,600
disadvantage Bernie and advantaged Buttigieg.

416
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Ben, it's a statistical fluke.

417
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I know, I know.

418
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,600
I better take my fucking tinfoil hat off, right?

419
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,600
I'm just being one of a conspiratorial Bernie bro.

420
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
This is a fucking Jeffrey Epstein level.

421
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Like obviously, like I already know, I've heard that like Pete

422
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
is like somewhat involved with the app that was made.

423
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Pete is CIA.

424
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
And yes, and that's not even the half of it because the app

425
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,600
that failed that allowed for so much gross incompetence

426
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
and obviously corruption to take place.

427
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Pete Buttigieg funded it.

428
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
The app is called Shadow Incorporated,

429
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
or the company is called Shadow Incorporated.

430
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,600
The CEO is a Buttigieg guy.

431
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Her husband is like literally works for Pete.

432
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
So this is cool.

433
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Okay.

434
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
And you know what?

435
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
That's fine.

436
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
One rigged primary.

437
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
That's fine.

438
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Whatever.

439
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
It's no big deal.

440
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
But the real fucking tragedy here is that they did it.

441
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
They released the data in such a way.

442
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Like they timed everything perfectly so that like

443
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
they never have to say Sanders is in the lead.

444
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
CNN can fucking spin it to say,

445
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,600
oh Buttigieg maintains narrow lead going into the New Hampshire primaries.

446
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,600
So like they announce a bit of Sanders

447
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
and then immediately Pete is, you know,

448
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
more data to show that Pete's in the lead.

449
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,600
So there's no like new cycle where Sanders could be at the time.

450
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Yes.

451
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
With 0% data reported,

452
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Pete goes on Twitter and says,

453
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
thank you everyone for this victory in Iowa.

454
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Declare's victory without any fucking data.

455
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
You know, I listened to some of those things.

456
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,600
I thought that because like everybody went on to like announce victory.

457
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Bernie did it later.

458
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Bernie did it later after the votes were tapped.

459
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Bernie declared victory because he did,

460
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,600
he did win the popular vote by 6,000 votes.

461
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Right.

462
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
And they have like an equal,

463
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
they have an equal amount of delegates, I think.

464
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
And if they don't, like it's,

465
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
it's like because of 0.1%.

466
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
It's like totally stupid.

467
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
I mean, whatever.

468
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
If you're Bernie at this point.

469
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
What the fuck?

470
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Okay.

471
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Okay.

472
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
So this all happens.

473
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Bernie gets rat fucked by the DNC.

474
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Pete is CIA.

475
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Pete, Wall Street Pete is a fucking cheat.

476
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
That's what's going on.

477
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
And you know what?

478
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
It's looking like it worked.

479
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,600
It's looking like controlling the narrative like this has worked

480
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,600
and Pete is surging in New Hampshire now

481
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,600
where Sanders was the favorite to win.

482
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
So, yeah, really.

483
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Wow.

484
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
He can't be Bernie in New Hampshire.

485
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Okay.

486
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
I don't know.

487
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Polls conflict.

488
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Polls have been showing conflicting things.

489
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Like at worst,

490
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,600
polls have shown that Pete is like close to Sanders.

491
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Some still show Sanders with a substantial lead.

492
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Apparently this morning,

493
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Pete had like the biggest turnout for his like rally

494
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,600
because they're all doing rallies today.

495
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Supposedly, according to social media.

496
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
What the fuck?

497
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Pete got the biggest turnout.

498
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Okay.

499
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
So this has got me,

500
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,600
this has been like the worst week of my entire life.

501
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
This is a fucking nightmare, right?

502
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I don't like Pete.

503
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Pete's bad.

504
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
And I was mad about it.

505
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,600
And I was thinking like, man, this is shaking.

506
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
I was all for vote blue no matter who.

507
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Like I love Bernie,

508
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
but I was still going to swallow my pride

509
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,600
and vote Hillary or whatever.

510
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
And then this happens and I'm like,

511
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
they're just cheating.

512
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Like they're just cheating.

513
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
And I'm really mad.

514
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
They literally cheated provably last time.

515
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
For sure.

516
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Yeah.

517
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
And once it's the first fucking,

518
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
not even a primary, a caucus,

519
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
and like we're already fucking cheating.

520
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
It's obvious,

521
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
but like,

522
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
but fucking moms at home don't,

523
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
don't follow Twitter.

524
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
They're not looking up graphs like this, right?

525
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
They're just like CNN says,

526
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Oh yeah, wow,

527
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Pete narrowly beat Bernie and they,

528
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
and they slurped their fucking wine on their couch

529
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,600
as their husband fucking fucks the secretary.

530
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
And they're, and they're just like, yeah, he's,

531
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Oh, what a nice young gay man.

532
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
You know, like, like,

533
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Oh yeah.

534
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
He looks like a politician.

535
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Doesn't he?

536
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Yes.

537
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
So, so I was worried about that.

538
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
But like then this morning,

539
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
or then yesterday,

540
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
I get fucking scared, right?

541
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
I get fucking scared.

542
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
I didn't even know this about Pete.

543
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Apparently Pete wants mandatory military service

544
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
for every kid in America.

545
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Like in the Boy Scouts?

546
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,600
No, like you serve in the military for a year

547
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
when you graduate high school.

548
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Like Israel or something.

549
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
It's just like, yes, like Israel.

550
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Okay.

551
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Yes.

552
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Okay.

553
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Yes.

554
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
So, um, yeah.

555
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
I don't like that.

556
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
It's like we,

557
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
it's like we,

558
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
we want to establish an expectation for mandatory service.

559
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Um, the, I didn't,

560
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
I didn't know this.

561
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
I see this and I'm like, oh my God.

562
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Maybe you know community service,

563
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
you know, you'd pick up some trash in the weekend,

564
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
a little.

565
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
No.

566
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Even that, I obviously.

567
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Military means military.

568
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
I mean,

569
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
it's,

570
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
it could just be an office job,

571
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,600
but it's still like in the realm of things you wouldn't want.

572
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
I certainly agree.

573
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Like mandatory anything.

574
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Yeah.

575
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Let me, I mean, let me find the,

576
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
let me try and find the graphic.

577
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Sure, sure.

578
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Here it is.

579
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Here it is.

580
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Pete's vision.

581
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Let's, let's, let's read about.

582
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
I can't wait to see our future president's vision personally.

583
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
I'm looking forward to it.

584
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Oh boy.

585
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Oh boy.

586
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Um, hold on.

587
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Sorry, I gotta, uh, I don't mean read,

588
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
read this and judge for yourself.

589
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
I guess.

590
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Oh, our, our,

591
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
this is from his website.

592
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
It looks like.

593
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Yep.

594
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Our intention is for this proposal to create a pathway towards

595
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
a universal national expectation of service

596
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,600
for all four million high school graduates every year,

597
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
such that the first question asked out of every college

598
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
freshman or new hire is where did you serve a new generation

599
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,600
of American youth bound by mutual service and sacrifice,

600
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
aware of the common values that bind all Americans,

601
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,600
uh, influenced by the experience of da, da, da, da, da.

602
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

603
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Yeah.

604
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Uh, hmm.

605
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Okay.

606
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,600
And, and this is apparently from a.

607
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Okay.

608
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Apparently you have to sign up for his email list to even get to

609
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
this part of his website.

610
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Let's see.

611
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
So.

612
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Okay.

613
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
So this, so this is where we're at people.

614
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
This is where we're at.

615
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,600
We've got this fucking rat, this little fucking rat fucker,

616
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600
uh, surging in the polls because the media,

617
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I guess.

618
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Because he did his way.

619
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
So much.

620
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Yeah.

621
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Yeah.

622
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Um, and because.

623
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
We need Bloomberg to save us honestly.

624
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Bloomberg, come in here.

625
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Just, you know, get Pete out of here.

626
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Let's go.

627
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,600
I mean, it's, it's exactly the same sort of stuff that happened

628
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,600
in the, in the fucking Jeremy Corbyn.

629
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Yeah.

630
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
The most recent election.

631
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Really?

632
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
Yeah.

633
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Where he lost a lot because everyone like piled on as soon as

634
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
the election had started.

635
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,600
It was all about shitting on Jeremy Corbyn as much as in as hard as possible

636
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,600
constantly and not shitting on the opposition quite as much.

637
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
And you know, the media does what the media does.

638
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,600
They get, they do what they're told by whoever's got the power.

639
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,600
And it's like, I mean Jeremy Corbyn, like arguably wouldn't have been that great

640
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,600
a leader, but it, the demonstrably like, you know, he was demonized beyond what he

641
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
was actually like.

642
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
They called him like anti-Semitic and stuff, right?

643
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Yeah.

644
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,600
It's, it's like, it's all about when the election happens, it's all about lying

645
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,600
as hard as you can, as loudly as you can for just long enough for people who don't

646
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,600
actually pay attention that much to get some sort of idea in their heads.

647
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,600
And then when they go to the polls, you, you win, you know.

648
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Hell yeah.

649
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
That's just, that's how it is.

650
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,600
If it wasn't for the graph that you posted, Ben, I mean, okay, this is all still

651
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,600
in theory, explainable simply by incompetence.

652
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Nate, sure.

653
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
It's possible.

654
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Look at that, look at the fucking, look at them.

655
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
I mean, the difference.

656
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
I mean, you're, you're not wrong.

657
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
You're not the, the.

658
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
In theory.

659
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Yeah, Nate.

660
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,600
In theory, fucking, uh, remember when like Dr. Manhattan is like holding up the ring

661
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,600
and he's like, I've yearning to see a quantum event wherein like a molecule spontaneously

662
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
turns into gold.

663
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,600
In theory, that's explainable by a random chance.

664
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
I guess you're right.

665
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Okay.

666
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Real quick.

667
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
At the bottom, I see this negative two on the left to the three on the bottom.

668
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
What, what are those numbers indicate?

669
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
I see SD.

670
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
That is, that is S.

671
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Okay.

672
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,600
You got your, you got your people show up to vote.

673
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Right.

674
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,600
With their, where they stand, like which group they stand in.

675
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,600
And then they get, they realign into like a new, like grouping for where they're going

676
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
to vote.

677
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Um, those numbers are tallied and through some sort of mathematics that I don't know what

678
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
it is.

679
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Oh.

680
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,600
A number is calc, the SDEs are calculated.

681
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Okay.

682
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,600
And that is basically how many like state internal delegate, the SDEs.

683
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,760
I don't know what SDU stands for, but it's like the state internal delegates that are

684
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,120
going to like get basically how many points from that precinct they win based on the vote.

685
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,880
And then those points gets, get like all added together from all precincts.

686
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,960
And then those point totals are again used in some weird math that I don't understand

687
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,960
to determine how many final, like actual state delegates go to the primary vote.

688
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Understand?

689
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Okay.

690
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Okay.

691
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
I think so.

692
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
I thought at the bottom that would have been like.

693
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,960
SDE is like an intermediary calculation between actual vote and like, and like delegates

694
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
assigned.

695
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
When I, when I looked at the bottom, I saw numbers.

696
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,640
So like the larger, um, areas in a state or whatever to account for like the differences

697
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,960
in size or like the ruralness.

698
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,960
Yeah.

699
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Like, like how, like, like the Des Moines precincts got like way more SDEs because they're

700
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
like much more heavily populated.

701
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Sure.

702
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Sure.

703
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,680
So as you, so as you can see, because of this, and the race was incredible, remember there

704
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,960
was like a 0.1% difference.

705
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Uh, Buttigieg.

706
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
So, so he basically should have won.

707
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,960
I mean, if there wasn't massive incompetence, clearly.

708
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
This is the takeaway.

709
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Buttigieg gained more than two, like two and change whole SDEs and Bernie lost almost three.

710
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
I have one other question about this.

711
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
I don't know if this is true or not.

712
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,960
I heard that Buttigieg had basically gone all in on Iowa.

713
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,960
So it was expected that he would perform well even though nationally he's doing that well

714
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,960
because he's specifically focused in Iowa with the hope of like getting some snowball effect.

715
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
I guess it worked.

716
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,960
He, I mean, by any metric he did outperform.

717
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Like he was not like the polls I was seeing had him getting like 15%.

718
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,960
It was like the polls I was seeing were like Warren and Biden, sorry, Sanders and Biden

719
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,960
tied for front and then like Warren and Pete like pretty like trailing pretty far behind

720
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
in third place.

721
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Uh, I don't think anyone expected because he did even, even with a knot, if you, if you,

722
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,960
if we fixed all these errors, he's definitely like in a strong second place, which is really bad

723
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
and upsetting on it.

724
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Like even that alone would be cause for alarm.

725
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Um, no, the fact that they cheated to put him over the edge and be able to say, oh, Pete

726
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
won Iowa.

727
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
Uh, that's, that's a problem.

728
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Anyway, I'm seeing that headline.

729
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
I'm, yeah, I'm seeing, that's, that's all they want.

730
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
That's all they want.

731
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,960
And then I'm seeing, I'm seeing them trending on Twitter.

732
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
I'm seeing this like, oh, wow.

733
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Okay.

734
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,960
People this morning are saying huge crowd for Pete at his rally this morning.

735
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,960
However, at the like, they had an event last night where like all the candidates came out

736
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,960
on stage and talked and while Pete was out, the crowd started chanting wall street, Pete,

737
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,960
wall street, Pete, wall street, Pete, um, which is great and all.

738
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Um, oh, and then, uh, Trump, uh, Trump didn't get impeached.

739
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Oh, well, no, who could have seen, who could have seen that coming?

740
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Did you see, uh, Nancy Pelosi ripping up the speech?

741
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
Tear up the paper.

742
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Yeah.

743
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
I don't know.

744
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
People are mad.

745
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Who cares?

746
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Whatever.

747
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
She's mad.

748
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Oh, who's, it's fine.

749
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
Well, okay.

750
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I'll give my, uh, uh, people be, uh, fucking people on Twitter.

751
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Oh, who's that one, that one fucking pundit is like, that is like, it was like, this is,

752
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,960
this is the most, this is the most disgraceful event that's ever been seen in Congress.

753
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,960
And it's like somewhat, then someone replied like some, like some senator or congressman

754
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,960
like literally like physically beat the shit out of another one.

755
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
I heard about that.

756
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
For like saying slavery was bad.

757
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,960
There was like emotional abolish slavery and a man, he got tamed nearly to death by his

758
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,960
fellow senators on the floor of the Senate like 150 years ago or something.

759
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,960
But this, this, this is just beyond the fuck.

760
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Okay.

761
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Uh, Trump, Trumpites and conservatives are such fucking coward snowflakes that they cry

762
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
and whine about tearing up some paper.

763
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
But also fuck Nancy Pelosi.

764
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,960
She, this is like bullshit performative politics and means nothing.

765
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Oh yeah.

766
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
Sleigh queen.

767
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Sleigh.

768
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Yeah, it's, yeah.

769
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,960
I saw, I saw, I saw Sean tweet, Sean tweeted like Nancy Pelosi will vote for Trump's third

770
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,960
term, but everyone will applaud because she'll give him the finger while she like Ollie's

771
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
out on a skateboard or something.

772
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Well, I was like, yeah, that's about right.

773
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,960
I mean, on the whole subject of this whole thing, I mean, obviously the line from Trump

774
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,960
and his allies is going to be like, I mean, what's the real embarrassment here?

775
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Like tearing up or what's the real disgrace?

776
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,960
You know, uh, fucking like impeaching the presidents over, you know, things that arguably

777
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,960
they think didn't, at the very least they knew nothing would come of it.

778
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
They got Mitt Romney's vote, bro.

779
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
We did it.

780
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
We got bipartisanship.

781
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Yeah, but they were, they were never going to, they were never going to, man, it's, it's

782
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,960
fucking wild how it's just like Democrats.

783
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,960
It, it, except for like Mitt Rom, except for Mitt Romney, who went pro impeach and Tulsi

784
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Gabbard, who just, who should have voted impeach, but for some reason declined to.

785
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Um, they, it was completely partisan.

786
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Like every Democrat voted impeach, every Republican voted not in both fucking houses.

787
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
It's fucking wild.

788
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
Yeah.

789
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,960
So yeah, it was, it was obviously never going to work and it was a waste of time and it's

790
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,960
just emboldened Trump's support and they go, ha, ha, ha, four more years.

791
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Ha, ha, he can, he's so fucking powerful.

792
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Oh, fucking suck my dick, Daddy Trump.

793
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,960
It's mostly just sad that, I don't know, things are in that way, but whatever.

794
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I haven't said that a million times.

795
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
I guess we'll get over it eventually.

796
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
I don't know.

797
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
Um, well, it's a nightmare.

798
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Um, what else are they going to say?

799
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
Oh yeah.

800
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,960
How do you think this bodes for the Democrats election coming up, Ben?

801
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
What do you think?

802
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
It's real.

803
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
It's real bad.

804
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Um, I mean, even if we got, even if Pete were the nominee, uh, he wouldn't win.

805
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Sanders is the only one who might win.

806
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,960
And even him, like, even him, I'm not like, I'm not like a hundred percent sure.

807
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
If it came down to Sanders v.

808
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Trump, it might be a coin toss.

809
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
Um, oh God.

810
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Anyway, I'm in physical pain.

811
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,960
I'm literally in physical pain, like every day, um, because I'm so fucking worried about,

812
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
about it.

813
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
I'm like following it constantly.

814
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
I can't sleep.

815
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
I can't eat, uh, my back hurts.

816
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Um.

817
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
When's New Hampshire?

818
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
That's the next one, right?

819
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
New Hampshire.

820
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
When's that?

821
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
New Hampshire.

822
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Well, listener, by the time you hear this, it will have already happened because it's on

823
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Tuesday and, um, there will probably be a whole new cycle of rat fuckery and, uh, cowardice,

824
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
uh, from the DNC.

825
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,960
And, uh, uh, these fucking drooling MAGA fucks will, uh, be, will just, will clap their hands

826
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,960
like seals and bleed, and, uh, it'll be fucking amazing.

827
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Speaking of seals, uh, monk seals are extremely protected, they're an endangered species in

828
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Hawaii.

829
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,960
I just got a sick pick with one on the beach this morning.

830
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Wow, man.

831
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
You gotta check this out, man.

832
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
You gotta see this.

833
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
That's so great for you.

834
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
It's really good.

835
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,960
I'm so, I'm so glad for your seal picture.

836
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Oh, there was also a dog wearing goggles?

837
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
What?

838
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
No.

839
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Wow.

840
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Yeah, dude.

841
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,960
Cool.

842
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
I'm gonna turn him into the ocean.

843
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,960
You know, we thought we might be going skydiving or something sick like that.

844
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Turns out, we asked the guy, or Michelle did.

845
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,960
He's just, uh, uh, German Shepherds, which he was, uh, are sensitive to UV light.

846
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,960
So he just wears these cool goggles, uh, like a Digimon main character, uh, to protect

847
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
his eyes from UV light.

848
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
You don't even get very close to him.

849
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Look at that fucking love.

850
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
See that sign?

851
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
See that sign right there?

852
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,960
You are not allowed to, by state law, get any closer to those fucking seals, uh, than

853
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,960
you are there.

854
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
I'm like, that's not gonna work.

855
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
Well, really, you're not allowed to touch him.

856
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
You're not allowed to touch him.

857
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
You're not allowed to touch him.

858
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,960
But these, okay, I'm gonna call them these island autists, get so up in their fucking

859
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
shit about, don't touch the turtles.

860
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
Don't touch the seals.

861
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
Uh, I'm not gonna touch it.

862
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
I'm just gonna pet it.

863
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,960
I'm just gonna give him a little pet, and he's gonna love it.

864
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
It's gonna be sick.

865
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
He's gonna thank me.

866
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Um, so don't, don't freak out.

867
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
But, uh, yeah, he's snoozing.

868
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,960
We went to, uh, this little island out, uh, Chinaman's Hat.

869
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Uh, yep, it's called Chinaman's Hat, is the name of this little island.

870
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,960
That's, that's that, like, black thing sticking out there?

871
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
Uh, no, no, no.

872
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
This is, uh, it's on the north, this is facing the south side.

873
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
It's on the north side of the island, I think.

874
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
Uh, we, we got kayaks yesterday.

875
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,960
We paddled out, and when we got out to that island, first of all, we nearly died on the

876
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,960
way back because the winds picked up to an insane degree, and, uh, let me, it was one,

877
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,960
one of our group fell over in their kayaks and were being pushed towards the rocks, and

878
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,960
like, one of our, like, the guides had to jump out of his canoe, swim over and save them

879
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,960
like dying, and he came back with, like, a huge fucking bloody mass on his leg because

880
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
he took the hit to, like, save him from the rocks.

881
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
It was fucked up.

882
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Um, but it was also awesome, uh, and I loved it, and it was totally cool.

883
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,960
But on the beach, on Chinaman's Hat, there was just a big old seal just hanging out on

884
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
there, and I got way closer.

885
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,960
I was probably, like, I don't know, maybe 10 feet away, but you're not allowed to touch

886
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
him.

887
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Everyone gets way in your case about it, but, uh, he was cool.

888
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
He was cool.

889
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,960
Natives do, or tourists do?

890
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Well, I mean natives, which I understand.

891
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,960
It's, uh, they're, they're very into, uh, conserve, uh, what are the conservationism?

892
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,960
Fucking idiots trying to conserve their precious wildlife.

893
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
It is embarrassing, Frank.

894
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
Get over it.

895
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,960
There's chickens that wander around everywhere here, and I think they're also protected.

896
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Although I know they're delicious.

897
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,960
So, uh, it's my time.

898
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
I'm not protected forever.

899
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,960
Um, oh, one, one last thing.

900
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
I wake up today.

901
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:43,960
I wake up to say, and I see hashtag AntifaTerrorist trending on Twitter because, uh, I guess

902
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,960
the KKK are having a rally in Portland or something, and, uh, and, yeah, and Antifa's

903
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,960
there, and, uh, fucking, and of course, fucking Andy Ngo.

904
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,960
Andy fucking Ngo is there to post some, like, yeah, to post some, like, some, like, totally

905
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,960
ambiguous footage that he claims is like, oh, Antifa pushes a woman in front of a car,

906
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,960
and, like, it doesn't even really look like it, but, like, he says it, so I guess it's

907
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
better.

908
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Guys, forget Antifa.

909
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
We gotta talk about the real scourge.

910
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,960
I saw a video this morning of furries bashing, I believe it was a Chrysler vehicle, apropos

911
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
of nothing as far as I can tell.

912
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
Not, not Chrysler.

913
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Not Chrysler.

914
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Not one of our good American companies.

915
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
I heard something, like, animal.

916
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Are they, are they American?

917
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
I don't know.

918
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
I think they are.

919
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,960
They were just chanting, like, something about, like, animal testing.

920
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
I don't know.

921
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,960
Just Chrysler, do animal testing?

922
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
I don't know.

923
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
I'm unaware, but they're the real scourge.

924
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,960
I mean, they were just in full fursuit, two guys bashing a car.

925
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,960
Did they have, like, like, claw, like, weapons in their paws?

926
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,960
No, they were just holding a baseball bat in their, in their disgustingly human-like hands,

927
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,960
which was a problem, though.

928
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Oh, not human hands.

929
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
No, no commitment.

930
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,960
You gotta at least, like, you know, gaffer tape the bat to the paws as we get around.

931
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Hold it in your mouth and swing it, like, like Sora in the Lion King order.

932
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,960
Like Zorlo.

933
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,960
Oh, speaking of Sora, I'm definitely going to do a picture where I pose, like, like,

934
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Sora from Kingdom Hearts 2, the title screen.

935
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,960
We're standing in the water with a popsicle in his mouth.

936
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,960
Look for that on my Instagram soon, instagram.com, slash bestestguyever.

937
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
I'm thinking about, I want to commit to this.

938
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,960
I want to mod a copy of Kingdom Hearts 2.

939
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,960
I plan an emulator where I use whatever image I produce in this way as the title screen.

940
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
Oh, I love Kingdom Hearts.

941
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
Wait.

942
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
Oh, it's good.

943
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,960
I don't understand the plan.

944
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Here, I'll show you.

945
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,960
To take a picture, doing the pose, and then put that in the game.

946
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,960
So when he plays the game, he sees himself and he says, oh.

947
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
I'll go, ooh, it's me.

948
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,960
And then I can distribute this as, like, you know, the good version of Kingdom Hearts 2.

949
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,960
You know, the vastly improved.

950
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,960
I'll be an elite modder, just like Econ.

951
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
It'll be great.

952
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,960
I bet I could make that happen.

953
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,960
I don't know stuff.

954
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,960
You know, speaking back on, like, the whole lefty stuff.

955
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
I have been.

956
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Antifa's the good guys, people.

957
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
Antifa is the good guys.

958
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Figure it out.

959
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Yes.

960
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,960
I mean, I have been watching a lot of specific bread tube, a philosophy tube, and contrapoints.

961
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,960
I've just been, like, playing Dark Souls and then having that on in the background and

962
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,960
learning all about these things, such as, I forget all of them.

963
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,960
But Antifa was one of the things that they talked about.

964
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
They talked about how Antifa, I mean.

965
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Was it a contrapoints video?

966
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Yeah.

967
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,960
It was a philosophy tube.

968
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,960
Okay.

969
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,960
But like the, you know.

970
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
Let's talk about it.

971
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
Please, let's talk about it.

972
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,960
I mean, I've watched so many of these videos that they sort of bled together and I can't,

973
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,960
like, pull specific lines out.

974
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,960
But, you know, I get the gist.

975
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,960
I understand that it's the false equivalency that is the problem.

976
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
It is the false equivalency that is the problem.

977
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
It's true.

978
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
It's true.

979
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,960
There's, you know, there's a lot more nuance and interesting thoughts in the videos.

980
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
It's fucking ghouls on Twitter.

981
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,960
It's fucking Andy Ngo types who just make money.

982
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,960
God, the video of someone quote pushing, he says, Antifa pushes a woman in front of a

983
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,960
car, right?

984
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,960
In the video, it's not clear who pushes her.

985
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,960
And there is a car on the road, but it's like pretty far down the road and it's not even

986
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
moving that fast.

987
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,960
And like the woman seems annoyed to have been pushed, but not like afraid for her life at

988
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,960
all.

989
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,960
So, but whatever.

990
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,960
The comments are just like hundreds and thousands of people being like attempted murder.

991
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
Where are the police?

992
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,960
Why doesn't the mayor crack down on these terrorists?

993
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,960
Like, if I were there, if I were there, I would have shot them.

994
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,960
Hashtag concealed carry.

995
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,960
It's just so weird because like there was this bit where he was saying like they use

996
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,960
the fact that Antifa wears masks for very clearly useful reasons so that they don't get

997
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,960
attacked themselves later.

998
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,960
By people like Andy Goh, Andy Goh who will fucking dox them.

999
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,960
And it's like it's not necessarily an indication of violence.

1000
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,960
You want to protest something and you don't want to get backlash for it and it's not illegal

1001
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,960
to wear a mask.

1002
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:12,960
But he was making the comparison that like riot police wear masks and they wear black

1003
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,960
and it's like the things people are talking about Antifa for being like terrorists, bullies,

1004
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,960
horrible people, the police as well.

1005
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,960
Which, you know, I think we can all agree that they're kind of a lot worse in every way.

1006
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Dude, ACAB.

1007
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:35,960
The Munchy, so I'm on Munchy's Audible subscription and he has got, he got me to read.

1008
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,960
We talked about this book Debt.

1009
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,960
Debt the first 5,000 years.

1010
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,960
He told me to listen to it.

1011
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,960
I did.

1012
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,960
We both think it's fucking great.

1013
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,960
And I have talked about, I think I've mentioned before that I've been meaning to read this

1014
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,960
book called Bullshit Jobs, which is about how like in America a lot of the jobs that exist

1015
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,960
are basically just like fake and made up and unnecessary and do not exist to like serve

1016
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,960
any material purpose.

1017
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,960
They are just like a product of like corporate bureaucracy.

1018
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:13,960
And then, and Munchy's like, hey, I got another book by the Debt guy and it's about like

1019
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,960
apparently this Debt guy, he was like one of like the organizers for the like Occupy Wall Street

1020
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,960
movement and it's like about that whole, the whole experience of like what the Occupy Wall

1021
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,960
Street movement was about.

1022
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,960
It's called, oh fuck, that one's called Democracy Something?

1023
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,960
It's called Democracy.

1024
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,960
I forget the full title.

1025
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,960
It doesn't matter.

1026
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,960
But it turns out this guy, David Graber?

1027
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Joshua, I think it's David Graber.

1028
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,960
The guy who wrote Debt is the guy who wrote Bullshit Jobs, which I have not read yet,

1029
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
but it's on the list.

1030
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,960
It's next to my list.

1031
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,960
I'm going to listen to it.

1032
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,960
And he also is the guy who did this.

1033
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:56,960
He was this like front runner in the Occupy Wall Street movement and he's my new hero.

1034
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Like what a fucking, what a fucking Chad.

1035
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,960
He's fucking, he's doing it, man.

1036
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,960
He's doing it.

1037
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
Oh boy.

1038
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:11,960
I just want to quickly say, I didn't mean like, that like all police are worse in every way.

1039
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,960
That was just like, it's the hypocrisy that the people who are complaining about Antifa

1040
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,960
don't complain about the police for doing the same things to people that they don't like,

1041
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,960
like minorities.

1042
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,960
It's pretty appalling.

1043
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,960
It's pretty appalling.

1044
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,960
People calling for like Antifa to be labeled like a terrorist organization and stuff.

1045
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,960
They're so fucking scared.

1046
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:41,960
They're so, these conservative types, these gun wielding maniacs are so fucking scared

1047
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,960
of these like, of these like, oh, these thugs, oh, these, they're like, they're like demonstrably

1048
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,960
so much less violent.

1049
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,960
They have like right wing extremism kills like hundreds of people a year and Tifa's

1050
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,960
never killed anyone.

1051
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,960
They just, they basically just throw milkshakes and like squirts silly string of people,

1052
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,960
which is kind of like sad, but it's true.

1053
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,960
Like that's what they do.

1054
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,960
Maybe a window gets broken once in a while.

1055
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,960
And there was that one guy with the bike lock.

1056
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,960
Okay.

1057
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,960
Everyone's like, oh, that one guy with the bike lock.

1058
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,960
Okay.

1059
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,960
That was bad.

1060
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
Right.

1061
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,960
Nobody likes that guy.

1062
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,960
Everybody fucking hates that guy.

1063
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:23,960
The thing that really strikes me about like a philosophy tube and contra points, aside

1064
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:29,960
from like their, their reasonableness in tackling these issues and not, you know, they appear

1065
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,960
on the outside to be like, oh, outlandish lefty stupid idiots.

1066
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,960
But like the things they say are like, oh, you know, they win people over clearly because

1067
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,960
I used, I didn't used to be a right wing guy.

1068
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,960
Like I had been conditioned by seeing that side of YouTube more and not seeing the left

1069
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,960
side of YouTube that the types of people that are stupid look and sound like, you know,

1070
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,960
left people.

1071
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,960
If you can ever see or hear a lefty idea sort of thinker, then you should immediately think,

1072
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
oh, what an idiot.

1073
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,960
What a, what a social justice warrior.

1074
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,960
But going into the videos, they're so well produced that they draw you in and then you

1075
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,960
listen to them and the things they say are just, oh yeah, like I get it now.

1076
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,960
I understand that I was, I was not really thinking about anything before.

1077
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,960
I was just making judgments on people.

1078
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:28,960
There was like the anti-feminist crowd or like the crowd that was like there to like

1079
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,960
criticize like crazy feminists on YouTube for a while.

1080
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,960
They were kind of like overlapped with like the atheist YouTubers, right?

1081
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,960
Or like the rational skeptic types.

1082
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,960
And like back in the day, that was one thing, but like a lot of them, not all of them, but

1083
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:54,960
a lot of them like went on to like do this weird morph into these like conservative reactionary

1084
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:02,960
like, like, like people that have these like, it's because like shoe, you know, shoe on head.

1085
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,960
I know of her.

1086
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,960
I never really watched her videos.

1087
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,960
She's like, she's the girlfriend of like armored skeptic who was also one of these like rational dudes.

1088
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,960
I always thought his icon, like his avatar uses really goofy.

1089
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,960
It's very, very stupid.

1090
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,960
Very stupid.

1091
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,960
But like, I like, like she was one of these like, oh, look how dumb these feminists are.

1092
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,960
But like, I don't know.

1093
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:34,960
I guess I think lately she's been like, she's been kind of like, oh, you know, I kind of, I kind of think maybe I went a little,

1094
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
maybe I went a little too hard in that direction before.

1095
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,960
Like now she's like a big Bernie, a Bernie supporter and stuff.

1096
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,960
She's like, I don't know.

1097
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,960
I think she's fine.

1098
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,960
I think she made mistakes, but she's fine now.

1099
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,960
I don't think she's really changed much of her political opinions, but she just does like Bernie and that.

1100
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Yeah.

1101
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,960
Which by the way, I would use as a moment to show that perhaps some of these people with

1102
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,960
opinions, you know, more on that side are more reasonable than you might think.

1103
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,960
They are.

1104
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,960
It's really just the fact that back in the old days when the internet was new and we were

1105
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:16,960
going through YouTube, just random people and their thoughts, it was novel and you would find somebody saying something crazy

1106
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,960
and then you would, you know, find it in market.

1107
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:25,960
And if it was really stupid, you would, you know, it sort of became profitable to do that and that became a whole

1108
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:32,960
sect of YouTube is to, to find people and it just so happened to be like feminists were saying things that could be easily

1109
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,960
taken out of context or not.

1110
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,960
You know, they still, there are people who say stupid things who are feminists.

1111
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,960
And so that sort of became that whole big thing.

1112
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:51,960
And now it's, you know, similar stuff on the left, but it's through, through like progression through like YouTube and culture and,

1113
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,960
you know, popular culture of internet stuff.

1114
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:03,960
We've sort of, a lot of people, I think have realized that it's, you know, it's easy to point and laugh at a certain group,

1115
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:11,960
but not nobody is like, what's the word, free from criticism, like every group has problems.

1116
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:20,960
And so to, to really get, you know, really smart about things and be an intelligent man with max manner, like max intelligence,

1117
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:30,960
you need to realize that people you might have enjoyed were, you know, have perhaps like incorrect or problematic or

1118
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,960
mis, I hate words, this is why I don't speak so much.

1119
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:45,960
In a society where everyone, this is increasingly how we are, where we're all damned for our, you know, everyone makes mistakes.

1120
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,960
And if the damnation threshold is getting lower and lower and easier and easier to cross, literally everyone will be,

1121
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:59,960
I mean, you can find and mock, choose a person, pick a random person on the planet, I guarantee you.

1122
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Like, you can cancel them online.

1123
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,960
I have no doubt.

1124
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,960
Yeah, this is, this is the sort of thing.

1125
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:13,960
Like, I kind of cringe at the same people who like call John Tron a white nationalist racist who is completely evil,

1126
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,960
because they don't know everything.

1127
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,960
They're overstating the case.

1128
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,960
They're playing into a thing.

1129
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,960
John Tron obviously is not like, you know, well, not obviously,

1130
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,960
but like the things he said in that thing, that livestream, were stupid and wrong.

1131
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,960
And he apologized for that.

1132
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,960
And he probably was just sort of misled by being, you know, he hadn't found the left side of YouTube

1133
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,960
and realized that there was a different way to think about all this stuff.

1134
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,960
I mean, I think it's because he's a gamer and he probably just hung out in fucking gamer spaces.

1135
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,960
And like, gamer spaces.

1136
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,960
I mean, this was like a, I was going to say, like, I can understand, I can, it's not hard for me to understand

1137
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,960
why, like, back in the day, people really loved, like, people really loved to, like, tear into, like, crazy feminists

1138
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,960
and things like that.

1139
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,960
And like, I get it, right?

1140
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,960
But then, but then that, that turned into Gamergate.

1141
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,960
And Gamergate was bad.

1142
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,960
And now we're living in a post-Gamergate world and it's not funny anymore.

1143
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,960
Now it's got, like, now it's serious.

1144
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:20,960
And some, some people, you know, some people leaned into that and some people, like, like, chew on head.

1145
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,960
We're like, hold on, this has gone a little too far.

1146
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,960
I didn't mean for it to go where it went.

1147
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,960
I have a universal problem with all of it.

1148
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,960
You know what YouTubers are like?

1149
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,960
YouTubers are like, you know, there's, there's a giant seaport town.

1150
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,960
It's like a ship manufacturing plant, which is obviously highly productive and people work there.

1151
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,960
Like, YouTubers are like the, they're like the surface population of, like, divers who, like, wrecks happen

1152
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,960
and, like, other people have made cool stuff.

1153
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,960
Sure, divers do cool stuff. They go down and they find treasures, but they're not, like, the main industry.

1154
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,960
They're surviving off of, like, plumbing the depths for what other people have done.

1155
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,960
And a lot of the times that can be valuable.

1156
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,960
You can find some really important stuff down there.

1157
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,960
But it is a surface industry that exists on the back of, of lots of other stuff.

1158
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,960
And, and to that end, I think there's lots of incentives, especially in this.

1159
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,960
YouTube is stomach acid, as Davoo once said.

1160
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,960
Oh yeah.

1161
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,960
Is that, is that what you're getting at?

1162
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Yeah, but I was gonna say that, like, the, the, the issue I have that sort of relates to that is that, like,

1163
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,960
those divers, to stick with that metaphor, they have such an incentive to, like, play up their discoveries

1164
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,960
and to make everything seem like such a big deal.

1165
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,960
And more to the point, like, when it comes to actual discussion of whatever topics going on,

1166
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,960
there's such an incentive to escalate and flatten ideologies on any side, such that

1167
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
just take your extreme right-wing stuff.

1168
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,960
You got full-blown Nazis, I don't know, like white supremacists, then, I don't know,

1169
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,960
you're getting into maybe like, like the, even this, I mean, you could argue how strong these are,

1170
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,960
but like the Proud Boys, then maybe like Second Amendment strong guys or whatever,

1171
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,960
then like General Conservatives, and then, I don't know, you're getting more to the middle of people.

1172
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,960
Like, you, you could choose, and I, to me it seems like this happens a lot,

1173
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,960
and on the other side as well, calling them commies or whatever.

1174
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Like, you could pick a guy on the early end of those rungs and just flatten him up to Nazi,

1175
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,960
because that's like all the way.

1176
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,960
And to me personally, on any side, when I see people call Bernie Akami, it frustrates me as well.

1177
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,960
I hate, all that is, is a loss of signal and a loss of information,

1178
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:29,960
and this is why I so famously said, back in the day on the PCP, I hate the spoken word.

1179
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:36,960
It is so easy. I just wish we could have direct data transfer between brains so that you can't do that sort of stuff.

1180
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,960
Like that fucking magic thing in Digi's light novel.

1181
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,960
Did he, does he have that? I haven't, I haven't checked it out yet.

1182
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Did you listen to that? It's the chapter two, is like he explains.

1183
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,960
Oh, you mean of Road to Radcon?

1184
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,960
No, of course you should check out Road to Radcon chapter two, but...

1185
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,960
I have, I have not checked out any of his new light novels.

1186
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,960
Kusomega, Kusomega, that one.

1187
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:04,960
Kusomega, yeah. His, there's this, I mean, it's very clear, like, ah, this is the perfect thing.

1188
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:10,960
I would love to have this, says the autistic person who can't, like, socially relate to anyone.

1189
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:17,960
It's the magical ability to project thoughts into the minds of people without any sort of speech,

1190
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,960
and you can perfectly, like, the more powerful you are in that magic, magical ability,

1191
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,960
the more succinctly and perfectly you can relay that information.

1192
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,960
And there's like a few paragraphs in a chapter where, like, this is explore and it's like,

1193
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,960
people are having thoughts and they're all, like, getting things done super efficiently

1194
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,960
because nobody has to actually talk to each other.

1195
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,960
That's good, that's good.

1196
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,960
It's great.

1197
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:47,960
There is a, there is a really interesting video by Innuendo Studios about, um, oh fuck, what was that game?

1198
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,960
The Beginner's, you guys know the game The Beginner's Guide?

1199
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,960
Yes, yes.

1200
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,960
I do not.

1201
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:59,960
The Beginner's Guide is made by the guy who made, ah, the, the, ah, what's the one, Stanley Parable.

1202
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,960
The guy who made Stanley Parable, which was a huge hit, came back and he made this game called The Beginner's Guide,

1203
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:15,960
which is, the, the Beginner's Guide pretends to be a, oh god, um, okay, the conceit of The Beginner's Guide

1204
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:24,960
is that what you are actually playing is a series of unreleased, like, unfinished games by an unknown developer called Kota.

1205
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:34,960
And this guy who knows Kota, who, no, um, oh fuck, I forgot he's, Davey, Davey Redan, is the, is the guy who made Stanley Parable

1206
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,960
and supposedly in the game, the real life Davey Redan is walking you through these unfinished games

1207
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,960
and explaining to you, like, what he thinks they mean.

1208
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:50,960
And it's just like him, like, being like, yeah, let's delve into the mind of, of this guy, of this, this, this unknown, like, creative genius

1209
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
that I, that I know called Kota.

1210
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,960
But it, like, it's, it's actually, like, not that, it's like a fictional story.

1211
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,960
Right, right.

1212
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:05,960
Um, but, um, but yeah, anyway, it's really, it's, it's, but anyway, there's a really good video by Inuena Studios about it

1213
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:12,960
in which he talks about, like, how, in explaining what he thinks the game is about, he, like, goes back and explains, like,

1214
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,960
the theory of, like, language and authorship, and he talks about how, like, when someone, like, someone, like, speaks,

1215
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,960
when someone, like, describes, they describe something, they translate, like, information in their head into, like, a shared language

1216
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,960
and then you take those pieces of language and decode it.

1217
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:33,960
But, like, the thing, the thing that you, the image that you put together in your head is assembled from, like, your experiences with those words.

1218
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,960
Right, right.

1219
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,960
And it's going to be different from the other person's experiences with those words.

1220
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,960
And so on and so forth.

1221
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,960
And it's a great video.

1222
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:47,960
You know what, I just heard the other day, I just, I was watching a, a Razor Fist was playing through, um, Bioshock 1.

1223
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,960
And obviously he's a big right-wing guy, but he was like, he's like, you know, I think one of the problems with a lot of people is that

1224
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:59,960
when Ayn Rand was writing, or English was her second language, and when she used the word selfish, like, for example,

1225
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:05,960
that didn't quite convey the meaning that she meant to the, to the English audience.

1226
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:11,960
I don't know, I never, I never really thought, I thought she was trying to take back the word when I read Atlas Shrug and stuff back in the day,

1227
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,960
but, uh, yeah, I mean, it's the same sort of thing.

1228
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,960
It has a very negative connotation in the West and probably due to our Christian roots and whatnot.

1229
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,960
Atlas Fugged.

1230
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,960
Atlas Fugged.

1231
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,960
Oh, he has his heavy balls.

1232
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,960
He, he bears atop his shoulders that he must relieve himself of, but he just can't.

1233
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:39,960
I was afraid, I was afraid I was going to spend the entire episode raving about the fucking Iowa caucuses, but don't worry.

1234
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,960
Next episode, I'll be back to talk about New Hampshire.

1235
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
New Hampshire, man.

1236
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:51,960
Since it will have already happened, let me just, let me just preemptively say, fuck the DNC, Bernie got rat-fucked in Iowa and New Hampshire.

1237
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,960
It's time, it's time to fucking, it's time to riot.

1238
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,960
Yeah?

1239
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,960
Do you recommend, uh,

1240
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,960
It seems like time to riot.

1241
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,960
I guess vote bridging would be bad prescription.

1242
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,960
I mean, that too.

1243
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Let me, you know what, I'll just, I've been conflicted, right?

1244
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,960
I've been conflicted about something.

1245
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,960
I guess I might as well talk about it here, unless you think it's boring.

1246
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,960
Probably, but whatever.

1247
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,960
Probably almost definitely.

1248
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:20,960
I was, I was very much like, you know, I should, even though I hate Hillary, I should have voted Hillary in 16.

1249
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,960
And then like,

1250
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,960
That's a tough one.

1251
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,960
That's what I've said.

1252
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,960
And like, this, because like voting third party didn't accomplish anything.

1253
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,960
The DNC didn't care.

1254
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:33,960
And like the turnout for the third party was not anywhere close to what it needed to be to make a meaningful difference.

1255
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,960
And so this time I was like, you know what?

1256
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,960
Okay, I want Bernie, but like this time I'm vote Blue no matter who.

1257
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,960
But then, but then they start cheating.

1258
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,960
And then I read this shit about like mandatory military service.

1259
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,960
And suddenly I'm not so sure if, if I'm, if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna do it.

1260
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,960
Like that, that policy alone, you know, I think that's one of those things that you just put in there to like,

1261
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Okay, the cheating, the cheating made me like, I don't want to vote for them.

1262
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,960
But I think I was coming down like, no, okay, you know what, even if they cheat, even, even if pizza rat, like.

1263
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,960
If it's gonna, if it's pizza rat, that could be his mascot, the pizza.

1264
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,960
For harm reduction purposes, it's probably better to vote Blue no matter who.

1265
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:18,960
And also like being, being Bernie, like, okay, the argument for Bernie or bust is that like, okay, you should be Bernie or bust

1266
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,960
because people will see that people are Bernie or bust.

1267
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,960
And it's like, okay, if we don't nominate Bernie, we're going to lose all this support.

1268
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,960
And like that's going to cost us the nomination.

1269
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,960
The counter argument is, okay, but if you are Bernie or bust, you're alienating like the vote Blue no matter who people.

1270
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,960
And cause those people already see us, see the, the Bernie bros is like, oh, they're bullies online.

1271
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,960
They were rude to me online.

1272
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,960
So no healthcare for pores.

1273
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,960
Like that's the attitude and I hate them.

1274
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,960
They put on their fur suits and they broke my Chrysler.

1275
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,960
That was fucked up, guys.

1276
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,960
But, but I think I was coming down on the side of like, okay, even though I understand that argument,

1277
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,960
I think that probably in terms of what's going to have the best like material consequences,

1278
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,960
probably vote Blue no matter who is better.

1279
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,960
But then I read this fucking mandatory military service and I'm like, I don't know.

1280
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,960
Now I don't know anymore.

1281
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,960
Now Pete might be, Pete might be worse than Trump guys.

1282
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,960
We might have found a guy who's worse.

1283
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,960
I'm scared.

1284
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,960
Trump, he ain't going to do that.

1285
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,960
He ain't going to do that.

1286
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,960
He's not going to do that.

1287
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:25,960
He might fucking, he might fucking, fucking destroy relations with Iran and get us into World War three.

1288
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,960
But he's not going to do mandatory military service.

1289
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,960
I don't know.

1290
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,960
And look, what do we care about more?

1291
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:36,960
If America's economy tanks over 20 years or I personally go to war and meet,

1292
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,960
I can tell you what I care more about.

1293
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,960
Leave me alone.

1294
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,960
Hashtag, leave me alone.

1295
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,960
And then, and then of course there's all these quotes from Pete where he says he wants to put an end to endless war.

1296
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,960
He keeps saying it over and over again.

1297
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,960
So like, hashtag never Pete.

1298
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,960
That's right.

1299
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,960
It would be verboten.

1300
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,960
I mean, I just, Pete really stand a chance.

1301
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,960
Elizabeth, it sounds like she's tanked.

1302
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,960
There's no way.

1303
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,960
No, I mean, even if Pete wins the nomination, there's no way.

1304
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,960
Oh, you mean against Trump?

1305
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:06,960
Okay, yeah.

1306
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,960
Against, no, against Trump I don't believe for a second.

1307
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,960
The DNC can't rig the entire election.

1308
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:13,960
They can rig their own party stuff.

1309
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,960
That's true.

1310
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,960
That's true.

1311
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,960
Yeah.

1312
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,960
But like, nobody actually cares about him.

1313
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,960
You guys know that, like, rats, we're rats.

1314
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,960
We're the rats.

1315
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,960
I don't know that one.

1316
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,960
We fuck at night.

1317
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,960
We sneak at night.

1318
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,960
We're the rats.

1319
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:30,960
We fuck at night.

1320
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,960
We come at night.

1321
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,960
I mean, if you fuck at night, you come during the day.

1322
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:40,960
I just wanted to make the joke that Pete wants to be the giant rat that makes all of the

1323
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,960
rules, and we can't, we can't, we can't let him do it.

1324
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,960
I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.

1325
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,960
What is this?

1326
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:49,960
This is a risky question.

1327
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,960
Now let's try and what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.

1328
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,960
I don't know where it's from.

1329
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,960
It's just like a video.

1330
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:02,960
It's from, it's from German 985's rat movie video.

1331
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,960
You guys, you guys know rat boy genius?

1332
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,960
Yeah, of course.

1333
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:06,960
Yeah.

1334
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,960
The other joke that's been going around is rat boy POTUS.

1335
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,960
This is where I make potato kineshes.

1336
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,960
Yeah.

1337
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,960
My favorite.

1338
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,960
My roommates are big into rat boy genius.

1339
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,960
He's got an extended body of work.

1340
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,960
I myself have not seen the entire, the entire uvra.

1341
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,960
That's too bad.

1342
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,960
Rat boy should pull a gorillas and, you know, be a political party that is a fake person.

1343
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,960
Rat boy.

1344
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,960
That's a great idea.

1345
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,960
Oh, Pete should or rat boy genius should.

1346
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,960
Rat boy genius should as like, like the creator of rat boy will put rat boy genius as the

1347
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:44,960
nominee.

1348
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,960
Rat boy genius runs as a virtual candidate.

1349
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,960
They make a music video slash political speech of him and like green screen him into like

1350
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,960
public events.

1351
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,960
We've got, we've got vermin supreme too.

1352
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,960
You guys know him?

1353
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:57,960
I've heard of him.

1354
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:58,960
I've heard of him.

1355
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,960
There's so many rats.

1356
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,960
Another, another rat.

1357
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,960
Vermin supreme is like a, is like a fake candidate who like runs in a light.

1358
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,960
He's like this bearded fucking crazy man who wears a boot on his head.

1359
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,960
Oh yeah.

1360
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,960
Right.

1361
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,960
Okay.

1362
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:20,960
I actually saw him like in real life at the, at the, at the fucking the straight, the straight

1363
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,960
pride parade, like how he was there.

1364
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,960
Just, just taking selfies with people.

1365
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,960
There are these candidates out there.

1366
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,960
Like I know there's some who just like are, they're like, Hey guys, if you vote for me,

1367
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,960
I'm just nobody.

1368
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:39,960
I will just do, we'll have like public votes for every issue and I will simply do like

1369
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:44,960
whatever it is that like the, the democratic, you know, populace wishes me to do.

1370
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,960
I don't know.

1371
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,960
I thought those were kind of cool.

1372
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,960
That's, that's an idea.

1373
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:48,960
Wait.

1374
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:49,960
What do you, what do you mean?

1375
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,960
Who are you talking about?

1376
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,960
I can't think of any names specifically, but I have heard of candidates in the past who

1377
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,960
think that like the presidency is bullshit anyway.

1378
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,960
And what they want to do is like, okay, if you vote for me, here is my platform.

1379
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,960
I will decide nothing.

1380
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,960
I will simply like put out votes to the public on any given issue that comes across my desk

1381
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,960
and I will just do what the people.

1382
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,960
That seems like it would be really difficult.

1383
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,960
Like since that's not how our like government infrastructure is built.

1384
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,960
Absolutely not.

1385
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:17,960
I mean, you know,

1386
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,960
To get people to vote on all of the things.

1387
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:20,960
Yeah.

1388
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,960
Look how fast China whipped together a bunch of hospitals for the coronavirus or whatever.

1389
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:24,960
I mean, that seemed pretty good.

1390
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,960
There's one big hospital.

1391
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:26,960
There is one.

1392
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,960
Okay.

1393
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:33,960
But there are advantage as singular, at least advantage to having like an executive who

1394
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,960
can do thing singular.

1395
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,960
Sure.

1396
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,960
But so yeah, I don't know if I necessarily would go for that.

1397
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,960
Pretty good.

1398
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,960
Pretty good government.

1399
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,960
Yeah.

1400
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:44,960
All right.

1401
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,960
All right.

1402
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:46,960
Let's do stuff.

1403
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,960
You know, it's easy.

1404
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,960
The one.

1405
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:49,960
Yeah.

1406
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,960
Go on.

1407
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,960
Go on.

1408
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,960
I was going to say the one thing.

1409
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,960
Another thing that makes me really mad is like, oh, Bernie's a socialist.

1410
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,960
Bernie's, I saw a great tweet that was like, I already knew this, but I was, I was reminded

1411
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,960
in a tweet that like, oh yeah.

1412
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,960
They said the same, they said the same thing about social security.

1413
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,960
They said this, like, how was the other thing?

1414
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,960
They said like anything that any public good, they call it socialism.

1415
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,960
God, and it's really makes me mad that Bernie, like Bernie calls himself a democratic socialist.

1416
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,960
And I'm in his, in his heart, I'm sure he is.

1417
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,960
But like the policies that he's pushing for, they are not socialist policies.

1418
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,960
They are just, he is, he is basically just an FDR or Truman style Democrat who wants

1419
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,960
to do something, who wants to create like social programs basically on the level of

1420
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,960
like social security.

1421
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,960
Maybe Bernie's problem is that level.

1422
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,960
Maybe he shares my weakness.

1423
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,960
And the fact that, and the fact that that's seen as like a radical leftist position now

1424
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,960
is just really sad.

1425
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,960
I guess.

1426
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,960
Super fucking sad, dude.

1427
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,960
That's how I feel about it.

1428
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,960
But what, what makes you glad though?

1429
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,960
What makes you glad in these last few, yeah, since last week.

1430
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,960
What makes me glad?

1431
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,960
That's a great question.

1432
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,960
Well, I've started work, I've started work, great question.

1433
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,960
I've started working on slime and punishment again.

1434
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,960
I am.

1435
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,960
Fantastic.

1436
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,960
I'm finishing up the last few, okay, because there's going to be like a bunch of panels

1437
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,960
followed by the video.

1438
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,960
And I'm working on getting those like pre-finale panels done.

1439
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,960
And I'm not going to really, I'm not going to release them until they are, until the finale is ready.

1440
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,960
Okay.

1441
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,960
But I am putting them up on Patreon for the, like for my,

1442
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:32,960
the ten, the ten dollar people, like people pledging at the level of like getting a cameo in the, in the thing.

1443
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,960
Like, yeah, I'm putting them up on Patreon early for those people.

1444
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,960
And some of them, you know, I don't know.

1445
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,960
I think, I think maybe there's, it's going in some unexpected directions.

1446
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,960
I certainly look forward to it.

1447
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,960
Should be, shouldn't be, shouldn't be too, too long.

1448
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,960
I don't know how long the video is going to take.

1449
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,960
I'm going to try and get it.

1450
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,960
I'm going to try and keep it as simple as I can.

1451
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,960
That's wise. That's wise.

1452
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:57,960
Yes.

1453
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,960
You know, speaking of that, I, I haven't finished it as of recording.

1454
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:11,960
But I hope to finish chapter three of Lord of Ghosts by the time this, this PCP comes out and is uploaded to Davoo's second channel or whatever.

1455
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,960
Yeah, whatever this is.

1456
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,960
Oh, I never, fuck, I never tweeted about Lord of Ghosts chapter two.

1457
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,960
I meant, I meant to do that.

1458
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:18,960
I think I retweeted it.

1459
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,960
Shameful.

1460
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,960
Yeah, that's embarrassing.

1461
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,960
You're really churning through these chapters pretty fast, which is great.

1462
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:24,960
That is what I want.

1463
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,960
Well, he had them sketched, but still, still that's pretty fast.

1464
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,960
I mean, I feel like I've been slowing down a little too much.

1465
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,960
I wanted to get them out like every two weeks.

1466
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,960
Yeah.

1467
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:41,960
I've just, I've been getting like a combination of like, I go down to work and I fall asleep like actually, like why am I doing that?

1468
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,960
And my wrists are starting to like actually hurt.

1469
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:45,960
Oh yeah.

1470
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,960
And I don't know, I don't know what to do to like speed up the recovery.

1471
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,960
I don't want to not do anything because I need my hands to play video games as well.

1472
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,960
And use the mouse and keyboard.

1473
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,960
Jick off.

1474
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:57,960
These are important.

1475
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:58,960
Jick off.

1476
01:11:58,960 --> 01:11:59,960
All important actions.

1477
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,960
I mean, I'm envious.

1478
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:07,960
I mean, I'm here, you know, relaxing stuff, but really I fucking hate it because I can't be working on my current projects.

1479
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:08,960
I can't be playing video games.

1480
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,960
That, that too.

1481
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,960
What you gotta do.

1482
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,960
That too.

1483
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,960
I can't be voting in the primary.

1484
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,960
Guys, if my, if my phone, oh, one more thing.

1485
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:17,960
Yeah.

1486
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,960
Fuck what makes me glad.

1487
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,960
What makes me mad is I still don't have a phone.

1488
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,960
Didn't you already something with the folks?

1489
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:24,960
Yes.

1490
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:25,960
Yes.

1491
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:26,960
They had, mom and dad had an extra phone.

1492
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,960
Yeah.

1493
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,960
They sent it to me.

1494
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:29,960
I took it to the sprint store yesterday.

1495
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,960
They were like, nah, it's not a sprint phone.

1496
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,960
It's not eligible.

1497
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,960
Can't do it.

1498
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,960
Oh, what?

1499
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,960
But we were all on sprint.

1500
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:35,960
That doesn't make sense.

1501
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:36,960
Maybe I'm wrong.

1502
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:37,960
I don't know.

1503
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,960
I don't know where they got this phone from, this extra phone, but it's like, nah, it's the wrong type.

1504
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,960
Can't, can't do it.

1505
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,960
So I'm still out of phone.

1506
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,960
Well, I genuinely, genuinely, if I had a phone, this pisses me off more than anything.

1507
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:56,960
If I had a phone, I would literally be fucking phone calling, phone banking and making calls for Bernie.

1508
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,960
I absolutely would be fucking doing that, but I can't.

1509
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:06,960
So instead, I'm just fucking, I'm just selling Yang shirts and donating the proceeds.

1510
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,960
Fair enough.

1511
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,960
I mean, hey, maybe.

1512
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,960
I've made like, I've made like the Yang shirts have raised like 115 bucks or something.

1513
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,960
That's good.

1514
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,960
And it's all, and it's all gone.

1515
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,960
It's all gone to the campaign.

1516
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,960
It's all gone to act blue campaign donations.

1517
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,960
I mean, with a generous cut for time and energy, you know, I mean, 50, 20, 80%.

1518
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:31,960
No, no, all the profit goes, no, I don't, no, I don't make anything from these Yang shirts.

1519
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,960
You're speaking of making things for doing stuff.

1520
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,960
How about that Radcon 4 Kickstarter that's rolling right along?

1521
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,960
The Radcon 4 Kickstarter is doing pretty good.

1522
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,960
By the time this comes out, how many days will be left?

1523
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,960
Oh, we'll have like a handful, like three or four days.

1524
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,960
Oh God.

1525
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:48,960
Yeah.

1526
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,960
This, this will be the last one.

1527
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,960
This will be the last PCP before the Kickstarter ends.

1528
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,960
Yep.

1529
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,960
So we better.

1530
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,960
Um, it makes me really mad.

1531
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,960
Yeah.

1532
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,960
Okay.

1533
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,960
I mean, the Kickstarter has, you know, it did really well immediately.

1534
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,960
And then it has kind of maintained like a pretty steady growth the whole time.

1535
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,960
It makes me so mad that we don't have our channel.

1536
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,960
We do not have the fucking PCP channel where we can be posting updates and, and, and like

1537
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,960
advertising more.

1538
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,960
That's like the place we want to advertise it, but fucking Brad Garlinghouse or Ripple

1539
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,960
or whatever owns it and we can't use it.

1540
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,960
And like, I know the, I know the Kickstarter is doing good.

1541
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:28,960
Like it outperformed expectations, but like, I'm sure it could be doing better if we had

1542
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,960
our fucking platform.

1543
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,960
I have no doubt.

1544
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,960
Holy fuck.

1545
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:32,960
I have no doubt that that's true.

1546
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,960
Um, well, hey, for the record, it sucks.

1547
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,960
We're at.

1548
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,960
So much.

1549
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,960
It does.

1550
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,960
I mean, I don't, I mean, I, I mean, at this point, I'm starting to think like, I hope

1551
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,960
we get it by Radcon by the time Radcon starts, right?

1552
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,960
I mean, surely we've got.

1553
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,960
No, no.

1554
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,960
We're fucked.

1555
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,960
Nate, Nate.

1556
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:52,960
I swear to God we're fucked.

1557
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,960
They're never going to do it.

1558
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,960
They're never giving us our channel back.

1559
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,960
They don't care.

1560
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,960
I mean, okay.

1561
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,960
Well, just to be callous for a moment, what about my channel?

1562
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,960
That 100,000 subs.

1563
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,960
I mean, do I,

1564
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,960
Your stand's a better chance.

1565
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,960
Yeah.

1566
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,960
But like that Mars reviews guy had a hundred K two and his channel is just gone.

1567
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,960
Well, okay.

1568
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
Yeah.

1569
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,960
Did the people who stole it, they probably deleted it, right?

1570
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,960
They did that.

1571
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,960
And now he's maybe working with Google to hopefully recover it.

1572
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:18,960
Yes.

1573
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,960
He said he's contacted YouTube and he's hoping to recover it.

1574
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,960
Okay.

1575
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,760
I mean, you know, maybe it might come back.

1576
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:27,960
It might reappear.

1577
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,960
I can't, I can't guarantee that it won't.

1578
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:31,960
Nate, I'm sorry.

1579
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:32,960
I hate to say it.

1580
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,960
It's my fault.

1581
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:34,960
I really hate to say it.

1582
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,760
But no, no, that's not what I'm, no, I don't look, I'm not mad.

1583
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,920
Nobody makes mistakes, but I'm saying, I don't like saying it.

1584
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,880
I'm afraid that the channels are just gone.

1585
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,880
Yours included.

1586
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:47,880
Hey, baby.

1587
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:52,960
And we should probably start, I don't know, just be just preparing for that.

1588
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,560
The reason I haven't done anything yet.

1589
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,560
Okay.

1590
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,560
One is because it's been a little over two weeks.

1591
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,760
I know you've been, I know you've been in contact with YouTube.

1592
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:00,760
Yes.

1593
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:05,240
But like the main thing and okay, there will be a time where this will no longer be an

1594
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,960
acceptable, you know, course to continue taking.

1595
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,640
But right now they just say the same thing every time.

1596
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,720
And I do seem to get a human response when I mail them.

1597
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,320
That's like, yeah, it's a little bit different every time.

1598
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,520
It doesn't seem like it's a bot.

1599
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,640
And they're just like, our internal team is working on it.

1600
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,640
Okay.

1601
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,960
I get nothing along the lines of sorry, like we tried, it can't be done.

1602
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:30,040
I've received nothing and I know that it's in their interest to keep me like pacified

1603
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,960
while they, you know, are figuring this stuff out.

1604
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,760
But I just feel like there is hope still.

1605
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,560
I retain hope for, for these things.

1606
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,560
Uh, sure.

1607
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,560
Yeah.

1608
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,560
I mean, I guess that's it.

1609
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,560
I guess that's it.

1610
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,560
Yeah.

1611
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,200
I mean, if it's not there by the end of February, I have a strong feeling is not, we're not

1612
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,840
going to have it back for like months and months.

1613
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,840
There should be a cutoff point where like if we are at a certain point, we need to decide

1614
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,960
to just make a new look.

1615
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:57,960
If we get our channels back.

1616
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:58,960
Okay, great.

1617
01:16:58,960 --> 01:16:59,960
We can migrate.

1618
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,200
Do you know if we do that?

1619
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,440
If we start re-uploading videos, we're going to get fucking like content matched with our

1620
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,880
own channel that someone else stole.

1621
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,320
Uh, that's definitely possible.

1622
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,040
I guess we could just fight them.

1623
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,040
Uh, what we could do.

1624
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,040
No.

1625
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,040
What we could, what we should do.

1626
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,040
Yeah.

1627
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,040
Right.

1628
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,360
Under the assumption that eventually it may take a really long time, but eventually

1629
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,560
the channels will be returned.

1630
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,680
I think we should make for specifically for Radcon 4, like a channel to do live streams

1631
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,680
and stuff.

1632
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,680
We could do that.

1633
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,680
Just so that it's there.

1634
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,680
That's, yeah.

1635
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,680
It's something for sure.

1636
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,680
PCP2 or, you know.

1637
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,120
This is my first week of my entire life.

1638
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,640
I can't fucking deal with it.

1639
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,880
I'm my back hurts now.

1640
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:39,880
It's hurting.

1641
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,880
Oh, I'm in pain.

1642
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,680
Ben, you got to wake up and do some yoga, brother.

1643
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:43,880
You got to stretch it out.

1644
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,320
You got to do some of this gay, girly yoga I've been doing.

1645
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,320
Do some girl yoga.

1646
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,320
Yeah, maybe.

1647
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,320
It's great.

1648
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,320
It's great.

1649
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,320
It opens the chakras.

1650
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,440
Uh, like my, you know, remember when, when, uh, Guy was acknowledged as the number one

1651
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:59,080
Taijutsu user by Madhura Uchiha at the end of Naruto Shippuden?

1652
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,080
Literally me every morning.

1653
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,080
Of course.

1654
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,280
It's great.

1655
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,280
It's wonderful.

1656
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,280
I have hope.

1657
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:13,280
Oh, and you know, the other thing is I really don't like want to make a big deal of like,

1658
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,680
like, I feel like some people have felt like, I haven't seen this a lot, but like, I can't

1659
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,200
help that since we have a Kickstarter going right now, and we're like, Oh God, please

1660
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,960
help that some people would think to like, I know what to do.

1661
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:26,960
I'll like.

1662
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:27,960
We're literally a Kickstarter.

1663
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:28,960
But wait, what?

1664
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:29,960
Wait, what?

1665
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:33,440
I was just thinking that like, I don't want people to think that like we're just asking

1666
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,560
for like money because that won't help the problem like at all.

1667
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:42,160
What I'd love them to do, I don't know, is put some sort of weird arbitrary ghost of

1668
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,920
like pressure on YouTube that will somehow manifest in them getting our channels back

1669
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,640
faster, which I am dubious at most will even do anything.

1670
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,400
We're literally the victims of a crime, Nate.

1671
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,400
Absolutely true.

1672
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,400
100% true.

1673
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,080
This is real crime.

1674
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:01,120
This is real crime has been perpetrated against us and we have been robbed.

1675
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,120
Yep.

1676
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,560
But where are the cyber police?

1677
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,560
Where are they?

1678
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,560
It's my question.

1679
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,560
We need them.

1680
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,560
I don't know.

1681
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:12,120
They just, they only stay, oh, well, they only, the police, all cops are bad.

1682
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,800
They only serve the interests of the capitalist class.

1683
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,800
So obviously they're on fucking Brad's side because he's, he's paying them.

1684
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,400
He's paying them under the table in fucking Ripple.

1685
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,400
He could.

1686
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,360
I mean, these guys, man, they, they don't need our channels.

1687
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,400
It's nothing.

1688
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,400
They're not getting any profit.

1689
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,400
No, of course they don't.

1690
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,400
So little returns.

1691
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,400
It'll give a shit.

1692
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,400
Yeah.

1693
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,320
It's just whoever it is, just like some scammer out there was just like, yeah, fuck it.

1694
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,560
I'll just, I mean, these people obviously send this out.

1695
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,920
There's like, I don't know, dozens or maybe hundreds of channels they scammed.

1696
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,920
Overall, sure.

1697
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,320
They can make a few thousand dollars probably just by doing whatever.

1698
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,760
Did you see, did you see that screenshot?

1699
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:55,280
Like someone posted on Twitter and Tom retweeted it about like how like a shad, not Shadbase,

1700
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:59,960
that one, that other YouTuber called Shad, like, and in his comments like, oh, so-and-so

1701
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:05,320
got his channel hacked and stolen a couple hours later, he's like, oh, I'm so relieved.

1702
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,320
Got it back that day.

1703
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,320
Yeah.

1704
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,320
Yeah.

1705
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,720
I definitely, it's like a China point system only, probably based on like number of subs

1706
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,000
like activity on the channel.

1707
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,720
I mean, I definitely think that's what's happening.

1708
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,080
No doubt, no doubt in my mind.

1709
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,680
Here's what I think.

1710
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:28,640
I think that we fucked up and mismanaged the situation by not going fucking ballistic

1711
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,160
about it immediately.

1712
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:37,440
And because it's a fucking nightmare and I am fucking in panic mode, it is ruining my

1713
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,440
life.

1714
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:47,160
Me, me, me, me, it's all about me, but it is a fucking disaster and like a worst case

1715
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,360
scenario type situation.

1716
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:54,280
It is fucking Armageddon and I think that we should have, I think that we should have

1717
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:59,240
just assumed the worst case scenario from the very outset and I don't think, I think

1718
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:03,800
people are not worried about it because we are acting like we're not worried about it.

1719
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,880
Let me tell the audience right now, I'm fucking worried about it.

1720
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,880
It's really bad.

1721
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,880
What should we do?

1722
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,880
It's really fucking bad, everybody.

1723
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,880
Do we act team YouTube?

1724
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,080
Is that the grand play we have?

1725
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,080
I mean, yes.

1726
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,080
I don't know.

1727
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,080
What's your fucking grand plan?

1728
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,080
I have no plan.

1729
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,400
I have no solution.

1730
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,400
I guess act team.

1731
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:27,200
Yeah, I mean Nate, I assume you've been retweeting all of the tweets from the PCP Twitter and

1732
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,080
stuff on your own Twitter.

1733
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,360
Most of them, yeah.

1734
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,840
Like I feel, because one of them did get a response from YouTube because we act team

1735
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,840
YouTube.

1736
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,840
That's true.

1737
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:37,840
I responded to songs, the PCB accounts.

1738
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:43,240
So like any little amount, I mean, we don't know how it works, but like, the way I was

1739
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:47,480
dealing with it at first, because Ben was like freaking out a little bit and I was trying

1740
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,840
to calm him down because I just wanted him to be okay.

1741
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,840
Yeah.

1742
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,840
Well, I'm not.

1743
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,720
And now it's gotten worse and it's like, ah, shit.

1744
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:03,080
I fucked up by trying to like react with reason because it's YouTube.

1745
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,400
YouTube is not a good company.

1746
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,400
They suck.

1747
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,720
I should have realized that it would suck, no matter what happens.

1748
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:13,200
You know, personally with me, I think one of my issues, maybe Ben's totally right and

1749
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,600
that is the correct response.

1750
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:18,960
I have, like, this isn't like a monkey narrative where like YouTube betrayed us.

1751
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,960
I personally fucked up.

1752
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,640
We fucking are the victims of a crime.

1753
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,960
We're the victims of a fucking, no, you didn't screw up.

1754
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,000
We are a criminal fucking stole our shit.

1755
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Okay.

1756
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I mean, you're right.

1757
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
You're absolutely right.

1758
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,160
Quit fucking, quit victim blaming.

1759
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,160
You fuck.

1760
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,160
Oh, but I just have to say.

1761
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,160
Your self-finding.

1762
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,160
You're self-finding.

1763
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,160
I know empathy for women who are victimized and I just have to apply the same, yeah,

1764
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,160
I don't know.

1765
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:42,160
I, yeah, I just, I feel, I guess, shame and it makes me not want to tell it.

1766
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,320
It's not that I don't want to tell anyone.

1767
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,320
I don't care.

1768
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,280
I don't care about your feefies, Nate.

1769
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,800
You're the fucking, you're the fucking victim and we're gonna, we're gonna fucking cry about

1770
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,800
it.

1771
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,800
Okay.

1772
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,800
Well, it's just, okay.

1773
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,720
We're gonna cry no matter how good you feel.

1774
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:02,880
The moment I felt hope was lost, I would feel 100% valid to like one, I would make a new

1775
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,080
channel instantly for like all these channels and two, I would be, I would probably make

1776
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,600
a video or two about, I don't know, whatever.

1777
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,480
I'll probably still do that no matter what happens.

1778
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,760
But then I would definitely proceed to, I don't, you know what, honestly, look, look

1779
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,680
into my, I don't think I would even make a big deal of, I just feel like, yeah, hey,

1780
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,680
here's my new channel, guys.

1781
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:19,680
I hope you'll get one of my videos.

1782
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,680
No, you should, you have to.

1783
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,680
All right.

1784
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,680
Here's the thing.

1785
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:32,040
I think it's easy to use comedy to deal with things that are like, you know, bad things

1786
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,040
like this.

1787
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:37,560
Like it's, you know, Brad Garlinghouse, that's funny, you know, that would be, that's like

1788
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,680
something we can look back on and laugh.

1789
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,040
But you don't want to think about how bad things are right now.

1790
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,720
So let's laugh right now.

1791
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:49,840
And because we're joking about it and being jovial in things, people, I don't think got

1792
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,880
the sense that we thought it was a big deal when it started out because we were joking

1793
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:54,880
about it.

1794
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,360
And it's, it's kind of, I mean, I don't know what any, like our audience could have done

1795
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:03,560
differently other than to do more retweets and stuff.

1796
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,720
Because that's the only avenue we really have.

1797
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,880
We don't have the channels.

1798
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,640
I mean, if we, I mean, you've got the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

1799
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,600
the link to the person and that's a, a three now.

1800
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:17,240
If, if, if we just step back for a moment, like, let's just say in fantasy land, let's

1801
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:22,520
say hashtag, save the PCP did, which you should retweet, I suppose, based on all these things

1802
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:27,160
and tweet that out, say blah, blah, blah, retweeting everyone who tweets, yes.

1803
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:33,320
Hashtag, save the PCP, if theoretically that hashtag, let's just say mad, became number

1804
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,400
one on Twitter, hashtag panic mode, fair enough.

1805
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:41,400
If that became the number one Twitter and like people around were starting to talk

1806
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:45,800
about it, then like, I bet YouTube would, in fact, they'd turn their attention and

1807
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,960
they'd sort this out in the, you know, half an hour to an hour it would take to give

1808
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,640
us back our stuff and do all those things.

1809
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,640
But you know what, you know, I had one other thought on this whole subject.

1810
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:56,120
Okay.

1811
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:59,360
So for us, here, you feel free to go ahead.

1812
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:05,560
Well, it's really just like I am, I was operating was operating under the same sort

1813
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,480
of thought, like, there's no reason to scream and cry immediately.

1814
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:17,840
But, you know, because like the likelihood that screaming and crying on our scale for

1815
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,320
the PCP channel or whatever, like your scale, maybe it would have worked.

1816
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:26,720
Maybe a hundred, hundred K, but like the idea that, oh, it's probably, they're probably

1817
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,320
not going to do anything if I make a big fuss about it.

1818
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:35,400
So I'm not going to make a big fuss is sort of like it only inconveniences you for

1819
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,120
no reason.

1820
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:41,320
You know, I just disposition wise, I'm definitely opposed to like being, I don't

1821
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,040
know, having people having sympathy for me.

1822
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:46,120
Maybe it's a personal issue I need to work with.

1823
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,120
I don't know.

1824
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:52,200
But I certainly don't want to be in that position if I can help it, which, which I

1825
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,240
was going to say that like, there's another thing that people have said.

1826
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:59,760
So there's this guy at the quartering who makes YouTube videos about like news updates.

1827
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,680
And it happens that he happens to be on this issue recently, it seems.

1828
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,640
And I think like I checked in his Twitter, his pinned tweet is like, you know, these

1829
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,000
channels have been hacked or excuse me, something like that.

1830
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,360
And like, you know, he seems to be trying to do something to get it dealt with.

1831
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:14,880
Okay.

1832
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,640
The only thing about that is, this is another complicated thing.

1833
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,680
I don't dislike the man personally.

1834
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,600
He seems fine.

1835
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,440
I do, I do.

1836
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,440
Okay, fine, fine.

1837
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,000
I don't dislike him as a man.

1838
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,760
He's, he's whatever.

1839
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,240
He's a, he's a fucking gamer.

1840
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,440
He definitely is a gamer.

1841
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,440
There's no doubt about that.

1842
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,360
So whatever you feel about that, fair enough, make that literally just makes him bad.

1843
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:32,680
But whatever.

1844
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,240
Okay, okay.

1845
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,960
Well, on the subject of this, see, here's the thing.

1846
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:40,840
I'm sure that in his heart, he feels that like doing this can help.

1847
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,200
And maybe he can spread the word.

1848
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,000
We were talking about a campaign.

1849
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,400
Sure.

1850
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:44,720
Okay.

1851
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,480
But I've watched this man quite a bit over the years.

1852
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,280
I've seen his content.

1853
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,160
I know what he does.

1854
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:55,040
Guys like him, and even to an extent like Tim Poole, or I mean, Sargon has been doing it a little

1855
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,440
bit more lately with his like, new stuff.

1856
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,360
What a great, what a great cast of characters.

1857
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,200
A wonderful cast.

1858
01:26:59,200 --> 01:26:59,600
Yeah.

1859
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:04,760
And I don't know, take your pick, any person, any persuasion of any news side,

1860
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,200
any political thing, whatever, it doesn't matter.

1861
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:14,760
Like, I really can't help but feel like these people, it does nothing to help anyone.

1862
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,000
And it's really like, okay, the thing about the quartering that makes him unique is that

1863
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,960
unlike other people, he will go in and he will say, guys, listen, these channels got hacked.

1864
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,520
There's only one thing you can do.

1865
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,720
You got to share this video.

1866
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,880
You got to retweet.

1867
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,320
You got to share it around.

1868
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:34,440
Cause this is the only, and I'm like, okay, look, I really don't think that we'll do anything

1869
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:38,320
to help anyone except you and your business personally.

1870
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:43,240
So I, I mean, maybe if you say just hashtag, save the PCP or save the channels or whatever

1871
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,240
it is, okay, sure.

1872
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,120
And I don't think it's out of malice, but I can't avoid thinking that like, and if you're

1873
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:55,240
listening to this quartering one day, I doubt you are, but like, it's not, I don't dislike

1874
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:58,800
you, but this is just so not helpful.

1875
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:03,440
Like, I already don't think any of this tweeting at team YouTube does anything because let's

1876
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,880
say our channel gets restored tomorrow.

1877
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,800
That's almost guaranteed because I put in those YouTube tickets at the very beginning

1878
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,600
two weeks ago.

1879
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:15,280
Well, explain to me how that guy that like shadowverse, okay, the guy who got hacked was

1880
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,000
Todd of Todd's workshop.

1881
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,720
I like, how did that guy get his channel back in like a matter of hours?

1882
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,200
Let me see how popular he is.

1883
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,560
Todd of Todd's workshop.

1884
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,200
Let me see here.

1885
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:25,240
Okay.

1886
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,400
This man is, is he a million sub kind of guy?

1887
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,120
Todd's workshop.

1888
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:30,640
Here we go.

1889
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,800
I'm seeing 182,000 subscribers.

1890
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,040
Okay.

1891
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,080
So, I mean, it's not massive or anything.

1892
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,600
That's, I mean, it's big enough.

1893
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,880
It's bigger than, bigger than you, but not like by like a huge amount.

1894
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:48,520
He's like one, he's like 180% of assuming this is the right one.

1895
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:48,720
Yeah.

1896
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,920
No, one hour ago, he made a video saying we're back on his channel.

1897
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,120
They're all putting the show notes.

1898
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:58,200
So what, how was, you know, I'm going to watch this video, see exactly because I

1899
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,560
haven't watched this yet, obviously.

1900
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:03,560
If he's like a, he's like a blacksmith channel, I guess I'm, I'm honestly

1901
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,640
surprised they haven't fixed your channel.

1902
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,760
Nate, seeing as you are a hundred K boy, I'm a little surprised as well.

1903
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,800
I don't know why it is.

1904
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,160
Okay.

1905
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,560
Look, I heard two weeks, maybe they look at watch time or something.

1906
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,320
We're still in the, I mean, yeah, that's definitely pop.

1907
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:19,120
My channel isn't like the most active or successful hundred K one or anything.

1908
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,560
I like, if we're in the orbit still of two weeks, which we are still now, that's

1909
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:23,760
fine.

1910
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,160
These things can take longer.

1911
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,640
I know of one guy with a smaller channel who took eight weeks to get

1912
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,080
restored, but it did eventually happen.

1913
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,520
So like, you know, the two week thing was just something I had heard.

1914
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,840
I don't know what it means.

1915
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,240
Some people are going to fix that.

1916
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,200
All right.

1917
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,600
I, I, I know, I know that you're, you know, it's sort of like, you don't want to

1918
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,400
look bad.

1919
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,920
You don't want to look like a guy who's begging for anything.

1920
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,520
Cause it's just, it's not your aesthetic.

1921
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:54,960
But like, I feel, I feel like if there's any chance that it can make the, the

1922
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:01,600
thing happen quicker, then it's nothing to be ashamed of, to try if, if you

1923
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,640
actually really like, I mean, you're right.

1924
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:05,800
You're definitely right.

1925
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,920
Like people aren't going to be like, Oh my God, is that the guy who got sad when

1926
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,160
his channel got taken down?

1927
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,120
Like that's not going to be a big deal in the future.

1928
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,160
I have wondered if I'm emotionally dead inside.

1929
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:22,920
Cause like I, I wonder a little bit why I'm not sadder and you're all about those

1930
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,720
facts and you got to, you got to let your feelings kind of feel in my heart.

1931
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,040
Like, yeah, I mean, I fucked up.

1932
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,400
Like, I, yeah, I deserve it.

1933
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,080
Cause you know, it's, I, I'm the one who did the mistake.

1934
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,000
That's fucking stupid.

1935
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,320
I know it's, I know, I know it's stupid.

1936
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,760
It's just a victim of a fucking crime.

1937
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,960
We all are actually.

1938
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:40,320
Yep.

1939
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:40,920
Yep.

1940
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:47,680
So like, I mean, no offense, but like take your fucking dumb ass.

1941
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,720
Like, Oh, what was me?

1942
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,160
This is all, I deserve this attitude and like fuck right off with it.

1943
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,040
Cause like it's, it's a fact.

1944
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,120
Like, like we're all fucking dealing with it.

1945
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,240
I, I care.

1946
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,440
You guys are all dealing with life.

1947
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,760
That's, yeah, it's fair.

1948
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,280
It's fair.

1949
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:03,640
Okay.

1950
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,000
Well, we're on the same page.

1951
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,920
We're going to look literally the only lever of power we have is just to get people

1952
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,760
to tweet about it.

1953
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,800
I mean, I don't know.

1954
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,360
What if we got a protest in front of TYN?

1955
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:17,600
So let's fucking get it fucking going before I cry.

1956
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,280
Here's a thought.

1957
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,320
Here's a thought.

1958
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:24,600
What of a public gathering in front of YouTube headquarters, a peaceful

1959
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:29,960
demonstration with signs that just say hashtag, save the PCP, where we just

1960
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:34,160
attempt to get them to a human being with authority to pay attention to the

1961
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,320
fact that this is happening.

1962
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,040
I mean, is that a, is that a thing we can do?

1963
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,560
It's not illegal, right?

1964
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,720
I mean, I'm not going to do that because I don't know how to get, I mean,

1965
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,680
the cost of money to go to California and stuff, but maybe other people would do it.

1966
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:49,040
Maybe you alone heroes, I don't know.

1967
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:52,160
That's hashtag PCP or I cry.

1968
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,840
I cry spelled I C R I great.

1969
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:56,880
Fantastic.

1970
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,240
Yeah, that's me.

1971
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,160
That's what I'm feeling right now.

1972
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:00,560
Okay.

1973
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,000
That speaks to my truth.

1974
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:08,680
Well, let's turn this sadness into righteous anger and get people all we can do at

1975
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,160
Team YouTube, just keep, I'll just tell people the news.

1976
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,800
I don't know if I've even told you guys this yet.

1977
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:18,320
Team YouTube did message me on best guy ever.

1978
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:18,880
Excuse me.

1979
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:23,160
I DM them all the information about every channel that was stolen in like a big

1980
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,800
spreadsheet, love putting it together.

1981
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:25,520
It was wonderful.

1982
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,000
Uh, so I've got, I can send that out to anybody who wants information on what's

1983
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,840
going on and, and then Team YouTube responded to us at TP.

1984
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,600
Crasinators and like their update was just like, we'll let you know, like what we

1985
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:38,760
find.

1986
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:43,720
So like right now everything is, they seem aware, just nothing has changed.

1987
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,200
Nothing has been done as far as we can.

1988
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:49,480
Maybe they're researching it right now and it's taking them a while.

1989
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:50,520
I don't know.

1990
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,960
It would take them no time.

1991
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,840
If that's the case, they should, like I emailed them on the BGE email, I think,

1992
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,240
and just like, look, I am losing my livelihood here.

1993
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,080
Like just tell me what's being done.

1994
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,800
If you're, if it's in the queue, tell me it's in the queue.

1995
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,600
If someone's looking at it, if you need any information, I'm in the videos.

1996
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,160
You will see, I can prove that it's mine, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera.

1997
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,720
We just need a fucking human who can, who can help on these things.

1998
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,320
So it sounds like attention's the game.

1999
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,960
You forced our hand, YouTube.

2000
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:26,560
What else can we do at this point, but make your life mildly unpleasant with a

2001
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,680
large number of, what else can we do?

2002
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:33,240
But like occasionally remind you of our existence with notifications on Twitter.

2003
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:33,920
What a nightmare.

2004
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:34,600
What a nightmare.

2005
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,000
All right.

2006
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,440
Hashtag, save the PCP.

2007
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:38,240
That's it.

2008
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,360
Tweet that, make a Twitter if you don't have one.

2009
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:41,440
Fucking get engaged.

2010
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,080
This is social media era, you idiot.

2011
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,320
Get on Twitter.

2012
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,400
That's what I'm talking about.

2013
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,760
Ruin your life by engaging in hostile political discourse.

2014
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,400
24 seven, tweeting about this.

2015
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:55,840
And then, and then, and then make calls for Bernie, please.

2016
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,320
And be very hot.

2017
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,720
Be a hostile Bernie, bro.

2018
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,400
Just like, call up fucking pizza porters and be like, you fucking neoliberal

2019
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:10,280
coward, don't fucking, don't fucking come to the polls.

2020
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,760
I'll fucking end you, bro.

2021
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,680
That reminds me.

2022
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:17,760
Are you saying, are you saying you call like pizza places to say that?

2023
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:18,440
No, Pete.

2024
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,560
Yeah, pizza.

2025
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,360
Yeah, pizza porters, pizza porters.

2026
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,240
Pizza porters.

2027
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,120
They carry around the porters is what I tried to say.

2028
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,440
Pizza, pizza, the, pizza, the port.

2029
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,120
And you go to the, you go off your boat, you get a pizza.

2030
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,160
By the way, this is very important.

2031
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,040
And you get attacked by Bernie supporters.

2032
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,120
I had an important note.

2033
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:41,720
I meant to read the beginning and it was just in Hawaii, taken it sleazy.

2034
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:47,600
But really, that was the Democratic National Convention all along that I was describing.

2035
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:50,040
They're taking it so sleazy right now.

2036
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,200
And I'm jealous.

2037
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:57,200
Tune in to my Twitter on Friday to see how angry I am about how they

2038
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,240
rat fucked my boy Bernie again.

2039
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,160
I, I, he's got it.

2040
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,760
I mean, he's got to take that one.

2041
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,760
He's got to take that one.

2042
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:03,040
We'll see.

2043
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:08,800
I don't, I mean, polls conflict and like, you know, like who fucking knows?

2044
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:15,400
Cause the polls didn't, didn't, didn't anticipate Buttigieg doing as well in, in, in Iowa.

2045
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,920
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I heard that the, I think the third one, which they expected

2046
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:23,400
Biden to win was I think South Carolina, like they expect like a black vote to be him.

2047
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:27,440
I think the third one's Nevada and then South Carolina, I might have them back.

2048
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:32,760
But like, yeah, um, uh, non-white people don't like Pete Buttigieg.

2049
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:33,000
Yeah.

2050
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,120
Uh, they, Buttigieg has like zero black support.

2051
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:40,200
And like he's like only white people will vote for him.

2052
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,600
So like New Hampshire and Iowa.

2053
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,360
Yeah, maybe, but like Nevada, no, South Carolina, definitely.

2054
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:50,400
It's Nevada, I don't know the demographics of Nevada, but I think, I mean, I think there's

2055
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:55,000
a lot of Hispanic people, but like I've, I've looked at the polls and like Sanders is still

2056
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,560
number one in Nevada by a pretty wide margin.

2057
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:02,160
He got, I mean, Buttigieg's got a little boost across the board, but like he didn't

2058
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,080
like soar in Nevada.

2059
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:09,240
Do we really want, South Carolina is still like locked in for Biden of all people.

2060
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,760
And Biden is like dying.

2061
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:14,440
I mean, Obama's VP, I guess that, you know, goes the distance.

2062
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:18,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Biden has a lot of black support for some reason.

2063
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:22,560
And he's the favorite to win among people who are just like, why can't we go back to

2064
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,560
the Obama years?

2065
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:24,200
Why not?

2066
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,720
I ask legalized crime.

2067
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:32,000
So like, honestly, honestly, the one shred of hope and also, uh, for some reason,

2068
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:37,320
Klobuchar, I guess Klobuchar performed, oh, I watched the debate at the ABC debate.

2069
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,080
I'm sorry to bring it back at the very end.

2070
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,160
Um, she had a really, she had a pretty strong performance at the debate.

2071
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,600
The ABC debate was like pretty good.

2072
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:51,200
Like as these debates go, oh my God, I want to talk about fucking Tom Steyer, who I

2073
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,160
don't know who that is.

2074
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:52,920
I have no idea.

2075
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,240
I'm okay.

2076
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,520
So, so Klobuchar did well at the debate and she's getting a little surged too.

2077
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,280
And I'm, I'm happy that Biden's still in it.

2078
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,960
I'm happy that Klobuchar is in it because they're splitting the moderate vote away

2079
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,440
from Pete.

2080
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,480
And like, thank God, thank God for Joe.

2081
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:11,640
At this point, I'm like, I cannot wait, I cannot wait for Biden to fucking sweep

2082
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:17,040
North Carolina just to make Pete look like a fucking idiot, just, just to humiliate

2083
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:17,400
him.

2084
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:23,440
Um, but anyway, so at the debate, the, the, the CNN is terrible.

2085
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,760
The last debate I watched with CNN, it was a fucking nightmare.

2086
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,240
This one was ABC and it was like way, I mean,

2087
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,800
it was a little annoying, but it was like way less annoying.

2088
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,800
Um, Sanders did good.

2089
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,600
Klobuchar did surprisingly good.

2090
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,560
Biden looked like he was about to have a aneurysm.

2091
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:43,440
Um, Warren was not where she needed to be.

2092
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,200
They hammered Pete on being, uh, on having like, they hammered Pete on a bunch of like

2093
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:53,640
shitty stuff, shitty reasons why he's like kind of racist and like how he like ran,

2094
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,220
how he, the thing that he, basically the South Bend became like way worse for

2095
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:02,020
black people when he was, um, when he was mayor of it.

2096
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:04,740
And there was other things too, but like that's, that's the long and short of it.

2097
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:08,260
Um, so they, they hammered Pete on that and like, okay, cool.

2098
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:11,620
But like this guy and Yang was there.

2099
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:15,540
Yang was there being like, uh, automation, uh, hey, $1,000 an hour.

2100
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:21,700
Everyone's like, yeah, yeah, that's cool.

2101
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:25,500
But then this guy, Steyer, Steyer is so fucking weird.

2102
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:29,460
He was kind of the like runaway hit of the, of the night.

2103
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:36,500
Like he, he won the meme vote, um, on, on whatever it's S-T-E-Y-E-R.

2104
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:41,220
He is a, he is a, like an oil billionaire, right?

2105
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:45,860
But he, he like, he's like an oil billionaire, like fossil fuels billionaire

2106
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:51,340
who like at some point in his life, he just like decided like fuck this.

2107
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:54,820
Like, and it's almost, it seems like it's like a vanity project.

2108
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:58,220
Just decided, I'm just going to be a liberal Democrat and run for president.

2109
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:03,620
And like he's up, he's up in like, I guess he's, he's, he's the climate change guy.

2110
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:07,780
Even though he's an oil guy, he, he has pledged like the one thing that I'm

2111
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:09,460
running on is like climate change.

2112
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:13,060
I'm going to be the guy who's like, that's his like, that's his, his whole issue.

2113
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,820
As far as like running for presidency.

2114
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,060
Is he still an oil guy now?

2115
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:20,580
That seems, uh, is, is he like, did he give up his interest or something?

2116
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:25,740
I don't think he is like actively running like oil, like fracking companies now or

2117
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:29,100
anything, uh, as far as I know, honestly, I haven't looked that much into it.

2118
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,260
I've looked a little bit into him, but not that much.

2119
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:35,060
Um, but he's, he's like, okay.

2120
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:38,860
And remember that thing about how Warren, like, how like Warren wouldn't

2121
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:42,100
shake Bernie's hand the last time you hear about that?

2122
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:42,700
Okay.

2123
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,180
Well, like, well, like they're having their argument.

2124
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,860
And she's like, I think you called me a liar on national television.

2125
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:50,140
He's like, okay, you want to have that discussion later.

2126
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:50,540
Okay.

2127
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:50,780
Yeah.

2128
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:51,100
Okay.

2129
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:51,420
Good.

2130
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:56,180
Um, and then, but like, while that's happening, Tom Steyer is like behind Bernie,

2131
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:58,340
just kind of like waiting to get a word in edgewise.

2132
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:01,180
Like, Oh, was he the guy who just wanted to say hi to Bernie?

2133
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:05,140
Yes, that guy, he was, he was like, hi Bernie.

2134
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:07,300
I just wanted to say hi and he's like, yeah, okay.

2135
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:12,500
And then, and then in this debate, Steyer's up there, like, I mean, he's

2136
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,260
a monster to be like, so you have to subscribe to my private Snapchat.

2137
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,500
That's only for $20 or not.

2138
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:19,940
He can't, he can't because Steyer's, Steyer's a billionaire and he won't let,

2139
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:23,420
he won't let donors, he won't let billionaires donate to him.

2140
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:24,860
So I can't, you can't do it.

2141
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:26,180
Sorry, Steyer, you're out of the fucking club.

2142
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:26,700
That's too bad.

2143
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:30,660
Um, but I mean, the whole debate, Steyer's mostly just up there, like,

2144
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:34,380
like standing Bernie, just like agreeing with everything Bernie says.

2145
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:35,820
BP, maybe he's going for BP.

2146
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:36,340
I don't know.

2147
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:39,740
I maybe, I mean, I just think he really likes Bernie.

2148
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:44,980
I like clearly seems to like Steyer was so funny the whole time because my,

2149
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:48,900
my sense watching was that he was just like really excited to be there.

2150
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:53,420
Like he's just like, man, I fuck, I can't believe I'm up on stage with,

2151
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:58,180
with Bernie Sanders and like the former vice president, like, damn, look at me now,

2152
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:03,220
dad, like, I can't believe he's the guy who said, I just wanted to say hi to Bernie.

2153
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:03,980
I heard that.

2154
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:05,540
I was wondering who that was.

2155
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:07,780
It's like, it's got to be like one of the reporters or something, right?

2156
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:12,660
That's, that's Tom, that's Tom Steyer and Tom Steyer is, I mean, there are no good

2157
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:18,020
billionaires, but Tom Steyer is trying really hard to be like less bad than

2158
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:22,580
like his ilk, even if it's just for like his own like weird vanity, like, fine.

2159
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:23,060
Okay.

2160
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:24,100
I'll, I'll take it.

2161
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:29,220
Honestly, honestly, Steyer solidarity comrade.

2162
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:32,260
What is it?

2163
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,420
We had a bunch of memes.

2164
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:36,740
We all, we all watched it in my friend's room and we had a bunch of memes where

2165
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,940
people call like his supporters the Steyer buyers, but then we're like, oh yeah,

2166
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:42,220
I'm a, I'm a pig Steyer.

2167
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:44,860
I'm in the pig Steyer.

2168
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:45,380
Yeah.

2169
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:46,940
I'm rolling in it.

2170
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:47,980
That's good shit.

2171
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:52,740
We watched them while the, for the first half of the bates, I was in my fucking

2172
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:56,820
discord, just like, we were all just like live, like reacting in my discord server

2173
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:00,300
to two things, just being like, oh my God, can you fuck?

2174
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:02,740
Oh my God, these guys are, they're fucking hammering Pete.

2175
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:03,340
Like fuck.

2176
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:05,060
Yeah, it was pretty good.

2177
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:05,500
It was pretty.

2178
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,300
I guess cause like whoever's the, what is it?

2179
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:11,260
They say the, the tall nail gets the hammer or whatever, the squeaky wheel gets

2180
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:11,860
the grease.

2181
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:16,500
Yeah, yeah, because like Pete, Pete was like the one who everyone was surprised

2182
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,180
by how well he did in Iowa.

2183
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:19,580
So they're like, fuck that guy.

2184
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:23,940
He's kind of the one that everyone was going after him on stage and like, I mean,

2185
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:29,300
thank God, we, yeah, but he's, he has to be, he has to be, he has to be fucked.

2186
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:33,020
Honestly, honestly, but he does suck things.

2187
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:37,260
I mean, he is gay, but gross.

2188
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:38,020
No, thanks.

2189
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:38,580
I know.

2190
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:39,140
Yeah.

2191
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:46,460
But, um, someone like, I like, I said on Twitter, like, please don't make, like,

2192
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:49,460
I want to vote for Lunamatter, but please don't make me vote for Biden.

2193
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:54,620
Like, honestly, I would, if Biden got the nom, I would like grit my teeth and like,

2194
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:59,180
it's like, damn it, but I would go and I would vote for Biden.

2195
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:02,860
Honestly, with, I don't, I don't know if I could do, I don't know if I could do it.

2196
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:04,140
I don't know if I could vote for Pete anymore.

2197
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:06,860
He's that, but I don't know his policy at all.

2198
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:10,060
I definitely don't want that mandatory fucking service.

2199
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:10,500
Shit.

2200
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:15,820
That's, it's the, okay, the mandatory military service thing is fucking scary.

2201
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:19,940
And then his, his Medicare bill is like, it pretends to be good.

2202
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:23,980
He has this like, the lion's like, oh, no, no, no, no, not Medicare for all.

2203
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:26,060
Medicare for all who want it.

2204
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:29,660
And what that basically means is like, he will do.

2205
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:30,060
Okay.

2206
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,220
The problem, it sounds good, right?

2207
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,740
It's like, oh, give people a choice.

2208
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:38,580
But like the problem with that is that if you do Medicare for all who want it means

2209
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:43,380
you don't have to, like Medicare doesn't work if like everybody is not paying

2210
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:44,660
into it, like social security.

2211
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:49,300
Like we have progressive tax brackets, like rich people need to be like

2212
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:53,260
paying in like a proportionally higher share, because that's how like we

2213
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:59,020
fucking have, that's how fucking social benefits are done in a civilized society.

2214
01:43:59,180 --> 01:43:59,460
Yeah.

2215
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,260
And if you give Medicare for all who want it, you have to opt in.

2216
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:04,740
The only people who will do that are poor people.

2217
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:08,580
Rich people will just continue to use their private health insurance because

2218
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:14,380
they want to be able to like buy priority over poor people in getting healthcare.

2219
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:16,180
And then it won't be fun.

2220
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:19,020
It will, and it just won't work and it will collapse.

2221
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:23,300
And then it will be even worse because Republicans, the, aha, you see, we

2222
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:25,660
tried a public option and it failed.

2223
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:29,300
But guess we better, guess we better privatize even more.

2224
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,260
That's, that's how they do it.

2225
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:31,820
Uh, yeah.

2226
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:33,660
You, you, you propose it.

2227
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:36,940
You propose a shitty half measure that's designed to fail.

2228
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:37,900
It fails.

2229
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:40,500
And then they say, aha, public options just don't work.

2230
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:43,220
Socialists blown out.

2231
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:43,900
Yeah.

2232
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:48,740
I mean, when you, when you try to, back in my day, we, we put, picked ourselves

2233
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:54,980
up by our white skin and we just worked hard for our milk or milk health.

2234
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:55,980
I was out there.

2235
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:57,100
I worked hard.

2236
01:44:57,140 --> 01:45:02,340
I, you know, it was backbreaking work, whipping slaves in the cotton fields and

2237
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:07,340
they're trying to just, but, but, but now here I am a self-made man made it all

2238
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:07,780
on my own.

2239
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:10,980
And, you know, we have to institute, I mean, you know, as you describe,

2240
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:15,820
communism requires everyone to be fully on board or else the slave subjects will

2241
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:17,740
escape to those lovely states nearby.

2242
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:18,780
We can't have that.

2243
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,620
We need everybody to be on board.

2244
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,460
So, uh, that's what happened.

2245
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:22,660
Yeah.

2246
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:28,580
Uh, like Bernie needs three more houses and we've all got to pitch in to make

2247
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:29,140
that a reality.

2248
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:32,660
Like if, like, like it takes it, not, not me, us, like all of us,

2249
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:34,380
us, my houses.

2250
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,140
Thanks Bernie.

2251
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:35,700
Appreciate that.

2252
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:36,860
Yeah.

2253
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:37,740
Only I'm not allowed.

2254
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:40,180
Not, not, not me.

2255
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:40,780
U.S.

2256
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:42,340
Oh, us, not me.

2257
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:42,780
That's good.

2258
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:43,340
That's good.

2259
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:49,180
Not, not me as in the state of Maine, us, as in the United States.

2260
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:50,340
Perfect.

2261
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:54,500
Maine gets, Maine is excised from the union.

2262
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,060
All right.

2263
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:55,860
Voice mails.

2264
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:56,420
What do you say?

2265
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:57,820
We got, we got a bunch of voice mails.

2266
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:58,980
Let's do voice mails.

2267
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:00,020
Holy shit.

2268
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:00,540
Okay.

2269
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:01,060
Okay.

2270
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:02,420
Uh, let me see.

2271
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:05,620
First now, I think these are gonna, oh wait, no, we had, we, we, we had an issue.

2272
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:06,540
Should I try to play it?

2273
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:07,500
You think I should give it a shot?

2274
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:07,860
What?

2275
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:11,340
From the, uh, the rhythm bot here, or should I just say fuck it?

2276
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:14,580
And we'll all, uh, try, try rhythm just one more time.

2277
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:15,620
Okay, we'll just give it a shot.

2278
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,020
All right.

2279
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:17,020
Uh, let me go over here.

2280
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:21,620
So as you always know, people go to the speak pipe link down below in the

2281
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,740
description and leave us your lovely voice mails.

2282
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:27,180
Uh, and do, if you have a more complicated one, as long as it's good,

2283
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:28,860
don't waste your time if it's bullshit.

2284
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:32,500
But if you have a longer one, you can always leave a link like in the title as

2285
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:35,900
some people do to like a longer one, but I'm telling you right now, if it's not

2286
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:37,740
good instantly, I will skip it.

2287
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:38,460
Uh, all right.

2288
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,740
Anyway, let's try this and see if it works.

2289
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:44,100
Uh, first one, if it works, this is from, Oh, right.

2290
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,180
This is just set in the tone for today.

2291
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:48,980
It's a Brad D M garling house.

2292
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,340
Uh, who, who could that be?

2293
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,860
I wonder go play that.

2294
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:53,740
No, no, no, no, no.

2295
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:54,060
All right.

2296
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,580
This can happen.

2297
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:55,980
Okay.

2298
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:56,660
That's all right.

2299
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:57,860
We'll just play them ourselves.

2300
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:58,140
Okay.

2301
01:46:58,140 --> 01:46:58,700
Let's play it.

2302
01:46:58,780 --> 01:46:59,260
That's fine.

2303
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:01,540
Brad D M garling house.

2304
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:02,180
Here we go.

2305
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:04,820
Count three, one, two, three, go.

2306
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:06,260
You see?

2307
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:11,900
I've come to add the voicemails.

2308
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,460
Thanks, Brad.

2309
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,860
God, great.

2310
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:21,340
Wait, he just, he just, the beginning of the voicemails.

2311
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:22,300
Oh, shit.

2312
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,500
He just takes and takes.

2313
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:27,180
He will, he'll have no satisfaction.

2314
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:28,660
Uh, no.

2315
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:29,100
Okay, give.

2316
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:31,260
That's why we played it first to prove him wrong.

2317
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,620
You'll never get us down, Brad D.

2318
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:34,900
I don't care how many M's.

2319
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:36,660
Why did he put the M in here?

2320
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:38,300
What's the D M about?

2321
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:41,100
There's probably like some other thing.

2322
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,220
Like obviously it's a one piece.

2323
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:44,460
And that was a one piece sounds, which is good.

2324
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:46,340
But I don't, you don't get the M.

2325
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:49,620
I think we should exclude, I think we should exclusively

2326
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:55,300
refer to bread garlic house in emoji form because I, I was

2327
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:59,260
tweeting, I was tweeting and there's a bread and a garlic

2328
01:47:59,260 --> 01:47:59,820
and a house.

2329
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:00,340
That sounds good.

2330
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,580
So like we, we should just speak in code.

2331
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:05,260
Like we should never actually type out his name because

2332
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:08,140
like, like Voldemort, he knows whenever his name is mentioned.

2333
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:08,900
You're right.

2334
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:11,740
We need to speak in code with a bread garlic house emoji.

2335
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:12,420
Fantastic.

2336
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:12,940
I love it.

2337
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:13,940
Uh, let's do this.

2338
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:15,620
This is, this is, this is how we're, this is how we're going

2339
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:16,780
to build the resistance.

2340
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,220
One loaf at a time.

2341
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:21,020
Uh, all right, let's, let's go to the next one.

2342
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,420
I don't know why that, that really got me over.

2343
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:24,820
All right.

2344
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:25,460
Next one.

2345
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:25,820
Okay.

2346
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:26,300
This is good.

2347
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:31,340
This is let's shit on Digi with a moral, a moral is a useful

2348
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,340
word that Digi doesn't use.

2349
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:33,900
Right.

2350
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:34,220
All right.

2351
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:34,700
Here we go.

2352
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:37,460
One, two, three, go.

2353
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:41,220
Digi, you don't use the word a moral correctly.

2354
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:46,220
Use it to mean morally bad instead of morally good, but that is

2355
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:47,540
what immoral means.

2356
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:52,220
A moral means that it's not on the moral spectrum, which I think

2357
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:54,340
is a useful term to have.

2358
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:58,020
You could say like sexuality is a moral.

2359
01:48:58,060 --> 01:48:59,340
It isn't good or bad.

2360
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:02,900
It just is not even to do with the moral spectrum.

2361
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:04,340
Uh, so yeah.

2362
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:06,580
Start using it right because it's cool.

2363
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:10,980
Take your pick, which side of the fence I fall on.

2364
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:13,620
This guy is technically right.

2365
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:19,980
I don't know whether you would describe sexuality as a, well, it's

2366
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:21,140
like, I don't know.

2367
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:23,060
It's such a, it's like fire, right?

2368
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:23,420
Like fire.

2369
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:23,820
Yeah.

2370
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:24,380
There you go.

2371
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:24,860
There you go.

2372
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:25,180
Yeah.

2373
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:26,380
That, that would be an, okay.

2374
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:27,340
Burns as bad.

2375
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:29,980
Oh, but what if it's heating my house sexuality?

2376
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:33,740
Sexuality is like a morally good or bad depending on the society

2377
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:35,620
in which you live, but fire is fire.

2378
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:35,860
Yeah.

2379
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:36,780
It just burns.

2380
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:38,100
Uh, there you go.

2381
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:38,860
I don't know.

2382
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:41,780
I, this guy's technically correct, but like, he knows what he means.

2383
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:45,820
So we feel like it's a little bit pedantic to be like, eh, like, I don't

2384
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:47,980
know, did you use all kinds of words wrong?

2385
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:49,340
He definitely does.

2386
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:53,020
Uh, I feel like, but do people actually use the word a moral to

2387
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,540
mean like negative?

2388
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:57,980
I mean, I, I always know what he means when he says it in the context

2389
01:49:57,980 --> 01:49:58,620
that he says it.

2390
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:00,540
I like this guy's definition.

2391
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:00,900
He's right.

2392
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:01,900
This is a useful word.

2393
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,860
And I wish it was used correctly all the time.

2394
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:04,780
I think I like it.

2395
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:08,980
I feel like when someone, you know, honestly, I'm kind of curious.

2396
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:13,260
Um, a moral definition.

2397
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:14,740
I mean, let's look it up.

2398
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:16,540
Okay.

2399
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:21,020
A moral means lacking a moral sense, unconcerned with the rightness

2400
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:22,300
or wrongness of something.

2401
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:28,300
I feel like it's not, I feel like it's not wrong to, okay.

2402
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:34,660
If you, if you say like, oh, uh, like a murder is a moral, I, I, that

2403
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:37,100
would bother me because it's like, okay, when you're saying it has no

2404
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:39,900
morality, but like, I think what you're trying to say is that it is morally

2405
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:44,180
bad, but if you say a person is a moral and it's like, they don't care

2406
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:46,820
what, whether something is right or wrong, like they're a sociopath or

2407
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:50,580
something, probably it would make sense to infer from like, Oh, okay.

2408
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:53,660
So they do things that are morally wrong because they're a moral and they

2409
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:54,220
don't care.

2410
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:57,940
I feel like there's an argument to be made here that using a moral in

2411
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:00,500
that case is not always bad.

2412
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:02,180
Uh, yeah, I guess you're right.

2413
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:02,820
I guess you're right.

2414
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:05,780
Again, this guy is technically correct.

2415
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:11,100
Now for, for the true definition, I went over to urbandictionary.com and the

2416
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,740
first two are boring, yawn, don't care.

2417
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:18,380
But the third one, uh, definition of a moral is simply legalized narcotics.

2418
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:20,460
That's the definition of a moral.

2419
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:23,300
Um, fair enough.

2420
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:23,780
All right.

2421
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:24,420
Moving on.

2422
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:27,500
Let's go to our next narcotics legalized.

2423
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:29,860
Narcotics is their third definition.

2424
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:30,820
That's super good.

2425
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:34,180
That's so good for you.

2426
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:35,020
I'm very helped.

2427
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:35,500
All right.

2428
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:36,660
Let's go to the next one.

2429
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:39,300
Uh, adulting question mark.

2430
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:43,260
Uh, all right, let's play this one, two, three, go.

2431
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:48,980
So Nate's definition of adulthood is providing 100% for yourself, paying your

2432
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:52,860
own rent, not living with anyone else, being entirely on your own.

2433
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:56,340
So by that definition is Ben St.

2434
01:51:56,540 --> 01:52:01,500
An adult, I mean, on the podcast, at least we've only ever heard tales of him

2435
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:05,180
living with 15 other men in his own squalor, paying as little as possible for

2436
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:09,860
rent and surviving on less than $1,000 a month in a city like fucking Boston,

2437
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:11,100
which how do you even do that, dude?

2438
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:12,500
I'm genuinely curious.

2439
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:16,340
I need these money saving hacks that you're using to survive in that shit

2440
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:16,860
whole city.

2441
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:18,260
Please share.

2442
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:19,860
I am genuinely curious.

2443
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:23,500
And if you have ever provided 100% for yourself, Ben, please share

2444
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:24,300
your experiences.

2445
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:25,060
I'd love to know.

2446
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:29,660
I love Nate's little heartbreak stories and I can relate to it as I've lived

2447
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:33,580
on my own since August 2018 and I love it.

2448
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:35,180
It's the best thing that ever happened to me.

2449
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:36,980
Anyway, thanks for listening, guys.

2450
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:39,580
Hey buddy, come and fight me in real life, huh?

2451
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:40,740
Huh?

2452
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:42,460
What are you, not so, not so tough now.

2453
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:44,860
You're real tough through the computer screen, huh?

2454
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:50,620
We got so, not so tough when you're facing down the barrel of my fist, fucker.

2455
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:54,300
Everybody comes, everybody who comes to my house.

2456
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:59,180
Says, wow, Ben, I expected you to live in like a complete shit hole, but

2457
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:00,780
actually this place is pretty nice.

2458
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:02,300
Like it's pretty, it's, it's true.

2459
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:03,500
It's pretty decent.

2460
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:07,100
Um, uh, well, okay.

2461
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:09,700
He's, he's, he's, I'm so fucking blustered.

2462
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:10,900
I'm so fucking mad.

2463
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:11,820
I don't understand.

2464
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,300
I do.

2465
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:13,780
Is this guy being genuine?

2466
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:14,580
I mean, okay.

2467
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:16,460
Is there something wrong with having roommates?

2468
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:17,020
Okay.

2469
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:20,740
Is this such a problem in 2020 in this economy?

2470
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:24,860
The fact that he correlates being an adult with not having roommates.

2471
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:28,660
I mean, Elaine Bennes, the most adult person I've ever known had roommates in

2472
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:29,460
Seinfeld.

2473
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:30,020
Yeah.

2474
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:35,380
I think the thing that he's, I think he's trying to be like, ha ha, jokey jokey.

2475
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:39,860
Let's make fun of Ben because of the fact that he brought up Nate's definition of

2476
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:40,540
being an adult.

2477
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:43,540
Which isn't even my definite, I mean, you know, yeah.

2478
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:46,900
I mean, Ben is an adult because Ben runs his own shit.

2479
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:49,860
That's, that's what being an adult is, you know, yeah, you know.

2480
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:50,220
Thank you.

2481
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:51,540
Like, I don't know.

2482
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:56,620
If you, if you live in a duplex and like, and like you're, you, you live on one side

2483
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:58,220
and another family lives on another.

2484
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:02,380
Are you not, are you not self-sufficient because another family is paying for the

2485
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:03,500
other half of the house?

2486
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:06,540
Um, whatever.

2487
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:07,140
Okay.

2488
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:09,460
No, my shit's, my shit's covered.

2489
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:10,180
My shit's fine.

2490
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:11,740
Okay, but that's the definition.

2491
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:14,700
I am definitely, no, I fucking, I pay for all my own shit.

2492
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:16,060
He does.

2493
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:16,620
He does.

2494
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:17,620
So far as I know.

2495
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:22,740
I, yeah, I feel like this guy was trying to make a joke, but I'm like genuinely

2496
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:23,380
offended.

2497
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:25,780
Yeah, I don't, I don't blame you.

2498
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:29,140
But I mean, the, the second half of that, I mean, he said he likes living alone.

2499
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:30,300
It's the best thing that ever happened to him.

2500
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:31,140
Okay, cool.

2501
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:31,460
Great.

2502
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:32,660
I very much agree.

2503
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:35,940
I hate going back to my parents for long periods of time for like one day it can be

2504
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:36,300
fine.

2505
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:39,900
Uh, but, but he wants, he's looking for tips about how to live that.

2506
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,940
Uh, what, what's the word?

2507
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:42,300
Alternative lifestyle.

2508
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,500
Wait, was he asking me for advice?

2509
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:46,060
There was a part in there.

2510
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:46,980
Yeah, yeah.

2511
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:49,740
Where he wanted to minimize costs and whatnot.

2512
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:53,380
I mean, it's like straight up just like having a bunch of roommates is how I do.

2513
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:57,380
It's like my, I guess that's number one, that's the number one thing.

2514
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,620
Surprise, surprise.

2515
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:00,140
You already knew the secret.

2516
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:04,900
Yeah, either, either you live as a child or you die.

2517
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,620
That's, that's your two options.

2518
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:11,180
Being, what's more adult than being deceased, you know, like you had your life as a child.

2519
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:11,900
Now it's over.

2520
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:14,300
And, you know, time to, time to move along.

2521
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,460
All right, enough of that one.

2522
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:21,500
Oh, and, oh, and never, never eat out, never, never eat pussy, never eat pussy.

2523
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,540
It's simp behavior.

2524
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:23,180
It's simpy.

2525
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:28,100
No, never, never eat out, never eat out, cook all, cook all your own food.

2526
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:30,260
That's it, those, those two things.

2527
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:35,940
Buy a giant bag of rice, get a bunch of rice, a bunch of beans and just eat that forever.

2528
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:37,740
Honestly, yeah, it's great.

2529
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:38,940
I mean, yeah, you'll be fine.

2530
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:39,300
You'll be fine.

2531
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:42,460
When I went on, you know, I just ate tons of rice and I was like, this is delicious.

2532
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:44,300
I could eat this every day.

2533
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:45,500
And for a while, I did.

2534
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:47,660
I love rice so much.

2535
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:48,340
It's so delicious.

2536
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:50,500
Oh, wait, no, best money saving tip.

2537
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:51,500
I love Japan, period.

2538
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:53,380
I love curry, I love it.

2539
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:56,580
Okay, the one exception to the never eat out rule.

2540
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:57,900
I'm doing this right now.

2541
01:55:58,580 --> 01:56:01,140
Go to five guys, buy some shit.

2542
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:05,620
And then while you wait for your order, just shovel free peanuts into the fucking bag.

2543
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:05,980
Yes.

2544
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:06,260
Right.

2545
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:07,740
I left the way.

2546
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:12,420
I left with the entire cover costs, almost the entire fucking like paper bag

2547
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,220
that my order came in, filled with peanuts.

2548
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:16,820
I'm still eating them.

2549
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:18,180
I'm eating them right now.

2550
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:19,620
Fantastic.

2551
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:20,740
It's so good.

2552
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:22,300
Oh, man.

2553
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:24,980
Speaking, I was going to say on rice and all these things.

2554
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:26,460
So that's, that's my secret.

2555
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:28,140
Actually, that's been the main secret.

2556
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:28,380
Yeah.

2557
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:30,180
Five guys change the game.

2558
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:33,660
How do I, Ben, Ben, I love, I love your content.

2559
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:35,780
How do you live such a carefree lifestyle?

2560
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:38,140
My secret free peanuts at five guys.

2561
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:42,140
It's all about those free five guys peanuts.

2562
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:46,940
It's the, it's the basis on which I've built my entire empire.

2563
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:47,740
It makes sense.

2564
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:48,500
It makes sense.

2565
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:51,620
I know I've said this a probably a long time ago, but it might as well say it again.

2566
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:56,700
A little known fact, did you guys know that Hawaii is basically Japan too?

2567
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:58,260
That pretty much just is a fact.

2568
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:59,060
You have said that.

2569
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:01,060
Oh, by the way, it's great.

2570
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:02,780
It's where all the Japanese tourists go, right?

2571
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:03,780
Absolutely true.

2572
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:06,940
Actually, you know, Michelle, while we were here, watched the K-On! movie.

2573
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:11,100
It's because Ohio sounds like this is like, ah, it's the Hello Island.

2574
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:13,820
That's, that's Japan three, Ohio.

2575
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:17,500
But wherever I go becomes Japan three, frankly.

2576
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,780
Oh, wait, no, Ohio is not Hawaii.

2577
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:20,900
They sound so similar.

2578
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:21,940
It's like Hawaii.

2579
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:24,780
Actually, there is an island called, but it's spelled like weird, you know,

2580
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:29,140
Islander, like K-A-U-A-I or whatever, Hawaii or something like that.

2581
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:34,060
Still epic, but Michelle was here and she watched the K-On! movie.

2582
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:37,540
And she was telling me that like, oh, actually, like all the class,

2583
01:57:37,540 --> 01:57:40,820
because like, depending on the class you're in or the, sorry, the club,

2584
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:42,500
because they're in the Light Music Club in K-On!

2585
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:45,860
I'm like, all the, all the Japanese, you know, because of Japanese and K-On!

2586
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:51,060
They all went to Hawaii, which was considered the like, safe vacation place to go

2587
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:53,100
at like, as a graduation thing or whatever.

2588
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:59,140
But like, as a crazy, kooky, spooky one, the Light Music Club girls went to London instead,

2589
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:01,660
where it's not as many Asians.

2590
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:02,500
Yeah, yeah.

2591
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,220
Going to Hawaii in Japan.

2592
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:06,580
It's like a four hour flight, by the way, from Japan to Hawaii.

2593
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,620
It's like right there.

2594
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:09,340
It's as close as California.

2595
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:11,540
So, yeah, four or five hours, whatever.

2596
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:14,540
As, wait, as close to Japan as California?

2597
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:17,540
Well, Hawaii's in between California and Japan, like right,

2598
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:19,380
right, equidistance or so, yeah.

2599
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:23,500
Hawaii is, oh, oh, yeah, it's an island, Ben.

2600
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:24,220
It's an island.

2601
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:25,220
OK, OK.

2602
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:26,340
It's an ocean.

2603
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:27,860
It's an ocean, Ben.

2604
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:29,420
DeWave, man, DeWave.

2605
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:35,580
And I was going to say that I desperately want to go get both curry and,

2606
01:58:35,580 --> 01:58:38,020
oh, I already had a ramen with a little Naruto in it.

2607
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:40,340
It was fucking sick, dude.

2608
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:43,820
Oh, what does Naruto taste like?

2609
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:46,940
They're a little, well, frankly, you always get them in ramen,

2610
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:48,460
so they taste like ramen broth.

2611
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:50,300
It's the fish-paste little cake thing with the spiral on it, yeah?

2612
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:53,140
That's right, but they absorb the flavor, so it is made of fish,

2613
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,540
but it just tastes like, you know, the miso soup or whatever you got in there.

2614
01:58:57,060 --> 01:58:59,980
But I cannot, I'm going to go get curry, and it's going to be great,

2615
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:01,740
and I can't wait.

2616
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:03,940
If I can divert for a second.

2617
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:05,180
I'm done, I'm done, yeah.

2618
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:08,860
When we were talking about HIPAA, when you brought it up,

2619
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:10,860
when you brought it up that you were watching Bread Tube,

2620
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:14,940
I wanted to say that I was sick and tired and I couldn't,

2621
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:16,660
I wasn't going to take it anymore,

2622
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:21,300
so I've decided to start subtly radicalizing the killers.

2623
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:25,540
So I went to Copkill Town, and I created a separate,

2624
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:30,060
I created a separate channel in Copkill Town

2625
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:31,460
that anyone there can see.

2626
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:34,900
It's called the Radicalization Station, and all it is,

2627
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:37,140
it's just every video that Thought Slime makes.

2628
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:40,060
Because I thought that was pretty on-brand.

2629
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:44,340
So the Radicalization Station is just where you go to watch Thought Slime

2630
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:47,620
and discover that all cops are bad and that we should dissolve the state.

2631
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:49,740
And that's it.

2632
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:54,460
Man, I can't tell you about a time where things didn't improve

2633
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:56,500
when my video games went political.

2634
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,500
I can't think of any examples.

2635
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:00,220
It's pure straight up, man.

2636
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:01,740
Unfortunately, it's true.

2637
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:04,900
Endless War has gone political, and it's not fun anymore.

2638
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:07,700
All right.

2639
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:12,140
Oh, I learned one other fun fact that people may be amused by,

2640
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:14,780
which is, you know those famous Hawaiian shirts, Ben,

2641
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:18,500
that you and I wore from Billabong with the flans and all those?

2642
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:20,500
I had so many and so many colors.

2643
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,780
They were wonderful. They were wonderful.

2644
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:24,340
Well, so like traditional Hawaiian shirts out here,

2645
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:26,940
they're like, they're like officials will wear them.

2646
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:29,580
They're like actual like uniforms for things,

2647
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:31,420
or they're like considered dressing up or whatever.

2648
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:33,420
Are they the same pattern?

2649
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:33,900
It's hot.

2650
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:35,140
No, all different patterns.

2651
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:37,300
So it's very colorful and all different stuff.

2652
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:40,300
But like I learned the origin of them at some, I don't know,

2653
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:43,100
we were somewhere or something, and there was a sign or whatever

2654
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:44,500
that just said, like, did you know?

2655
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,620
I think around a museum or like Pearl Harbor or something

2656
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:51,620
that originally the famous Hawaiian shirts were so the Japanese

2657
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:55,260
like immigrants or whatever came from Japan to Hawaii to look for work.

2658
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:56,860
They work in the fields and stuff.

2659
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:59,820
And their kimonos, which are all different patterns and colors,

2660
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:03,260
they would cut and taper down and pin in place

2661
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:05,260
so that they could work on the plantations.

2662
02:01:05,340 --> 02:01:08,340
And it's those like morphed Japanese kimonos

2663
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:12,980
like in this Hawaiian style that became the Hawaiian shirts we know today.

2664
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:15,260
So it's actually a Japanese thing originally.

2665
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:16,620
Fucking weeaboos.

2666
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:18,780
Isn't I know they can't escape them.

2667
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:21,580
Every culture is a whole island of weeaboos.

2668
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:25,740
Just just just just pickable culture is their number one export.

2669
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:27,860
All right, let's do next one.

2670
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:29,700
The truth. You ready for the truth?

2671
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:31,540
No, probably not.

2672
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:32,740
I'm ready. All right.

2673
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:35,420
Here we go. One, two, three, go.

2674
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:37,300
I've done it.

2675
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:40,180
I figured out the big secret of the whole world.

2676
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:43,780
Everything is going to come apart after this.

2677
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:48,060
OK, at least sex isn't real.

2678
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:52,100
I've made twenty five laps around the sun.

2679
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:56,780
I have seen no physical evidence of sex at all.

2680
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:59,740
Babies, the stork.

2681
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:02,980
Yeah, is the actual way babies come from.

2682
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:06,980
Is they're pulling the ball over your eyes when they say it wasn't.

2683
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:09,780
Sex isn't real.

2684
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:12,940
Porn is a whole sci-op by the government.

2685
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:15,460
Yeah.

2686
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:17,300
There's no other way to explain it.

2687
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:21,260
How could I, after twenty five years, not have had sex?

2688
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:24,460
It was the only way. It's got to be fake.

2689
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:26,220
Yeah, I guess.

2690
02:02:26,220 --> 02:02:27,820
Holy shit.

2691
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:28,660
Good logic.

2692
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:32,460
I mean, I mean, even if sex was real,

2693
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:36,100
I don't know why we have to bring babies in because I've seen correlation

2694
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:40,700
between like people having sex and babies, but like I haven't seen a causal link.

2695
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:42,900
It's not there. It's not there.

2696
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:47,420
Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, you do you sleep you sleep in the same bed

2697
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:50,140
with a woman and then an angel comes and, you know,

2698
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:53,740
they talk to the woman about something and you something happens.

2699
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:55,500
Tell you what, the truth.

2700
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:59,140
Why don't you bring me your girlfriend or your mother

2701
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:01,420
and we will try to figure out this causal link.

2702
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:04,500
Just the two of us will see what happens.

2703
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:06,900
Oh, won't that be?

2704
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:07,540
Oh, you cut out.

2705
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:10,180
Did you say your girlfriend or and or mother?

2706
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:11,140
I did. I did.

2707
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:14,060
These are the two options on the table.

2708
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:14,940
That's how you do it.

2709
02:03:14,940 --> 02:03:17,140
No age is too ageing.

2710
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:22,420
All right. Next, we got four, Nick, eight.

2711
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:23,620
OK, all right. Here we go.

2712
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:25,860
One, two, three, go.

2713
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:27,860
A, B, C, B, A.

2714
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:30,740
So the dating sim is being released this week.

2715
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:31,620
Oh, my God, that's right.

2716
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:34,140
I'm an undecided dator from Nevada.

2717
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:39,340
I still don't know if I should date Tom or Digi or Brad

2718
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:42,140
or maybe I'm just better off being a meek towel.

2719
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:45,740
Why should I date you specifically?

2720
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,540
What's your position on gay marriage?

2721
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:51,300
Personally, I don't want to date

2722
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:52,700
candidate that supports it.

2723
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:54,620
It goes against my founding principles,

2724
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:58,620
right, liberty, having a small government and sucking a dick.

2725
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:03,300
When you over PCP, Pete, 20, make my heart flutter,

2726
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:08,140
make my mind explode and make my soul yours.

2727
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:11,100
Right. Now, this guy's got a winning attitude.

2728
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:12,820
I'm happy to pursue his vote.

2729
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:15,780
Yeah, like, um, Valentine's Day is the what, the 14th?

2730
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:17,900
The 14th, five days away from a recording.

2731
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:19,740
So that'll be out.

2732
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:21,460
No, that is coming out the day.

2733
02:04:21,460 --> 02:04:24,140
The day, when you hear this, it will be out.

2734
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:25,060
Holy Christ.

2735
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:27,420
It will have, I mean, unless something fucks,

2736
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:30,340
unless they fuck it, unless it's shadow incorporated,

2737
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:32,580
like causes like deliberate app failure.

2738
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:37,180
Yeah, part of Valentine's Day and Valentine's Day gets canceled.

2739
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:40,940
Valentine's Day will get replaced with Valentine's Day.

2740
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:43,340
And it's going to be a nightmare for this guy, if no one else.

2741
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:45,540
So yeah, it should be out

2742
02:04:46,540 --> 02:04:48,980
right now, as you hear my voice.

2743
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:49,940
Yeah, how exciting?

2744
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:50,780
You should, you should not.

2745
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:52,140
Lincoln the doobly-do.

2746
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:55,060
You should not go for me.

2747
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:57,780
No, I don't want anyone to fuck me.

2748
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:58,980
Reverse psychology, right?

2749
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:02,740
I also don't want, I honestly, I don't want anyone to fuck me.

2750
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:03,740
Please don't.

2751
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:05,780
Okay, I don't know this for sure.

2752
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:07,220
I don't consent.

2753
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:10,820
Hey, hey, viewers, I'm saying right now that I do not consent.

2754
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:11,980
Oh, Lord.

2755
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:13,260
Hey, do you guys know?

2756
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:14,580
I wonder what he means by that.

2757
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:17,500
Dating sims come in all stripes and all sizes and shapes.

2758
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:19,620
Is there sex in this?

2759
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:20,820
Like, are there sex scenes?

2760
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:22,740
Because that's a pretty clean divide between dating scenes.

2761
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:27,540
I have not heard of any actual, like even implied sex scenes.

2762
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:29,380
But yeah, I mean, there could be.

2763
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:31,300
But I have no actual evidence.

2764
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:32,500
I don't know who would have drawn them.

2765
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:33,900
I mean, I'm very curious.

2766
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:38,260
The absence of evidence of sex is not evidence of the absence of sex.

2767
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:39,020
Very, very true.

2768
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:40,620
It is evidence of abstinence.

2769
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:43,180
Well, I mean, maybe there is sex, but it's behind.

2770
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:45,380
You have to, like, hack into the mainframe and, like,

2771
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:48,780
and, like, re-remove some, like, some, like, code or something.

2772
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:51,780
Yeah, a.k.a. open the folder of all the images in the look.

2773
02:05:52,780 --> 02:05:56,540
Or maybe you have to, you know, pledge to the silver or gold tiers

2774
02:05:56,540 --> 02:06:00,660
on their, you know, PCP dating sim Patreon in order to get the exclusive.

2775
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,220
I've seen some shit like that.

2776
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:03,340
Oh, it makes me mad.

2777
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:04,940
Oh, I don't like it.

2778
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:07,460
Oh, I'm filled with fury.

2779
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:08,340
But hopefully not.

2780
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:11,580
Maybe they maybe they did, like, funny censor bars that don't.

2781
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:13,700
There is nothing under this.

2782
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:14,820
I mean, there's plenty of room.

2783
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:15,420
I don't know.

2784
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:18,380
There's plenty of room for comedic sex scenes that aren't, like,

2785
02:06:18,380 --> 02:06:19,780
you know, actually porn.

2786
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:20,740
I don't care either way.

2787
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:21,980
I will experience whatever happens.

2788
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:23,940
They make you laugh, but they're still fucking hot, though.

2789
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:25,380
Hell, yeah, that's that's the idea.

2790
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:28,900
It'll be all in text, like, and then the sex happens.

2791
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:32,060
Ooh, unga, bunga.

2792
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:34,340
By my cat's rays.

2793
02:06:35,540 --> 02:06:38,940
And they got, like, like the version of the avatar with the glasses,

2794
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:41,220
like, slightly tilted, like, and the hair ruffled.

2795
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:42,300
That sounds great.

2796
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:43,780
I hope that happens.

2797
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:44,780
I guess we'll see.

2798
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:47,180
All right, anyway, go check it out.

2799
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:50,260
I believe it's at PCP dating.

2800
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:51,900
I think it's at, I think it's at PSB Day.

2801
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:53,180
We'll put a link down below.

2802
02:06:53,180 --> 02:06:54,580
Let me make absolutely sure.

2803
02:06:54,580 --> 02:06:56,180
Okay, okay, yes, please.

2804
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:56,980
Take a pause.

2805
02:06:56,980 --> 02:06:58,260
Yeah, because there was another one.

2806
02:06:58,260 --> 02:06:59,980
The joke one.

2807
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:02,620
Yeah, it is, yeah, PCP dating.

2808
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:03,700
At PSB dating on Twitter.

2809
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,540
You can definitely get it there on the day.

2810
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:06,740
So be prepared.

2811
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:08,380
We will, all right.

2812
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:10,060
Do they have any updates?

2813
02:07:10,220 --> 02:07:11,060
I haven't checked.

2814
02:07:11,060 --> 02:07:11,900
Do you see anything there?

2815
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:12,860
I assume you're looking at that.

2816
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:17,860
On Jan, a week ago, they tweeted, hold on to your butts.

2817
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:19,660
PCP dating sims script.

2818
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:20,580
Okay.

2819
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:21,420
They released the script.

2820
02:07:21,420 --> 02:07:23,220
There's a picture of the script.

2821
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:25,620
Oh, the giant text dump.

2822
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:29,060
Like, that's gotta be like 200 pages, 100, 200 something.

2823
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:29,900
Yeah, that's a lot of tech.

2824
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,220
Why would you print that out?

2825
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:32,460
They've been a little quiet.

2826
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:35,580
Their last tweet was on January 30th.

2827
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:36,420
Well, can-

2828
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:37,580
Maybe it was already nearly done.

2829
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:38,700
They got nothing to say.

2830
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:39,780
Maybe, maybe.

2831
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:41,900
Maybe they're just, maybe they're just cranking.

2832
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:43,940
I mean, it's gonna be too late when we hear this.

2833
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,820
But certainly on the day you hear this, everybody,

2834
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:46,900
I'm sure they'll listen to this episode.

2835
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:47,860
It looks as though that hopes so.

2836
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:49,220
One of them, likely too.

2837
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:51,860
Let us know at TP Crasnairs, at least once.

2838
02:07:51,860 --> 02:07:54,220
We'll make sure we get the word out, if we forget,

2839
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:56,260
because it's on Friday, so it might be.

2840
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:58,500
It's gonna be Aloha Friday.

2841
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:01,540
So that's gonna be a day to take it sleazy

2842
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:03,860
like the Democratic Party.

2843
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:07,780
All right, next one.

2844
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:08,980
Let's listen to Brad is a god.

2845
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:10,700
Let's say that name.

2846
02:08:11,900 --> 02:08:13,220
All right, here we go.

2847
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:14,100
Brad is a god.

2848
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:16,660
One, two, three, go.

2849
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:20,300
I quickly wanna thank Brad Garlinghouse,

2850
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:24,820
my lord and savior, Brad, for allowing me

2851
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:29,260
and my poor, poor fellows to listen to the BGE Montel cast.

2852
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:30,100
Oh, god.

2853
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:32,180
It was really nice of him.

2854
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:34,660
He's really turning the channel around.

2855
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:36,660
It's giving it a new life.

2856
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:39,860
Thank you, Brad, and fuck you, Nate.

2857
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:42,180
This guy sounds like a guy in his turn.

2858
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:43,860
Brad Garlinghouse is for the people.

2859
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:45,900
He is one of the good billionaires.

2860
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:48,060
He is redistributing the wealth he has taken.

2861
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:51,580
Did you know that 1% of the best guy ever listeners

2862
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:56,580
have access to 99% of the content of the Patreon exclusive?

2863
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:58,740
Not anymore, baby.

2864
02:08:58,740 --> 02:08:59,940
They power to the people.

2865
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:04,420
Brad is a fucking hardcore right-wing populace.

2866
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:06,180
Everyone will listen to these podcasts,

2867
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:08,940
and then we will get the Jews somewhere.

2868
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:09,980
Not saying they're there.

2869
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:11,540
Don't worry about it.

2870
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:12,460
Well, what was I gonna say?

2871
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:13,700
Remember that website we discovered?

2872
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:15,340
Maybe I shouldn't talk about it, but who gives a fuck?

2873
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:18,580
There was a website that their purpose and being

2874
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:22,580
was to make all paywall-blocked content,

2875
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:24,060
like non-paywall-blocked,

2876
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:27,180
and they had uploaded every PCP bonus episode and stuff.

2877
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:28,020
Yes, yes.

2878
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:30,380
I don't remember what it was called,

2879
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:32,140
but I know that there are things like that.

2880
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:33,500
Yeah, me neither, me neither.

2881
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:34,380
Look, that's fine.

2882
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:35,340
I mean, whatever.

2883
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:37,380
Hope people support if they like the show and all that,

2884
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:40,260
but I wonder if that's been done.

2885
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:41,900
We all have basically, all of us,

2886
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:44,380
have our pay-off-treatment-only podcast

2887
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:45,220
that we're doing now.

2888
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:48,980
Actually, it's funny because I'm not gonna say anything,

2889
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:51,500
but the Slime and Punishment finale images

2890
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:52,820
that I've been uploading,

2891
02:09:52,820 --> 02:09:57,380
I think Christine would have an opinion about them,

2892
02:09:57,380 --> 02:09:59,900
and part of me wonders if some troll,

2893
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:02,180
if some Pee Wee Farm's troll or other

2894
02:10:02,180 --> 02:10:06,900
isn't gonna like pledge 10 bucks, get them,

2895
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:08,100
and then like post them early,

2896
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:10,540
be like, Christine, look at this.

2897
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:14,020
Honestly, I don't know if, I mean it would be interesting.

2898
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:16,020
I sure hope you don't pledge the money.

2899
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:20,860
I sure hope somebody doesn't give me $10

2900
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:25,420
to get access to this exclusive juicy content

2901
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:27,780
that would surely cause an incredible stir.

2902
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:29,740
And that's just me.

2903
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:34,460
I hear you lifelong to Christine Weston Chandler, no doubt.

2904
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:36,900
Making her subject to any and all trolls

2905
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:38,140
that may be a concoct of nature.

2906
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:40,020
I sure hope there's no one around

2907
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:41,820
looking to stir the pot a little bit.

2908
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:44,340
You might not have some extra change lying around.

2909
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:48,060
God, that sounds fantastic.

2910
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:52,260
All right, moving on, let's go to Red Orange's

2911
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:56,540
big boy, AKA Long JJ or Jelly Bean.

2912
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:57,380
That's good.

2913
02:10:57,380 --> 02:10:58,940
Those are all his names, I guess.

2914
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:00,620
All right, let's hear it.

2915
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:03,180
One, two, three, go.

2916
02:11:03,180 --> 02:11:05,860
Nate, I've heard that you like grapefruits.

2917
02:11:05,860 --> 02:11:07,100
Yeah, true.

2918
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:10,940
There's this new thing called Red Oranges.

2919
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:11,780
Yeah.

2920
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:16,380
They're oranges and grapefruits combined.

2921
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:18,540
They're so fucking good.

2922
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:19,940
Don't show this on the podcast.

2923
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:21,220
I just wanted you to know.

2924
02:11:21,220 --> 02:11:24,060
Too late, fuck you, dude.

2925
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:25,660
I'm playing on the podcast.

2926
02:11:25,660 --> 02:11:28,500
Okay, this guy's a fucking moron, okay?

2927
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:30,620
Let me tell you all about it.

2928
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:32,260
Fuck this guy.

2929
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:35,140
Fuck you and your grapefruits.

2930
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:38,460
Okay, first of all, Red Oranges,

2931
02:11:38,460 --> 02:11:41,300
no, they're called Blood Oranges,

2932
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:44,300
and they're not across between...

2933
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:45,140
There's a different thing.

2934
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:46,180
Maybe this is a new thing.

2935
02:11:46,180 --> 02:11:47,500
I don't know.

2936
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:49,180
There's no, I just googled it.

2937
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:50,860
There's no such thing as a...

2938
02:11:50,860 --> 02:11:51,700
A red orange.

2939
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:54,660
Wait, okay, a blood orange, it's a natural, okay.

2940
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:56,660
It's a natural mutation of an orange,

2941
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:57,860
which is itself a hybrid,

2942
02:11:57,860 --> 02:11:59,900
probably between the pomelo and the tangerine.

2943
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:04,900
Okay, so, yeah, blood orange is not half grapefruit.

2944
02:12:04,900 --> 02:12:05,980
You fucking idiot.

2945
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:07,580
He didn't say blood oranges were,

2946
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:08,420
he's talking about red.

2947
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:10,060
He said red, but there's no such thing.

2948
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:12,060
There's no such thing as a red orange.

2949
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:12,900
Okay, fair enough.

2950
02:12:12,900 --> 02:12:14,660
He seemed to be implying that they're new,

2951
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:17,460
so maybe they're local or some, I don't know.

2952
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:19,460
Maybe it was at his local farmer's market,

2953
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:20,300
and some guy there.

2954
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:21,460
If he's talking about blood oranges,

2955
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:22,860
we've known about them for years.

2956
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:25,460
Dexter ate one every fucking episode.

2957
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:26,580
Is that true?

2958
02:12:26,660 --> 02:12:30,420
Yeah, yeah, the opening sequence to Dexter ate a blood orange.

2959
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:31,740
I was thinking of Dexter's laboratory.

2960
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:33,900
It was supposed to be evocative, you understand,

2961
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:34,740
because he's a blood orange.

2962
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:36,380
We'll see, I was thinking Dexter's laboratory,

2963
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:37,220
so that was the...

2964
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:39,100
Oh, no, it was the computer.

2965
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:40,100
And that's wrong.

2966
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:42,100
He ate those because of his ginger hair.

2967
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:43,940
Makes him really smart, yeah.

2968
02:12:43,940 --> 02:12:45,580
Makes sense.

2969
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:48,700
That apparently is a cross between a grapefruit and an orange.

2970
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:50,820
It's called an orangello.

2971
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:52,100
Okay, I think I've heard of that.

2972
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:53,620
I've heard of that.

2973
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:56,220
This guy had an alternate name that was jellybean

2974
02:12:56,220 --> 02:12:58,020
and an orange-yellow-y-bean?

2975
02:12:58,020 --> 02:13:02,060
Orange-yellow is a hybrid citrus fruit,

2976
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:03,860
believed to have originated in Puerto Rico,

2977
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:06,180
the fruit across between a grapefruit and an orange.

2978
02:13:06,180 --> 02:13:07,020
Okay.

2979
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:08,620
That's funny, because an orange is a cross

2980
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:10,740
between a pomelo and a tangerine.

2981
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:11,860
Well, all right, look, all this is grape gnaw.

2982
02:13:11,860 --> 02:13:14,700
So then you take a pomelo and a tangerine cross,

2983
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:18,020
that was a grapefruit, and then you get an orange-ello.

2984
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:19,540
Well, actually, no, I think a grapefruit

2985
02:13:19,540 --> 02:13:21,580
is also a pomelo hybrid.

2986
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:22,420
Blood orange, zero.

2987
02:13:22,420 --> 02:13:24,300
So I guess, yeah, you are doubling up on the pomelo.

2988
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:26,180
Okay, listen, none of this matters,

2989
02:13:26,220 --> 02:13:27,020
because his main point here.

2990
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:29,260
You get a strawberry and a carrot,

2991
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:32,540
and you get something that you don't want.

2992
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:33,900
You get rhubarb.

2993
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:35,940
Yeah, you probably do.

2994
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:39,940
Listen, this guy's like, oh, I've solved it.

2995
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:41,660
I combined the orange with the grapefruit.

2996
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:42,500
What?

2997
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:44,740
No, I love this shit.

2998
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:46,900
Yeah, a grapefruit is a cross,

2999
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:50,980
an accidental cross between a sweet orange and a pomelo.

3000
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:54,260
So an orange is a tangerine pomelo.

3001
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:56,540
A grapefruit is an orange pomelo,

3002
02:13:56,540 --> 02:13:59,260
so it's a tangerine pomelo-pomelo.

3003
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:00,420
Wait, what the hell's a pomelo?

3004
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:03,180
So it's just two parts pomelo, one part tangerine,

3005
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:04,500
and that's a grapefruit.

3006
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:06,420
And then so you cross them.

3007
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:08,260
With an orange.

3008
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:09,980
I've never heard it as pomelo before.

3009
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:13,700
You just get like five sixths of pomelo,

3010
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:17,500
one part tangerine, and you call that an orange-ello.

3011
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:21,140
Wow, I guess it makes sense, kind of.

3012
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:24,140
Okay, I had never heard of a pomelo until right now.

3013
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:26,580
I have had a pomelo, they are not good.

3014
02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:27,420
No.

3015
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:28,260
Okay, okay.

3016
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:32,060
But, I think a pomelo is, imagine a grapefruit,

3017
02:14:32,060 --> 02:14:36,180
but like, it's like huge, it's like massive,

3018
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:39,220
like football size, but you open it up,

3019
02:14:39,220 --> 02:14:41,540
and like most of it is just rind.

3020
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:44,540
Like most of it is just like white fluffy rind

3021
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:45,380
that you throw away.

3022
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:46,220
Yeah, I've seen that.

3023
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:49,660
And then there's about a regular amount of grapefruit,

3024
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:52,260
of like grapefruit-ish flesh in the middle,

3025
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:54,860
and you eat it, and it just doesn't taste like anything.

3026
02:14:54,860 --> 02:14:57,180
It's like grapefruit, but like bigger,

3027
02:14:57,180 --> 02:15:00,380
with less edible part, and tastes worse.

3028
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:02,300
Here's a cross-section, yeah, look at all that.

3029
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:05,060
That's a waste, that's too much fluff.

3030
02:15:05,060 --> 02:15:07,620
I mean, I kind of love it, aesthetically, but.

3031
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:10,340
I have heard that, like, I've heard, I don't know,

3032
02:15:10,340 --> 02:15:14,420
there's, I guess people use it in like vodka or something,

3033
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:16,180
like it has its uses, but like,

3034
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:17,740
I don't think many people eat it,

3035
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:20,140
cause like it doesn't taste that great to just eat.

3036
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:22,860
Okay, so it was a tangerine cross with a pomelo

3037
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:23,700
that made oranges or something?

3038
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:28,460
Apparently an orange is a tan, no, the orange,

3039
02:15:28,460 --> 02:15:30,060
this one says the orange is a hybrid

3040
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:33,820
between a pomelo and mandarin.

3041
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:36,340
Okay, AKA a mandarin orange.

3042
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:37,900
I'm getting conflicted reports here.

3043
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:38,740
Okay, you know what?

3044
02:15:38,740 --> 02:15:40,180
I'm going to spit all these fucking fruits.

3045
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:41,820
I am way into all this.

3046
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:43,220
This is fascinating.

3047
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:44,220
But the point I was gonna make here.

3048
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:46,340
I love this shit, I love this shit.

3049
02:15:46,340 --> 02:15:47,660
Listen, his original point was like,

3050
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:50,060
Nate, you know, you love grape, I do love grapefruits.

3051
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:52,020
It's true, I'm a huge fan of grapefruit.

3052
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:53,940
It's better than oranges, fuck oranges.

3053
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:56,500
Me too, I was the original, I liked it first.

3054
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:58,540
I mean, I'm sure that's true, I'm sure that's true.

3055
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:01,220
I'm out here, Ben likes it first cause he's oldest.

3056
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:04,100
I'm out here standing for my man, the grapefruit.

3057
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:05,300
Shout outs to grapefruit, by the way.

3058
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:06,740
Shout outs to grapefruit, dude.

3059
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:07,580
Every fucking time.

3060
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:08,740
Why is it called grapefruit?

3061
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:11,420
It's so big compared to a grapefruit.

3062
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:16,140
I'm speed running, like Bikini Bottom.

3063
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:18,260
I'm fucking no clipping through the floor

3064
02:16:18,260 --> 02:16:19,100
to get to a grapefruit.

3065
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:21,220
Bikini Bottom, I say, shout outs to grapefruit

3066
02:16:21,220 --> 02:16:22,540
for powering this one.

3067
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:24,460
Bro, you know, anyone remember that kid

3068
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:25,820
who no clipped through the floor

3069
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:27,460
to get to the snack drawer faster

3070
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:29,100
to get his precious grapefruits,

3071
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:30,900
like coming home from elementary school every day?

3072
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:33,140
That was me, I admit it, it was me.

3073
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:35,900
I was speed running in a big way.

3074
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:36,740
Look.

3075
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:38,540
God, I remember no clipping at school.

3076
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:40,780
Because I was clipping through the bathroom stall

3077
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:42,420
when someone else was inside.

3078
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:43,940
And rolling out of class.

3079
02:16:43,940 --> 02:16:48,700
The blood orange page says that the orange

3080
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:51,660
is a hybrid between pomelo and tangerine.

3081
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:54,660
But the orange page says that the orange

3082
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:58,220
is a cross between pomelo and mandarin,

3083
02:16:58,220 --> 02:17:00,140
which I guess is called mandarin orange,

3084
02:17:00,140 --> 02:17:02,180
but it is not the same as a sweet orange,

3085
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:05,060
which is what we call an orange here.

3086
02:17:05,060 --> 02:17:05,900
It's all fucked up.

3087
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:08,260
I guess their factions are at war

3088
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:10,700
about the true history, I don't know.

3089
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:14,180
My friend, my roommate has a tree.

3090
02:17:14,180 --> 02:17:18,100
Oh, the sad story of the calamundan tree,

3091
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:21,020
which he called a scarlet lime.

3092
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:26,020
But calamund, he called it scarlet limes,

3093
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:29,500
but I think it's actually more commonly called

3094
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:32,100
the Philippine lime.

3095
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:33,780
I think a scarlet lime is actually something different,

3096
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:36,300
but it is these, they're like limes,

3097
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:37,980
but I guess they turn orange,

3098
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:39,860
but they're still very tart when they,

3099
02:17:39,860 --> 02:17:42,340
but he's got this potted tree.

3100
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:45,860
And it, one year, last year in like the spring,

3101
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:47,980
it flowered and it smelled so good.

3102
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:50,260
It was like such a sweet smelling,

3103
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:52,820
like nice smelling flowering tree.

3104
02:17:52,820 --> 02:17:54,900
It was like really great.

3105
02:17:54,900 --> 02:17:58,780
But then, I guess it got put in the wrong place,

3106
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:00,820
like the weather turned bad at the wrong time or something,

3107
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:04,060
and it lost all of its, it died.

3108
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:06,300
But not entirely though.

3109
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:10,020
So now, so he had to cut basically the entire tree down,

3110
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:11,820
and it just sprouted like one little leaf

3111
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:15,940
from the side of the little foot-long stick

3112
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:17,900
sticking out of the dirt pot.

3113
02:18:17,900 --> 02:18:21,620
But now it has kind of grown like a little bit more.

3114
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:23,420
It's like, it's not quite a bush,

3115
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:25,540
but it's sort of like a little bunch of leaves

3116
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:28,580
just kind of coming out the bottom of this one like stick.

3117
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:31,260
And like, boy, I'm rooting for it.

3118
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:33,060
I really hope it flowers again.

3119
02:18:33,060 --> 02:18:35,100
Were they green or were they orange?

3120
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:38,460
Okay, because it was not, yeah.

3121
02:18:38,460 --> 02:18:42,180
Well, if it's like fully mature, they look like that.

3122
02:18:42,180 --> 02:18:45,100
It only sprouted like one lime,

3123
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:46,460
and it did not fully mature.

3124
02:18:46,460 --> 02:18:47,540
So it never turned orange.

3125
02:18:47,540 --> 02:18:50,860
It had like one actual like fruit on it,

3126
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:54,500
and it was green because it did not like fully mature.

3127
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:55,740
Sure, sure.

3128
02:18:55,740 --> 02:19:00,260
Well, listen, this guy's point was that I got a genius idea.

3129
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:01,100
He got to smell him.

3130
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:02,140
At some point in your life,

3131
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:04,700
he got to smell the flowers of a calamandan.

3132
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:07,100
To respond? Or a calamansi, I guess it's also called.

3133
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:07,940
Who the fuck was it?

3134
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:10,420
Red oranges who didn't want me to play this voicemail,

3135
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:12,220
but I did it anyway.

3136
02:19:12,220 --> 02:19:15,180
He's like, I'll defuse a grapefruit in an orange.

3137
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:16,900
It'll be like a grapefruit, but the size of an orange.

3138
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:18,660
Why the fuck would I want a grapefruit

3139
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:20,180
the size of an orange when I could just take

3140
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:23,460
a normal big grapefruit, which is just more fruit?

3141
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:24,300
Why would anyone want that?

3142
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:25,580
Would you have a grapefruit as bigger?

3143
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:27,620
Retarded, I like that they're bigger.

3144
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:29,300
It's so much better that they're bigger.

3145
02:19:29,300 --> 02:19:31,300
I hate how small oranges are.

3146
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:33,060
The main reason I don't eat oranges

3147
02:19:33,060 --> 02:19:35,380
is because it's so much work for less fruit

3148
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:36,220
than a grapefruit.

3149
02:19:36,220 --> 02:19:38,020
It makes me mad.

3150
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:43,020
I wonder if an orange yellow is good.

3151
02:19:43,980 --> 02:19:45,980
I'm sure it's acceptable.

3152
02:19:46,020 --> 02:19:47,060
I don't know, maybe not.

3153
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:49,220
I'll give it a shot.

3154
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:50,060
Okay, give it a shot.

3155
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:51,060
What about a lemon?

3156
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:53,820
Get the fuck out of here with that.

3157
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:55,900
All right, let's go to our next one.

3158
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:57,340
All right, these are peas in a pot.

3159
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:58,900
I mean, apparently an orange yellow

3160
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:00,660
is just like sweeter than a grapefruit,

3161
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:02,540
so I guess it's just like right in between, I guess.

3162
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:03,820
I prefer grapefruit to orange,

3163
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:05,020
so I would probably just rather go

3164
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:05,860
for a fucking grapefruit.

3165
02:20:05,860 --> 02:20:07,460
Yeah, obviously we're not these cowards.

3166
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:09,140
We're talking about who put sugar on the grapefruit.

3167
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:10,620
Like idiots, it doesn't need it.

3168
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:11,460
Oh my God, oh well.

3169
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:13,540
They should kill themselves, it's retarded.

3170
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:14,380
They're so good.

3171
02:20:14,380 --> 02:20:15,220
What is wrong with these people?

3172
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:16,740
Who fuck with a delicious grapefruit like that?

3173
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:17,580
All right.

3174
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:18,420
Waste of a good fruit.

3175
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:19,660
It's like turning it into a fucking pie.

3176
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:21,980
Like, okay, I guess that's fine, but whatever.

3177
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:22,820
All right.

3178
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:24,700
Waste of a good fruit, I tell you what.

3179
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:25,540
It is.

3180
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:28,300
Man, I got at the local farmer's market,

3181
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:31,980
I got some, or one of my friends got some

3182
02:20:31,980 --> 02:20:33,620
grapefruit marmalade.

3183
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:34,460
Okay, sounds good.

3184
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:35,300
It's really good.

3185
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:36,620
It was really good.

3186
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:37,780
I gotta tell you.

3187
02:20:37,780 --> 02:20:39,460
I'm glad to hear it.

3188
02:20:39,460 --> 02:20:40,780
All right, let's go to the next one.

3189
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:42,340
That's all I had to say about that.

3190
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:43,540
Next, voicemail.

3191
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:44,380
All right, here we go.

3192
02:20:44,380 --> 02:20:46,480
This is the Lost Tape Archive,

3193
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:49,420
Lost Tapes Archive Interlude.

3194
02:20:49,420 --> 02:20:50,260
This was sent special.

3195
02:20:50,260 --> 02:20:51,700
This is one of these long ass messages

3196
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:52,740
that was sent with the link.

3197
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:54,340
So, let's, well this one isn't a lot,

3198
02:20:54,340 --> 02:20:55,660
but all right, let's play it.

3199
02:20:55,660 --> 02:20:56,500
Here we go.

3200
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:58,500
One, two, three, go.

3201
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:02,060
Previously on Lost Tapes Archives.

3202
02:21:02,060 --> 02:21:02,900
There it is.

3203
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:04,900
Lost Tape Archive, DeVoo?

3204
02:21:04,900 --> 02:21:06,060
Question mark?

3205
02:21:06,060 --> 02:21:08,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Jesus.

3206
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:09,340
Horrific.

3207
02:21:09,340 --> 02:21:11,060
I think that was a war crime.

3208
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:13,580
For this crime, he's putting straight into voice jail.

3209
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:17,300
Can he exist in a superposition of jail and?

3210
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:18,900
The voice Azkaban.

3211
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:19,740
Voice Limbo.

3212
02:21:19,740 --> 02:21:22,820
Yeah, I think he exists in both simultaneously.

3213
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:25,060
Torn between two worlds.

3214
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:28,580
Continue in part two.

3215
02:21:30,460 --> 02:21:31,300
Wow.

3216
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:33,340
What did he even, I do not remember what he did

3217
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:34,180
to get into.

3218
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:35,900
That was just a recap.

3219
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:36,740
That's right.

3220
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:39,420
No, what he did was he did the Lost Tapes

3221
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:41,820
and it was all about DeVoo's fetishes.

3222
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:42,900
Oh, was it?

3223
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:45,380
Extreme and it was like, ooh, ooh.

3224
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:46,220
Okay, thank God.

3225
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:47,540
I had also forgotten.

3226
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:49,100
So I'm glad he reminded me.

3227
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:49,940
Me too.

3228
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:52,180
Me too, one of these rare reviews I'm happy to see.

3229
02:21:52,180 --> 02:21:55,740
I needed to be caught up on the lore, yeah.

3230
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:56,940
All right, well, let's jump into it.

3231
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:59,020
Them's tapes, number two.

3232
02:21:59,020 --> 02:21:59,860
Let's do it.

3233
02:21:59,860 --> 02:22:02,380
One, two, three, go.

3234
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:06,060
I am Trent in a void.

3235
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:11,140
There is no life, no food,

3236
02:22:11,140 --> 02:22:13,820
and no tapes.

3237
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:16,580
That's no good.

3238
02:22:16,580 --> 02:22:19,340
If I could make the PCP laugh,

3239
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,700
they might set me free,

3240
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:23,980
but without any tapes,

3241
02:22:23,980 --> 02:22:25,420
how can be?

3242
02:22:26,900 --> 02:22:29,580
Can I be in his voicemail?

3243
02:22:30,580 --> 02:22:31,420
Yeah.

3244
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:32,980
Them snakes.

3245
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:35,100
What?

3246
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:37,740
I was once a snake dealer,

3247
02:22:37,740 --> 02:22:41,020
but I can be your tape dealer too.

3248
02:22:41,060 --> 02:22:42,420
How are you here?

3249
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:44,940
There's no ground to slither on.

3250
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:46,980
The method is irrelevant.

3251
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:50,060
I have a tape and I am here.

3252
02:22:50,060 --> 02:22:54,180
If only we had a cassette player to play it with.

3253
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:57,740
Do not worry, my slippery, snakey fuck.

3254
02:22:57,740 --> 02:23:01,540
I have a cassette player built into my fucking face.

3255
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:03,300
Put it in, big boy.

3256
02:23:05,300 --> 02:23:06,860
Greetings.

3257
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:10,500
My name is Ben's Taint.

3258
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:13,180
I am a big smelly Taint

3259
02:23:13,180 --> 02:23:15,660
in the shape of a human.

3260
02:23:15,660 --> 02:23:16,500
Shut up.

3261
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:19,220
A true walking keto crotch.

3262
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:22,020
I draw pictures.

3263
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:24,540
I spew poo.

3264
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:27,380
BRB, I use blue.

3265
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:34,340
No, turn it off.

3266
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:37,540
Listen, buddy, I don't think this is gonna cut it.

3267
02:23:37,540 --> 02:23:39,380
We already did Ben's Taint.

3268
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:41,460
Besides, I can tell it's you.

3269
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:44,940
It's not my fault that all them snakes and personators

3270
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:46,780
sound the same.

3271
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:49,740
You'll need to awaken your a Kundalini

3272
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:53,460
if you wish to find the funny fucking tapes.

3273
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:57,140
I can provide them if I can find them.

3274
02:23:57,140 --> 02:24:01,420
To please the PCP, to be set free.

3275
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:04,900
The only payment is entertainment.

3276
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:09,340
Ooh, ooh, it's cool.

3277
02:24:09,340 --> 02:24:12,660
So, PCP, do you agree?

3278
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:15,740
I agree.

3279
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:18,140
The only payment is entertainment.

3280
02:24:18,140 --> 02:24:18,980
Yes.

3281
02:24:18,980 --> 02:24:22,620
I mean, it's yes, true.

3282
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:24,740
That's good.

3283
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:25,580
That's good stuff.

3284
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:27,340
That's good stuff in there.

3285
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:29,180
I hope you don't expect to be let out

3286
02:24:29,180 --> 02:24:31,580
of superposition voice jail.

3287
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:33,420
I mean, he himself acknowledged that tape

3288
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:35,060
was some bullshit.

3289
02:24:35,060 --> 02:24:36,860
We need, we gotta step it up.

3290
02:24:36,860 --> 02:24:38,380
Yeah, I can't remember the tape.

3291
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:40,380
I don't think he's done me yet.

3292
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:41,220
I don't think so.

3293
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:42,900
And now he's done Ben twice.

3294
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:46,140
No, no, he did you, he did everybody, didn't he?

3295
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:47,260
I don't think he did everybody.

3296
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:48,100
I can't remember.

3297
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:49,180
He was in the process of doing everybody.

3298
02:24:49,180 --> 02:24:50,020
Someone let us know.

3299
02:24:50,020 --> 02:24:52,580
I know he did, Digi and Jesse and you and Ben.

3300
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:53,420
Yeah, right, right.

3301
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:54,780
I don't know if he did Munchy or not.

3302
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:57,420
I think Tom, yeah, I don't think he did Munchy.

3303
02:24:57,420 --> 02:24:58,860
Okay, well, we shall see.

3304
02:24:58,860 --> 02:25:00,820
I do not remember.

3305
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:02,180
But I know one thing.

3306
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:07,860
Please, please in the comments, point to the time codes

3307
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:11,060
of the episodes and we'll have a look.

3308
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:14,180
Make a YouTube collaboration.

3309
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:17,500
Highlight video, yeah, of all of them's tapes.

3310
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:20,140
Just do that for me please, that would be great.

3311
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:22,740
Yeah, or at least tell us who.

3312
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:24,700
Put it in the comments, say who's been done.

3313
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:27,460
I would love to be reminded.

3314
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:31,340
I am excited for more of them's tapes to come.

3315
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:35,980
Please, God, bring them to me, deliver them.

3316
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:39,780
And save this voicemail from Brad Garlinghouse's

3317
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:42,860
devious attempts to ruin all voicemails

3318
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:45,740
by sending in pure shit voicemails

3319
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:48,260
as I'm sure he's responsible for all the bad ones.

3320
02:25:48,260 --> 02:25:51,700
If we just taint the PCP brand enough,

3321
02:25:51,700 --> 02:25:53,500
you'll have to relinquish the channel.

3322
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:54,660
It'll become a liability.

3323
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:56,780
It'll be such a liability, yeah.

3324
02:25:56,780 --> 02:25:58,780
Now that's a plan that can't fail.

3325
02:25:59,540 --> 02:26:02,540
Well, I guess that's it.

3326
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:03,900
Hey, hey, you wanna leave voicemails?

3327
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:06,500
That was epic, that was great.

3328
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:09,500
Them snakes, yes, star, them's tapes, good job.

3329
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:11,180
Hey, leave your epic voicemail

3330
02:26:11,180 --> 02:26:14,300
at the Speak Pipe link down in the description.

3331
02:26:14,300 --> 02:26:17,140
Do it up, we're waiting for them.

3332
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:17,980
What else is going on?

3333
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:21,420
We got Patreon people, patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

3334
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:23,620
Support this show for a couple of dollar

3335
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:25,900
reduced on there per episode.

3336
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:28,940
$5 and you get the bonus episodes.

3337
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:31,100
The new one is already out.

3338
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:33,180
Talk about comics and whatnot, good time.

3339
02:26:33,180 --> 02:26:36,180
And there's like 34, 35, something like that.

3340
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:39,940
What a deal, incredible, you're welcome.

3341
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:42,940
Updates for all things that are happening on Twitter

3342
02:26:42,940 --> 02:26:46,220
at TPCrastinators on Twitter.

3343
02:26:46,220 --> 02:26:48,500
I would again, highly recommend you follow that

3344
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:50,020
because when we make a new channel

3345
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:51,260
or get our channel back,

3346
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:53,100
that's gonna be the place to keep our SP out.

3347
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:54,980
That's where we'll announce whatever it is.

3348
02:26:55,540 --> 02:26:57,060
I mean, you can follow me at Best Discover.

3349
02:26:57,060 --> 02:26:59,900
I'm also discussing these things, Ben at BenSaint

3350
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:01,580

Follow me on Twitter at patreon.com slash BenSaint.

3352
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:09,220
Any of us, we're letting people know as fast as we can.

3353
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:12,380
And of course, the RadCon Kickstarter

3354
02:27:12,380 --> 02:27:13,540
is going on right now.

3355
02:27:13,540 --> 02:27:16,900
And when you hear this, you'll have just a couple more days.

3356
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:18,660
It's like, wait, wait, hold on.

3357
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:19,860
Five days from now.

3358
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:24,660
If the day that it ends will be like one, two, three,

3359
02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:27,900
four, five, it'll be the Tuesday

3360
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:31,060
or it'll like the Monday or like Monday or Tuesday.

3361
02:27:31,060 --> 02:27:32,100
Yeah.

3362
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:35,540
Yeah, after, so like this weekend is it.

3363
02:27:35,540 --> 02:27:36,740
That's right, this weekend.

3364
02:27:36,740 --> 02:27:37,580
That's it.

3365
02:27:37,580 --> 02:27:39,380
The 18th, I mean like the 17th, the 18th.

3366
02:27:39,380 --> 02:27:41,540
I think it's gonna end like the morning of the 18th

3367
02:27:41,540 --> 02:27:43,940
because it like went live on like the morning of the 18th,

3368
02:27:43,940 --> 02:27:45,860
like 31 days before or whatever, so.

3369
02:27:45,860 --> 02:27:47,740
Well, so really the 17th is the last full day.

3370
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:49,260
I think Monday night.

3371
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:50,100
Yeah, pretty much.

3372
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:51,380
Whatever, the point this weekend is it.

3373
02:27:51,380 --> 02:27:52,820
That's your last fucking chance.

3374
02:27:52,820 --> 02:27:54,820
Yep, so hey, we got tons of good stuff on there.

3375
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:58,420
And now that all our fucking tiers have been fulfilled

3376
02:27:58,420 --> 02:28:02,900
except for Digi's, Light Novel's still going for those.

3377
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:06,180
We are close to the Brad lecture.

3378
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:08,900
And then after that, we've got the Digi's.

3379
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:12,780
The higher chapters are still waiting.

3380
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:15,620
Yeah, of Road to RadCon 4.

3381
02:28:15,620 --> 02:28:16,980
That's the one.

3382
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:19,380
Should we make a new one like an intermediary

3383
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:21,180
like for like 75?

3384
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:23,060
I see no reason why not.

3385
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:23,900
Fuck it, let's do it.

3386
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:25,700
Maybe we should think about that.

3387
02:28:25,700 --> 02:28:26,540
Yeah, let's think about it.

3388
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:27,860
Okay, well, let's think about it.

3389
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:32,100
We might even add more stretch goals, don't know.

3390
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:32,940
Check it out.

3391
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:35,260
But right now, we've got 224 backers,

3392
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:40,260
eighties to go, 176% funded, 14,659.

3393
02:28:40,740 --> 02:28:43,100
That's like, I think it's like $100 from when we started.

3394
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:46,140
So we're just like 300 and change away

3395
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:48,580
from the Brad Garlinghouse lecture,

3396
02:28:48,580 --> 02:28:50,260
but there's more stuff beyond it.

3397
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:51,980
So check back when you see this.

3398
02:28:51,980 --> 02:28:53,620
There may be updates added to it.

3399
02:28:53,620 --> 02:28:55,860
So how exciting for all of us.

3400
02:28:55,860 --> 02:28:57,180
RadCon's coming up no matter what.

3401
02:28:57,180 --> 02:28:59,380
None's gonna stop RadCon, baby.

3402
02:28:59,380 --> 02:29:01,740
So hey, if you wanna donate, you got, let's see.

3403
02:29:01,740 --> 02:29:04,740
T-shirts, pins, you got the calendar.

3404
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:08,060
If you pledge $100, you'll be in the fucking PTA,

3405
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:10,100
making decisions, participating in live streams,

3406
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:11,620
part of the Discord, et cetera.

3407
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:13,980
If you go to that $200 tier, oh my God,

3408
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:16,580
you get the fucking to be part of the art,

3409
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:19,580
part of the cast members of the RadCon art.

3410
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:22,060
On the posters, that will be sent out to everybody.

3411
02:29:22,060 --> 02:29:23,940
You'll be immortalized for all time.

3412
02:29:23,940 --> 02:29:27,180
If you wanna be a mad lad, you can be in the Royal Rumble.

3413
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:29,780
Like two people already have been.

3414
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:31,260
So hey, consider it.

3415
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:33,980
I should say, there's the dark,

3416
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:35,500
have we talked about the dark champion?

3417
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:38,540
How like the $200 patrons,

3418
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:42,100
they will collectively build a Royal Rumble.

3419
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:42,940
That's right.

3420
02:29:42,940 --> 02:29:44,660
Attendee, do we have, I don't know.

3421
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:47,420
There's like a whole bunch of like weird shit in the reward.

3422
02:29:47,420 --> 02:29:48,740
Yeah, read through, read through.

3423
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:50,460
It's good stuff, it's good stuff.

3424
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:52,100
That's a good one, yeah, we didn't talk about it.

3425
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:53,420
But like the $1,000 guys,

3426
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:55,780
they get their own individual champion.

3427
02:29:55,780 --> 02:29:56,620
But at the end.

3428
02:29:56,620 --> 02:29:58,060
Yeah, that represents them all collectively.

3429
02:29:58,060 --> 02:30:02,180
They're attempt to subvert the caucus with Shadow Inc.

3430
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:05,060
Shadow the Hedgehog Inc.

3431
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:07,500
My favorite guy.

3432
02:30:07,660 --> 02:30:09,420
All right, well, that's it for the episode everybody.

3433
02:30:09,420 --> 02:30:10,620
We'll be back again next week.

3434
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:12,900
I will be back from vacation

3435
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:17,580
and we'll do this whole nightmare all over again.

3436
02:30:17,580 --> 02:30:19,340
See you there everybody.

3437
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:21,180
Bye.

3438
02:30:21,180 --> 02:30:23,180

02:30:23,180 --> 02:30:24,900

3440
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:26,940
