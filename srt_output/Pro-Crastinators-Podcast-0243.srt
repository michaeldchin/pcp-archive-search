00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am your

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:20,240
host Tom Oliver, so far alone, sitting here 15 minutes, 20 minutes after the podcast is

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,640
supposed to start recording and no one has shown up. So, you know, I had some time and

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,320
I went out, I got a snack, I got a drink, I got, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm refreshed

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,280
and rehydrated and ready for battle and nobody, nobody seems to be here. I added everyone

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,240
and I just figured, you know what, the show must go on quite literally, even if no one

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,560
else is here. So, here we go. Solo Tomcast for the beginning of the podcast. I'm assuming

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,800
and I'm hoping that somebody will join me at some point during these proceedings, but

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,920
if not, this may be a short podcast because I'm not interesting enough to talk for two

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:10,520
hours about my life. That would be sad. We're approaching the new year. That's fucking fantastic.

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,040
2020, glad to leave it fucking behind, be gone with it, banish it to the shadow realm

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:23,840
for all time. 2021 gearing up to be interesting. I just saw on Twitter yesterday that there's

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,000
like a new strain. There's like a new hyperpowered like Super Saiyan strain of COVID-19 that

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,720
people are already kind of freaking out about because it's like going crazy in the UK. Too

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,920
bad it wasn't here. I could maybe poke a brain about it, but I guess Japan just closed down

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,080
all travel again to prevent it from fucking them up because I guess they got a case. There's

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,240
been some cases in Russia. One of the CEOs for the vaccine said that it'll like their

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,040
vaccine will work on this new strain. So maybe it'll be a nothing burger, but you know, you

19
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:05,080
know, 2021 gearing up to be to be a whole big fun thing. What have I been up to? What

20
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,280
have I been doing for the last month and change? They haven't really been on the podcast.

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,720
I've been playing a ton of video games. I talked about that briefly last week. I've

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,760
been working my VPN to the core, downloading a bunch of high definition movies and stuff.

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,040
In fact, my 4k rip of Godzilla, King of the Monsters just finished. So I'm going to stop

24
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,800
seeding that because I'm a bad torrentor. I bought it legally on Blu-ray. So as far

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:40,920
as I'm concerned, this is totally above the belt. So fuck you copyright law. I don't care.

26
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,720
Maybe I shouldn't admit that on the podcast, but whatever. Ben can talk about shoplifting

27
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:53,160
and be fine. I can piss off the MPAA or whoever the fuck is in charge of movies and shit. It's

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,480
fine. Started using Plex. Has anybody here used Plex? I had heard about Plex for like years,

29
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,080
but never bothered with it. I've just manually been managing my media on like multiple hard drives

30
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,120
and it's really annoying. And I tried using Plex I think like five years ago because I had an

31
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,960
account when I signed up for it a few days ago, but it's the fucking shit. And anybody who has

32
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,920
like a big media library that isn't just like if anyone is like me and hasn't completely succumbed

33
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,320
to streaming services and that convenience and still like tries to keep like digital files of

34
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,280
their media that they have complete autonomous offline control of and that's something you care

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,080
about, but you still kind of are tempted by the allure and the simplicity and the streamlined

36
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,560
clean aesthetic of something like Netflix. Plex is your answer, my friends. Okay. So it like

37
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,360
you run a client on your host PC, right? There's a Plex media server client and you run that and

38
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,680
then you hope you like point it at all of your media. You can like choose movies, TV shows,

39
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,200
music, all that kind of stuff. And it has like a bunch of databases it taps into and it's pretty

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,880
good at matching like jumbled bullshit, like internet downloaded names to the actual show

41
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,000
or movie or whatever that it is, populating all the metadata, bringing up like, you know, like,

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,080
like images and graphics and descriptions and episode titles and all that kind of stuff. And

43
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,080
it automatically populates your downloaded local stored media with all this really good

44
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,800
presentation. It has a really clean UI and this is like built into smart TVs. You can get it on

45
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,440
like it Amazon fire stick and all that kind of bullshit. And so you basically just have access

46
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,920
to all of your media that you have locally, freeware. So I'm just like keeping my desktop on

47
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,200
it's hosting all my media and anything with a web browser, I can go and log into like the user end

48
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,360
of Plex and just have access to all of this. And I guess there's a way to configure it so you can

49
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,640
even access it remotely over the internet. So if I'm like out of the house, and I'm like on my phone

50
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,600
and I'm bored and for some reason I want to watch an episode of Garo, I guess I can do that now.

51
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,400
So that's pretty fucking cool. There's a way to like manually override the automatic metadata

52
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,080
matching because some of the times it doesn't like pick up exactly what it is, especially when

53
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,080
you're like me, and your your library is full of like, you know, Garo gold storm and common

54
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,480
writer Kabuto and ultra seven X and shit, like weird Japanese Tokusatsu things, where like a lot

55
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,200
of these databases think that like, oh, common writer, that's one series with like 700 seasons

56
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,520
when each one is like its own distinct show. So it kind of has some trouble with that so you can

57
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,920
manually go in and like set some things up if you need to. But for the most part, for most like

58
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,160
normie core shit, like even anime, I haven't had any problem with any of my anime stuff, it's matched

59
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,320
all that up almost perfectly with the exception of Babylon, I thought it was some 2014 live action

60
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:52,440
show. But other than that, it's been pretty fucking good. And I don't I don't have much to

61
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,240
complain about the only thing I have to complain about is I've been starting to get into 4k,

62
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,400
right? Because I just talked about how I was got my 4k kick the monster, but I don't think it streams

63
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,280
any higher than 1080p on the free plan. Or if it does, I haven't been able to figure it out,

64
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,000
because it seems to be downscaling my four by couple 4k rips I have to 1080p, which still look

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,200
fine. But it's like, man, they're taking up 30 gigs of space. I want I want every last little pixel.

66
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,800
But what are you going to do? What are you going to do for free? I can't complain too much,

67
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,440
much, much better media experience than just sifting through hard drives and having to like

68
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,440
get a laptop and plug the hard drive in and bring it up and hook it up via HDMI to a TV.

69
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,240
Fuck that shit. Just load the Plex app and stream it. That's way better. So I highly recommend Plex,

70
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,840
if you haven't tried it out, if you're a media hoarder like I am, if you're like, you know,

71
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,160
a fucking hardcore doomer, and you're torrenting and line wiring before it was cool.

72
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,920
It's this is what you've been waiting for. This is a solution to get shit on all the screens

73
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,640
without having to like juggle cables and shit, because nothing is more annoying than having

74
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,080
to deal with motherfucking cables. Let me tell you. That's the end of my Plex story.

75
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,520
Let's see. Did I talk about Remnant last week? I don't think I did. I'm playing this game called

76
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:24,840
Remnant from the ashes. It's a I get tentatively call it a souls light game, but I feel that's

77
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,080
kind of dish and genious. I think it's an indie title or it's made by a smaller studio. It's not

78
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:38,520
like a triple A thing or anything, but it's like a randomly generated dungeon kind of crawler game

79
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:46,440
shooter souls light all kind of mixed into one. So you're like playing through these randomly

80
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,080
generated levels and depending on like the world seed, like the seed of like how it makes the

81
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,760
levels, like there are a bunch of bosses and some of them you won't even find on like a single

82
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,200
playthrough. So you have to play through it multiple times to experience everything. And

83
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,880
it's a shooting game. So instead of like fighting with swords and shit and armor sets like in like

84
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,200
souls, you're using guns. You have a melee weapon, but it's usually kind of like a last resort sort

85
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,280
of thing, but like you have a long gun and a sidearm. And so you can customize these and level

86
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,120
them up and they have like their version of tight night with just different kinds of iron.

87
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,120
And so you collect these iron resources and you can make your guns better and add different

88
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,200
like attachments and enchantments to them. And just like souls, every time you kill a boss,

89
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,200
you get like a unique item from them that you can go back and craft into a weapon if you have

90
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,320
enough materials. So like in that regard, it's pretty similar because you also have the same

91
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,880
kind of world progression. It has like an estus flask. And then like you have checkpoints throughout

92
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,040
these levels. And when you die, you go back to the checkpoint. From what I can tell, there's no

93
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,880
like souls that to lose if you die, because like you pick up scrap, which is your currency,

94
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,320
because you're doing a lot of like crafting or going back to like the girl who like crafts

95
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,240
your items, like you give her resources and she can craft you stuff and you can go to the armor,

96
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,360
like the Smithy and he'll upgrade your armor and things like that. So it kind of has like the,

97
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,080
I don't want to say it has a loot system like Diablo, because it doesn't it's much more reserved,

98
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,840
like like Dark Souls, you know, like where there's not like there's not like a hardcore loot game,

99
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,800
but there is like an item progression, you pick up items kind of as you go.

100
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm not I'm of the two minds of the game, I guess this the shooting is really good,

101
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,240
which is what's kind of keeping me there, like firing like the hunting rifle

102
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,120
feels really good, like the gunplay feels great. And the controls are really nice. I'm playing on

103
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,160
controller, even though I have it on PC, just because like it's a super casual game. At least

104
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm playing it casually, because you can play it offline by yourself. And that's where it kind of

105
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,080
feels more like a Souls game, because there's like a bunch of dudes against you. And they're

106
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,320
a fair bit more brain dead than then Souls enemies. And like, obviously, the back and

107
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,320
forth is different, because you're firing at range, and most enemies have range attacks too,

108
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,680
whereas in Souls, it's much more up close and melee and based more on positioning.

109
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:09,160
So this is like different in that regard, but the kind of like tepid like forward momentum,

110
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,600
where guys can like easily like kind of get the jump on you. So you can't just kind of like barrel

111
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,960
through the level, like a crazy man, you got to take it a little bit more calmly, that kind of

112
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,640
like moment to moment kind of like slow, paying attention to the environment kind of gameplay

113
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,080
is there, but it's not nearly as good, because all these environments are randomly generated.

114
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,760
So like the careful handcrafted attention to, you know, Lordran that Dark Souls has, it isn't

115
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,440
replicated here, because there's so many repeating tiles and stuff, which kind of makes a level

116
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,360
navigation kind of difficult. There's definitely not enough tiles in any of these environments,

117
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,200
because with multiple environments, you kind of like go through this like threadbare story

118
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,120
that I barely am paying attention to. And you'll see a lot of repeated tiles through your playthroughs,

119
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,840
like you a lot of the time I will start and end in the same, like the exact same room. So it feels

120
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,360
like I went in a circle when I actually did go through the entire level, you'll be referencing

121
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,680
your map a lot to make sure you're not going in circles, because there's so many repeated tiles,

122
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,560
which is pretty fucking annoying. But even to someone like me who doesn't usually pay attention

123
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,000
to level design or give a shit at all, I noticed a lot of this repeating shit. So that way, you

124
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,600
know, it's like kind of egregious. But they serve as like shooting galleries well enough. And

125
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,280
yeah, like you can play it solo, which getting back to what I was saying, you can play it solo,

126
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,640
that's kind of like the Dark Souls sort of thing, where you have that kind of like slow

127
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,800
forward momentum. But then you can also play it co-op, which I haven't done yet, you can play

128
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,960
up to three other people. And I'm assuming once you do that, like it scales up, like it adds more

129
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,080
enemies and stuff like that. But like these levels, unless they get bigger, they're definitely not

130
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:48,200
designed, I don't think, to really facilitate that like tense souls forward progression with

131
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,800
four people, I'm assuming at that point, it'll become much more of just like an open season

132
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,760
shooting gallery, because you'll just have so many, so many extra like firearms and like,

133
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,080
like options on your side that you'll just kind of turn the tides pretty easily. So I just feel

134
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,120
like it will become much more frantic if you're playing with friends and feel like a different

135
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,520
game, which is why I haven't decided to play multiplayer, because I kind of like the the

136
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,320
one person versus everybody more tense kind of atmosphere that the single player is providing.

137
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,960
So that's interesting. I got to the last level. The final boss is ridiculous, has like multiple

138
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,000
phases like a Dark Souls boss. The boss designs are pretty cheap, because again, all this feels more

139
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,560
like a co-op game that I'm playing single player rather than a single player game that can play

140
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,440
multiplayer. So like bosses will spawn tons of ads, they feel like the worst Dark Souls two bosses

141
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,000
at sometimes where it's just like, let's just throw more shit at you. Like one of the most

142
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,080
difficult and annoying, not even difficult, but just annoying bosses, like, you know, the butterfly

143
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,400
boss of Dark Souls one, they basically ape that boss fight, except you're still on a narrow bridge,

144
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,720
there's the butterfly that's like floating in the air, but there's two of them, there's one on each

145
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,440
side. And they're spawning like these like homing projectiles that have HP do tons of damage, you

146
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,240
can't dodge roll through them. So they're firing those firing missiles, like throwing down AoE poison

147
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,840
effects, and there's two of them. So you can never see the way the level is designed, you can never

148
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,160
see them both at the same time on the screen, you have to be facing either one or the other.

149
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,440
And this is where it feels like this is a multiplayer boss, right? Because if you have two

150
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,800
or three people on this bridge, you can kind of like, you know, have one person doing DPS on one,

151
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,480
one person doing DPS on another, and they have a third or four person kind of taking care of

152
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,200
like the homing projectiles and keeping you clear and doing like some secondary DPS in between

153
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:39,320
bursts. But when just one person, it's ridiculous. So the boss designs and the boss encounters

154
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,840
definitely seem like balanced more for having multiple people in the fray, because if you die

155
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,560
in multiplayer, someone could come and revive you. Whereas if you die single player, you get kicked

156
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,200
back to the bonfire or like the fucking, I don't know, some weird, they use a weird fucking like

157
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,880
red stones that are basically function as bonfires. They have the exact same thing.

158
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,720
It's good. It's not great. It's not great. It's good. It's fun. It's worth playing through it.

159
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,400
Like it survives really on just like the catharsis of the gunplay alone. Like if the gunplay didn't

160
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:18,040
feel so good, there really wouldn't be anything else super redeeming about the game. But that

161
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,640
carries it, at least for me, who just like plays games to like feel cool cathartic things like firing

162
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,000
a rifle and a magnum and like the black as the headshot goes off. That's pretty fun. And that's

163
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,600
all that's all I need to be happy when it comes to video games. So remnant from the ashes, I guess

164
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,040
there's a sequel coming out soon, I think, if it's not already out. This games, I think a couple years

165
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,920
old, but it's pretty fucking cool. I watch a skill up video on it. And that's what made me check it out.

166
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,080
And that was pretty dope. I was thinking of doing some more I am games podcasts or like like like

167
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,320
vlogs sort of style videos kind of similar to what I just did for remnant. Maybe I'll like cut this

168
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,720
out and put it on I am games because that was I was literally planning after this podcast to record

169
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,040
a bunch of stuff on some games I've played. I played Jedi Fallen Order, Ghost of Tsushima, Remnant, Halo

170
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,600
4. And what was the other one was another game I played recently. Dragon Age Origins, which don't

171
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,560
play Dragon Age Origins on PC. It keeps constantly crashing it deleted my save file. It does not run

172
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,920
on modern hardware very well. It is not a great PC port. Despite the name on Steam, it is not the

173
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:33,720
ultimate edition. Yeah, we'll see about that. God, no one is joined. No one is no one's here.

174
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,320
Gib says I'm about to eat dinner. I'll jump in later at some point or or not IDK sick,

175
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:49,160
all right. Well, damn, I'm floundering. I'm floundering. I thought I was I was fucking sure

176
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,560
that I was going to add somebody jump in and like immediately, Ben was going to be like I'm not

177
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,560
missing out on my Patreon money and was going to jump in and like be here and we'd have be having

178
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:04,760
a discussion right now. But no, no such no such luck. It's just it's 15 minutes and I'm running

179
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:13,960
out of steam already. Let's see what else what else can we talk about? Oh, I mentioned on Twitter

180
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:20,440
a couple days ago, like two days ago, yesterday. Oh my God, I don't even remember a couple days ago

181
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,360
that I was like really like reminiscing fondly on like the DS and like its graphical style. The

182
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,960
DS is like such a cool aesthetic. I was trying to like kind of figure out what I like so much about

183
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,800
the DS. I mean, I've always like really like the PS one blocky like non texture filtered graphics.

184
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,880
But the problem with the PS one, in my opinion, aesthetically is that it's almost too simplistic

185
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,560
at sometimes like a lot of games really work well on the PS one, like the cartoony style games,

186
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,120
like you look at medieval, you look at Spyro, you look at Crash, like those are such like

187
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,880
cartoony style characters that even on the PS one, they have tons of emotion and tons of expressiveness

188
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:09,720
to them. And they just look really good. But you look like Metal Gear Solid one. On the whole,

189
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,120
the game looks awesome, right? Shadow Moses is a gorgeous looking environment. They did so much

190
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,000
with the PS one, but like the character models themselves kind of break down when solid snakes

191
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,880
faces like seven pixels, you know, that has no room for emoting. Like, I appreciate it aesthetically,

192
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,360
but in terms like something I would want to reproduce in my work, the PS one has always

193
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:38,520
felt a little too limiting as someone who'd want to do not necessarily just games, but like if I

194
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,880
wanted to make like a multimedia project, you know, like, I think like the biggest barrier to

195
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,320
getting into Metal Gear Solid one for like a zoomer would be taking the cut scene seriously,

196
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,680
because solid snake has seven pixels and when he talks his head just kind of shakes like he's

197
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,240
having a seizure. And like, if you're an old fuck like me, like that, you're totally immersed in

198
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,920
that because that's just what games were at the time. But I feel like anybody experiencing that

199
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,720
kind of thing now with the PS five existing would be like, what is this? How am I supposed to take

200
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,560
this seriously? So I've been hesitant to work in that style some because I feel like

201
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,280
like I would love to make a game in the PS one aesthetic like something you just play,

202
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,400
but in terms of like a more multimedia narrative driven experience, which is stuff I do as well.

203
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,240
PS one seems like would be almost antithetical to the emotions you're trying to invoke would hit

204
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,000
that nostalgia nerve. But like, I feel like anybody who was disconnected from playing games back in

205
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,920
the late 90s, mid 90s, would not kind of resonate with whatever kind of emotion was trying to be

206
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,600
conveyed. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but that's just kind of been my kind of hesitance. Also,

207
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,280
I do when it's hard to envision a complete PS model, while you're working on it, right? Because

208
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,560
when you're building a model, initially, you're doing the modeling. So there's no textures and

209
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,720
on that sheet, you're just seeing the geometry. And when you're working as low resolution as a PS

210
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,600
one is, you have to kind of imagine the detail because the majority of the detail all comes out

211
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:09,240
in the texture work. So a lot of the times I like put too much detail into the modeling part,

212
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,320
because I'm not envisioning it with a texture, I'm just envisioning it as a shape and the shape

213
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,000
needs more detail in order to be defined. And then by the time I get to texturing, I'm like,

214
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,680
this is way higher poly count than a PS one model would be anyways. So it's a it's a balancing act,

215
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,880
it's like juggling and like really optimizing. And like, if I was going to do this style,

216
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,160
effectively, I would probably do more studying and like ripping more models from like VG resource

217
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,120
and like seeing how they put them all together and how they work. But the nice thing about the DS

218
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:44,040
is that it has that texture filtered, like that non texture filtered look that the PS one has,

219
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:50,360
but the poly counts are just a little bit higher. They're closer to like, you know,

220
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,600
something like an N64 or like really low level Dreamcast that sometimes they're kind of like

221
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,920
in this middle ground somewhere, like the DS, I feel to my eye, and I haven't like fattened,

222
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,480
you know, looked up anything, but I feel like it's got a little bit more is able to push a

223
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,120
few more polys than the PlayStation is. Or it's just because it's so much later,

224
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,280
uh, time wise, like it came out like over a decade later than the PlayStation, like in that time,

225
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,160
artists just got better at like doing 3D. So like they've just able to use those same polygons

226
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,920
more effectively. I don't really know. I just find the 3D on the DS to be more detailed and

227
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,480
more representative of the objects in question than what the PlayStation could produce. And

228
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,800
that combined with the really low resolution screen, it's like half the resolution of the

229
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:42,680
PlayStation. The PlayStation is QVGA 320 by 240. And then the DS is like 160 by 144, I think,

230
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,560
something like that, something low, something low, like actually 160 by 144 is Game Boy Color.

231
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,040
It's a little bit higher than that. It's like 240 by 160. It doesn't matter. It's lower than the

232
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,320
PlayStation. So that lower pixel count actually kind of helps further obscure the lack of detail

233
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:03,560
in the PlayStation and like the DS's models. So like the low fidelity of the models combined

234
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,160
with the low resolution of the display kind of like tricks your eye into thinking there's more

235
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,840
detail there than there actually is and carries the art style even further. It's really fucking

236
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,600
interesting looking back at like DS stuff. And I'm thinking like Final Fantasy III,

237
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:25,400
Dragon Quest Monsters Joker. There was a Dragon Ball game that looked really good. Of course,

238
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,480
the one I mentioned on Twitter was Final Fantasy Fables Chocobo Tales. Like a lot of these games

239
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,640
that like used cartoonish, anime inspired aesthetic combined with this low resolution display,

240
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,600
these low resolution textures and these very low polygon models all coalesced into this really

241
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,840
evocative and like kind of semi nostalgic art style that also felt like this is kind of more

242
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,440
like how I remember it than what it actually is because you go back and play like Siphon

243
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,080
Filter 1, you're like, oh my god, this is a fucking technical mess. You know, there's just like,

244
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,440
there's a lot of just jank that the PlayStation one had to deal with like the

245
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,840
the way the texture is kind of a blur and distort because they're kind of being projected to the

246
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,400
camera and things like that. Like that looks weird, but the DS doesn't do that. So it kind of like

247
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,280
presents the PS1 as you remember it being more so than what it actually was, which was like a series

248
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,640
of technical concessions. So I don't know, coming back to the DS and like playing Final Fantasy

249
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,880
Fables again a little bit was like, oh, this is like really cool. This is like really fucking cool.

250
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,640
And I would love to work in the style. And I kind of just tweeted that out saying like, oh man,

251
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,480
this stuff was great. So maybe I'm making a zoomy game in the style of a DS. That would be weird.

252
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,640
That would take a lot of extra work that I would not know how to do. So I still don't know anything

253
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,920
about 3d game dev. But I found this really cool guy sickly wizard who does a bunch of tutorials

254
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,600
and blender on how to do like PS1 kind of stuff. And a lot of the stuff I've watched so far is pretty

255
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,360
basic. It's just like this is how you unwrap a model. It's like I've been there done that.

256
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,760
His stuff's really designed for like total beginners. But like if you're interested in 3d,

257
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,240
and you're like, man, I have no idea where to start this shit's really fucking complicated. PS1

258
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,800
is so easy. It's I mean, I don't want to say 3d is easy, right? But like in terms of like levels

259
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:15,000
of complexity, you take like sculpting a high poly model and baking normals down to like a mid

260
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:22,600
poly geometry and like retopology versus just like PS1 where it's like the arm is a square.

261
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,280
Like it's the barrier of entry there is so much lower. So if you were ever like interested in

262
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,760
3d and wanted a place to start, check out sickly wizard, follow along with some of his videos.

263
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,600
Like you'll have PlayStation one graphics by the end in like an hour and you'll be like,

264
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:41,400
well, like there it is, it's real, it's done and it looks cool. And I don't know the I guess it's

265
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,560
like watching his streams like the efficiency, right? Because like doing a PlayStation 2 style

266
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,520
model is significantly more work requires much more finesse in the weight painting. You can't

267
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,800
get away on the PS2 style with like segmented limbs and stuff which makes again rigging a lot

268
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,160
easier to make them like animate and deform easier when you have segmented limbs, you don't have to

269
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,600
worry about like how am I going to get the shoulder deformation right because there is no

270
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,720
shoulder the arm just moves in a socket essentially. So like I'm just thinking of it in terms of like

271
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,160
aesthetically, I really like the DS and then practically making props and characters and

272
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,040
like tons of like game assets at this resolution is way simpler because I was looking at the wiki

273
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:26,920
for Chocobo Tales. They made that entire game with 2006 tech, which is not a lot compared to what we

274
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,480
have now at least they made that with 20 people in like a year. And it's like that was that's a

275
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,880
way more complicated game that anything I would make for Izumi. So like scaling that down to like

276
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,920
one or two people, you could probably turn around a decent game in a similar maybe a little bit

277
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,520
longer timeframe. Like if I was going to do like a basic 3d Izumi game that just had some basic

278
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,800
systems of just me and like someone doing sound. Maybe I could turn it around like 18 months like

279
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,920
I don't fucking know. It's just another idea. It's another it's another idea to think about

280
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:03,960
because I don't have enough ideas. God fucking damn. But that's that's cool. That's that's nice.

281
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,680
Now we're at 25 minutes. And now I'm like really tapped. What else do I got going on?

282
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,960
Okay, let's see. This was this was a bad call. This was a bad call. I rolled the dice thinking I

283
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,960
was just going to have like a cheeky little intro. And it did not work. What else have I been doing?

284
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:33,640
Oh, fuck Vizio. Okay, so another thing I mentioned, this is going to be my Twitter

285
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:40,360
escapades, I guess. Twitter, I mentioned a few weeks ago, I ran a poll saying should I buy an

286
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,240
HDTV, like a big 4k TV with my my cashback, my credit card cashback awards and everyone

287
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,760
overwhelmed me said no, fuck you, I did it anyways. My cashback on my credit card is not

288
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,960
actually cashback. It's like here's some gift cards. And I'm like, that's

289
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,760
literally not cash. In fact, on the back of a gift card, it says this is not redeemable for cash.

290
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,040
So saying this is a cashback rewards card is like straight up lies. And I feel like I have

291
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,480
legal grounds. But I probably don't because I probably said yes to something in some terms

292
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,000
of conditions that the cashback rewards card from Santander Bank is not actually cashback

293
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,440
rewards. We lied. It just sounds nice. So I had a bunch of gift cards, and I had nothing to do with

294
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:25,320
them. The GTX, the RTX 3070 is not in stock, you know, and I already got my overpriced 3060 Ti.

295
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,280
PS4 and Xboxes are never going to be in stock. And I don't want to buy one until the new ones come

296
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,920
out with at least like, you know, a terabyte or two terabytes of storage, because like the PlayStation

297
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:40,520
5 having 600 gigs of storage is a non starter for me, my dude. My PS4 came with more storage,

298
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,000
and these games are way bigger, especially with a backwards compatible library. So that's skew,

299
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,680
in my opinion, is out of the question. I want two terabytes of flash storage, or at least some

300
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,640
fucking like SSDs on the market to up the storage, because right now you can't even officially upgrade

301
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,720
your storage on your PS5 because they haven't rolled out the firmware update. So I don't want to buy

302
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,320
that. I want it in matte black, fuck you. The white and black looks terrible. And ideally,

303
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,400
I'd like it to be smaller. Like I have the PS4 slim, it's so much nicer than the base PS4,

304
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,000
like the original. So if they do like a PS5 slim, that's where I'm going to jump in.

305
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,160
Because I don't care about Demon's Souls enough to drop a million dollars. So like,

306
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,040
what else am I going to get at fucking Best Buy? If the consoles aren't on the table right now,

307
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,680
the cashback expires eventually. And I already have the graphics card. Well, I have a shitty TV

308
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,480
that's like from 10 years ago, it has terrible pixel refresh rate, it goes all the time. So

309
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,760
whenever you play a PlayStation game on it, it's all blurry, not in a good way. So I'm like, well,

310
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:45,640
here, let's just do this. So I'm like, fuck it. I order like a mid tier, big ass 70 inch TV,

311
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,920
which was stupid. But I didn't know what else to do with my cashback. And it's Christmas.

312
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:58,440
And I'm in consumer mode because corporate programming works. So I got this big ass TV.

313
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,840
And it's pretty cool. But I immediately have concerns. And my concerns are thus,

314
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:10,920
I did a ton of research getting this TV and I got the Vizio M Q7 series, which is like

315
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,760
their middle of the road. Like I don't need 120 FPS, I'm only going to be playing consoles and

316
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,680
watching movies on this, I'm going to play high frame, I'm going to play on PC. So that's not a

317
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:27,240
big deal. It just needs to do 60 4k 60, which it does. And it's big, it's a nice big display,

318
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,320
I got a nice soundbar with it. I've never had like a big TV, I've never had a 4k display,

319
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,880
I've never had a soundbar with really good audio. So this is like, you know, watching like movie

320
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,520
trailers on this, because I'm just like kind of digging through it. Like this is fucking great.

321
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,480
I'm going through all the settings, you know, turning off the fucking like soap,

322
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,880
proper effect garbage and all the preloaded terrible settings I have on these things,

323
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,480
turning all that off, whatever, getting it dialed in, but I'm a nerd. So I go through

324
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,640
all the settings and look at all the little things. And then I realized copyright 2019

325
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,760
Vizio, I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute. This is a 2020 TV. This is the M Q7. This came out

326
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,040
like a couple months ago. This should not have a 2019 copyright on the firmware because it's new,

327
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,840
it came out this year. Like, what does that mean? That's strange. So I decided to start digging.

328
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,880
And this is when I realized I got fucked. Okay, because this TV is not the M Q7,

329
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:24,840
even though it's labeled M Q7. They rebadged their low end entry level 70 inch TV by adding like one

330
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,360
extra like quantum dot feature to the display, and then marketed it as the mid range. So this

331
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,560
is an entry level. It doesn't have any of the stuff that the mid range thing did, which I

332
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,960
actually wanted like really good HDR 10 brightness. It didn't have local dimming zones. It didn't have

333
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,520
it didn't have enough HDMI ports. The panel was not nearly as good quality because it was like

334
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,120
the V series panel at the M series panel. So like it was a lie. It was a fucking lie. It was not

335
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,800
actually the series it was it was saying it was it was like a lower tier garbage TV

336
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,080
that they wanted to sell to like dummies like me buying near Black Friday. So they tricked me.

337
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,280
Those motherfuckers. So I was pissed off about that. So it's sitting next to me right now. I'm

338
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,280
looking at it with disdain, but there's a really good return policy on Best Buy. So I'm swapping

339
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,880
it out with an actual M Q7. It's 65 inches out of a 70 inch, but this is like the actual one

340
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:24,680
with all the good tech that'll have a good picture and all that shit. So I can watch my Plex

341
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:34,120
and fucking god tier HDR can watch Thunderbolt fantasy in the best possible way with like booming

342
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,800
sound and a really good screen with HDR. Actually, I don't know if my torrents have HDR. If not,

343
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:45,640
maybe I'll find something to do. But Thunderbolt fantasy is cool to watch Thunderbolt fantasy.

344
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,680
It's it's like Thunderbirds are go on crack. It's by Urubuchi again. Music by

345
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:56,760
Hiryuki Sawano. Attack on Titan dude. And it's it's like puppets. It's like puppets,

346
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,920
but like the most ridiculous, over designed, like well choreographed puppets you've ever seen.

347
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:13,800
Oh my god. Tom. It's been saying I can't believe I slept until 350 p.m. You fucking idiot.

348
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:21,320
I got really drunk last night at because it was friend's mess. It was friend's mess dinner.

349
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,760
Baby friend. My friend cooked a goose and I ate it.

350
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:37,000
Good morning. Sunday morning. Yeah, it's definitely morning. Good afternoon. Sunday afternoon.

351
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
What I want to give you shit, but I didn't I didn't drink anything and I still woke up at

352
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,320
like 2 30. So I don't know. I can't I can't throw any shade because you're still doing

353
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,560
better than me. All things considered. Oh, how long you been going? A little over half an hour.

354
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:59,400
Okay. All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. What's what's up? What's on the docket?

355
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,480
What's on the what you what you been? What's what are you? What's going on, buddy? Not much.

356
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,200
I've just been talking about bullshit like video games and TV because that's that's all

357
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:19,080
my life's been for the last month. The worst the worst things. Yeah, just being a good old consumer.

358
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:28,600
How was your how was your holiday? Dumb. Nice. Yeah, it was pretty nice holidays around here

359
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,040
and never anything to pay attention to. So I forgot it even happened until you mentioned it.

360
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:44,600
I see. I did a I did a I hung out with my parents and my parents house and it was literally just me

361
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,520
and my mom and dad hanging out at their house for like two days.

362
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,040
It was fine. It wasn't it. It was it was okay. It was all right. Me and my dad got really drunk

363
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:02,680
also. I see a pattern for you. True. True.

364
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:12,920
Did you get your dad twisted? I guess I guess so. Yeah. Excellent. We watched we watched flushed away.

365
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,680
Which was which was really good actually believe it or not. I thought it was really good. Yeah.

366
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,600
That's my mom. My mom didn't like it. She thought the characters were ugly.

367
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:30,760
Oh, well, that's unfortunate. And then and then and then we and then we tried to watch

368
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,200
Escape from New York, but I think we got too drunk and we stopped in the middle.

369
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,120
I haven't seen that. I haven't I have tried to watch it once before

370
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,800
and and I didn't make it all the way through that time either. I don't know why.

371
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,960
Well, I was talking earlier about how I'm doing nothing but like abusing my VPN and stealing movies.

372
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,520
So I'm going to get escaped. Oh, good. I mean in a video game, this isn't happening for real in

373
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:08,200
Minecraft. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god, I'm sweating. I'm having hangover sweats. I think is what's

374
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,560
going on with me. Ben, why do you never learn? Why do you keep doing this to yourself? Is it worth it?

375
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,320
This is life, Tom. Life is about making the same mistakes over and over again.

376
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:31,160
Oh my god. I'm so sweaty. Why? Why? Please help. Did you have water?

377
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,520
No. Oh, you fool. I have an open water bottle here, but it's like it's not drank at all. So I

378
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,800
probably just didn't drink it. What are we going to do with you, Ben?

379
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,120
Oh, refreshing.

380
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You ever had goose? I've never had goose. One of my roommates procured a goose

381
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:06,680
and cooked it. The long story short is it almost tastes like beef. It tastes very beefy.

382
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,000
Really? Yeah, extremely greasy, extremely beefy.

383
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,360
So what he did was he roasted it in the oven, gave it like a Christmas herb rub,

384
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,520
things like cinnamon and allspice and nutmeg and things, and then he let the grease all

385
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:36,200
drip down onto trays of potatoes and cooked the potatoes in the grease. It was so good.

386
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,840
I ate so much. Yes. And then there was a... Fat Ben strikes again.

387
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,160
Oh god, I was going to mention, I was going to bring this up, that Fat Ben is officially back

388
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:56,600
and it's the worst thing. I weighed myself before I got in the car to go to my parents.

389
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,240
It was bad. I have gained back all the weight that I lost doing keto.

390
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:10,040
Oh, all of it. Yeah. Dude, this year's really bad. I started doing keto again like three weeks ago,

391
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,680
like the end of November. And then of course I had to break it for Christmas, which made me angry.

392
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,840
I told her, I'm keto, I'm dieting, I don't want to have anything like here's pumpkin pie

393
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,560
and ice cream and all this shit. I'm like, I hate you, die. So now I'm back on keto again.

394
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,120
And I feel a little bit better than I did in November, but November was the worst. I was

395
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:37,080
eating like shit for like four weeks straight. It was bad. You just feel worse. You feel

396
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:43,640
yourself becoming less human as you gain weight. It's the worst. Agreed. Yeah. Well, it's time for

397
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:52,440
me to get back on it. It's time for me to get serious, quit fucking around. But I have all

398
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:59,000
the leftovers. All the leftovers I have from the holidays are turkey and beef and goose.

399
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,160
And so that's all good. That's all good keto shit right there.

400
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,680
I'm thinking I'm going to combine keto with intermittent fasting to like double you. Yeah,

401
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,960
that's how you do it. You gotta really do it, right? Gotta do those speed heads, you know.

402
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:24,120
You like only eat during like an eight hour window or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. I like tried that a

403
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:29,960
little bit before. I had never got, I never was super serious about it, but they say it works

404
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,680
good. Oh, I just, you should just combine it with regular fasting and not eat for a week.

405
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,440
Yeah. Give it a shot. I was saying on my bonus podcast a couple of weeks back,

406
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,240
I was watching this video on like breatharians. Do you know what that is?

407
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:53,160
Yeah, I saw there was a video. Oh, was there like an H bomber guy video about it or

408
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,920
Sarah Zed or someone I watched the video on it. That's really interesting.

409
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,080
And the only thing I took away from that is that if you don't eat for two weeks,

410
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,440
you lose 40 pounds. I was like, that's a really good time investment ratio as far as I'm concerned.

411
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,520
No, it's all going to come from your, it's all going to come from your muscles and

412
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,480
your vital organs, and then you're going to die. That sounds like a bonus to me.

413
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:26,440
Hey, if you fast for one week, you lose 20 pounds. That's still a good deal in my book.

414
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,600
And if you fast for two weeks, you lose 40 pounds. And if you fast for three weeks,

415
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,960
you lose all the pounds. Right. You lose your life.

416
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:41,480
As you, as you shuffle off this mortal coil, as you end the nightmare of your own corporeal

417
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,680
existence, as you, as you move on, this is like a great ultimate abstract.

418
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:56,600
Exactly. Exactly. So sacrifices have to be made for the greater good. Can't have fat people.

419
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:04,120
No, it's unacceptable. And by fat people, I mean just me. I have no problem with fat people

420
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:09,480
unless the fat person is me, in which case I hate them. I same about you.

421
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Yeah, yeah, I agree. Totally, totally fair.

422
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,560
No, man. Okay, my hangover sweating has, has subsided. I feel a little more normal.

423
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,480
I think I got, I like, I rolled, I rolled out of bed.

424
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,000
I rolled out of bed and I stood up and I sat down at my chair and I think the

425
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,240
action of moving made me a little nauseous. I got, I only got, I would have kept sleeping,

426
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,400
but I, my, my computer is just making a horrible squeaking noise, or it was. I don't hear it.

427
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah. I think the fan was going like,

428
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,800
and I didn't like it. So I, so I got up to click, kick it and make it stop.

429
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,600
It seems to have stopped on its own though. So good, good for it.

430
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,320
My computer is on all the time too. Like one of the fans is loose or something,

431
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,600
and you just have to like beat the shit out of it sometimes. I'm just like, I spent like

432
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,760
$70 on ultra quiet fans and I'm still dealing with this garbage. What a waste.

433
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,840
Every, every once in a while, it'll make a weird noise and then, and then I don't know.

434
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,240
And I think, what am I doing with my life? What's the, what's even the point?

435
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,680
There's no point, Ben. No, it's true. It's true.

436
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,160
Hey man, 2020 is over. By the time this comes out, it's going to be 2021.

437
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Holy shit. You're right. I didn't even think about that.

438
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,840
Pretty fucked up, right? Actually, no, this is coming out on New Year's Eve, or on New Year's rather.

439
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,640
They have the last ones on Christmas.

440
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,080
Amazing. Hit Christmas and New Year's.

441
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,280
Last ones on Christmas. This one's New Year's. Happy New Year, listener. Happy. Welcome to,

442
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:00,200
welcome to the fresh hell that is 2021. What new horrors do they have in store for us?

443
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,840
I was saying earlier, I hope the, the Super Saiyan COVID doesn't come in and like fucking destroy us.

444
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:12,120
Oh, the UK one. Yeah. I was saying about that yesterday. I'm just like, oh no, not again.

445
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,400
I haven't read about it. I have, I've heard a little, heard that there's a new one.

446
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,120
Of course it would come from the Brits. Of course it would come from those fucking bongers.

447
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,280
Give me to get on so we can flog her for being a piece of shit.

448
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,640
Killer. Just fucking murder. Yeah, for sure.

449
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,840
Just dissing.

450
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,360
You have a good old fashioned lynching here on the PC.

451
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,600
Bring in the new year with the sacrificial lynching to kind of appease the COVID.

452
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:49,880
If only. If only. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I didn't, didn't think,

453
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,520
my sleeping, my sleep patterns have been really weird lately when I have,

454
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,440
when I have gone to bed at like a reasonable hour, I wake up like two hours later.

455
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,720
Like when I go to sleep at like midnight, I wake up at like three.

456
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:11,320
And then when I say, okay, well, time to just, time to sleep like during the day,

457
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,880
that doesn't happen. I sleep for like 12 hours. And that's what I did today.

458
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,960
And that's why it's 4pm and I'm, and I'm just up now. It's fucked up.

459
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,440
I wish it would just cooperate. I wish my circadian rhythm would just get on my fucking

460
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,200
level already, but it won't. Never will. Never does. I've never, I've never had a normal sleep

461
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:38,600
cycle. It sounds glorious, but I wouldn't know. Waking up in the middle of the day kills you.

462
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,120
It just feels, it feels like the day is already over. You just want to go back to bed. I'll just

463
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,080
start over tomorrow. Fuck it. It's already getting dark outside. It's already kind of dim.

464
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:54,520
Damn. Why did I even bother getting up? Right?

465
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:06,600
Oh no. You ever just wake, you ever, you ever rise back into consciousness and think, oh god,

466
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:14,920
I'm a, I'm a corporeal entity. Oh god, I'm a conscious being in a, in a universe that I,

467
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:21,880
that exists beyond myself and that I have, have no control over and, and, and I, and I,

468
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,640
and soon I will die. That's, that's just my life. You know, it's just like,

469
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,760
you just wake up, like someday I'm just not going to, someday that's just going to be forever.

470
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,280
That's it. That's it. Yeah. God damn it. Makes you think, really, really gets the noggin' job.

471
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:46,520
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I should just get COVID and die. Maybe it's better. It's better that way.

472
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,040
No, you won't, you won't die. You'll just, you'll just permanently lose your sense of smell and taste.

473
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,320
And, and, dude, think how easy it would be to lose weight at that point if like food no longer

474
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:03,080
had power for you. Dude. Maybe getting COVID is a good thing. Hell yeah. It's like, yeah,

475
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,280
I'll have broccoli. It tastes exactly the same as anything else. I don't give a shit.

476
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:13,960
Perfect weight loss strategy. All right. COVID. We're starting the COVID-19 diet.

477
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,120
It's going to be called, you're going to lose the COVID-19. By getting COVID, you lose 19 pounds.

478
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:29,400
That's, that's the COVID-19. That's why we call it that. Exactly. We cracked the code, finally.

479
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,440
So, were you talking about, were you talking about like models or rigging puppets or something?

480
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:48,280
Some of that bullshit? I was talking about all sorts of things. Talking about games I was playing,

481
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:55,000
movies I was watching, TVs that I hate. All sorts of things. It's been a, it's been all,

482
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:04,840
it's been the best podcast. Best is in quotes. Yeah. I've been working on something,

483
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,480
but I can't say what it is. It's a mystery. You don't even know. I would,

484
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,520
we don't even know viewers. I would like, I would like very much, I would like very much to elaborate

485
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,520
but I won't because I have, I have things I could complain about. I have things I could say

486
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:27,720
about it. I have things, I have things to talk about with regards to it and things I've noticed

487
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,440
during the process, but I won't, I won't get into it. I won't get into it until it's done.

488
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,400
You're just building the intrigue. Building intrigue. That's right. That's right.

489
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:45,560
It's called, it's called hype. It's called marketing. I hope, I hope, well anyway,

490
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:57,960
I won't say any more about it. Lamal. So, Tom, do I hear wedding bells?

491
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:08,360
I don't think so. My uncle, my uncle called my dad while I was home and he's like talking on

492
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,840
the phone. They're talking about like, oh, how you been? Oh, I had, I had sinus surgery. Like,

493
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:18,360
oh, that's terrible. And my dad's like, oh, Ben's here and my uncle's like, oh, hey, Ben,

494
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,320
do I hear wedding bells? I'm like, what are you fucking talking about?

495
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,920
What are you fucking talking about, you weirdo? What is that even mean?

496
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,960
I don't know. I literally think he was merely inquiring, like, when the fuck are you getting

497
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,760
married, Ben? You useless prick. Like, what are you doing? That phrase is usually used after,

498
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,880
like, you've said that you, like, love someone, right? And they're like, like, it's too implied.

499
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,360
You love them so much, you must be getting married soon.

500
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:56,040
And even when my dad asked, like, uh, like, no, like, what do you mean?

501
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,600
It's not like my uncle, like, thought like I had a new girlfriend or something.

502
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,840
He just, he just didn't elaborate on why he asked that question.

503
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:11,320
That's so bizarre. It was very bizarre. It was almost as bizarre as when I did it to you.

504
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,960
Just a minute. Yeah, I'm glad that we were able to first like experience what you're talking

505
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,000
about first hand, you know, help with the immersion. Now you know. I empathize with the

506
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,400
story a lot more now that I've experienced it myself. Exactly. Exactly. Uh, my,

507
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:38,840
Nate, Nate, uh, made fun of me for, because I said we shouldn't do a Thanksgiving get-together

508
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:44,680
because COVID, but I nevertheless went to see my parents for Christmas.

509
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:50,120
But let me defend myself. My, my explanation is that the Thanksgiving thing is everyone

510
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,360
who's going to be traveling across the country, like Nate and Michelle would have been flying

511
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,600
in from Virginia. My, my sister or sister would have been traveling in from Kentucky,

512
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,520
you know, and then I also would have been there. And I think that it's, it's the traveling,

513
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,480
the dangerous part. I thought it was fine for me to go and see them just because like they would

514
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,160
just come to my house, I would just get in the car and it would be, and that would be it in terms of

515
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:20,600
like exposure to the outside world. And I'm extremely safe. I don't ever leave my house.

516
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:27,480
I think, I think I'm a very low risk individual. So that was my thinking there. I'm not a hypocrite.

517
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,920
Damn it.

518
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,080
The very least you change significantly.

519
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,000
Yes, definitely. So that's my excuse.

520
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,360
Sick. Have you been getting text messages from, from the Massachusetts government saying like,

521
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,960
don't go out for a Christmas this year. COVID is at risk in half of Massachusetts.

522
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,640
I'm just like, you're not my mom. Shut up.

523
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,520
No, no, I don't think I have been getting those, but I know, I already know.

524
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,880
The numbers are, the COVID numbers are insane. We thought, we thought they were bad early in

525
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,440
the year, but no, there's so much worse now in terms of like new, new cases.

526
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:07,880
Yeah, but it's all fake anyway.

527
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,480
Post Thanksgiving, the, yeah, it's all hoax. The post Thanksgiving spike is like,

528
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:20,280
it's funny. I saw like a graph, I saw a graph a few months ago that was like,

529
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,680
it showed like the Spanish flu, I think, and how it had like an initial wave and then sort of a

530
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:32,040
secondary wave. And then it's like, we are here. And then there's like a huge third wave that dwarf

531
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:38,120
the other two. And I was like, oh, haha. Nah, that's just like funny. That's just like a joke.

532
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,000
So that's like, that's probably how they actually, there's no reason to think that would actually

533
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,240
happen again. Super COVID coming in right on schedule. Super COVID though.

534
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,600
Oh my God.

535
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:56,440
So, you know, that's where we are. My dad's getting vaccinated pretty soon.

536
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,520
It's a lot lucky him. I guess I will as soon as I get the chance.

537
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,160
Then you just go out and be like, fuck you guys. I'm better than you.

538
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:15,720
Fuck you guys. I will put it in my tin. I'll go, I'll go on Tinder and put it in my bio. It's like,

539
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:23,080
hey, vaccinated. Like put that at the top of the top of things you'll like about me. Number one,

540
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:28,360
vaccinated. Number two, house trained. You got all my shots.

541
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,760
But you won't mention you have AIDS and that's how you get them.

542
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:40,280
No, no, no. Of course not. You can just assume that everybody on Tinder has AIDS.

543
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,920
That's true. Why else would you be there?

544
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,960
Yeah, it's your last resort.

545
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:58,600
I just got spooked. I just got spooked by a thumbnail. It was creepy. It had a face on it.

546
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,040
Yeah, on YouTube because I'm looking at YouTube. What are you doing on YouTube?

547
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:10,840
Wow, we're recording the podcast. I just had it open. I just had it open. I think I was

548
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:16,600
watching the new best of the worst last night. I think that was what I was doing

549
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:25,320
before I went to bed. Oh, the Christmas one. Yeah. I guess I only got 17 minutes and 30 seconds.

550
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,120
You don't? I like those. They're pretty hit or miss. They're hit or miss.

551
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,560
Like sometimes the tapes are just not interesting and you're just like, okay.

552
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,600
There was one really good tape in that one though, like the gun one. That was pretty fun.

553
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,520
Sometimes the movies they watch on the non-black spine ones are not very interesting.

554
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,240
Yeah. It feels like those ones are curated a little bit more.

555
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:54,520
All right, buddy. We're allowed to agree to disagree. Black spine versus no black spine,

556
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,440
COVID hoax versus real. These are things we can agree to disagree on.

557
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,440
These are things that need to be discussed in the free marketplace of ideas.

558
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:11,080
I like, I don't know. The black spine one had the octopuff, which I thought was very memorable.

559
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,360
Octopuff was pretty good. There's some hidden gems in the black spines,

560
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,240
but you got to wade through a lot of boring shit sometimes. I don't know.

561
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:29,240
It's, I don't know. I like just, the other ones, they're all like movies.

562
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,040
You know what a movie is and you know why a movie exists, but then the black spine ones,

563
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:45,000
they'll find things that are like instructional videos or like the Don Beverage seminar or whatever.

564
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,000
Well, let me clarify. Why does this even exist?

565
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,240
I like Wheel of the Worse, where they spin the wheel and there's a bunch of dumb movies,

566
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:58,280
but the black spine ones are the ones where you can just get a lot of the same kind of

567
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,000
low tier thing in a row because nobody knows what's on the tapes. Whereas even on Wheel of

568
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,040
the Worse, like they're slightly curated, so there's like a diverse mix of like weird looking

569
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,800
shit. I guess that's fair. Yeah, I just like it when they watch the really weird things that

570
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:20,440
make you go like, who bought this? Like why did anyone make this and put this on shelves?

571
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:26,440
The journey of how that tape got to where it is, got into their hands. Like who created it,

572
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,280
who thought it was good to purchase it? You know, what a mystery.

573
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:44,200
Oh, I got my new tablet. I got my new tablet and then I, because I, did I complain about my

574
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:51,640
stylus situation about how, okay, okay, well, I ordered the new stylus and I got it. It was here

575
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:58,360
waiting for me when I got back from Christmas and you know what? It worked. It works perfectly. I

576
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:03,960
had to fuck around with like the, I had to fuck around with settings and I had to fuck around with

577
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,680
drivers and stuff to get it to like actually recognize the pen, but it did eventually. So,

578
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,960
beautiful. Now I can, now I can, now I can draw again.

579
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:23,160
I can do art. The worst. Stupid, pointless. Working, making things. God, we're all going

580
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:30,440
to die anyways. It's even the point. It's true. It's true. Damn, you know, you know, that's true.

581
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:39,560
You know, maybe, maybe I should just watch TV all day like all the normies. Maybe they had it

582
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:46,840
right all along. Why should I make entertainment when people can entertain me? That's, that's

583
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:54,680
compelling. And you know, maybe I should just kill myself instead. You know, that, that would

584
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:01,560
save like, think of all the time you would save. Speedrunning, speedrunning life, baby.

585
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,840
Life any percent. Life any percent.

586
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,960
Now nobody, nobody runs life any percent because it's like, like the record, the record has been

587
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,320
cut. There's, there's all these hacks that have been found. The record has been cut down to like

588
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:28,040
zero, zero minutes and zero seconds. Yeah. Yeah. And the any, any percent run is just boring.

589
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:33,880
You got to try and make the run as long as possible. That's, that's the real,

590
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:41,320
that's the real end game for life. Speedrun. Slowly. What's, what's the name for like the,

591
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,960
there's like the category of speedrun. Is there like a,

592
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:52,200
there's like a minimum percent category, right? In some games. And it's like, I'm not a big speedrun

593
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:58,520
I think there's a channel called lowest percent. And it's like, a lot of its videos are explaining

594
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:03,480
like, like lowest percent categories for some games. And it's like, I watch speedrunning videos

595
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:09,640
all the time. I watch like speed docs and, and, and stuff like that. And, oh, what a,

596
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,880
Bismuth, I just, I started watching the Bismuth channel this week. And that's

597
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:20,440
like a, like summoning salt as videos explaining like the history of a speedrun. Bismuth will do

598
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,720
videos explaining like, what is the, what is the tech that's being used in like, you know,

599
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:32,440
the world record run of, you know, whatever game. Yeah, lowest percent is like, lowest percent is

600
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:38,280
like, yeah, you want to do it faster. You want to do the fastest you can. But if you can beat the game

601
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,960
by doing less of it, if you can, if you can cut out even more of the game, even if it's slower,

602
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:49,560
then it's still a better run. Cause the main goal is to do, do as little, and some, some games,

603
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:56,360
it makes sense in, in most games it doesn't. Yeah. Cause cutting out, sometimes cutting out

604
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:02,120
stuff is not faster, right? Some, sometimes it's faster to just do the game, but that's for nerds.

605
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,880
Gross. Who'd want to be a nerd? Imagine. No.

606
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,400
Shameful. Disgusting. Hell, yeah.

607
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,680
What else is, what else is going on? What else is going on in the world today?

608
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,080
I need to share this. I shared it on Twitter. Nobody cared.

609
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,200
I'm going to, I'm going to tell you, do you know, do you know Linus Sebastian, Linus Tech Tips,

610
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,680
the guy who talks about tech on YouTube and he's like, obnoxious. He's like a Canadian guy.

611
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,960
Linus Sebastian. No, I don't.

612
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,880
Well, viewers, if you, if you, because I was, I was up late last night, this is why I didn't

613
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,200
get up until like two 30 and I was testing out my Plex server, which I talked about earlier.

614
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,360
And I was watching this movie, this Tokusatsu movie called zero black blood. It's like a,

615
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,760
it's like a Japanese, like, you know, common writer kind of movie, but it's a spin off a series

616
00:57:52,760 --> 00:58:00,120
called Garo. And the main villain is a white guy and it's just Linus Sebastian. Like it is him.

617
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,000
Is it literally him or does it just look exactly like him?

618
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,240
It's not, it's not literally him, but it looks exactly like him. He plays like an evil demon

619
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:15,240
and it was the funniest shit in the world. And I, it's, it's not, I did, I added him in the,

620
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,240
you should add him on, yeah, okay. You should add him on Twitter and get him to retweet you

621
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,520
saying you are the monster in this fucking Tokusatsu movie.

622
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,440
He won't do it, but still, the people need to know that if you want to watch Linus be an

623
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:36,760
evil womanizer demon that turns into a giant feathered CGI monstrosity by the end of the

624
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,680
movie. You can watch Zero Black Blood. He's in it and it's incredible.

625
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:54,520
Zero Black Blood. Let me see. I'm, I'm trying, I'm, oh, I think, I think I see him. Is he this

626
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:02,440
guy in the white tuxedo? Yeah, yeah, I linked it in the chat. Oh, okay. Whoops. Where am I? Where the

627
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:09,240
fuck am I? Yep, there he is. Well, good for him. You know, I'm glad he's, I'm glad he's getting

628
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:16,760
work. Living, living his best life. In between tech tips, fighting fucking Tokusatsu guys. That's

629
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:25,560
cool. Man, I was surprised. I really liked Flushed Away. It was really, it was a really good flick.

630
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:32,360
It was a very, I mean, it's your, it's your very normal, like, hero's journey, three act structure,

631
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:40,520
you know, rising tension, the hero's lowest point, followed by a, followed by a, the ah-ha moment,

632
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:48,040
and then the denowment or whatever. But you know, it was very, it was very charming. Little, little

633
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:59,400
film. I thought the jokes were pretty good. I liked the protagonists. I would recommend it. I used to,

634
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:05,960
I used to really like them. Or my dad was a really big fan of Ardman stuff while he, he loved Wallace

635
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:13,960
and Gromit when I was a kid. And then I, I filmed an episode of Pokemon over one, one time. I think,

636
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:19,960
I think like we were going to, we were going on vacation or something. And I think it was like

637
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:27,080
the, the Indigo Plateau arc was happening, was going to be airing on TV. And I didn't want to

638
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:33,240
miss it. So like I set the VCR to record the episode while we were gone. And I think I accidentally put

639
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:39,720
like the wrong trousers or something in the, in the VCR and filmed over it. And I think my dad was

640
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:49,560
pissed. And you know what? And you know what? Ash didn't even fucking win. So fuck. What was it all for?

641
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:58,280
Nothing. Nobody cares about Richie. Yeah. That was the beginning of a series of disappointments

642
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:06,120
with the Pokemon show is Ash got cucked. He never, he never won. He never won the fucking, it seems.

643
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,760
I think he does eventually like way the fuck later, like, like only like a year or two ago,

644
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,680
he actually finally won something. I heard that like he never, I heard that he never did. I heard

645
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:23,000
that, didn't, didn't Digi do a video or maybe it was a vlog or something talking about how like

646
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:30,280
the Pokemon got like, like the, like the, the show got like more and more, like the stakes of

647
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,360
the battles got like more and more epic in X and Y or not X and Y. It was, it was in black.

648
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,560
Or was it, was it an X and Y? I don't know. I don't know. But, but it just never, it never,

649
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:46,120
and it seemed like it was the perfect time to finally have Ash win the fucking, the fucking

650
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,440
Indigo Plateau League or whatever. And they just don't do it. I don't know. That's what I heard

651
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:57,000
anyway. Imagine, imagine caring about Pokemon in 2020. Pretty cringe. I, I just think, I just

652
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,560
think a little boy me would be satisfied to know that eventually Ash did become the very best.

653
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:12,440
Some closure. Yeah. But oh well. But oh well. And then they like really like rebooted it for

654
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:18,920
Sun and Moon, I think. Like rebooted it with like a new Ash, right? I don't think it's a new Ash.

655
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,600
I think it just went to, they like changed the art style significantly and all that kind of shit.

656
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:28,520
I, I thought that like, I thought that they like changed the, it was like a new continuity or something.

657
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,360
Did they really? That's what I thought. That'd be wild if so.

658
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:41,160
I don't know. Viewers, let us know if you've been, if you can enlighten us.

659
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:50,840
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, thank god you're here. We're floundering. We're floundering.

660
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,400
We're so desperate for content. We're talking about Pokemon of all things. Oh god.

661
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:02,840
Yeah. Hey, hey, when, is this 2021 right now?

662
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:12,600
Yeah, this will be, this will be out on the day. Wow. Wow. The nightmare's over. Everyone,

663
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,080
COVID's over. It was a hoax all along. Everyone go out and spit in your neighbor's mouth.

664
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:23,880
Oh, I can't wait. I've been, I've been dreaming about this my day for the whole year.

665
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:30,280
We've all been dreaming about this day since the last day of Radcon 4. We all found out

666
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:35,320
shit was bad and it had arrived and we were worried that we were going to be able to get home.

667
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,200
Let's, let's just take, let's just take a stroll down memory lane about how like COVID

668
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,760
became like serious at Radcon 4 and that we all,

669
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,920
After we had made a bunch of jokes and all of our shit making fun of coronavirus

670
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,880
and they're all going to age terribly when they all come out.

671
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:57,800
No, no. Can you imagine, just from, I just, you know, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

672
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,640
I know exactly what you're talking about. I can't wait. I can't fucking wait for that

673
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:07,640
shit to come out and be like so weird in hindsight. So tone deaf. It's like so bad.

674
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,720
Well, whatever, coronavirus, probably nothing. It's going to be great. It's going to be great.

675
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:16,280
And remember how like, like the last day of Radcon, we all, we all had a big meet up. We all had a

676
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:20,760
big meet up with everybody and we all, we all went out and played fucking laser tag and we're

677
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,680
all like running around and sweating in a room together and like picking up this, like all

678
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:30,280
these plastic shit that like kids have been like, scrubbing their hands on. We did. We did. It was

679
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:36,920
like the worst thing you could possibly do. I feel like at the time, it really was like early

680
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,080
enough that that wouldn't have been a problem because I don't think anyone had it after that,

681
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,840
after that exchange. I mean, you never know. Maybe one of them did.

682
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:49,640
You know, I mean, it doesn't seem, it doesn't seem like anybody got it, but

683
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,560
but like easily, easily we could have been spreading it at the time.

684
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,240
Yeah, we could have had the first super spreader event.

685
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,760
It's just really funny how like what we were doing was like the worst thing to possibly do,

686
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:09,720
like three days after we did it, you know, like that shit would have been not allowed.

687
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:14,920
And it's just like, God. And then like, we're all like waiting with baited breath. Like,

688
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,520
are they going to close down the flights? Is Gabe going to be able to get home? Like, we don't know.

689
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:25,160
Oh, yeah, laser tag arena for a little while. They burned they burned down that laser tag arena

690
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,400
afterwards today. I mean, that's because we're super spreading. Oh, because it was super

691
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:37,240
spreading is the last known place where the PCP were just burn any place where the PCP are.

692
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:42,680
Any place we've been. We're in. Yeah, they burned they burned the Radcon 4 house.

693
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:50,920
Shame. Oh, man. Yeah. Hey, it was a nice house. Radcon 4 was fun.

694
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:59,560
Can we just reminisce about how fun Radcon 4 was? It was fun. It definitely like as fun as it was.

695
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:05,640
Every time I think about it, I think nothing happened, though. It was so quick. It was like

696
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:12,040
a slap in the in the face. Yeah, I think Radcon 5 longer. I think that's the lesson we've learned.

697
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:18,280
I agree. I don't know so much. It needs to be longer and it needs and it needs to be less

698
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:24,040
tightly scheduled. Well, it was it was only so I mean, you remember Radcon 2?

699
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:31,000
Or even yeah, right on to a right on three. I think right on three more more. So we had about

700
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:38,280
the same amount of time staying there as it as in Radcon 4. And even then, people were showing up

701
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:45,560
a few days into Radcon 3. I think Ben, you were like a few days late or something. Yeah. And yeah.

702
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,680
So we couldn't do any of the lectures, any of the group projects until everyone was here.

703
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,880
And it's like somehow that feels like we did so much more stuff.

704
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:02,040
And it didn't feel like anything. It's very strange time. And like, I don't exactly know why.

705
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:08,360
I think it might be really just those two days where we were all there on Radcon 4,

706
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:16,120
filming the OVA and and other such things that we needed sunlight. And there wasn't going to be a

707
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:22,760
lot of that weather wise, weather forecast. So we had to get a lot of filming done immediately.

708
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:31,640
And it took up two full days of like extreme filming. And we were in costume and it was a lot of

709
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:38,520
sweat, a lot of falling over. A lot of work. Yeah. A lot of work. Yeah. It was definitely more packed

710
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:44,200
with stuff Radcon 4 was. And then after that, there was a lot of downtime. After that, it was like

711
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:50,040
everybody was like, oh, shit, I don't know any how I don't have any notes for my lecture. I got to

712
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,720
do all of them right now. And that was the Radcon 4. That's what it feels like.

713
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:05,560
Maybe we were also probably could have made it feel. Yeah. You know, we made a lot of money on

714
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:12,600
those streams, actually. We got a lot of donations. It got really drunk also. Yeah, it was bad.

715
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:19,000
But it was very fun. As much as I harp on like how quick it was, it's only because I wish it was

716
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,240
longer, because I wanted to do more stuff. I wanted to be there and on the beach. It was so fun.

717
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:28,920
It was cool. I got like, I mean, we could I got mad. I got like actually high for the first time

718
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:35,560
with Digi. It was really funny. We could have just streamed saying stupid shit.

719
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:42,440
If it had been a week longer, we could have just streamed more. Like we wouldn't have had to like

720
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:48,600
do any any more stuff. We could have done the same amount of stuff, plus a bunch of streams and a

721
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:54,040
bunch of other bullshit. And I don't know, let's plays and stuff. It would have had to be in a

722
01:08:54,040 --> 01:09:00,040
week earlier rather than the like the like the game. Let's play from Radcon 2.

723
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:07,320
Yes, right. On 2. One. Yeah, that was a that was a really good one. But I'm just realizing. Yeah.

724
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:15,640
It could not have been a week longer because Munchie had he only had those two weeks off from

725
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:21,400
school. And so that was what we were well setting it. Well, Munchie Munchie just needs to drop out

726
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:27,800
of school, obviously. Yeah, whatever. But like, I feel so bad for Munchie about the whole school

727
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:32,920
situation. Yeah. Have we have we talked about on here about how we were all totally right

728
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:38,520
that Munchie shouldn't have gone to school? I feel like you can't even do a victory lap on that,

729
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,920
just because like none of us knew this was going to happen.

730
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,760
Yes, kind of. I mean, we didn't know how we didn't even know how right we were going to be.

731
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:51,720
But covid has made it like even more. Munchie would be getting what he wanted out of the

732
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:59,640
experience if this wasn't happening. Woody, though. I mean, in his mind, I don't I don't I

733
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,440
can't tell you if like he would have been satisfied, but like he would be getting what he said out to

734
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,280
go get, which is like a personal hands on experience and making connections with people,

735
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:13,160
which is what he said he wanted out of it. That's all it's such a scam. School is such a

736
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:18,200
fucking scam. The youth have to learn these harsh lessons even their own. No, that's no,

737
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,680
that's so dumb. They don't have to learn the harsh lessons. They can just learn. They don't have

738
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,960
to learn the hard way. But like, nobody wants to agree with an adult. That's the thing.

739
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:36,840
Fucking adults are always stupid. Yeah. That is that's fair. That's fair. I don't know. You know,

740
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:44,680
it's like why why do you know if if something like this, right, if something like covid can show up

741
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:50,120
and just like ruin your school experience, right, can just take away all the stuff that like is good

742
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,680
about it. It's like, oh, it's not the education. It's the it's the connections. It's the hands

743
01:10:54,680 --> 01:11:00,360
on experience or whatever. Then like, oh, okay. So what you're telling me is that it's it's pointless

744
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:05,080
and it's and it's fake and it's a scam is what you're saying. And covid has merely has merely

745
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:12,120
highlighted that fact. It hasn't it hasn't made it into some like fake. It was it was fake all along.

746
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,720
In my opinion, I mean, in my opinion, this merely this merely exposes what was already true.

747
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,040
The education has always been a joke in a post internet world. You can learn everything you

748
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:30,760
can learn in school online for free. Yes. That's indisputable. Yeah. But if you're going there

749
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,480
to meet people and make connections, then you can't really do that online to the same degree.

750
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:44,520
I think the thing is that sure that you can't do that online. But the the cost of that experience

751
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:48,840
is like very antiquated with what the internet can get you.

752
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:54,280
What what a disaster. What a disaster of pounds.

753
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:00,760
Yeah. What what a disaster that like that's that the only way like like there is no there's no like

754
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:07,240
alternate way to do that, right? Right? There's no there's no it's like, oh, well, I want to,

755
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:13,080
you know, make connections with people and, you know, have a fucking experience or whatever.

756
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:18,200
But I don't want to pay a million fucking dollars and and live in a dorm and attend classes. Like

757
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,440
I don't want to do those very specific things, but I want that other experience and there's no

758
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:28,600
alternative. And and and why? Why is that? I guess the alternative is just like go

759
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,640
capitalism is in the world. You just have to like go out into the world and just talk to people

760
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:40,360
and just like be outgoing. You just need to be sure. Sure. But the weird cool guy nearby the

761
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,040
university who just hangs out with all the students. He doesn't actually go. You need to be that.

762
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:50,760
That's a creep. You're describing a weird creepo. Whoever went. No, no, he's cool. You don't

763
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,160
understand. I said he's cool. He's not cool. He's just being cool. That's not cool. You know,

764
01:12:55,160 --> 01:13:01,880
who did that? Oh, Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs dropped out of school, but like sat in on a bunch of classes

765
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:07,080
anyway, learned about typography and all this cool shit. And then he made the Mac dope. He just

766
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:12,840
like stole that. I feel like if I just hung out near a school, I would be arrested.

767
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:18,040
Somebody would find some reason to arrest me because you're your fat Ben right now. Once

768
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:24,680
you're not fat Ben anymore. Oh, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Okay. All right. Now I really

769
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:29,720
got to lose that weight. How bad is fat Ben right now? How? How? What is the percentage like

770
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:38,520
overtaken of him? Fat Ben is. Fat Ben is about. Are we at a game back?

771
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:46,280
Uh, right. You mean Radcon? Was it three that I was fat? Radcon three was what made you start

772
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:52,840
keto? Yeah, I think I weigh about as much as I did at Radcon three. So, you know, it's bad.

773
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:57,800
I don't, okay, I don't think I look as fat. I don't feel like I look as fat as I did then,

774
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,920
but I weighed myself the other day and I weighed about as much. Do you still have the beard right

775
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:08,440
now? No, I have no beard. Oh, no. Some of it might be illusory. Like some of it might be water weight

776
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:13,480
or I might like I was weighing myself with clothes on. So like actually if I like started

777
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:19,000
dieting, I might be down to like, I might be down another like five or 10 pounds than what I

778
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
think I weigh. So I might not quite be that level, but it's pretty close. Yeah, I've gained like,

779
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,480
yeah, I lost like the difference between fat Ben and skinny Ben. It's like about 50 pounds.

780
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:35,080
And actually there is no skinny Ben, just fat Ben and normal Ben. It's like about 50,

781
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:41,400
it's like about 50 pounds. And so I'm up, I'm up almost that 50, at least 40. It's fucked up.

782
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,800
Yeah, it's fucked up. Dude, COVID fucked everything up, man.

783
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,600
I mean, you were doing well under COVID with keeping on keto and not being fat Ben.

784
01:14:53,880 --> 01:15:03,080
I kept on keto, but yeah, I gained, I did gain a little weight. I gained like maybe 20 pounds back

785
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:09,800
over during quarantine, but while I was still doing keto. And then I think when I went off keto,

786
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:17,000
I gained another, I've gained like another 20 or so since then. I was like, I was like slowly

787
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:24,760
putting weight back on while I was still keto. And then it, and I was just like, I kind of wanted

788
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:30,440
to lose it again, but it wasn't urgent. But now I feel urgent. I'd like to get it off by, I'd like

789
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:36,360
to be back down to normal Ben weight by like April or so. I think I could do that. If I'm,

790
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:41,720
if I do like the keto intermittent fasting thing, it should be doable. It should be pretty good.

791
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,960
Yeah. Hey, it's going to be, it's going to be hype. Yeah.

792
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:51,240
What happened over Christmas Day? Did you talk about that already?

793
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:59,720
No. Yeah, I said, I was talking about that. I went and hung out with my parents.

794
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:06,520
Uh, and I, then we had friends giving here at my apartment and my friend cooked a goose

795
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:14,840
and I carved it. Uh, and it was delicious. And there was a dessert he made. Let me tell you about

796
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:19,480
this dessert he made. He made like a, like a, I don't know what you call it was like a chocolate,

797
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:25,400
like sort of roll of like a roll of like sponge cake and some kind of like chocolate ganache.

798
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:32,120
And it was rolled up into a log, like a yule log. Yeah. It was, yes, it was,

799
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,720
it was rolled up into a yule and it even like, it was even textured to look like bark.

800
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:43,800
It was very nice. There's a fun classic. I'd never seen something like that before,

801
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,480
but it was cool. Yep. So eight goose and a log. What'd you do?

802
01:16:50,280 --> 01:17:01,720
Um, fucking, we ate a turkey and I was, I can't, I don't know. There's nothing really to say.

803
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:07,400
I guess I get, I could talk about the, the presence I got. I was thinking about, uh, like

804
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:15,160
fucking AVG and DVDs. I got those. I saw you tweeted the picture of those.

805
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:21,080
What did I get? I didn't, I didn't like get anything because I, oh, my, my mom got me more,

806
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:26,760
um, got me more, uh, Copic markers because she always, she always buys me a bunch of Copic markers

807
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,880
every holiday and she asked me what I needed, what colors I needed. And because I had finally

808
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:37,160
used my Copic markers this year to do all the like drawings in people's, uh, Vapors copies.

809
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:43,000
I actually, I actually was like, oh wow, I finally got some use out of these. And this,

810
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,920
and this time I knew I was like, oh, I don't have nearly enough like light blues and light

811
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:52,520
purples and light greens. I was, I, I have only like medium shades. I need pastels and she got

812
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:58,120
me a bunch of like light blue, light purple, light greens and it's very, very good, very good. Uh,

813
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:05,080
very exciting. Yeah, I don't, I don't know why, but I can't remember anything. Like am I brains

814
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:10,200
gone? Like my mind is addled for some reason. Christmas was just, I know why I can't remember

815
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:16,600
anything. Oh, we walked the dog and then we came back and we had breakfast and then we stopped

816
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:22,200
having breakfast and then later we had Christmas dinner and presents were involved at some point.

817
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,400
Do you open presents in the afternoon? We open them after breakfast or like early because it's...

818
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:38,440
Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. You gotta open them in the morning. Um, I know why I don't remember

819
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:45,480
anything and it's because I was plastered. Uh, I don't remember what happened last night

820
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:50,760
when I went to sleep. I think I was watching Best of the Worst Christmas 2020. I think

821
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,560
that's what I was doing, but I don't know and hopefully I never will.

822
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,600
Who's more dangerous to drink than a fat Ben?

823
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:10,440
Fortunately, we don't have to choose. We can have, we can have both and that's what we did.

824
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:16,200
That's what, that's what, literally that's what happened last night and it was a real,

825
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,520
a real nightmare and it was really the worst of both worlds.

826
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:28,680
Oh boy. I'm probably, I'm going to go and I'm going to eat some of those leftover goose fat

827
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:33,320
potatoes and that'll be like the last non keto meal I ever have.

828
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,680
Damn. It was good. It was fun while it lasted. It was nice, but now it's gone.

829
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,840
It was fun, but look what it cost.

830
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,720
Look what, yes. At what, at what cost? Look what, look what it's wrought.

831
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,720
Looks down at body. Ugh. Disgusting.

832
01:19:53,720 --> 01:20:00,280
Adios. Here's, here's what's good. I learned this Christmas that I like champagne.

833
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:06,440
I drink it and I'm like, yeah, you know what? It's, it's not as bad as I thought it was

834
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:11,160
because I've never really been much for wine. Everyone would make fun. Yeah, wine's gross.

835
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:16,600
I hate wine. Actually, I was drinking it last night, lol, but I still don't like it.

836
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:26,440
Everyone would make fun of me because I would go to the liquor store and I would buy two bottles

837
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:32,520
of sparkling, of sparkling, brute cuvée and then drink them alone in my room.

838
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,840
And that was, that was one of my favorite, that's been one of my favorite quarantine

839
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:42,760
activities this year. And everyone, and everyone's thinks it's funny because it's,

840
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,200
because it's a girl drink, but you know what? It's tasty.

841
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,480
There's no such thing as girls drink.

842
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,160
You just, there's no such things as girls. You just drink whatever is you want.

843
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:04,280
Yeah. Wine is, wine is gross and the fact that it's not carbonated, I think,

844
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:10,600
can make you like drink it too fast. The worst hangovers I've ever had have been wine hangovers.

845
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:17,720
They're horrible. Yeah, they just sort of have, I don't know, it's like, oh, it's sort of similar

846
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:23,320
to fruit juice, but like not good taste, but you know what? It's got a hint of some sort of fruit,

847
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:29,320
so I guess, you know, I'll drink it like a, like a normal drink. Just guzzle it, just chug it down.

848
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,760
Because like sipping it, I don't want to have this taste in my mouth that long, I just gotta chug

849
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:39,640
it down, like blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, and then you're done. Then you're fucking toast.

850
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:46,200
And then they say, hmm, some more, and I'm like, no, no, no. No, no, please, no, please.

851
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:55,960
Oh, we didn't make, you know what, you know what was missing from my holiday was, was eggnog.

852
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,560
We, we did, my parents did have some pumpkin eggnog that I had like a little paper

853
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,880
shot glass of, because I just wanted a taste of it, because that's, that stuff's good, but you

854
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:12,120
don't, you're just, no. Most holidays, we make like, we make like hard cider in a crock pot,

855
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:17,240
or we make like, or do like rum eggnog and a thing, and you're, and everyone drinks it out

856
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:23,480
from a ladle, everyone ladles it, but we didn't do like a party this year. So I guess nobody did that.

857
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:31,160
And now that I remember that we didn't have that, I feel it's absence. That's a holiday tradition

858
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:38,760
that I like, and it's gone. It's gone. COVID took everything from me. They took my eggnog.

859
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:49,640
Fucking egg frog. I've never had eggnog in my life. What the fuck? Yeah. What the fuck? I heard

860
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:55,080
someone describe it recently as cold cum, and now I do not want to try it ever. What the fuck?

861
01:22:55,080 --> 01:23:00,280
It's no. It's not like that at all. It's not even. I think I've asked this question before,

862
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:05,240
and I keep forgetting because it's so, I don't care. So I guess I won't ask again what it is.

863
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:13,000
It's, it's like a, it's like a, I guess it's got egg in it. It's like a, it's like a cream. It's

864
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,800
like you drink an egg. It's like a, it's like a milkshake. It's like a milkshake, but it's

865
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:25,640
flavored with like, with like nutmeg, I think is the, is the flavor. And it's good. I don't know.

866
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:31,560
It's just a good milkshake and it's great. I love eggnog. It's the best. I don't think it's keto

867
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:39,800
best. Oh, you know, I'll bet you could make a keto variant. I bet if you just, yeah, if you just

868
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:44,760
left the sugar out and you just replaced it with like stevia, you could absolutely make keto eggnog

869
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:53,000
because it's made of like cream and eggs. There you go. No problem. Is, is egg keto? Hell yeah.

870
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,760
Yeah. Eggs are keto. Yeah. Egg is, egg is keto. Okay. Milk, milk is not keto, but I bet if you

871
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:04,440
just use more cream and less milk, you could make like a, you could make a version that's low enough

872
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:08,920
sugar that you could, that you could have some and it would still be keto. I think it would be totally

873
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:15,240
doable. I mean, I used to just chug. When I was, when I was really hardcore keto, I would just chug

874
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:20,280
a heavy cream out of the bottle or out of the carton. So, you know, I could just make it with

875
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:24,440
all cream and it'd be fine. That's, that's the kind of person I wouldn't want to let on my

876
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:29,080
college campus. Someone who's just sitting on the side drinking heavy cream right out of the carton.

877
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:36,600
Those, those are the days I have to, funnily enough, that was like the least fat Ben was the,

878
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,760
was the like just chugging heavy cream out of the carton Ben. So I have to go back to that.

879
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:46,360
I have to like reclaim my lost animal nature. It sounds disgusting, but scientifically, if you're

880
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:51,960
burning ketones, that's just, that's just you're not, you're not getting any fatter. It's, it can't

881
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,600
argue with it. I can't wait. I can't wait to piss on the keto strip and have it turn purple again.

882
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:02,680
I'm going to feel so superior to all of you. That is the closest thing to a fucking glucose.

883
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:07,880
The closest thing to ascending to Godhood is doing that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ben's saying

884
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,520
it's like a, it's like a real Scott Pilgrim character.

885
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:18,280
Like I'm imagining sitting, sitting on the side drinking heavy cream in front of a university

886
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:24,680
trying to be cool. Not that you actually do that. And yeah. And you're with your shirt.

887
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:28,200
I'm just being cool shirt. Link in the description. I should,

888
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:34,120
I should act, I should actually get that shirt. You're, you're, you're making me actually want

889
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:42,440
that shirt. The shirt is really, I got, I finally, I went back, I went back to reality.

890
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:49,160
Oops, there goes gravity. And I bought the, I bought the T-faps. Let's do the slime war again

891
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:54,920
shirt. I don't know why I just wanted it. Like I wanted to get one back when it was like relevant

892
01:25:54,920 --> 01:26:01,000
back during the old RFCK hiatus that the, that caused it to exist. But I just thought about

893
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,200
and I was like, I really wanted that shirt back then, but I never got it. I'll get it now.

894
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:11,880
And I did. And now I have it and, and I'm too fat for it. So I better lose some weight so I can

895
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:17,800
wear it. Yeah. Fat Ben has taken everything from me. Fat Ben has ruined my life.

896
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,800
When I was like hardcore keto, I was actually able to finally like get into like medium shirts

897
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,520
comfortably. I was always like either large or extra large. And it felt, it literally felt like

898
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:34,360
ascending to a higher level of Christ consciousness. It was, it was so good. I let it all slip away.

899
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:40,760
There's nothing worse. There's nothing worse now than like putting on a shirt that I know

900
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:47,240
fit me when I was lighter and it doesn't, and it's not comfortable. And I just, I just, the

901
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,800
self-loathing is just unbearable. Putting on a pair of pants that you needed a belt for and you

902
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,160
don't need a belt for it anymore. It's like, you want to just use that belt and just hang

903
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:58,120
yourself with it. Cause it's just like, what's even the point of being alive?

904
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:06,280
It's, it's a nightmare. Well, I'd like to say that I cannot relate at all to that.

905
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:13,560
Yeah. I know. Fuck you. I know. I hate you. I hate you so much. Fuck you. Get the fuck out of here.

906
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:21,560
Get the fuck out of here. Go on. Get. No. Go on. No, I'm, I'm, I'm dodging the broom.

907
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:27,400
You're trying to brush me out. Are you trying to like, are you trying to like gain weight?

908
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:32,360
Are you trying to like put on? Who would ever want to do that? I need to.

909
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:38,760
Put on, put on girl fat. Kind of. Is that, is that the plan? Yeah. A little bit, a little bit.

910
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:45,480
I heard, I saw, I think it was, oh, who was it? I saw someone on Twitter who was saying they were

911
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:51,640
trying to gain weight to get, to get the girl fat. I think it was, I think it was Izzy from,

912
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:58,680
the, from the, from the pizza party podcast, who, which doesn't, which I don't know,

913
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:02,760
where's the podcast? I don't know. I think she was saying like she wanted to like,

914
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:06,040
she was trying to gain, gain girl fat. And I thought that was funny.

915
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:14,760
I mean, you don't need to gain necessarily. It's just like under HRT, fat redistributes

916
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:21,240
to the hips and stuff. So if you have a, you know, depends on your genetics, I guess,

917
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:28,840
what, where it goes exactly, but that'll happen. Lamal. Lamal. So if you want huge

918
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:33,640
tits you need to eat, I guess, I don't know how that works. Gross.

919
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:39,000
Being a stick figure is my ideal body type. I can't do it because I'm not built that way,

920
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,720
but it doesn't change the fact that I want to just be like 2D. Just, just nothing. I just

921
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:48,600
want to seize existing. I just want to, I just want to look like Goku.

922
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:55,640
I'm too, I'm way too lazy. I want to be like Luffy, like pre time skip.

923
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,280
Well, like with a fucking eight pack.

924
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
When he was, no, before when he was just a little twig man, that's what I want to be.

925
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,880
We just a little bit of a strong, strong the whole time.

926
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:13,800
Maybe, maybe he wasn't drawn like that. I can't remember.

927
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:20,520
I mean, he has like stick arms, but he has like, I think he's like a little bit of a define,

928
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,440
define chest. I could do that, but I just don't, he has like,

929
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:30,600
aesthetically, I would be totally fine looking like that, but I have no illusions that I have the

930
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,680
discipline to like actually work out to that degree. It just isn't going to happen.

931
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:39,320
That's really, it's really funny. It's really funny that that's your ideal body type.

932
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:43,960
It's like a stick. I just want to disappear. No, no definition whatsoever.

933
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:48,120
Yeah, yeah. You just hold out your hand and it just keeps going.

934
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, that's the, that's the bonus.

935
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:57,400
It's got to be, it's got to be powerful. You got to have that, you got to have that,

936
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:02,760
that masculine V shape. You got to have the, the, the broad, the broad shoulder look.

937
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:08,040
The thing longer. You got to have the, you got to have that big dick.

938
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:15,240
Yeah. That's my ideal body type. My ideal body type, big penis, please.

939
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,360
My ideal body type. Everything else is negotiable.

940
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,200
Can I have three legs?

941
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:29,480
Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much. Oh God. There's a, there's a, there's a,

942
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:37,080
there's a thermos here on my desk of a mysterious substance and I'm pretty sure that it's probably

943
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:48,200
sea ice and coke. Should I drink it? No. You don't know what it is. Oh God. It's come.

944
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:56,600
Okay. It's, it's sea ice and coke. It's sea ice and coke. Oh God. Fat Ben wins again.

945
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:02,760
Oh, it's, oh, it's flat. Oh, it's flat and it's gross. Fat Ben is just, what did you gain from

946
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:09,240
that? What did you gain from that? Nothing except more weight. What if I just, what if I just drank

947
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:14,680
all of it right now and just got drunk here on the procrastinator's podcast? What if I just did

948
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:18,200
that, huh? Good night, good night everybody. Ben, it's fat Ben speaking now. You have to,

949
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:22,840
you have to resist. What would you do? You can't stop me. You can't stop me. Ben, you were just

950
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,640
saying how, how you want to be powerful. You want to be powerful Keto God and now you're just

951
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:32,840
immediately caving to pressure at the first possible opportunity. Pressure that no one is

952
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:39,160
really putting on you. Alcohol's Keto. Alcohol's Keto. That's cute. Sort of, technically.

953
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:46,520
If I drink it first enough and then pee it out, it's not, it's Keto. It's like it never happened.

954
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:54,520
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, there's a science to it. There's a, there's an art. There's a

955
01:31:54,520 --> 01:32:00,520
technique. It's, if you actually, if you, if you chew your food properly, you can, you can make

956
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:05,960
things more or less Keto. You can control their Keto levels through, through breathing exercises.

957
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,640
I prefer breathing exercises. It's strange, but it's true.

958
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,360
Mmm. Yes. Excellent. Mmm. Yes. Delicious.

959
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:21,720
Did anybody see my fucking Game of the Decade video I made?

960
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:29,240
Game of the Decade? I saw it, but I saw that you posted it, but I haven't watched it.

961
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:33,240
It's an hour and 30. It's an hour. Oh my God. I think it was because I saw,

962
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,520
I think of you, Tom, on the IM Games Twitter talking about Game of the Decade or something.

963
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:44,200
I thought, hmm, that was a good idea. That was a tweet from last year. Oh, well, that's,

964
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:48,600
I think that's probably like, I made a mistake, but I did, I didn't do it last year, I don't think.

965
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:57,720
So this year I talked about games that came out, um, in the decade. I don't, I get the decade

966
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:04,520
wrong. So, but it's 2010 to 2020. Fuck yeah. I, yeah. So it's a long rambling. You did a Game of the

967
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:09,960
Decade video and you got the decade wrong. Yeah, but, um, I could just do it next year as well.

968
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:16,920
I'll just keep doing it. 2011 to 2021. That would be pretty funny, actually.

969
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,760
They'll have the same, they'll be like the same games.

970
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:27,480
Some of them. They probably have the same winner. Yeah. Can I ask what the Game of the Decade was,

971
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:33,080
or would that be spoiling it? Um, I mean, it's a long video. If you go listen to it,

972
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:36,760
if you want to hear, basically it's like a tournament bracket thing where I have the,

973
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:41,960
I pit the games randomly against each other. And then I deliberate to myself, hmm,

974
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:48,360
is Fallout New Vegas better or worse? The Dark Souls? Hmm. What are the Bennett pros and cons?

975
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:52,760
Like you can't compare games like that. It's stupid, which is why I thought it would be funny.

976
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:59,160
And so I did that for all of them. And I think, uh, I can spoil the winner was Minecraft, because,

977
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:02,920
you know, because, you know, wait, that doesn't come out this decade.

978
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:08,040
The, the, the, um, came out officially in 2010.

979
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,760
It technically, the, the Alpha was in 2009.

980
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,000
Okay. I'm pretty sure. I looked at the thing. Wow.

981
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:23,080
Um, I believe it. I guess, I guess it just feels so much older than that. It feels ancient.

982
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:26,120
Yeah. It feels like it's always been there. If Minecraft doesn't count,

983
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,200
then the second place winner was Pokemon Go.

984
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:38,680
Really? Yep. That's shocking. That is, that is a shocking pick. I think you'll make a lot of

985
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:42,680
people upset with it. Yeah. Um, so go watch the video. I mean,

986
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:50,600
I can't wait to go dislike this video right now. The video is like very like stupid and like ill

987
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:55,400
thought, ill prepared, ill thought out. I was just like game of decade. Hmm. What do I think?

988
01:34:55,400 --> 01:35:00,920
I guess nobody would care to know. So I won't put any effort into making the video about it,

989
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:06,120
but I want to make a video about it. And it was just like all of the games I have played

990
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:10,920
and enjoyed, uh, those were the only ones in the running. If I played a game and I didn't

991
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:14,760
care for it, it's not on there. So there's a lot of games that just have never been,

992
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,320
were not on in the running.

993
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:24,680
Indeed. Indeed. I'm looking at these games. I played

994
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,520
like two or three of them that's on here. Maybe four.

995
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:40,040
Criminal. Let me, let me see here. Let me, let me just take a, let me just take a quick look.

996
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:46,760
I'm judging your game. Just choose. Please do. The best, the best game on here is

997
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:58,600
what the fuck is from dust? What the fuck is Trover saves the universe? That's, that's Justin

998
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:06,120
Roiland's VR game where you're, he's Justin Roiland and he says, ah, ah, geez, you gotta,

999
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:12,520
you gotta save the universe. And I'm like, okay, it's very funny. Oh, it's the best game.

1000
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:18,520
Lisa, Lisa, the joyful on here, I think Lisa wins. Lisa, the painful got very close, got to fourth

1001
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:25,080
place, I think. Wait, you put, you put Lisa and Lisa, the painful and Lisa, the joyful as

1002
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:30,200
separate entries. No, the first Lisa, I didn't put on there because I didn't feel it was as good of

1003
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:36,040
the others as the other two. Okay, I, I just, I disagree. I disagree with this

1004
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,720
because I think Lisa, the painful Lisa, Lisa, the joyful is DLC for Lisa, the painful. So really,

1005
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:47,240
they should be one entry and they should win. Yeah, as I said, takes the video really poorly

1006
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:54,840
planned stupid video. Like the longer, the longer I think about what it is, the more cracks and like

1007
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:00,840
complete inaccuracies and flubs and like, this is just wrong. Why would you do it like this?

1008
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:05,560
I didn't have the bracket like, have like a loser's bracket so that we could figure out

1009
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:10,360
of the losers who wins. Just some people get eliminated too early. Single elimination.

1010
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:16,360
Yep. This is like everything that could have been like, like not, not quite correct about it is,

1011
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:24,760
is the case. Nice. Cool. But if you like listening to me ramble on about stuff,

1012
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:25,960
then there's that.

1013
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:34,680
You know what? I do. That's why I'm here listening to the procrastinator's podcast.

1014
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:40,760
The best podcast. Actually, the best podcast on the internet.

1015
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:48,680
Ted interwebs. Best game of the decade was Slime Ranch. The best game of the decade was Endless War,

1016
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:51,880
a free MMO playable entirely within Discord server.

1017
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:57,880
Uh, you know, I would have put that on there, but I didn't like it. It sucks. Game sucks.

1018
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,960
Fuck. No, fuck. No, fuck. No.

1019
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,080
Too hard. It killed me.

1020
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,920
No, I'll, no, I'll kill you.

1021
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,040
No, you're gonna die.

1022
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:18,840
I rage quit so hard that I destroyed all Slime.

1023
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,440
Hell yeah.

1024
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:26,200
No, you didn't. You didn't do that. You can't.

1025
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:27,960
Oh, god.

1026
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:28,840
It's impossible.

1027
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:33,240
Do we have anything else left to say? We're floundering right now.

1028
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:38,120
We are floundering. I'm, I feel kind of sick from drinking that, from drinking that,

1029
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,800
that, that's, that's soda water.

1030
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:42,760
Really? That was a bad idea and you shouldn't have done it. Wow.

1031
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:47,960
No, no, it was good. It was a good idea. It was great. I'm glad I did it.

1032
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:54,520
But I am ill now. I am feeling terrible. So, you know, whatever.

1033
01:38:55,560 --> 01:39:01,880
I mean, it's not really much to talk about other than like, I guess I've been continuing to clean

1034
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:08,120
up my room and I got to these boxes that have like toys in them that I was like, I don't want to

1035
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:13,240
throw these away. They're funny. And it was basically just a lot of like rubbery, floppy

1036
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:19,880
dinosaurs that you can squeeze and, and like weird fish and snakes and spiders. And I was like,

1037
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:23,400
I don't ever take these out. Why do I keep them? So I've been

1038
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:28,920
packing them up in a box. I'm going to toy story them over to a charity shop or whatever.

1039
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,200
That's what you call.

1040
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:36,520
I'm going to toy story three though. I'm going to fucking toy story three those bitches.

1041
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,840
As in like throw them into a fucking furnace.

1042
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,160
No. No, no, no.

1043
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:49,640
I found, I found all my old Yu-Gi-Oh cards. I was like, ha ha. Look at them sitting there.

1044
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:56,520
Oh, my, my mom, my mom, she's always, she's always trying to like sell our old stuff,

1045
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:02,680
like our old, like baseball cards and stuff, which I like had, I guess, for some reason.

1046
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:07,080
And I think they're all worthless. I don't think that any of them are ever worth anything.

1047
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:13,320
I think, I think she's tried to sell our old Pokemon card collection and, you know,

1048
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:18,520
that's all worth nothing. Even, even though I have a Charizard,

1049
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:21,800
even though I have a Charizard, it turns out it's not actually worth that much.

1050
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:26,200
It's not actually that rare. Just everyone just wanted it because it could do 100 damage.

1051
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,240
And everyone thought it was cool.

1052
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:28,840
It does.

1053
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:29,400
First edition.

1054
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:30,360
No shortage of them.

1055
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,040
CGC rated.

1056
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:32,360
No.

1057
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:32,920
You're worth money.

1058
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,040
CGC rated? What's that?

1059
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:40,280
It's like when you like send them in to get them like rated so they can be like, oh,

1060
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:44,440
like, like a professional like card thing, like Riggs, how good the condition is,

1061
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,760
and like make some more valuable or some shit. I don't know.

1062
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:51,160
I see. I see. No, it's not first edition. It's just normal.

1063
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,080
It's just normal.

1064
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:53,640
Friends.

1065
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,080
Just normal Charizard.

1066
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:55,560
Imagine.

1067
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:58,200
Piece of shit. Yeah. I don't, I don't know.

1068
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:01,800
My family threw out all my Pokemon cards and they refused to admit it to this day,

1069
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,160
even though they don't exist anymore.

1070
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:03,640
Why?

1071
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,280
I had so much shit.

1072
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:05,160
Why would they do that?

1073
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:06,280
Because I don't know.

1074
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:07,160
Why would they do such a thing?

1075
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,640
I don't know. I don't know if it was on purpose or it was an accident.

1076
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:11,560
They deny it, but they don't exist anymore.

1077
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:16,520
So it's a travesty.

1078
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,320
Tragic.

1079
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,440
It really is.

1080
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:18,920
Tragic.

1081
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,960
Maybe there's a hidden memory of you having a poke and meltdown.

1082
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,520
Maybe you just let them all on fire.

1083
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:25,960
Yeah.

1084
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:29,960
I did fire spin for 100 damage to all my cards.

1085
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:35,640
How could you?

1086
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:36,680
That's fucking criminal.

1087
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,320
That's terrible.

1088
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,080
Should we do voicemails?

1089
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,120
We should do voicemails.

1090
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,120
All right.

1091
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:42,440
Okay.

1092
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:44,200
Let's, let's, let's, let's go.

1093
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:44,920
Let's go.

1094
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:45,560
Are we ready?

1095
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:46,040
I see that.

1096
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:48,600
I think the first one we got is the jungle man.

1097
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:50,040
I believe so.

1098
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:52,280
Are you ready?

1099
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:52,680
Nope.

1100
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:53,000
Nope.

1101
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,400
Hang on.

1102
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:55,000
Faster.

1103
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,400
Okay.

1104
01:41:55,400 --> 01:42:00,440
Speakpipe.com slash, well, there's not many of them.

1105
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,320
Oh, you're right.

1106
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:04,600
It's a small miracle.

1107
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,520
There's, there's like a, there's like a normal number.

1108
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,360
If you can even believe it.

1109
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:10,680
Okay.

1110
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,240
Wait, hold on.

1111
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,440
Why is my computer taking so long?

1112
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:15,400
Just to download.

1113
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:17,080
Thanks.

1114
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:19,000
Not even, these are not even.

1115
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:20,280
Your internet.

1116
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:20,680
Good.

1117
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,280
These voicemails aren't even good.

1118
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:23,560
You don't need to download them.

1119
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,600
I'm on the site.

1120
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:25,400
We can listen like.

1121
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:26,840
Okay.

1122
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:27,000
All right.

1123
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,920
I guess you'll have to download them at some point, but yeah.

1124
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:30,920
All right.

1125
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,840
First one is called the jungle man.

1126
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:35,560
Also, I haven't forgotten when Ben said rule of thumb.

1127
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:36,600
Okay.

1128
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,040
Thanks.

1129
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,640
Three, two, one, go.

1130
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:45,400
You guys talked about The Simpsons last episode,

1131
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:49,080
and I just wanted to recommend Jonas Chakas previously known as

1132
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:53,960
Cuck Philosophy's video called The Simpsons and the Death of Parody.

1133
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,360
Ben would come on this shit.

1134
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:00,840
It goes into how capitalism inevitably leads to shows like The Simpsons

1135
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,680
and how it creates ironic entertainment,

1136
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,840
which is similar to awareness of exploitation,

1137
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,640
yet still doing actions that support exploitations.

1138
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:10,360
But since you know it's exploitation, it's fine.

1139
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,320
Or creating things that make fun of capitalism or of anti-establishment views,

1140
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:18,840
but still make a boatload for their owners, shareholders,

1141
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:22,120
and the word pastiche, which was coined by Jameson,

1142
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:26,360
Dude Fox, which basically means parody without jokes.

1143
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:29,160
Simpsons went from social commentary through parody

1144
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:33,320
to just referencing reality and that being the joke.

1145
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:36,680
It leaves off it's high from a generation ago as a zombie.

1146
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:39,960
You can also see the zombification and a lot of other things

1147
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:42,520
like superhero movies, picture play games,

1148
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,840
the Assassin's Creed, Cod, etc.

1149
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,200
Go watch it.

1150
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,400
I am the jungle man.

1151
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,280
I literally watched

1152
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,880
Okay, cool.

1153
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:54,840
Thanks jungle man.

1154
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,800
I watched that video

1155
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,560
on Christmas Eve.

1156
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,440
I went to bed.

1157
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:03,800
No, no, it was the day after.

1158
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,560
I watched the video last night,

1159
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:09,000
or no, two nights ago in bed, and it was really good.

1160
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:11,800
Cuck Philosophy is a really good channel.

1161
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:15,240
I think he's changed the name to like CCK philosophy.

1162
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:16,200
I don't know why.

1163
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,760
I wish they didn't, but they did.

1164
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:19,080
You too probably.

1165
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,240
Was it because people were calling him a cuck?

1166
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,480
And it was like, no, you don't get it.

1167
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,440
You don't understand.

1168
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:26,200
I'm not a cuck.

1169
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,000
It's the name.

1170
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,040
Perhaps.

1171
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:33,560
Also, I'm noticing that I have like a burn on my hand,

1172
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:37,720
and I didn't know, and it looks painful,

1173
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,960
but it doesn't feel like anything.

1174
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:41,160
So I guess it's fine.

1175
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,680
A short subburn.

1176
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:43,400
Ben, stop.

1177
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,080
I don't know what it is.

1178
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,200
You have to stop this.

1179
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,240
Is it a bruise?

1180
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:50,920
Or it kind of looks like a burn,

1181
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,360
but it doesn't feel like anything.

1182
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,840
God, but you really shouldn't have drunk that, whatever it was.

1183
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:57,240
I think it's destroying you from the inside.

1184
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,480
God, I hope so.

1185
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:00,360
I hope you're right.

1186
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:06,760
Next, next voicemail is called The Quest for Cold Corona Episode One,

1187
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:08,120
Bat Dong.

1188
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,440
Three, two, one, go.

1189
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,160
And I got some city warehouse.

1190
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,000
The middle is up to his evil ways.

1191
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,920
What's the valuables in the truck, boys?

1192
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:19,080
Grammatically crushing just about silly like a boss.

1193
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,640
Well, it's Batman and his Bat Dong.

1194
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,640
Stop saying I'm a Bat Penis, brother.

1195
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,600
So I have cry-fighting zone, but I can kill my right-out of function.

1196
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:27,560
Never mind that.

1197
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:28,360
Minions, attack.

1198
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,120
Batteries, I choose you.

1199
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:32,840
Go.

1200
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:35,160
Ow, my eye, my leg, my penis.

1201
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:38,360
Your cry-fat bone predicts the fight.

1202
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,600
Brother, you can go to Ogham without a penis.

1203
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,800
The choice is yours.

1204
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,160
No thanks, Bat Dodo.

1205
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:44,360
I plan on ruling the world.

1206
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:45,240
And I rule the world.

1207
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:46,280
You need a penis?

1208
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,120
True, but I'm still taking you down.

1209
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,800
Wait, Bat Dodo, I have a hostage.

1210
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:51,480
A PCP member hostage.

1211
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:52,200
Impossible.

1212
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,640
I say no, PCP members.

1213
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:56,520
And this is very happy with her new Android dong slash plus.

1214
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:57,640
You say it all but one.

1215
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,000
Look at my ass, Batman.

1216
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,880
Who's been here the whole time in the furnace room?

1217
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:02,680
You know what it means?

1218
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,480
Yes, Batman.

1219
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:06,760
I'll save you.

1220
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,640
Who could really possibly have it in his clutches?

1221
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:10,760
Batman's kind of in the lagoid.

1222
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,640
Who's the identity?

1223
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,440
Did you, Whippiesle?

1224
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,440
Who would Batman save next time?

1225
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,360
Save your next time to find out.

1226
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,880
Same PCP time.

1227
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,080
Same PCP channel.

1228
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:25,160
Thank you for watching this episode of Riddle My Ass, Batman.

1229
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,200
Go to riddlemyassbabman slash patreon.com

1230
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,600
for more great content to support me.

1231
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:31,320
Okay.

1232
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,520
Same PCP time.

1233
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,560
Same PCP channel.

1234
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:40,040
I could only barely understand what he was saying.

1235
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:43,000
I got enough of it.

1236
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,400
I got enough of it to last a lifetime.

1237
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,720
The commitment to one take.

1238
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:51,640
Is truly, truly inspiring.

1239
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:57,800
I'm going to go right now to riddle my ass, Batman.

1240
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:58,680
Was it backwards?

1241
01:46:58,680 --> 01:46:59,640
Was it supposed to be?

1242
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,760
Is it the other way around?

1243
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:03,720
Like, I don't even know.

1244
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:05,240
Is it real?

1245
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:05,720
I don't know.

1246
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,040
I don't know.

1247
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:07,560
Hold on.

1248
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:07,800
Wait.

1249
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:08,200
Okay.

1250
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:08,520
Okay.

1251
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:09,000
No, no, no.

1252
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,400
I would be more impressed if it was.

1253
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,600
There was an actual website.

1254
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:21,240
Unfortunately, tragically, riddlemyassbabman.patreon.com

1255
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:22,760
does not exist.

1256
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:23,160
No.

1257
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:25,480
Surely it must.

1258
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:26,760
I've been misdirected.

1259
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:27,800
Damn.

1260
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:30,920
Okay.

1261
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,720
I googled and I'm reminded of the P.C.P,

1262
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,960
the ultimate fanfic quest for cold corona.

1263
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:42,760
That fanfic.

1264
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:43,800
P.C.P.

1265
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,120
Oh my god.

1266
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:47,880
The riddlemyassbabman fanfic.

1267
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,120
Yeah.

1268
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:48,680
I haven't.

1269
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,880
Did I read that?

1270
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,480
Did I read that on the show?

1271
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:52,040
No, on the show.

1272
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:53,240
It's quite a long thing, isn't it?

1273
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:55,320
I think we had an X.

1274
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:56,200
It's kind of long.

1275
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,240
Yeah, I think that's right.

1276
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:00,680
Oh my god.

1277
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,840
The show's been going on for a long time.

1278
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,760
The show's been going on for too long.

1279
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:11,480
It needs to be put down before it hurts someone.

1280
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:12,200
But we can't.

1281
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,000
We can't stop.

1282
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,320
We're running on pure momentum now.

1283
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:20,440
There ain't no getting off of this train we're on.

1284
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:25,320
Next voicemail is from Janess.

1285
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:28,360
Originally it was Janess, but I have a new name now.

1286
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:29,800
It's spelled differently.

1287
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,360
A new vowel.

1288
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:30,680
Okay.

1289
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,880
Three, two, one, go.

1290
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,520
Hey, P.C.P. Happy 2021.

1291
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,960
Can't believe it's been more than five years

1292
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:46,120
and a couple of years of me listening to your podcast weekly.

1293
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:49,480
My favorite thing this year was finally getting around to

1294
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:53,560
listening to all the horse cast episodes.

1295
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,680
You were just as good back then as you are now.

1296
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:02,920
So I want to wish you good luck and don't blame yourself if you feel like

1297
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:06,520
you're not going to be able to be on the podcast regularly.

1298
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:07,560
I understand.

1299
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:14,600
I'm going to be doing a re-listening to all the podcast episodes myself sometime in 2021

1300
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:17,880
and figure out which episodes are my favorite.

1301
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,000
Who knows?

1302
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,760
Maybe it's not actually going to be the yellow episode.

1303
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,280
It will be.

1304
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:31,400
I like the idea that we're just as good back then as we are now.

1305
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:31,720
Okay.

1306
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:34,440
We have not improved once, like even slightly.

1307
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:40,840
I think saying we're just as good now as we were back then is an indictment of how bad

1308
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:43,320
it was back then than it is to say it's good now.

1309
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:48,280
I just always exactly the same.

1310
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:58,040
Janice, I appreciate the kindness, but it was absolutely 100% was Ben's fault.

1311
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:59,960
He was late to the podcast today.

1312
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,840
100%.

1313
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:03,480
That's on me.

1314
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:07,240
It was also Ben's fault that I was late to the podcast.

1315
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:07,720
Agreed.

1316
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:10,360
Just a throw out of the bus a little bit.

1317
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,280
I take full responsibility.

1318
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:18,280
I don't know if we talked about it when he was on the show.

1319
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:22,280
Tectonic Improv made like a big, I think he might have mentioned that he made a big

1320
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:25,000
ranked list of PCP episodes at one point.

1321
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:25,960
Yeah, the big image.

1322
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:28,520
Right, right, right.

1323
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:29,160
Okay, we talked.

1324
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,680
I think we linked it in the description.

1325
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,160
We did.

1326
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:32,600
Maybe we showed it on screen.

1327
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:37,560
Okay, you should contest that one.

1328
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:40,760
People should argue about placement.

1329
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:49,160
People should be angry about the decisions made and that and not angry at us.

1330
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:54,520
It's not a proper audience if they aren't arguing with each other about pointless ranking.

1331
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:56,600
Absolutely.

1332
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:58,920
Ab, so Lutely.

1333
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:02,600
Next one is called PCP Makes You Trans.

1334
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,280
Three, two, one, go.

1335
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:06,760
Confirmed.

1336
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:10,360
The PCP makes you epically trans.

1337
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,880
Did you give Andavu?

1338
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:14,760
Come on, Ben.

1339
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:17,560
Then it will be your turn to become a cute anime girl.

1340
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:20,040
I would love it very much.

1341
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,040
Yeah, yeah.

1342
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:25,960
And many people are saying this.

1343
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:30,040
It's definitely a statistical anomaly.

1344
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:32,040
I wonder why.

1345
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:35,400
It's statistically based is what it is.

1346
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:39,320
Statistically, I would say it's pretty epic.

1347
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,000
We're pulling our weight for social progressivism over here.

1348
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,040
What are you guys doing?

1349
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:47,560
Davu's not even on the PCP anymore.

1350
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:48,360
Davu's dead.

1351
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:49,640
Davu is fucking dead.

1352
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:49,880
No.

1353
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:55,480
She's, I don't even know who that is.

1354
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,680
It's not even real.

1355
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,680
Next one is called SUCK.

1356
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,480
Wait, you missed Kyosano.

1357
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,160
Did I?

1358
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:05,880
Oh, right.

1359
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:08,840
I didn't realize the next one was called SUCK.

1360
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:12,680
I thought you just didn't want to attempt pronouncing that and just said SUCK.

1361
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:15,560
No, the one after is called SUCK.

1362
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:16,280
Ah, I see.

1363
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:17,960
Okay, Kyosano Ure.

1364
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,240
Three, two, one, go.

1365
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:29,480
Me, what you filthy capitalists call virtual YouTuber.

1366
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:34,040
You fight for love, justice, and the revolution of the world.

1367
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:40,440
You can find me in secret underground bunker where CIA can't hear.

1368
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:45,480
And I destroy western culture with fact and logic.

1369
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:53,160
Come join me in struggle for glorious future and always remember the east is red.

1370
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:54,680
Was that like Russian?

1371
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:57,480
What was that?

1372
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:01,000
Like either someone explain.

1373
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:03,000
It's foreign.

1374
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:03,800
That's all I know.

1375
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:09,080
I don't, I don't, well, okay.

1376
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:09,400
Sorry.

1377
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:11,320
They say yes.

1378
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:12,360
So it's like that.

1379
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:15,000
There is a lot of things happening.

1380
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,960
I think they were speaking Japanese with a Russian, with a Russian accent.

1381
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,400
I think that's what was going on there.

1382
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:21,160
They said the east is red.

1383
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:23,480
And all I can think of is G Gundam.

1384
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,920
The east is burning red.

1385
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:28,200
The school of the undefeated of the east, which is the greatest show of all time.

1386
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:29,080
So they have my support.

1387
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:31,240
Yeah.

1388
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,520
Good luck.

1389
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:33,240
Good luck.

1390
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,720
Good luck destroying capitalism, you know, rooting for you.

1391
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,240
Okay.

1392
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:41,880
Next one is called, um, sec.

1393
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:42,680
Why won't it play?

1394
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:48,440
But wait, mind fucking, mind like don't start for a while.

1395
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:52,280
I have to like start mine early, wait like 10 seconds, and then, and then.

1396
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:52,840
Okay, whatever.

1397
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:53,400
It's fine.

1398
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,560
Next one's called, three, two, one.

1399
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,200
Three, two, one, go.

1400
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:02,680
Ben, you absolute lazy fucktard.

1401
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:05,880
Where the hell is Son of True 102?

1402
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:10,120
If you don't give it to me soon, you lazy fucking cunt.

1403
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:14,840
I swear to God, I will break into your house and suck you off in your sleep.

1404
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,440
Well, I explained why you didn't wake up for so long.

1405
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:21,800
You're just so exhausted.

1406
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:25,240
You better not make the thing then.

1407
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:25,880
If you want to get sucked off.

1408
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:26,920
I'd better not.

1409
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:31,800
Oh, I certainly wouldn't want anyone to suck my God.

1410
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,920
That would be, that would just be terrible.

1411
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:38,920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, suck, but you missed your window of opportunity.

1412
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:42,200
Ben just got his new tablet in, so now he has no excuse to not be drawing.

1413
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:48,280
In fact, I will, I will say, um, on the other hand, though, maybe you'll want to procrastinate on

1414
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:51,160
drawing now that you have the ability to do it and you'll start editing.

1415
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:53,720
The Son of True lecture.

1416
01:54:55,240 --> 01:55:01,480
The thing, the thing that I'm working on now, my secret project is, um,

1417
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:03,960
this is the last thing that I want to do.

1418
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:07,720
And as soon as I'm done with it, the next thing on my list is to finish,

1419
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:12,120
finish the, uh, the, the Son of True 102 lecture.

1420
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:14,520
I could have done it at any point, but you know what?

1421
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:15,640
I fucking didn't.

1422
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,080
So get fucked.

1423
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,280
You just went to get your dick sucked.

1424
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:19,160
Played the long game.

1425
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:20,120
It's about to pay off.

1426
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:23,320
Fuck you, audience.

1427
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:24,040
Die.

1428
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:26,920
Um, uh, okay.

1429
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:31,400
Next one is called Tale of Sand slash the in call.

1430
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:34,120
Wait.

1431
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:34,520
Okay.

1432
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,200
Three, two, one, go.

1433
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,720
Somebody asked for more comic book recommendations.

1434
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:41,640
So here is more recommendations.

1435
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Tale of Sand is a script by Jim Henson.

1436
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,200
They never got made.

1437
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:56,040
So they turn it into a comic are very fully illustrated comic with a,

1438
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:59,320
really like a bare bones story.

1439
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:03,400
I started, I could take place in someone's subconscious, maybe,

1440
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:07,000
but it's, it's a fast read and it's delightful.

1441
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:13,080
And, uh, I don't know, take a cup of coffee and, and, and chug this one down.

1442
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:20,920
Uh, the in call, it's a sci-fi epic and it's illustrated by Moebius,

1443
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:23,160
one of the best illustrators of all time.

1444
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:28,360
He's French, uh, and Joe Dorovsky, who is, who makes movies,

1445
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:30,520
these weird spiritual movies.

1446
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:37,480
So, um, it really bleeds into the in call, the spiritualism.

1447
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:41,320
Um, and it's weird and it's funny.

1448
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:53,240
And it came before Star Wars, despite being also a sci-fi adventure tale with weird characters.

1449
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:55,880
It's so slowing down.

1450
01:56:55,880 --> 01:57:03,000
These need to be like one ch-ch-ch-ch-chow to you also.

1451
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:07,480
I'm looking at Tale of Sand, um, and it looks pretty cool, actually.

1452
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:12,040
And yeah, I see it's The Lost Greenplay by Jim Henson and Jerry, Jerry Jewel.

1453
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,320
Um, looks nice.

1454
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:17,480
Isn't Jim Henson the Muppet Man?

1455
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:19,320
Yeah.

1456
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:21,400
Yeah, Jim Henson the Muppet Man.

1457
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:23,720
Who lives on Drury Lane.

1458
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:29,240
They were like, they were like, uh, they were like, hey Jims, thanks for this script,

1459
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:31,800
but we're not gonna make a fucking movie about it.

1460
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,320
So, uh, get fucked.

1461
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:33,800
It's just too cool.

1462
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,080
We'll give it to some idiot.

1463
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,760
We'll give it to some sucker and he'll draw it instead.

1464
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,360
You nerd.

1465
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:42,200
That's what I would do.

1466
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:49,720
And, uh, I don't know, fucking thanks for the comic recommendations, I guess.

1467
01:57:51,000 --> 01:58:00,680
Next one is called Captain Max Nezbit to the care of CaptainPatrion.comS

1468
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,160
Oh, wait a minute.

1469
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,120
What is happening?

1470
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:07,560
Didn't, did this guy, okay, never mind.

1471
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,960
This guy made a shitty voicemail last, last week.

1472
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:12,120
Let's see, let's see if he can redeem himself.

1473
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:13,720
Three, two, one, go.

1474
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:15,480
Yeah.

1475
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:16,680
Ha ha ha ha.

1476
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:20,040
Patreon.com slash Ben Saint.

1477
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:26,520
You've done me a great disunner by shunning my voicemail on a previous episode of the

1478
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:28,360
Die Max Nezbit, you fuck.

1479
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,240
Ask a better question next time.

1480
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:37,800
You will never hear the tale of how I became a more interesting character or how I came to pirate

1481
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:41,560
a frigate of tea guys and tea boys.

1482
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:48,040
You'll also never know the secret to eternal heterosexuality or how we came to acquire it

1483
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:49,880
at the bottom of the ocean.

1484
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:52,200
You'll never find the treasure.

1485
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:52,920
Fire.

1486
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:59,960
Ben Saint, this is my message to you.

1487
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:04,920
Your heart tightly fit to a captainship you've got.

1488
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:10,840
By happenstance, if you've ship crossed your path, you'd be killed.

1489
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:11,240
Hold.

1490
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:18,760
There's no ship's diligence, but in the hippo girl, she's old in rickety ship and she's

1491
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:20,680
limp led to nautical miles.

1492
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:23,720
I'd hate to see her go down to the poor sailing.

1493
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:28,440
I like the idea to crowdsource half your content with no checks of a quality.

1494
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:36,840
So ship up Ben Saint or else my transship will transfer some cannons into the side of your

1495
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:40,440
YouTube channel and bring her to the bottom of the sea.

1496
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:42,360
That would be terrible.

1497
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:43,800
Yeah.

1498
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:50,760
You know, say what you like about Max Nesbitt, but he really does bring the enthusiasm.

1499
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:54,040
I like how crazy he is.

1500
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:01,000
Reminds me of Spongebob's Pirates a little bit.

1501
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:07,560
He's damn and that's, I love Spongebob.

1502
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:10,840
You know, as a millennial, I love Spongebob in my opinion.

1503
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:12,520
It's a good program.

1504
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:16,840
And we can, and that's something we can all agree on.

1505
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:17,160
Okay.

1506
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:23,240
Sorry, I'll never get to hear the tale of whatever you were just talking about.

1507
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:31,160
Next one is called the actual best Pokemon game.

1508
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:33,960
Give me a second here.

1509
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,160
Please start play.

1510
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:35,560
Okay.

1511
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:37,240
Three, two, one, go.

1512
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:42,120
You guys are sleeping on the actual best Pokemon game, HeartGold and SoulsFilver.

1513
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:48,360
Like for one, you know, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl had HP bars made of platinum.

1514
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:51,880
They sped up the HP so it actually goes down pretty fast.

1515
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:59,000
Like in Ruby and Sapphire, you can have your Pokemon follow you around and it's right,

1516
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,000
you know, just walls behind you as you run around the area.

1517
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,680
I don't even use the bike in that game just so I can have my Pokemon run around.

1518
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:14,360
And to compliment that they can toggle running shoes on and off so that you didn't have to hold

1519
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:16,280
the B button to run all the time.

1520
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:22,200
And some features that just didn't make it back in later games like that.

1521
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:25,880
It's fucking red and you guys need to check it out.

1522
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:30,920
I'm a little bit baffled that he thinks we don't know about HeartGold and SoulsFilver.

1523
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:33,080
I mean, he's right.

1524
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:35,000
It is one of my favorite games.

1525
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,200
Yeah, even I, a person who hates Pokemon, have heard that that is like really good.

1526
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:43,560
It's because Gen2 was the best gen.

1527
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,240
So when they remade it, it just got better.

1528
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:54,200
You know, I've, Pokemon Challenges has redpilled me recently that Gen2 is actually not,

1529
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:55,640
it's not that good.

1530
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:58,040
Gen2 is not as good as everyone says it is.

1531
02:01:58,040 --> 02:01:59,160
It's hard to disagree.

1532
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:02,440
HeartGold and SoulsFilver is a good remake.

1533
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:05,480
I think HeartGold and SoulsFilver is probably the best remake in the series.

1534
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:09,320
Black and White 2 is still the, is still the best game.

1535
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:10,360
It's the best in the series.

1536
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:15,320
But everybody loved in Black and White, or not in Black, in HeartGold and SoulsFilver,

1537
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:18,280
the following Pokemon that you could have them follow you around.

1538
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:20,120
Everybody loved that.

1539
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:25,320
And that's one thing they just put in that one remake and never put in any other game ever again.

1540
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,840
Just to mock us, I assume.

1541
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:29,400
Game Freak.

1542
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:30,280
Just because they hate us.

1543
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,160
They're a bunch of freaks.

1544
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,040
They put in their name.

1545
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,360
They're, they're demons.

1546
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:35,640
They're monsters and I hate them.

1547
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:39,480
I mean, yeah, it's got that and everyone likes it.

1548
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:42,440
And it's the only game you can do that in for some reason.

1549
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:44,120
So, you know, that's pretty cool.

1550
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:45,800
That really is stupid.

1551
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:51,400
I've always like, in the sun and moon where it's like, oh, you could write Pokemon,

1552
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:52,920
but I don't have these specific ones.

1553
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:56,600
No, you can't just have your Pokemon there.

1554
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:58,600
It's not like they have 3D models or anything.

1555
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:03,960
Everybody, yeah, it's not, it's not, it's definitely not like they have like 3D

1556
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:06,360
models of these Pokemon running.

1557
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:13,800
They fucking, everybody, everybody defended ride Pokemon in sun and moon.

1558
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:14,760
And I hate it.

1559
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:16,120
It's, it's terrible.

1560
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:21,080
It's so shit that you, you don't even ride your own fucking Pokemon around.

1561
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:25,320
You ride some other tourists that you're like renting so bad.

1562
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:25,880
Cringe.

1563
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:27,400
Is it like that in some sort?

1564
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,760
Is it like that in Sword and Shield?

1565
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:33,160
Yeah, you just have like a taxi service with the, uh...

1566
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:33,800
The crow?

1567
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:35,000
Corvik Knight and stuff.

1568
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,600
Ravencroft.

1569
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:38,200
Corvik.

1570
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:40,440
Corvik Knight is a good, is a great Pokemon.

1571
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:40,600
Corvik Knight is incredible.

1572
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,800
But it really sucks.

1573
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:45,640
That really sucks so fucking bad.

1574
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:51,080
I hate it and it sucks and it's bad and it's terrible.

1575
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:57,720
At least, you know, but it's so, like in fucking Pokemon, in Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee,

1576
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:01,640
they give you, they let you, they actually let you ride your Pokemon around.

1577
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:04,440
And then you, and then they take that away again in Sword and Shield.

1578
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:06,040
It's almost like-

1579
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:07,400
Why do they just give you something good?

1580
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:08,200
There's no idea what they're doing over there.

1581
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:11,640
And then they just, they just take, no, they do, they do, that's the thing.

1582
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,080
They do know what they're doing though.

1583
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:14,440
They do this on purpose.

1584
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:20,040
They literally, they literally add features that people want in one game and then take them away.

1585
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:23,400
So that like old games never become obsolete by the new ones.

1586
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:24,600
I think that's why.

1587
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:29,080
It's cause it's like, oh, if you want a game where you can ride your Pokemon around,

1588
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:31,960
you have to play Let's Go Eevee and Let's Go Pikachu.

1589
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:34,760
If they, if they just kept all the good features in every game,

1590
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:38,600
then the new games would just be objectively better than the old ones.

1591
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:40,760
And people would only play the new ones.

1592
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:41,480
I don't know.

1593
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:44,840
Maybe that's crazy, but I can't think of any other reason why they would do it like this.

1594
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:47,560
There really isn't any other reason.

1595
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:52,760
I think it's, but I, it feels strange that they would even think about that.

1596
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:57,560
Like games are made, like they always know.

1597
02:04:57,560 --> 02:05:01,640
The reason they make new games all the time is because they know that the old games stop selling.

1598
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:08,920
It's like, why would they try to future proof a game for sale that is like,

1599
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:13,000
that they'd know it's not going to sell anyway, because there's new ones to make.

1600
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:21,560
Yeah, yeah, um, I, it's kind of, yeah, it's true.

1601
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:22,920
No, maybe that doesn't make any sense.

1602
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:28,360
Cause like the new, they make, like they make all their money on like the sales of the new games.

1603
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:30,600
It's not like they're making bank selling old games.

1604
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:32,520
So maybe that's like a stupid theory.

1605
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:37,160
But like, if it's, if not for that reason, then I genuinely don't understand why it seems like

1606
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:42,680
they deliberately just like put good features in and then, and then just ruin them and take them out.

1607
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:43,640
And forget about them.

1608
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:48,760
To be a Japanese fly on the wall in those board meetings.

1609
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:54,520
They put the fucking, they put like the ability to ride any Pokemon in, let's go.

1610
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:56,200
And then they just took it away.

1611
02:05:56,840 --> 02:05:57,400
And why?

1612
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:02,440
Why can't I just ride a, you can have a Pokemon follow you, right?

1613
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:05,320
But only on like the Isle of Armor, I think.

1614
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,160
And why?

1615
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:08,200
Why is it like that?

1616
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:09,880
Why is it like that?

1617
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:16,280
Maybe they're, they're stringing people along on the off chance, on the hope that eventually

1618
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:20,040
a really good Pokemon game will come out that has all the good features that people like.

1619
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,960
And you know, they get them to buy it based on that.

1620
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:26,680
But they'll never actually, but they'll never actually make that game

1621
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:29,960
because they just, they throw features away.

1622
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:34,440
Even ones people like, everybody likes that in HeartGold SoulSilver, you could have your,

1623
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:36,280
you could have your Pokemon follow you.

1624
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:39,880
And then they kind of put it in Sword and Shield, but only in the DLC.

1625
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:43,640
Is it just because Sword and Shield was rushed?

1626
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:44,840
Is that why?

1627
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:46,920
I think they just know they don't have to try.

1628
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:49,240
Because like they made a bajillion, zillion dollars anyway.

1629
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:50,760
So like, why do you do anything?

1630
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:56,440
Yeah, I would attribute it more to like, just not thinking like the people at the top,

1631
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:00,760
making the decisions are like, I don't know if I can put Pokemon in there or something.

1632
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:05,160
It can't, it can't be that they don't know what they're doing.

1633
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:05,720
It can't be.

1634
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:07,880
I feel like they have to just not care.

1635
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:08,280
I feel it.

1636
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:14,040
Well, Pokemon's just a gargantuan like media property, but like a lot of it is,

1637
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:16,840
is not the games so much.

1638
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:20,920
So I feel like whoever's developing the games might not have enough of a say to like,

1639
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:23,480
make a good Pokemon game.

1640
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:26,360
Well, but like, all right.

1641
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:29,480
There might be people in the company who want to do this stuff, but like,

1642
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:31,640
they can't do it for some reason.

1643
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:33,240
And it's stupid.

1644
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:38,760
The guys in suits are the ones that like decide, that like produce the game,

1645
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:41,480
but like they're not personally in charge of like designing it.

1646
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:45,640
Like they, they have like people that are working on the game that presumably like,

1647
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:47,720
know what they're doing to some extent.

1648
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:50,040
I would think that even if the executives are not like,

1649
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:53,560
smoking their cigar and being like, hmm, yeah, see, we got to keep this,

1650
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:57,240
this next Pokemon game is going to be, we really, we really care about quality.

1651
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:57,400
Hmm.

1652
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:59,160
Keep all these features in that everybody likes.

1653
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:02,040
So yeah, we want, like they, like they don't care.

1654
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:07,160
But like you would think that the people who are actually making the game would be like,

1655
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:11,080
okay, people liked that you could do this in another game.

1656
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:13,160
So we should let you keep being able to do that.

1657
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:17,720
Do you think that like someone in the, in the chain of command,

1658
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:20,520
I really don't want to think that be responsible for this.

1659
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:29,320
I guess it really just could be that they're just incompetent and stupid, the people making it.

1660
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:31,960
I don't want to believe that because I don't know.

1661
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:35,160
And it feels like mean because I don't, I don't, I don't believe it.

1662
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:37,080
I don't believe that it could be by accident.

1663
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:39,240
Yeah.

1664
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:45,000
Like it must, it's, it's either just that it simply doesn't matter to them

1665
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:51,320
or they are doing it deliberately with some sort of agenda because it's, it's, it's,

1666
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:53,960
there's like such a consistent pattern there.

1667
02:08:54,360 --> 02:09:01,320
Okay, what was that game that came out that was or it was in early access?

1668
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:01,800
I don't know.

1669
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:07,240
The, the Pokemon ish similar game that had stuff in it that was pretty good.

1670
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:11,960
Oh, Temtem?

1671
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:12,600
Temtem.

1672
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:12,920
Yeah.

1673
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:15,320
I never, I never played it.

1674
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,240
It looked cool.

1675
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:20,520
It wasn't, it was an MMO, right?

1676
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:21,480
You could like.

1677
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,680
Yeah, it was on the line.

1678
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:24,520
You could see other people and fight them.

1679
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:26,200
God, that looks, that looks cool.

1680
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:27,240
That's a cool idea.

1681
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:29,480
Yeah, I don't know.

1682
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:33,400
I had friends that were playing it in like early access or whatever.

1683
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:37,240
Looked, looked pretty neat.

1684
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:39,800
Okay.

1685
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:45,240
Next voicemail is called is cross desktop wallpapers.

1686
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:47,240
Three, two, one, go.

1687
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:51,240
What is the backstory to your current desktop wallpaper?

1688
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:53,160
I just watched Akira for the first time.

1689
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:57,160
So I got a cool moving desktop wallpaper of Shotaro Kaneda.

1690
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,680
He's sitting on his throne.

1691
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:02,840
He's looking all cool, like he's got a bunch of energy around him.

1692
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:05,800
Some cool thunder and electricity and stuff.

1693
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:06,680
Looks awesome.

1694
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:07,480
What about you guys?

1695
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:14,680
My desktop wallpaper is an RFCK wallpaper.

1696
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:18,600
It's, it's, it's cop, it says cop killers and it has the original,

1697
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:26,120
it has the original version of the cop killer logo as it was drawn by Slimes who created it.

1698
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:30,360
And it's got a drawing of me next to it also by Slimes.

1699
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:32,920
And I just think it looks really cool and aesthetic and I have,

1700
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:37,880
this has been my wallpaper like for like a year and a half, I think it's nice.

1701
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:39,240
It's nice and it's black.

1702
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:41,640
So it's easy to see stuff on it.

1703
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:43,800
And I think that's good.

1704
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:45,000
Tom just left the call.

1705
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,800
Tom was so bored by my explanation of my desktop wallpaper.

1706
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:48,600
He left the call.

1707
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:49,960
Yeah.

1708
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:53,400
Well, I got, I got a desktop wallpaper for you.

1709
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:59,960
It's, it's something I commissioned from Kazi and it's Riska and there she is.

1710
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:02,280
She's Riska in the old web.

1711
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:07,080
Oh, that's pretty, that's pretty good, I guess.

1712
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:10,040
That's a pretty good thing you got there.

1713
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:13,080
Good job.

1714
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,320
I like buying commissions.

1715
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:19,560
It's pretty fun to get, to get a little something.

1716
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,680
I don't know why.

1717
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:25,560
Well, I do know why, but I always ask the artists to like put some sort of a

1718
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:31,320
reference into something I've in, you know, some sort of me reference.

1719
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:34,920
So that there's no, there's no way people can free boot it and just think it's just

1720
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:38,440
Riska because it's just, it's Riska, but she's got punk there as well.

1721
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:39,720
Yeah.

1722
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,800
So it's tied to me forever.

1723
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:48,840
Damn it, how do I, I want to like, I want to post my desktop, but I like,

1724
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:53,640
I don't know where the file is saved that it's like referencing.

1725
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:57,880
I guess I'll have to find it and I'll post it so Eleazar can, can show it.

1726
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:01,160
Man, Kazi's so good.

1727
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:02,840
Look at that.

1728
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:03,400
Look at that.

1729
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:06,200
Look at that sky and shit.

1730
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:06,840
I don't know.

1731
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:09,800
What a, what a fucking, what a fucking masterpiece.

1732
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:11,320
Yeah.

1733
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:13,000
Fuck yeah.

1734
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,120
Where did Tom go?

1735
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:14,680
The Tom.

1736
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,640
I hope he's computed.

1737
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:18,520
I hope he didn't die and lose all his audio.

1738
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:20,680
That would be pretty fucking tragic.

1739
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:23,560
Oh, and he started the episode.

1740
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:29,240
Can you imagine though, like, can you imagine if that happened?

1741
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,120
I guess I can imagine.

1742
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:37,240
He did, he was, it was the, it was the solo Tom cast for a while until I bombed

1743
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:38,280
it and ruined everything.

1744
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:44,840
Okay. Well, we got one more voicemail to go and it's called,

1745
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:49,080
and it's called, wait, funny joke two.

1746
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,960
Yes. It's called funny joke two.

1747
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:52,280
Sorry.

1748
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:53,880
It's doing the thing again.

1749
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:59,560
We're please, please, please just play the fucking voicemail.

1750
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:01,320
I don't know what's wrong with my computer today.

1751
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:02,600
It's like particularly shit.

1752
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:03,720
All right.

1753
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,120
I'm ready.

1754
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:07,800
Funny joke two, three, two, one, go.

1755
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:11,960
Fanti fa, more like fa.

1756
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:21,320
You see, cause they say they're against fascism, but actually.

1757
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:24,120
Cool. Nice. Got them.

1758
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:30,840
Well, we did it.

1759
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:33,080
They're the real fascists because they don't,

1760
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:37,000
because they'll punch people for being racist.

1761
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:40,040
Well, I said five.

1762
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:41,240
That's the joke.

1763
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:46,120
Like B, like A Tifa and B Tifa, C Tifa.

1764
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:47,160
What?

1765
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:48,680
Never mind.

1766
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:49,320
I know.

1767
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:51,720
I got it wrong because I heard it wrong.

1768
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:53,400
I didn't get it.

1769
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:54,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

1770
02:13:56,360 --> 02:13:58,920
I'm, I'm developmentally challenged.

1771
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:00,600
I'm like stupid or whatever.

1772
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:03,000
That's true.

1773
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:04,600
That's true.

1774
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:05,160
True enough.

1775
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:11,160
I can't believe everything is crumbling around us.

1776
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:14,120
I can't believe Tom is dead too.

1777
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:16,760
And now I'm, now I'm wondering if maybe he didn't,

1778
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:18,920
like his computer died and his audio is lost.

1779
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,840
And this episode will never see the light of day.

1780
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:23,160
How fucking tragic would that be?

1781
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:26,600
Well, post in the comments how tragic that would be.

1782
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:29,960
If you're, if you're hearing this episode now,

1783
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:32,520
then, then I suppose that probably didn't happen.

1784
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:35,560
But so fingers crossed that you do in fact,

1785
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:40,600
listen, hear this on, on January 1st, 2021.

1786
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:43,320
Happy 2021, every, every pony.

1787
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:44,840
We made it.

1788
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:47,080
Hey, what's your new year's resolution?

1789
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:49,000
Me?

1790
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:49,320
Yeah.

1791
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:51,400
You're gonna kill fat Ben.

1792
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:53,560
Oh, good one.

1793
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:55,960
I'm gonna kill myself.

1794
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:57,080
What about you?

1795
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:58,120
Uh, I don't know.

1796
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:01,720
I'm gonna kill myself.

1797
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:05,160
Nice, nice.

1798
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:10,120
Hey everyone, I'm sorry about this episode.

1799
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:11,560
I'm sorry about this show.

1800
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:13,640
I'm sorry about me.

1801
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:17,000
I'm sorry for who I am and the things that I do.

1802
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:20,760
I can't believe fat Ben is such an apologist.

1803
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:27,000
Yeah, he's a fat Ben is a fat Ben apologist.

1804
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,200
And that's the worst thing about him is that he thinks it's okay.

1805
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:30,680
Oh, I see.

1806
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:32,120
He thinks what he's doing is fine.

1807
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:33,480
I see Tom going online.

1808
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:34,680
Is he back?

1809
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:38,520
Oh my God, Tom, Tom.

1810
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:39,720
Yeah.

1811
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:40,600
What happened?

1812
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:41,640
My whole, Tom, what happened?

1813
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:43,080
My whole, my whole computer crashed.

1814
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:44,760
Really?

1815
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:45,000
Yeah.

1816
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,320
The whole thing just besotted and died.

1817
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:48,600
But I was, what about your audio?

1818
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:50,040
I was able to recover the audio.

1819
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:50,600
Thank God.

1820
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:51,800
Oh my God.

1821
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:52,520
Yes.

1822
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:54,680
Yes, Tom, you're a genius, Tom.

1823
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:56,520
It's a, it's a January 1st miracle.

1824
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:01,400
It's a, it's, it's a fucking PCP 2021 miracle.

1825
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:02,920
This year is looking up, baby.

1826
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:06,200
Oh my God, what a fucking nightmare.

1827
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:09,000
Everything was at the bottom and now we're here.

1828
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:12,120
We've ascended to the top of that peak.

1829
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:16,520
Hell, yes.

1830
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:20,920
Hey, we, we already listened to the last voicemail, a spoiler alert.

1831
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:21,720
It sucked.

1832
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:22,360
So, you know.

1833
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:24,040
Whoa, big, big surprise there.

1834
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:26,520
So don't even worry about it.

1835
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:28,200
It's all good.

1836
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:31,480
So, Tom, I don't know.

1837
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:34,760
Real quick, what's your new year resolution?

1838
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:37,480
4k.

1839
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:43,240
No, but try, try and just make more shit.

1840
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:45,720
Make, make more shit, make more shit consistent.

1841
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:49,000
That's pretty good.

1842
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:49,960
That's pretty good.

1843
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:52,600
If you chew your food, you'll make more consistent shit.

1844
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:53,880
Are you sure?

1845
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:59,160
I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try and get back to you.

1846
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:05,000
I'm, I'm about halfway through this horrible, horrible sea ice and coke.

1847
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,360
Why, why did you continue to do it?

1848
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:10,840
Why are you, I don't know, I started, I started doing a thing.

1849
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:12,040
So I have to finish it.

1850
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:14,680
That's just, that's called having honor.

1851
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:16,520
Ben, you two wouldn't know anything about that.

1852
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:19,240
You don't, you don't finish anything.

1853
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:23,560
You two wouldn't, what the fuck are you talking about?

1854
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:26,920
You know, I finish everything eventually.

1855
02:17:27,880 --> 02:17:32,680
You finish that drink faster than you finished any project in the last 100 years.

1856
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:37,880
Um, you're gonna, you're gonna eat those words because the thing,

1857
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:41,800
my secret project is going to be done before you even know it,

1858
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:46,760
and everyone will be in awe of its perfection and its majesty.

1859
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:50,760
Yeah, so suck it.

1860
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:52,920
Dumbass.

1861
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:57,160
Okay, uh, are we done?

1862
02:17:57,800 --> 02:17:58,440
I guess.

1863
02:17:58,440 --> 02:17:59,320
Are we, are we finished?

1864
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:00,680
Are we finished here?

1865
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:01,480
Have we set our piece?

1866
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:05,320
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators, if we haven't already said that.

1867
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:06,360
Give us money.

1868
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:08,360
Oh yes, bonus episode.

1869
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:10,680
Is there a bonus episode?

1870
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:13,000
Do we already, do we record a bonus episode this month?

1871
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,200
We did, right?

1872
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:15,000
I think we did.

1873
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,840
We did, I think, with Game is Tavern.

1874
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:19,080
Yes, we did another.

1875
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:23,240
Right, we did another commentary track.

1876
02:18:23,240 --> 02:18:29,560
We had Gamer's Tavern on to record a commentary retrospective on Gamer's Tavern's original

1877
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:33,000
cameo for some reason.

1878
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,120
We did, we did it.

1879
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:40,360
We really did, uh, based, um, yeah, Patreon.

1880
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:45,800
And send us a voicemail at speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.

1881
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:49,560
Your New Year's resolution should be to make voicemails that don't suck.

1882
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:51,800
That's right.

1883
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:53,240
That's right, it really should.

1884
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:54,520
But I know you won't do it.

1885
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:55,320
You won't.

1886
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:57,720
I, you, you, you don't, you don't have the courage.

1887
02:18:57,720 --> 02:18:59,240
It'll be like going to the gym.

1888
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:02,520
There'll be a bunch of good stuff in January than the rest of them the year.

1889
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:03,640
Just be terrible again.

1890
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:09,960
There'll be one week, one week of quality voicemails before everything just degenerates

1891
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:11,720
back to its natural state.

1892
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:17,320
You, you, you know the thing, the CGP gray thing where he's like, don't have a New

1893
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:20,200
Year's resolution and have a theme for the year.

1894
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:21,880
You know that?

1895
02:19:22,680 --> 02:19:23,160
Yeah.

1896
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:26,360
I've thought really hard about it and I've watched that video multiple times and I

1897
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:28,280
don't get how you're supposed to do it.

1898
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:28,920
I don't get it.

1899
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:32,680
It's about, I think it's about like having a system instead of a goal.

1900
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:39,720
Like a goal is a tangible finite thing that it's like a binary like win or fail state

1901
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:44,680
where a system is like a structure that continues to go on in perpetuity.

1902
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:46,120
So you're always working towards it.

1903
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:52,840
I just can't decide what the theme is because I don't know what I want to be doing.

1904
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:55,480
Get your New Year's resolution.

1905
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:01,000
If your New Year's resolution was to make a good voicemail and you made a bad voicemail,

1906
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:01,960
you failed.

1907
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:06,920
But if your theme is make good voicemails, then you might make one voicemail that's

1908
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:09,240
bad, but then you just got to try again.

1909
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:10,280
Exactly.

1910
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:13,080
It's about the next one can be good.

1911
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:15,400
It's a goal is a finite game.

1912
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:16,840
A system is an infinite game.

1913
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:21,000
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

1914
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:29,240
Well, let your theme of this year be discovery and figuring out what it is you actually want to do.

1915
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:32,360
Like that discovery.

1916
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:33,880
That Duff Punk album.

1917
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,280
Yeah, the theme of this, the theme of my year is courage.

1918
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:40,040
And honor.

1919
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:41,000
And integrity.

1920
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:42,440
And justice.

1921
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:43,720
And return scroll.

1922
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:47,000
And return scroll.

1923
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,960
No, no, definitely not.

1924
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:53,720
Returning the scroll is the one thing I won't be doing.

1925
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:57,960
Ben's using the scroll as his coaster for his drink he's nursing right now.

1926
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:01,880
For my terrible, terrible drink that I hate.

1927
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:06,760
Almost as much as I hate the scroll, yet I won't let it go.

1928
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:09,100
Mmm.

1929
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:10,380
Mmm.

1930
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:11,640
Oh, horrible.

1931
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:13,960
All right, is that it?

1932
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:14,460
That's it.

1933
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:16,360
We're done.

1934
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:17,800
We're done here, everybody.

1935
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:18,600
Goodbye.

1936
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:19,640
Thanks for listening.

1937
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:20,920
Happy 2020.

1938
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:21,720
See you next week.

1939
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:24,680
See you in fucking hell, bitches.

1940
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:27,640
Bye.

1941
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:40,280
You
