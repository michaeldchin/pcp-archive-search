00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,840
Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,160
I am the best guy ever, and today we are joined by Ben Oliver.

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,400
Patreon.com slash Polystation 2 Hippocrates.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Franchises more like French Isis am I right?

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,400
And here's Lethal Aurora Mage, speaking of terrorists.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Why do my introductions always get interrupted?

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
I don't know.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,400
The real terrorism is destroying intros.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,400
I feel Nate has a grudge against me.

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I didn't interrupt shit.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Don't blame me.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
It was not my fault.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I've been here for zero responsibility here.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Alright, now I'm in a bad mood.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I'm ready to fight.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
I'm ready to kill everybody today.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Let's fight.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Let's fight.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
Let's do it.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Listen up, team.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Today's episode is Franchises, subtitle, and how to ruin them.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,400
That is the overall theme that we're sticking with here.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,400
So there's a lot of franchises in recent years that have just gone to shit.

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,400
And we're here to kind of discuss why.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,400
What, if anything, can be done to avoid it for the ones that have survived,

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
the few that still remain.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
And I guess, you know, also to examine the other side of the coin,

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
see who's doing well these days.

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
So let's get into it.

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
What do you think, guys?

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Who's got an example?

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Who wants to start us?

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Wait, Urban Dictionary.

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Urban Dictionary, what have I done?

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
What have I done?

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Almost.

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Almost got away with it.

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
The PCP franchise was almost cleansed.

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
I have a horrible meme, but.

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Okay.

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
All right, Urban.

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,400
My friend, here is the definition of a franchise.

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Franchise, an entire series of the film.

44
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Wait, this doesn't have to be a film.

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,400
The original and all its subsequent sequels thereafter.

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
This is terrible.

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
No, what the fuck is this about?

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Of course it's terrible.

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
It's Urban Dictionary.

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Yeah.

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
I don't think this has ever been good.

52
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Have we ever had a good definition?

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
No, that's not true.

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Wait a minute.

55
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Wait a minute.

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Wait a minute.

57
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Okay.

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Oh, I get it.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Okay.

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Fourth definition of franchise.

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Franchise.

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Verb.

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
To get it in, to smooch, a.k.a. to have sex.

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
And here's the example.

65
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Did you franchise?

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Oh, I franchised last night.

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Hashtag sex, hashtag fuck, hashtag hookup, hashtag penis, hashtag smooch.

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,400
That's, I assume they mean that in like the fight club definition of franchising where

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Ed Norton's dad, like said, a bunch of families of which he was one.

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
And he's like, you know, like that, that sort of thing.

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
You with me?

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Yes.

73
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
You with me on that?

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
I understand.

75
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
But wow, I've never.

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
The thing about franchises.

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,400
The thing about franchises that I was going to talk about is that they sort of ruin certain

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
things within a franchise.

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Like if you've got like a series of video games, good games are overlooked or like harshly

80
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,400
judged if there are better games in the same franchise.

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Like the label brings down opinions on the things that are good because they're tied

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
to things that are better.

83
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,400
And then things that are bad are elevated because they're tied to things that are better

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
than them sometimes as well.

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
That's definitely true.

86
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
It's funny we're doing this topic when we are.

87
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Because our good friend Jesse Wood just made a video all about this topic concerning the

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
God of War series.

89
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
That's very true.

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,400
It was very, very topically relevant and everyone should watch it because it was fucking fantastic.

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
It was a great classic Jesse video that everyone should definitely watch.

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
But probably link the show notes below.

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
But if you like that, what was interesting about his video was that it was less.

94
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,400
I mean, that actually was about kind of how like how much more credit the God of War series

95
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,400
deserves than it's currently getting just due to a change of Zeitgeist.

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,400
And people endlessly spinning their wheels about like how games should be art and getting

97
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
all wrapped up and insecure about Roger Ebert's ghost.

98
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Like I feel like if the new God of War game wasn't a God of War game, people would not

99
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,400
be shitting on the old God of Wars because it's not connected by a franchise.

100
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
There's no reason to compare them.

101
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
I mean, it's just Jesse said.

102
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
They're just looking for an excuse to sound like this one's better.

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
I would.

105
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,400
I mean, as Jesse very well painted, people have simply just forgotten what happened or

106
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
never played a lot.

107
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Like you'll hear like game commenters today.

108
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Oh my God, I fucking hate these people.

109
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
They come out.

110
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
I mean, Jesse made a very, you know, we're just reiterating his case.

111
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
So go watch his video.

112
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
But it's just like they come out.

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
They're like, oh man, this is so much better than the character Kratos was way back in

114
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
the day.

115
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
It's like, oh, so you're experienced with it?

116
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
No, no, I haven't played any of them.

117
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Right.

118
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Yeah.

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,400
And then again, like Jesse points out in that video, like the whole, like you read the original

120
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,400
reviews for the OG God of War because I remember when it came out because I'm an old fart.

121
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,400
And I remember reading about it and like, oh man, Dave, you have to make the game and

122
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
all this shit.

123
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Everyone was like, this is like Devil May Cry with an incredibly good story.

124
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,400
That was like the elevator pitch for the OG God of War.

125
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
God of War One had a great story.

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Yeah.

127
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Better than Devil May Cry once.

128
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Definitely.

129
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Definitely.

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,400
He actually had like character motivation and depth and complexity, which, and everyone

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
was like, this is why this game is so good.

132
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
It has everything.

133
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
I feel a meme brewing.

134
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Oh, no.

135
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I feel a meme brewing.

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Wait, wait.

137
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Kratos is like, he's holding like his dead wife and daughter's body.

138
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,400
And he's like, it was supposed to be my job to fill your dark soul with war.

139
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
No, not light.

140
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,400
See, I made a twist on it because it's God of War, not God of Demon Cry.

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
That's my joke.

142
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Okay, it was a terrible joke.

143
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I'll take the paycheck.

144
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
I don't like it.

145
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
It was the worst.

146
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
But yeah, no, it was good.

147
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,400
It was a good video and it kind of is on point because a lot of the times the new stuff in

148
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,400
the franchise is automatically classified as the betterer by some people, especially in

149
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
games.

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,400
That's why we need remasters and stuff because like, well, the old stuff's too old.

151
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
We got to make it more accessible and newer.

152
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
It's disgusting.

153
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,400
It's very specific to video games, but like the whole graphics thing needing to be updated

154
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,400
for people to even think about giving a shit.

155
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
People think about that about movies to a degree as well, but yeah, it's mostly games

156
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
for sure.

157
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,400
But it's not really because like movies, I mean, I guess movies still always had like,

158
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
you know, they never really changed the frame rate or increased.

159
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
The only thing they increased was like, you can put things on Blu-rays now, but you can

160
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,400
still turn like old, what are the millimeters, like 100,000 millimeter film?

161
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
35.

162
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Right.

163
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
And also like put things in CGI now instead of like making puppets or stuff like that.

164
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
That's true.

165
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Yeah.

166
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
That's true.

167
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
I mean, you look at like old like like 60 sci-fi and stuff.

168
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
It's hard.

169
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Some people have a hard time like, you know, is the Gorn really that threatening?

170
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
It's like, come on.

171
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Well, that's just terrible acting.

172
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:22,400
I mean, you know, things like Citizen Kane, for example, like, I don't think people look

173
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,400
at that movie and think to themselves like, man, this looks dated because of the artistry

174
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
of the thing.

175
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,400
It like really like the just the cinematography and the clear, like, I've actually watched

176
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
this movie a lot.

177
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,400
So I'm not talking to my ass like people always do about like, oh, it's Citizen Kane.

178
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
It's so good.

179
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I actually have studied this film quite a bit and quite it really deserves all the praise

180
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
it gets.

181
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
And so like that's in an artistic way.

182
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,400
It stands up as opposed to, I mean, what I would argue about like, like a pixel based

183
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Final Fantasy or even one like a Final Fantasy 7 versus like the Final Fantasy 15 struggle

184
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
for photorealism.

185
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
I think it moves.

186
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Like the seven remake and stuff.

187
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Film just ages more gracefully than video games do.

188
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
And that's just because it's still real life.

189
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,400
You know, like you're still it's it's like a very low resolution recording of real life

190
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
versus, hey, look, it's like seven polygons with like a five.

191
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Well, image slapped on it.

192
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I'm pretty sure I'd still enjoy watching like the Back to the Future movies just as much

193
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
as I did when I was a kid.

194
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Yeah.

195
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Yeah.

196
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I mean, those are those like the special effects and those are actually pretty great

197
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
and hold up pretty well to this day.

198
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Like they invented a lot of effects for that time anyways.

199
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,400
I think the thing is like, like when people say movies are too old to watch them.

200
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I just realized there is definitely going to be a resurrection of the Back to the Future

201
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
series without question.

202
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Oh yeah.

203
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,400
With Marty, Marty is now going to be an old professor.

204
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
He'll be the professor.

205
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
He'll be old and be like, hello, I'm old and now I'm smart.

206
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Here I built another DeLorean.

207
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,400
That is probably the series that will be most fucked up by like reinvention and like doing

208
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
more because it's so reliant on time travel and like everything was really packaged in

209
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
those three movies.

210
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I can't wait for it to show up on Netflix in a year or two.

211
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Marta, she's too shaky, though, or whatever his name is.

212
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Frightened.

213
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,400
He's got the, he's got the shakes, whatever that's called.

214
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Another thing that's like just happened was that there was an announcement for a Thundercats.

215
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,400
We were just talking about this.

216
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,400
And it looks like every other cartoon out there at the moment.

217
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
It's literally Steven Universe.

218
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,400
It's Steven Universe Adventure Time, okay, KO, all of them.

219
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Can we say officially that Cal Arts has ruined cartoons?

220
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I mean, they have their legacy is it's too much.

221
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
It's simply too much.

222
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,400
I would say at this point, Cal Arts is a franchise that has been ruined.

223
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Oh shit.

224
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Yep.

225
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Okay, just, I just want to, I just want to say something like I really dislike the art

226
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
style.

227
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,400
I'll say that like even emotion is just like, I don't like it.

228
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,400
However, I don't want to knock the series out before I've even seen it because like it

229
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
could have like good writing or something.

230
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
I am only commenting.

231
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I completely do not care how good it is.

232
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
It is a reboot.

233
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm tired.

234
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm tired of things coming back.

235
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I hear Tom Slade Queen.

236
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I kill these fucking necromancers.

237
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
These skeletons stop coming back.

238
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I can't get through all the catacombs.

239
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I thought you liked skeletons.

240
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Like, we're not the target audience though, guys.

241
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
That's fine.

242
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Your opinion doesn't matter.

243
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
That's not fair to say.

244
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
My opinion is everything.

245
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I'm on the internet.

246
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
My opinion means everything.

247
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Well, actually, I was going to be more generous and say, I'm not judging the writing.

248
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm just judging the art style.

249
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
But I think there's, right, right, right.

250
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
We can separate those.

251
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I mean, after the really good 2011 reboot, how can you just turn around and turn it into

252
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
this?

253
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Was there a reboot in 2011?

254
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
It was amazingly good.

255
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Really?

256
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Wait.

257
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
So actually.

258
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Yeah, Fundercats.

259
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Was it the Japanese anime one or whatever?

260
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Japanese anime style.

261
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Yeah.

262
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
It was gorgeously animated.

263
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,400
It had amazing, dude, there was a super fucking amazing episode because it was mostly a continuous

264
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
storyline, but then they had short one-off episodes.

265
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,400
And there was one episode that was super cool, and it's been a while since I've watched it.

266
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
But it was about Lyno's all depressed and shit.

267
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
He's a sad boy because shit's going bad.

268
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:30,400
And he comes on this race of small little flower people, and they only have 24 hours to live.

269
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Their entire life is in 24 hours.

270
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,400
So he meets one of these characters as a newborn, and throughout the day, he sees him trying

271
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,400
to use his short little life to make a better impact for his people, and that reinvigorates

272
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
him to keep going forward and fighting.

273
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
And it's like the fucking sickest concept.

274
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
That sounds fucking incredible.

275
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
It's so good, dude.

276
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
It's fucking great.

277
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,400
And then they come out, they're like, what if we just made Teen Titans Go furry edition?

278
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
And I'm like, I'm so fucking angry.

279
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Hey, Teen Titans Go, I like more than this because it has an original art style.

280
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
I give it more credit.

281
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
The whole thing about, like, we're not the target audience.

282
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I don't...

283
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Aren't we, though?

284
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
No, well, I mean, kind of.

285
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
The target audience...

286
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
The new kids don't remember sending cats.

287
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
They don't have kids.

288
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,400
But it's also going to be like, hey, guys, remember how old you are?

289
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Now you can relive how old you are by thunder cats again.

290
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Yeah.

291
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Well, you know what I would say.

292
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Well, mage, you don't know that it's not a more mature show with an older audience in mind.

293
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
So maybe we should all wait.

294
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
And maybe you should die.

295
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,400
The thing about it, though, is that stuff like...

296
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
It's just...

297
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Ready Player One, Ready Player One, Thunder Cats, everything coming back,

298
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
it just makes me not like the things that they're originally attached to.

299
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm sick and tired of reboots and remakes and rehashes

300
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,400
and reintroductions of old things that I haven't experienced.

301
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
So maybe I have experience.

302
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,400
And it just makes me like, okay, now I will never want to look at Thunder Cats

303
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
because of this fucking shit.

304
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Everything that gets rebooted goes into a vault in my mind brain

305
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,400
where it's like, this is bad because it came back and I hate it

306
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,400
and I never want to see it and I hate everything associated with it.

307
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,400
And if I see anyone enjoying it, I'm just going to spit right in their eye.

308
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
I just want to say, I'm not describing your disappointment.

309
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,400
I fully agree. If someone took something I really liked when I was a kid

310
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
and rebooted into shit, I mean...

311
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
I have never seen it.

312
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Yeah, I haven't seen it either.

313
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
But the thing is, I guess it's just...

314
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Yeah, I'm also tired of the reboots.

315
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,400
If they wanted to do their completely own original weird cookie thing,

316
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
just do it with a new IP.

317
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Why do you have to reboot Thunder Cats and make this thing?

318
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Of course, people are not going to be happy.

319
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,400
And if your target audience is new kids that haven't seen the show before,

320
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
then just make an original show.

321
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
They're not going to care.

322
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

323
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Where did the reruns go?

324
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Reruns are so fucking easy and cheap.

325
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
You just do those, it's so much better.

326
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
You know, that is a really good point.

327
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Because this is all about making a safe bet

328
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
and trying to make more money off the franchise.

329
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Why even spend any money making a new show?

330
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Just put all the money where it actually matters,

331
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
where all the money comes from for these fucking shows anyway.

332
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Merchandise sales.

333
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Just re-air Thunder Cats 2011 and drop more merch.

334
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Or re-air the original, because everyone has memories of that.

335
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
But those are old and they look gay.

336
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,400
I feel weird in my penis and that's not good for me.

337
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
That's just the thing that gets me like,

338
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,400
oh, but all the Thunder Cats is in 4-3 resolution aspect ratio.

339
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
We can't air that.

340
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
That would be laughed out of town.

341
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll just kill you if you think about that.

342
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Just mirror the edges.

343
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Us YouTubers have figured out the solution for airing 4-3.

344
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
All you do is zoom in on another layer and blur it out.

345
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
So then you have a 16x9.

346
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Yeah, it works.

347
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,400
You could have a funny little side things,

348
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
pillars, drawn little side things.

349
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Just draw the Thunder Cats roar characters as your border

350
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
and then just air the original.

351
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Right. That could be the whole show.

352
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
It's in the border of a normal Thunder Cats episode.

353
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Just imagine, guys, remember,

354
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,400
just think about all the hilarious epic meme references.

355
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
There's going to be two the 80s into old cartoons

356
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
in this incredible new show, Thunder Cats War.

357
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Oh, it's going to be great.

358
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
I know that I'm reached.

359
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
I don't know. I haven't seen the show yet.

360
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,400
But I do feel that you can both, one, have fatigue for reboots

361
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,400
and two, also sincerely determine if a show is good or bad as it comes out.

362
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm sure.

363
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm sure you can.

364
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Like Teen Titans Go is like one of those things where people hate it

365
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,400
just because, oh, it's not the same as Teen Titans.

366
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
But it's actually okay and it's kind of fun.

367
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
No, no.

368
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Okay, like I like the original Teen Titans

369
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
and I wanted to give Teen Titans Go a shot

370
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
because when I first saw designs,

371
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
I kind of liked them.

372
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
They're cute and chibi sort of like, oh, that's neat kind of,

373
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
you know, that sort of thing.

374
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
It wasn't the same and I didn't expect it to be the same,

375
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
but I watched the show.

376
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
I watched several episodes

377
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
and I really didn't care for the humor, I guess.

378
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Sure.

379
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,400
A lot of it was very mean spirited and that's what I dislike.

380
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
I mean...

381
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
What? No.

382
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
What are you talking about?

383
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
What was mean spirited?

384
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I don't buy.

385
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,400
That episode with the pie, Mother May pie or something.

386
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
What's wrong with that?

387
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
I don't remember any mean spirited humor in that.

388
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I hated the song.

389
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Three of the Teen Titans got cooked into a pie

390
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,400
and then Cyborg and Beast Boy ate them.

391
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
But like, that was a joke.

392
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I don't like, I don't like, I didn't like it.

393
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I don't like that sort of humor.

394
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I understand it because it's funny, but for me personally,

395
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,400
I really didn't like the humor of the show

396
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,400
and because the show relies heavily, like solely on its humor,

397
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
I didn't like the show.

398
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Mostly you.

399
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Okay.

400
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Well, okay, fine.

401
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
The thing is the people that usually hate Teen Titans Go

402
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
hate it on a very surface level.

403
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
If you watched it and you didn't like it, then that's fine.

404
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,400
But most people, I think I've never given it a shot because

405
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,400
but, but what happened to my ones that I grew up with?

406
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Where did they go?

407
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Oh, yeah.

408
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
I feel like, same with the Powerpuff Girls reboot.

409
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
I also watched a few episodes because I wanted to see.

410
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,400
It's, I don't think I reached like the few episodes

411
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,400
that people were really, you know, talking about like the ones

412
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
with the twerking and whatnot.

413
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
But I've seen quite a few episodes.

414
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm sorry, did you say twerking?

415
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Yes, there was twerking in the Powerpuff Girls reboot.

416
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
What?

417
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Wait, wait.

418
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
The Powerpuff Girls of these like six year old children

419
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
and twerking.

420
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
What's the...

421
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
That was awful.

422
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
I haven't seen the show but I've seen bits of like,

423
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
this is how terrible this is.

424
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Yeah, I haven't seen, I haven't seen the show

425
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,400
but I think the context is like there's some sort of villain

426
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,400
maybe and they're like, then they're kind of drugged

427
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
and then like they twerk.

428
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

429
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
We're talking about drugged children twerking.

430
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
But like I'm just...

431
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
I'm just guessing that they're drugged

432
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
or like the illusion to being drugged.

433
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
What?

434
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Okay, alright.

435
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Nate, do you know there's a whole like conspiracy

436
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
in that show that one of the artists

437
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
where the show has a self-insert of himself

438
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
and maybe they're talking about himself.

439
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

440
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
No, no, no, no.

441
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Who's the love interest, blossoming right?

442
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
But guys, guys, guys, no, like it came out

443
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
and like the artists people were making a joke

444
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
and they made the character without the person

445
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
actually being aware so it was meant to be

446
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
as an inside joke.

447
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
He didn't do it himself.

448
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
So we all got pranked.

449
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Okay.

450
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Okay.

451
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,340
There's a ton of disdain.

452
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,480
It's interesting, we're talking about all these shows, right?

453
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,280
And they run the gamut of we don't know how good they are,

454
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,780
if they're good or they're not good.

455
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,880
But they're all symptoms of a terrible disease

456
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,320
that has infected popular culture,

457
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,060
which is it's much safer to just rehash

458
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,600
what we've already done than to dare go

459
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,200
into uncharted waters.

460
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,040
It's a serious question that'll have.

461
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,240
I just want to finish one when I started

462
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,080
with the pop-up girls.

463
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,960
Like, yeah, so I seen a bit,

464
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,760
it's not as terrible as people make it out to be,

465
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,120
however, it's still pretty bad.

466
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,440
I mean, I dislike it, that's my personal opinion.

467
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,600
Some people might find it good,

468
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,160
but it's not, it doesn't have that charm, I guess.

469
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,840
But it's really not like the end of the world, you know?

470
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,960
It's not the end of the world,

471
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,040
but like there's a reason people get so upset,

472
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,520
because as much as I don't agree with the people

473
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,240
who react badly to Teen Titans Go,

474
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,200
I totally get why they would have such a reaction

475
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,120
when it's a completely different sort of show,

476
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,720
but with the same name as the one that they remember,

477
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,960
which was, you know.

478
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,920
Yeah, but like now speaking about franchises

479
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,000
and being ruined and stuff,

480
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
well, it was Teen Titans Go,

481
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,240
as much as like people like to dislike it,

482
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,080
it hasn't ruined the franchise in terms of like business

483
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,240
and stuff, because apparently it's making a lot of money

484
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,200
for a scene.

485
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,880
However, with the pop-up girls,

486
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,360
it is ruined.

487
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,400
I think it is ruining the franchise

488
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,960
because it's not making a lot of money

489
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,720
and I'm not sure why they're still making it.

490
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,560
Well, okay.

491
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,080
I'm not sure, and I might be wrong,

492
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,880
maybe they are making a lot of money or enough money.

493
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,640
Here's a serious question on this front though.

494
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,320
Okay, so the Teen Titans like show,

495
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,400
like I never read, I know it's based on the comic books,

496
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,640
I never read them, so they're completely irrelevant to me.

497
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,160
And also Powerpuff Girls was like mostly like just a show.

498
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,920
I know it'd been, there was like an actual anime,

499
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,120
may have been stuff a while back,

500
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
but like it, they were mostly, they were what they were,

501
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,720
like the one show.

502
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,280
Okay, but like, so when we talk about ruining a franchise,

503
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,520
like for example, does it ruin the franchise

504
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,240
of Teen Titans to make Teen Titans go

505
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,120
when like, frankly, the series

506
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,200
simply would have remained dead without it?

507
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,560
All right, the way I see ruining franchise is that

508
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,920
it's, you can see it from like a money perspective,

509
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,960
in which case,

510
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,280
loads of terrible things are completely fine

511
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,800
because they make money

512
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,160
and the franchises aren't ruined in that sense.

513
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,080
But like the way I think about it is that

514
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,400
it's a personal thing.

515
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,560
If you feel like you're enjoyment or you're like it,

516
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,560
you know, something about one of the things

517
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,680
in a franchise spoiling the others in some way

518
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,800
and making you feel bad

519
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
when you think about the thing as a whole.

520
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,960
You know, like, oh man,

521
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,520
that would be the perfect series of movies

522
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,640
unless they, and you know,

523
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,840
that one right there ruins a lot of them.

524
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,760
Yeah, another thing I think is like

525
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,200
from the consumer perspective,

526
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,800
it's about the legacy of the show.

527
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,240
Teen Titans was very much beloved

528
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,280
and although people really, really wanted like

529
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,560
a sequel or a continuation or just, you know,

530
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,280
to finish the fucking series because it wasn't finished.

531
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,160
People remembered it fondly and they were very, you know,

532
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
and they liked it a lot,

533
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,880
but now whenever people think about Teen Titans,

534
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,480
they can't help but think about Teen Titans Go as well.

535
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,040
And the fondness just sort of like gets pushed it aside

536
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,200
and like the anger and the disappointment takes first place.

537
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,840
So the legacy of the series is now ruined

538
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,480
because Teen Titans Go exists.

539
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,840
Yeah, it's really gross how like something

540
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,840
that has fans and followers is like as long as it's,

541
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,720
you know, it has like people who regard it fondly.

542
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,920
As long as there's that, it will eventually be, you know,

543
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,640
exploited for money down the road unless you have an author

544
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,440
like the guy who made Calvin and Hobbes

545
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,760
who like explicitly forbade any adaptation of his work.

546
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,160
And so that is like super beloved

547
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,120
because no movie has come around

548
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,680
to fucking ruin it for everyone.

549
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,080
It's just perfect forever.

550
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,840
I mean, yeah, copyright expires in 80 years

551
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,920
and like some like fucking brain Najara

552
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,800
has been waiting since this little late 70s is like,

553
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,600
finally I can make my CTI Calvin and Hobbes movie.

554
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,160
Isn't that recently occurring for like The Catcher in the Rye?

555
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,640
I forget the name of the guy who wrote that.

556
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,080
I thought that happened like they were,

557
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,840
I know he expressly forbid the thing to happen

558
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
and I believe he's still alive.

559
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,160
I can't fucking remember his name, I'll tell you.

560
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,320
J.D. Salinger.

561
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
J.D. Salinger, that's the one.

562
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,400
I don't know, whatever, just throwing that out there.

563
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,960
Well, I mean, when I think about these questions

564
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,920
like legacy and stuff, that's a fair point.

565
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,840
But like there's two different ways

566
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,400
things can be ruined in my mind.

567
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Like Final Fantasy comes to mind a lot

568
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,280
and I'm sure I'll discuss that a bunch in this podcast.

569
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,040
But like, so there's two different things

570
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,240
going on with Final Fantasy.

571
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,840
One, there is the current constant ever changing

572
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,360
Final Fantasy series that itself like is still being developed

573
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,240
and like never stopped from like the 80s when it started.

574
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,960
So like you could definitely say

575
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,040
that like Final Fantasy as a series has been ruined

576
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,920
because they continue to put out, you know, like worse products.

577
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,080
I mean, I know a lot of people like 15,

578
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,520
like that doesn't even matter.

579
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,480
Like you can make a case along those lines.

580
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,640
But then just as one example,

581
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,320
there is the specifically Final Fantasy 7.

582
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,720
And so Final Fantasy 7 exists as one game

583
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,440
that came out at one time.

584
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,840
But then they made sequels and prequels

585
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,240
and side stories and a million different things

586
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,160
and books and visual novels and all kinds of crazy shit

587
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,200
as well as they are currently working

588
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
on the remake of the game.

589
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,960
So the game itself, like so the Final Fantasy series

590
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,080
is one franchise that you might consider ruined

591
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,560
by later games that are actually changing

592
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,320
what the Final Fantasy series actually is.

593
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,440
But Final Fantasy 7, it is what it is at that time.

594
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,400
You know, like if they updated it for like,

595
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,800
there's like a PC release or whatever,

596
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
there's updated stuff,

597
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,560
the remake will obviously be a huge change.

598
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,200
They've added lore with all the side games.

599
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,720
But that original game is what it is.

600
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,200
And it will never be different

601
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,560
as long as you have a copy and don't lose your fucking copy.

602
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm gonna protect mine like the fucking sacred tomb.

603
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,320
So like has the legacy of Final Fantasy 7 been ruined?

604
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Is like, I think the answer is like to the public, yes.

605
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,560
Because everybody thinks about like Zach Fair

606
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,480
and Crisis Core and the Turks and all these side stories.

607
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,320
All these other things.

608
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,480
To me, like if I was gonna define like what this would be,

609
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,200
like what like ruining a franchise is,

610
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,160
I think it's like either the erosion or negligence

611
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,920
of the artistic merit of a property.

612
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,320
I think that pretty much sums it up, you know,

613
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,360
like either through like continued like,

614
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,120
iterance, like the original idea that like

615
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,280
attractive people in the first place

616
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,160
gets kind of lost in the shuffle.

617
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,080
Or like it's just blatantly ignored

618
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,960
for a crazy like left turn.

619
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,160
Usually both of these are done with monetary hopes

620
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,520
from corporations and stuff who never really understood

621
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,760
the merit of the franchise to begin with.

622
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,160
You know what comes to mind for this though?

623
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,880
I think about like, if someone today says like,

624
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,520
I've heard about Final Fantasy 7,

625
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,260
let me get into that thing.

626
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Like that person will experience not what was intended

627
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,080
when the first game came out, you know?

628
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,880
Unless they start from the beginning.

629
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,760
If they start, but see, that's what I was gonna say.

630
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,400
I was gonna say that like for me,

631
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,240
as like an old fan of the series,

632
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,360
like what I do in my brain,

633
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,240
I've played almost every of the compilation games

634
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,120
and I'll play the remake, I'm sure too,

635
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,160
just to find out what's going on.

636
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,800
But like in my mind, I simply discard everything

637
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,200
that happened outside of the original game.

638
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,160
Now it's unfortunate because things like

639
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,760
Cloud's personality and because of how great

640
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,160
and interesting like a character Cloud is

641
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,080
and how nuanced and how amorphous he was

642
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,520
even in his old game.

643
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,240
It's given people like Nomura an excuse to depict him,

644
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,040
you know, in ways that I would argue

645
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,280
he should not have been depicted

646
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,520
in like subsequent games and prequels and stuff.

647
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,520
So like, I definitely can't help but have the character

648
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,720
as a monolith tainted in my own mind.

649
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,000
But if someone could just play the original game

650
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
and ignore everything that happens,

651
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,280
but the reason is how would they know to do that?

652
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,440
They wouldn't know to do that.

653
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,840
They had no fucking idea.

654
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,280
Yeah, I still, it's hard to like say

655
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,600
that a franchise can be like...

656
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,960
I've never played any of the Final Fantasy games, by the way.

657
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,800
Okay.

658
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,160
I just want to say, and I've been curious

659
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,440
about playing Final Fantasy 7 specifically,

660
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,560
but there was like a steam seal that I didn't take up

661
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,560
or didn't take advantage of of all the Final Fantasy games.

662
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,840
I really wanted to play like as many games as I could,

663
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,080
you know, in order to see what's up and stuff.

664
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,920
Okay.

665
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,400
Well, your boy Hippo did play it

666
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,240
and was just talking when you interrupted him.

667
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,040
So let's see what he is to say.

668
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,280
I've been waiting to say this for a while

669
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,520
because you were talking as well.

670
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,920
So I guess interruptions...

671
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,160
So let's just interrupt Hippo, not me.

672
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,480
That makes sense, that makes sense.

673
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,080
If you can't beat him, join him wagon

674
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,520
when it comes to interrupting people.

675
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,720
She's had enough of being interrupted

676
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,640
and dealing it back out.

677
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,560
This is all Nate's fault, let's agree.

678
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,600
Sure, I agree.

679
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,800
Gabe, what were you saying?

680
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,640
I forgot.

681
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,080
Well, any thoughts on the legacy of Final Fantasy VII

682
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,760
as someone who's recently played that game?

683
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,600
Oh, I remembered.

684
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,120
The idea, I think, I don't agree

685
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,160
that a franchise can be ruined for the public necessarily.

686
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,000
With education, they can figure out

687
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,360
what's good and bad probably.

688
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,600
That's probably true.

689
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,440
Yeah, because like...

690
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,280
But do they get that education?

691
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,880
If nobody plays the original Final Fantasy VII

692
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,160
in the way that it was intended again,

693
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,080
but they play like the remake and they like that.

694
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,560
There's an argument to be made

695
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,440
that they're not getting like the true experience

696
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,560
because maybe the remake is not as good.

697
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,320
I mean, it may be good, but we don't know...

698
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,000
No, no, no, why do you say it?

699
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
No, what I'm saying is that I think the franchiseness

700
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,240
of the fact that this is a remake of another thing,

701
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,080
but they're different, is what is the problem here,

702
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,000
because they may prefer on a base level,

703
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,800
human, like this is what I feel at the very core of my being.

704
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,040
They may prefer whatever the remake becomes

705
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,040
to the original game, but if they were not franchise connected,

706
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,160
they could just see them as two different things.

707
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,640
There's Final Fantasy VII, the game, it's an old thing.

708
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,360
And then there's this new thing that is not supposed

709
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,240
to replace it, but it is implicitly being a replacement

710
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,400
because of it sharing the name and being a remake,

711
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,320
which is why I think franchises like destroy the legacy

712
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,680
of things for people who come into them later,

713
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,720
unless they do a lot of research to,

714
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,640
unless they put in a lot of effort to sift through

715
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,640
all of the updated new things that have muddied the waters.

716
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,720
Okay, I wanna quickly say,

717
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,520
I've been playing Shin Megami Tensei,

718
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,480
and that's like all those balls franchise, I will say.

719
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,280
It's like older than Pokemon from my knowledge.

720
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,240
And like I played the fourth game

721
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,120
and I started playing the apocalypse.

722
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,520
And I did a lot of digging like with the history

723
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,960
of the Shin Megami Tensei because I wanted to know,

724
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,040
because it fascinated me, like something this old existed

725
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,960
and it just, I liked it.

726
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,880
And from my knowledge, the franchise was never

727
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,760
sort of ruined by any game.

728
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,800
And all the spinoffs were either mildly successful

729
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,240
or became persona, which like super successful.

730
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,960
So like, I think it's an example of a franchise

731
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,720
that's like hasn't been ruined yet,

732
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,400
despite it's very long lifespan.

733
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,240
And although I-

734
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,400
I know that some people, sorry.

735
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,600
Yeah, I know some people have been sort of complaining

736
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,160
about the newer games for some reasons, like, oh, they-

737
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,000
A lot of old school fans, don't they say that like,

738
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,280
they're mad that the focus has gone to like persona

739
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,040
and that like that side of the Shin Megami Tensei?

740
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,360
I've heard some degree of that.

741
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,960
At some point was, but then they revived Shin Megami Tensei

742
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
with Shin Megami Tensei 4 and the apocalypse

743
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,560
and there's gonna be a new Shin Megami Tensei on the Switch.

744
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,560
So it hasn't died and has actually has been sort of revived.

745
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,640
And a lot of people because of persona are turning,

746
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,520
you know, their focus on Shin Megami Tensei

747
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,560
because they want something of similar but not the same

748
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
like me because I started with,

749
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,160
I sort of started with Persona 4,

750
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,600
that MMO game that I talked about aside

751
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,720
because I wasn't even,

752
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,200
I didn't even know it was a franchise at that time.

753
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,960
Anywho, but like, yeah, I started with Persona,

754
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,400
I really liked Persona 4, I couldn't play Persona 5,

755
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,480
still can't, I want to, but yeah.

756
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,280
And instead I turned to Shin Megami Tensei

757
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,600
because it seemed like, you know, something I'd like.

758
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,040
At first I was sort of a little bit turned off

759
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,000
because of the, even in the fourth game,

760
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,400
which is pretty recent and Apocalypse also,

761
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,800
recent enough, I think,

762
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,400
but they still had like the sprites

763
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,160
rather than like 3D models and stuff.

764
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,560
And it sort of feel like very clunky

765
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,680
and sort of like bloated, not bloated,

766
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,240
but like very visually heavy, I guess,

767
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,520
not heavy, overloading, like, not sure how to say it.

768
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,720
Well, so are you saying that like,

769
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,320
what you're saying is that like the games

770
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,520
that some people might consider ruining something

771
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,440
actually can bring people into the fold

772
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,960
and expose them to, you know,

773
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,160
like aspects of the series

774
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,520
that maybe the hardcore fans would say,

775
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,120
like, is the real experience

776
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,160
or something along those lines?

777
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,960
No, I'm saying, no, what I was trying to say is just like,

778
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,600
originally I was sort of turned off by the graphics

779
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,200
that kind of looked very outdated,

780
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,040
but then I played the game

781
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,840
and I really liked the story and the setting

782
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,560
and the idea and the mechanic.

783
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,400
I think the heart of the Shin Megami Tensei

784
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,920
still lives on through its franchise,

785
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,480
the Persona thing aside,

786
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,120
it's become its own thing very much.

787
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,600
So it's like very different games.

788
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,720
Like, but I think Shin Megami Tensei

789
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,360
has always had that core sort of fight

790
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,600
between good and evil, but not like,

791
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,720
I mean, the demons and the angels

792
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,040
and the apocalypse happening

793
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,600
and like world going to hell.

794
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,720
It's always seemed to have had that theme.

795
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,000
I think originally started like on a small scale-ish,

796
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,320
now it's becoming bigger and bigger over time.

797
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,920
I'm not too certain because so many games,

798
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,280
but yeah, and it's just like,

799
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,800
I think it's still a good franchise

800
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,240
and although some people are grumbling

801
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,560
about the changes, however,

802
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,880
like you can't remake the exactly same game each time

803
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,640
whenever a new game is made,

804
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,320
changes are gonna happen.

805
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,280
And some changes I think are made for the better.

806
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,120
They're like sometimes-

807
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,920
But if the changes are bad,

808
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,760
then it's fair to criticize them, right?

809
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Oh yeah, that's fair.

810
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,760
I mean, but I haven't seen like legit criticism above,

811
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,720
like, oh, it's different than what I remember it to be.

812
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,040
I mean, there was one,

813
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,640
like there's like a legit one

814
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
that like the overall world map was very,

815
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,840
very confusing and hard to navigate on the fourth,

816
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,000
but they improved upon it on the fourth game, Apocalypse,

817
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,360
which was meant to be a DLC,

818
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,440
but it became its own thing.

819
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
It became too big to be just a DLC,

820
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,760
so they made a separate game out of it.

821
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,960
That's what I've heard anyway.

822
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,400
But yeah, my point is it's a good franchise

823
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,240
and I'm happy to experience it

824
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,080
and I'm happy to say that it hasn't gone to shit yet.

825
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,280
Hopefully it won't.

826
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,720
I don't like this idea

827
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,400
that I am like guilty of sometimes,

828
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,440
that if you don't like the new thing in a franchise,

829
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,640
you're a grumpy old man

830
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,800
and you're just looking back

831
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,160
in the nostalgia goggles and all that,

832
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,080
because I definitely have done that for a few things,

833
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,960
but I don't like the idea that it's okay to be that either.

834
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,000
Sometimes new things are just good and they're not for me,

835
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,840
but like I was saying,

836
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,000
it's like the franchise has kind of tricked me

837
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,640
into needing to have an opinion on it

838
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,800
because it's from something that I used to like,

839
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,680
which was different from a different time.

840
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,000
And now this new thing is coming around with the same name

841
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,200
and it's the new one and oh,

842
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,840
but it's made for a completely different generation of people

843
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,960
and I don't like it.

844
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,280
Do I criticize it?

845
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,320
Do I get mad?

846
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,880
I don't really know what to do sometimes.

847
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,600
Yeah, just like the God of War game

848
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,120
is just made for like modern gamers

849
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,560
and so they had to completely change the kind of game it was

850
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,120
because nobody likes action games anymore.

851
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,760
There's a case to be made that some things

852
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,680
are better than other things

853
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,480
in terms of like the thematic relevance of like,

854
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,560
the original game in every franchise

855
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,840
is usually the one that makes the most sense

856
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,560
with all the reasons for everything being put there.

857
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,000
And then everything after that is some kind of like muddying

858
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,960
of the general idea.

859
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,640
Like with the Dark Demon Blood series,

860
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,120
Demon Souls is like the most,

861
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,600
the perfect like mixture of the way the game was told

862
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,040
and what is in the game

863
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,920
and the way it's played and everything.

864
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,960
And then beyond, after that,

865
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,960
it's sort of shifted in Dark Souls

866
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,000
and then Dark Souls 2 and then Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3

867
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,280
into something that's just a bit far removed

868
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,280
from like you're a real human being or you're a dead guy

869
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,200
and you're trying to survive at,

870
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,000
you've got a realistic-ish strength level

871
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,880
and you're trying to survive in this harsh world

872
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,240
that is fucking going to destroy you.

873
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,120
But then in Dark Souls 3,

874
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,640
it's like you are a super being from the very beginning

875
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,720
and you're really fast and you dodge well, super good.

876
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,080
And it's like the message is different.

877
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,920
And that doesn't even make sense

878
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,120
because like in Bloodborne,

879
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,680
you're designed to be like a speedy dashy guy,

880
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,240
but you're wearing like heavy plate

881
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,640
and doing this shit in Dark Souls 3.

882
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,960
Yeah, Dark Souls 3 is just sort of,

883
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,040
it's not bad, which is the thing,

884
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,680
but it's like, it's a muddy,

885
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,200
it's a, it's a, it's a removal,

886
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,200
removal of the core of reason for like stuff.

887
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,160
So, so like what you're arguing is that like,

888
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,600
there can be an artistic thing that was done

889
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,880
in the original thing that can be diminished

890
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,720
as sequels go along.

891
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,520
It can be diminished, but like there's no reason

892
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,960
to think that if it's not perfectly artistically cohesive

893
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,880
with gameplay and whatever.

894
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,400
I'm talking mostly about games

895
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,800
because I don't really watch movies.

896
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,640
Sure, sure.

897
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,960
But like, you know, there can be that,

898
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,960
but there's nothing to say that you should like the old game

899
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,840
or the old one more, even if you like the new one,

900
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,080
because it's a game you like more.

901
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,840
It's just, it's just always confusing

902
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,880
because they're the same franchise

903
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,440
and there's different things.

904
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,160
Franchises should not exist.

905
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,080
They should not.

906
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,240
That's, I mean, I definitely want to say a thing about that.

907
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Yeah, I wanted to say something, but you can go Nate.

908
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,600
Okay. Well, I was just going to say that like,

909
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,320
so when it comes to like,

910
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,240
my mind keeps going back to Final Fantasy 7

911
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,960
as like the main example in my mind.

912
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,720
And it's like, so that is a little different

913
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,960
in the sense that like, well,

914
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,560
actually Dark Souls had direct sequels,

915
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,640
but like there was Final Fantasy 7

916
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,360
that had its own artistic integrity, love or hate it,

917
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,080
you know, whatever it was, it was its own thing.

918
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,840
And then you've got years later,

919
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,960
they make Advent Children.

920
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,400
It was like the first thing that was made

921
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,280
for this compilation of Final Fantasy 7,

922
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,000
which was followed by many games and whatnot.

923
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Like, okay, you could theoretically make a prequel

924
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,840
to Final Fantasy 7, which actually they did.

925
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,120
There were some animated films

926
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,200
that came out before Advent Children.

927
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,360
There was at least one, I think it was called Before Crisis.

928
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,840
That's just like an anime version

929
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,720
of what happened in Nibelheim

930
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,680
between like Zack Cloud and Sephiroth.

931
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,160
And like a prequel that just makes the events of the game

932
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,240
into an anime, like that's totally fine.

933
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,960
Like that generally doesn't hurt anything

934
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,200
and is pretty decent.

935
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,320
Now, the problem is when you make sequels

936
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
to Final Fantasy 7,

937
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,400
that's when artistic integrity gets its Achilles heel sliced

938
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,680
because the entire point of the end of that game

939
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,120
was there was a question as to whether or not humanity

940
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,080
was going to be wiped out.

941
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,680
And like, we don't know the answer to that question

942
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,320
at the end of Final Fantasy 7.

943
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,720
By making sequels, and that was the whole point

944
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,720
that we as the viewers have to wonder ourselves,

945
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,200
are human beings actually a plague on the earth?

946
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,360
It was about the environment.

947
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,600
It was an environmental question.

948
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,200
It was about the nature of mankind.

949
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,600
Are we deserving of survival?

950
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,880
Are we just a virus on this planet the way Genova was?

951
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,800
Or do we actually deserve to live here

952
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,200
as part of this ecosystem and this world we're on?

953
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,720
That is the question asked at the end of Final Fantasy 7

954
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,280
and we do not know the answer.

955
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,920
So you are given the homework to spend the rest of your life

956
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,320
thinking about the ending to that game.

957
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,880
Until Advent Children comes out a couple years later,

958
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,080
when they say, nope, everything's fine, humans are cool,

959
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,280
don't worry about it, they just got Geostigma.

960
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
So shut the hell up, everybody.

961
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,720
Like bad, like no, stop.

962
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,120
I watched Advent Children without having any context

963
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,520
for any games or anything.

964
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,880
And I was young and I quite liked it.

965
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,840
It was like, ooh, shiny, basically.

966
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,960
I liked it at first too when I first saw it

967
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,840
because I also was just like, ooh, shiny.

968
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,880
Because I hadn't really thought seriously

969
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,080
about what it all meant.

970
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,920
But then as the years went on, I did and I am where I am now.

971
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,080
But like, so that's just one example.

972
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,160
I did a full cosplay of Vincent Valentine in my youth.

973
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,640
Made his gauntlet, made his whole thing.

974
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,560
And there's a picture of it, there's pictures of it around.

975
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
But anyway, I worked at an anime convention

976
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,400
to work at Anime Boston.

977
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,680
I wanted to make my larger point here

978
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,480
and it's specifically about,

979
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
and keeping with what Ghib was saying,

980
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,560
it's why I hate franchises.

981
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,120
And it's this, it's a whole bunch of things.

982
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,640
But it's, it's a whole bunch of things.

983
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
And I think it's a whole bunch of things.

984
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
And I think it's a whole bunch of things.

985
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,480
But it's, any time that is spent on making a sequel to a game

986
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,040
is time that could instead be made

987
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,720
making like a new thing with original ideas.

988
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,280
And there are absolutely sequels that are good,

989
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,720
that improve various things.

990
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,000
But I'm approaching this from the lens of like,

991
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,880
like how much intellectual content really in the story.

992
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,680
I know a lot of people don't care about fucking stories

993
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,600
and games, but I do.

994
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
And I, and you know, the whole Gazambkutsfark

995
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,040
of story working with gameplay, blah, blah, blah,

996
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,200
all that bullshit.

997
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,600
And it's like when, when you have to sit down

998
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,480
as like a game designer,

999
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,640
cause I have been a game designer many times.

1000
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,560
I know what it's like, even though I don't do it right now.

1001
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,200
Like you have to sit down and think about,

1002
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,880
okay, what's the whole basis of our game gonna be?

1003
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,160
And you really have to go through an intense struggle

1004
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,200
to come up with something original.

1005
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,360
And that's where the most of the intellectual labor is done

1006
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,240
when you're making a game.

1007
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,000
It's when you come up with the concept

1008
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,040
and then like all the shit that comes afterward

1009
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,680
is all like filling in the blank.

1010
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,760
So that's, you know, that's how you make your game.

1011
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,840
So like, you know what, this brings to mind

1012
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,040
when I was doing the weed cast with Digi and the boys

1013
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,840
and we would watch episode one

1014
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,720
of like every anime that came out in a season.

1015
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,660
I loved doing that because episode one

1016
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,920
of every single show that's ever made for the most part

1017
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,800
is interesting or absurd or just,

1018
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,620
it stands out generally in some way.

1019
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,380
But the thing is, watching another 11 episodes

1020
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,980
of that thing generally for most shows is not worth it

1021
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,420
because you're not getting that like,

1022
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,140
that spark that's like leading into a whole show

1023
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,100
when you watch the whole thing.

1024
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,180
You get all the ideas presented in episode one

1025
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,700
and then they string it out for 11 episodes in some way.

1026
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,100
And you know, a lot of the times that makes sense

1027
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,860
because it's a complicated narrative, whatever.

1028
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,340
But the point I'm getting at is what I really liked

1029
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,180
about that and the good thing I get from that is

1030
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
when you're forced to like start over

1031
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,460
and start from the very beginning

1032
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,060
and come up with a unique premise,

1033
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,300
that's where most interesting things that I like in a show

1034
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,420
and generally in a video game as well, like are done.

1035
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,940
It's at that first stage.

1036
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,100
So to go on and spend a million fucking years

1037
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,980
reinventing the wheel and trying to come up

1038
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,540
with sequels to games to just like refine art

1039
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,340
or refine gameplay or you know, make a sequel to a show

1040
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,900
and like find excuses to like have like new characters

1041
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,820
show up in season two.

1042
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,140
Like, oh, cause we didn't mention them

1043
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,680
cause they were off doing a secret mission

1044
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,520
but now they're back

1045
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,120
and here they are main character of season two.

1046
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,300
I hate all that shit.

1047
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,140
It's terrible.

1048
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,240
It generally, I'm not gonna say every time

1049
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,240
but a lot of the time it violates artistic integrity

1050
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,620
and like to all the things that the big push right now

1051
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,420
of like doing like the big remake thing,

1052
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,120
the reboots and whatnot.

1053
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,220
It's just like I do not blame studios for doing it.

1054
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,240
They've got to make money.

1055
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,100
They've got, you know, bills to pay.

1056
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,020
What I hate is when people just are content with it

1057
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,960
and accept it and are just like, yeah,

1058
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,400
this is a perfectly good use of everyone's time.

1059
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,160
Like this ThunderCats reboot, maybe it will be great.

1060
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,840
I don't know, but I don't want people to think

1061
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,000
that it's a good thing to do to spend all their time

1062
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,120
making a new ThunderCats show when they could instead

1063
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,000
be making something actually original, you know,

1064
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,680
from the premise up.

1065
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,000
Okay, I still have a point to say.

1066
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,680
So like, oh, I wanted to bring up a franchise

1067
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,700
that I also like, Dragon Age.

1068
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,700
I really, really like Dragon Age.

1069
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,000
It's one of my favorite franchises, I guess.

1070
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,260
I really love the first game

1071
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,820
and the second game got bashed to the ground

1072
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,340
because people hated it so much because of the changes

1073
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,540
and like, not just the changes,

1074
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,620
like it was lacking severely in a lot of things.

1075
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,700
And like, it was obviously a very rushed project

1076
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,420
and it looked, it felt more like a DLC

1077
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,280
and it didn't connect so well, story-wise.

1078
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,560
Like, there were a lot of problems.

1079
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,680
However, I still liked Dragon Age too

1080
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,920
as blasphemous as it is to say.

1081
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
I quite liked it.

1082
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,160
And now after, you know, talking with you guys

1083
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,000
about all this.

1084
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,760
Is that the one with all the gay minotaurs and stuff?

1085
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,920
Is that the one?

1086
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,240
No, I mean.

1087
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,160
No? Okay.

1088
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,240
Okay, okay.

1089
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,560
Maybe a little bit.

1090
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,320
Konari, maybe if you're talking about Konari,

1091
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,520
they're not minotaurs, but they are people

1092
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,600
with giant horns in their heads, most of them.

1093
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,440
Yeah.

1094
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,280
Is there a big gay one?

1095
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,120
Is there a big gay one?

1096
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,820
It's in the third game, not the second one.

1097
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,660
Maybe.

1098
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,500
Ah, okay.

1099
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,340
My apologies.

1100
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,180
But yeah.

1101
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,520
So in the second game.

1102
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,220
That's the one Nate's interested in, for sure.

1103
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,100
Yeah, that's the one I want to know about, okay.

1104
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,940
He's called Iron Bull and yes, I need-

1105
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,780
Iron Bull?

1106
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,380
Oh, damn.

1107
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,220
That's hot.

1108
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,580
Now I need to come go back to my game

1109
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,220
because I remember I made a character

1110
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,500
specifically to romance that guy, so.

1111
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,320
Now we're talking.

1112
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,160
Yeah.

1113
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,000
Nate did too.

1114
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,680
It's called Nate Bestman.

1115
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,840
Yeah, I'm sure.

1116
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,880
I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna,

1117
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,400
if he was originally, I was going to originally romance him,

1118
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,080
but then Colin happened and oh, my heart.

1119
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,640
Because of the story this guy has had

1120
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,680
throughout the whole games, like in the original game,

1121
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,160
I played as a female mage and you meet him.

1122
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,480
And he has a crush on you in the original game.

1123
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,520
And yeah, that's really cute.

1124
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,720
And then like you meet him in the second game

1125
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,060
and he's sort of like, not exactly an antagonist,

1126
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,660
but he, but like if you play a mage,

1127
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,780
he's not really happy with mages at that point

1128
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,620
for a lot of reasons.

1129
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,260
Oh wait, is he that, he's that like Ranger guy

1130
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,900
who hates magic and wants to kill everybody, right?

1131
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's-

1132
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,740
Does he wear a bandana?

1133
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,580
Does he wear a bandana?

1134
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,060
No, he has fluffy feather things.

1135
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,700
Like he's like a captain of stuff.

1136
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,540
Anywho.

1137
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,540
So yeah, so the Ranger guy is a DLC character

1138
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,620
which I never got because I dislike him severely

1139
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,980
and he messes up my game.

1140
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,720
At least how I want to play it

1141
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,480
because I want people to be as happy as possible

1142
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,520
and he just kind of nopes out

1143
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,960
of one of the endings of the game.

1144
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,640
And like he forces me to make a choice

1145
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,720
that I don't want to choose.

1146
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,560
That I don't want to make-

1147
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,400
What does he make you choose?

1148
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,080
What's the choice?

1149
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,520
Either kill one of my party members-

1150
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,360
Straight or gay?

1151
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,040
No, no, no, either kill one of my party members

1152
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,160
or like he gets the fuck out or something like that.

1153
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,000
I don't remember.

1154
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,440
Like he really advocates for the killing

1155
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,460
of one of my party members.

1156
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,580
And I'm like, no, I like this party member

1157
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,020
despite all the fuck that shit he's done.

1158
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,860
So.

1159
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,700
Okay.

1160
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,300
Anywho, so yeah, so like Cullen and the second me

1161
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,100
and then the third game he's finally romance-able

1162
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,220
and I was like, I've been playing female majors

1163
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,180
throughout all these games.

1164
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,540
Wouldn't it be so cool if he could finally

1165
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,740
get it on with like a female age?

1166
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,540
Isn't that how it was with Tali?

1167
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,500
You could only romance her in Mass Effect 3 as well

1168
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,340
or something.

1169
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,380
I never romance her.

1170
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,860
You could romance her in Mass Effect 2.

1171
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,660
It was the first game that you could-

1172
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,560
I got you.

1173
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,400
Yes.

1174
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,000
Mass Effect's another good example of that.

1175
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,440
It was kind of different because like Mass Effect 2

1176
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,400
was way different than Mass Effect 1

1177
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,000
but people were generally positive towards it.

1178
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,920
Like there was like a hardcore group of people

1179
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,440
who played Mass Effect 1 who weren't a big fan of it

1180
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,000
because like Mass Effect 1 was a role-playing game.

1181
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,160
The combat was pretty bare bones

1182
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,120
but like there was like loot and gear

1183
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,000
and like everything you killed, you had drops

1184
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,480
and like you could change your armor

1185
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,120
and change like all your equipment and stuff

1186
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,140
and like it reflected things like one of the big memes

1187
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,700
of Mass Effect 1 is you could dress everybody

1188
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,580
in pink armor and it looked ridiculous

1189
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,860
because like there were pink armor sets

1190
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,260
that just were really good.

1191
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,780
Like the designs were really fucking weird

1192
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,860
but then Mass Effect 2, they changed all of that

1193
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,660
and it became strictly a shooter with RPG elements

1194
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,620
and the combat got a lot tighter

1195
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,100
and it was much more fun to actually like have firefights

1196
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,940
and stuff which became much more the focus of the game

1197
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,580
but there were only a couple armor sets

1198
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,140
and they weren't like equipment, it was just kind of like

1199
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,800
rewards you got throughout playing the game.

1200
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,440
So like everything, all the RPG stuff

1201
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,640
was like very streamlined or stripped out entirely

1202
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,200
in favor of being a shooter

1203
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,320
with a light leveling progression.

1204
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,120
Well, you know, I still wanna make my point.

1205
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,160
So Dragon Age 2.

1206
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,640
Wait, so let me just finish, I just wanna say on this,

1207
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,040
it's just that what's interesting about Mass Effect

1208
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,240
is just that like that, so that was always intended

1209
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,760
to have a sequel but like obviously the reboots,

1210
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,640
like that's another story with the Andromeda and whatnot.

1211
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,480
Okay, I'm sorry.

1212
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,320
Yeah, I mean Dragon Age also I think, you know,

1213
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,720
they also, it's made to have sequels

1214
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,220
but yeah, Dragon Age 2, like it got bashed to the ground

1215
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,700
and people really disliked it.

1216
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,460
However, I think like if it wasn't tied to the franchise

1217
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,860
and had come out of its own thing,

1218
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,820
people would have been as harsh to it as they were.

1219
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,500
It probably wasn't-

1220
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,820
But that harshness though, like would it have gotten

1221
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,740
as many sales, you know, like would people pay attention?

1222
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,900
Like I think the reason they're mad

1223
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,540
is because they have an expectation

1224
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,060
and then they get tricked, you know.

1225
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,700
When you buy into a franchise, like a franchise,

1226
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,280
the reason a franchise even can exist

1227
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,480
is because it's formed some sort of identity

1228
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,400
and expectation in people's minds.

1229
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,440
So when you say we're going to make more of this,

1230
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,320
they expect more of this,

1231
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,840
not like something different with the same name.

1232
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,200
And because of Dragon Age,

1233
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,920
because they're trying to tell a story

1234
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,960
throughout multiple games, like it's all said

1235
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,440
within the same time span kind of mode, like generally.

1236
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,080
You can see recurring characters, whatnot.

1237
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,080
You usually don't, you can't make like an RPG game

1238
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,940
into like a first person shooter

1239
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,700
and then just so seamlessly and tell, you know,

1240
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,220
a story I don't think,

1241
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,060
because the fans of the original ones,

1242
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,860
like the, that were fans of the RPG part,

1243
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,620
I'm probably not going to want to play it

1244
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,820
as a first person shooter, you know?

1245
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:08,320
So you can't make too much drastic changes to the formula.

1246
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,020
However, you can try to update it and stuff.

1247
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,420
And I think with Dragon Age II,

1248
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,900
I liked the agreed to the combat,

1249
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,340
at least as playing as a mage.

1250
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,720
I'll say that much because I haven't played any other classes

1251
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,400
because I only play mage, but yeah.

1252
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,760
Mage only plays mages, no.

1253
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,280
Yeah, so they made the,

1254
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,440
like I really liked the combat as a mage in Dragon Age II,

1255
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,840
which I think was a nice upgrade

1256
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,400
because in the first one, it just,

1257
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,200
it felt really clunky and the animation was sort of like,

1258
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,880
I'm poking someone with a stick just for like,

1259
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,960
with a distance, like very big distance.

1260
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,640
Like I poke someone with a stick

1261
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,480
and then like a lightning bolt comes out

1262
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,520
and then like hits them and just like,

1263
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,060
it just like, it looked like my character was going like,

1264
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,820
nyeh, nyeh, it's just so silly.

1265
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:57,180
And so unsatisfying because like Dragon Age II,

1266
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,780
they kind of like combined like martial arts with the staff.

1267
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,780
So you can do like really cool moves.

1268
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,420
So like you switched staff around and like,

1269
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,540
Is this in first person?

1270
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,380
Is this in first person?

1271
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,700
No, it's a third person.

1272
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,540
Oh, okay.

1273
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,220
I'm just trying to get a picture of what's happening here.

1274
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,220
It's like, it's like, it's a lot more satisfying the combat.

1275
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,000
And like when you melee people within like range as a mage,

1276
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,120
even that looks cool.

1277
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,120
Even if you don't do that much damage, like it's,

1278
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,960
it's really neat.

1279
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,000
I liked, I liked it to the combat a lot.

1280
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,920
Okay. So, so basically,

1281
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,880
so not every franchise immediately goes to shit.

1282
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,440
I like, and there's things to be enjoyed.

1283
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,520
Well, here's, here's my question.

1284
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,880
I'll just quickly want to say like,

1285
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,240
Dragon Age Inquisition was the third game

1286
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,120
and I think it was received positively enough.

1287
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,780
They did a lot of changes that people heavily disliked

1288
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,140
because they sort of made it feel like an MMORPG

1289
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,340
with a lot of little mini quests and very big worlds

1290
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,740
that kind of felt a little bit on the empty side

1291
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,020
and just like a lot of little tedious quests here and there,

1292
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,460
you know, pick up five herbs, kill 10 boys or something,

1293
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,820
you know, those sort of quests

1294
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,500
to make it feel more bloated than it actually is.

1295
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,860
However, I didn't, it wasn't a deal breaker for me.

1296
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,260
I didn't have too much of a problem

1297
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,260
because I'm a great big MMORPG junky sort of person.

1298
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,840
So I didn't have an issue with that.

1299
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,960
It didn't, I liked the game regardless

1300
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,660
and it's my favorite game of the three.

1301
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,320
And I hope they do better with the next game.

1302
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,160
And I'm really scared

1303
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,960
because the EA has been fucking up recently and...

1304
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,800
Oof.

1305
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,240
Have you considered being a video game YouTuber?

1306
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,600
No.

1307
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,420
I mean, I sort of like, I did an Undertale Let's Play

1308
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,120
that I never finished, but no, I don't wanna.

1309
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,360
I'm not, I'm not, no.

1310
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,160
I'm a wee, you know, so many things.

1311
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,200
So just get that out on the PCP.

1312
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,200
Yes.

1313
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,840
In the middle of every PCP with Mage,

1314
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,720
we'll not have a game review, just out of nowhere.

1315
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,960
I don't play that many games that I don't know.

1316
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,420
Like I usually play like very cute farming sims

1317
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,560
or something like that.

1318
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,720
Well, okay.

1319
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,960
I mean, I'm trying to come to like a thoughtful thing

1320
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,560
to say, to summarize.

1321
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,720
Like, okay, is it fair to say that franchises

1322
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,400
are always bad?

1323
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,240
No, right.

1324
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,080
It should never happen.

1325
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,240
He's what I can say about things.

1326
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,720
No, Mage, pause.

1327
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,840
Give talk, god damn it.

1328
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,680
Franchises.

1329
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,040
I was fucking pausing.

1330
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,640
You, then you interrupted.

1331
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,360
Also you went on about your shit for a while, Nate.

1332
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,480
I waited a long time.

1333
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,320
You're absolutely right.

1334
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,160
You're absolutely right.

1335
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,200
What we need to do is to stop giving a shit

1336
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,360
about the names of franchises

1337
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,680
and start giving a shit about the people behind them.

1338
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,440
It's always the case.

1339
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,200
It just always is.

1340
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,240
Even sometimes when it isn't the case, it's the case.

1341
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,000
We should literally criminalize naming movies.

1342
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,720
We should name them one, two, three,

1343
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,400
starting with the first movie we made now

1344
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,720
and just naming them with numbers forever.

1345
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,840
The artist behind the thing is so much more

1346
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:15,760
of a reliable way to tell whether a game is going to be

1347
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,440
the sort of thing that you want from a franchise.

1348
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,240
The most obvious example is Dark Souls 2

1349
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,160
in the Dark Demon Blood franchise

1350
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,720
was not helmed by a hit attacker Miyazaki

1351
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,040
like the other games.

1352
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,320
And it's not as good in various ways

1353
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,280
that it was good in the other games.

1354
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,120
That's a great point.

1355
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,800
He directed all the other ones.

1356
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,680
And it's clear that he has a very clear vision

1357
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,520
of what the game should have in them

1358
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,080
and why things are put there.

1359
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:51,080
And so when he's in charge, you can tell before you buy

1360
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,640
that at least there's going to be a good shit.

1361
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,920
I was upset with Dark Souls 2,

1362
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,760
but then hit attacker Miyazaki

1363
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,000
coming back for Dark Souls 3.

1364
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,600
I was like, OK.

1365
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,320
I was like, OK.

1366
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1367
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,400
He made Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3.

1368
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,720
And I'm like, OK, this time I've never

1369
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,760
liked the idea of believing something

1370
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,520
is going to be good before reviews come out.

1371
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,960
I never liked pre-ordering.

1372
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,840
Pre-ordering is stupid.

1373
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,200
But and I didn't pre-order Dark Souls 3.

1374
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,160
But I had this idea that if he's there,

1375
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,520
I feel like it's going to be good.

1376
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,840
And it was.

1377
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,960
Like fucking, oh, shit.

1378
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,760
I just had like the godfather.

1379
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,880
Everyone, the Godfather 2 actually won more Oscars

1380
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,120
than Godfather 1, I think.

1381
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,200
And that was just another by Coppola, you know?

1382
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,920
Like if that had been outsourced, like, for example,

1383
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,520
I forget who the director was of American Beauty.

1384
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,560
Like American Beauty 1 is like a legendary film

1385
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,880
that everybody loves, Dubs.

1386
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,480
But then America, I mean, this may be a bad example,

1387
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,720
but American Beauty 2, it is a sequel.

1388
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,840
It features the character in a small way.

1389
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,600
I have not seen it.

1390
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,280
It stars Mila Kunis and it's like, it's like a joke.

1391
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,480
Like it's a, no, it's just not real.

1392
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,240
Like if you bought American Psycho 1,

1393
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,680
I knew it was a video game,

1394
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,440
and then you bought American Psycho 2, I mean, no, it's not.

1395
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,320
There's an American Psycho 2?

1396
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,320
There is, starring Mila Kunis as, I mean,

1397
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,840
but that's so bad.

1398
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,480
You said American Beauty.

1399
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,280
God damn it, American Psycho, no beauty involved here.

1400
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,640
Okay, I was very confused.

1401
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,080
Except for Person Fail, if you know what I'm saying.

1402
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,400
Got him, hashtag gay.

1403
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,440
Yeah, there was another, oh, I was gonna say,

1404
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,240
and another one is like Hideki Kamiya directed

1405
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,640
like Devil May Cry 1,

1406
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,160
but then like Devil May Cry 2 was by some other asshole

1407
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,520
and it was a complete nightmare.

1408
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,120
It was terrible and this was young me before I knew.

1409
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,680
I think that's, yeah, yeah.

1410
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,400
I think that same guy also went on to make

1411
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,840
Devil May Cry 3 and like redeemed himself, I think.

1412
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,680
I think that's what happened.

1413
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,240
Yeah, I thought that Kamiya came back for 3

1414
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,920
and then someone called me up on a previous episode

1415
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,280
and was like, no, you're fucking retarded.

1416
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,680
It was the same guy who just like learned to not suck.

1417
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,080
And I was like, oh, well, I take back all the things

1418
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,760
that I said for him for like 15 years.

1419
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,840
It's not a guarantee, that's true.

1420
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,960
It's not a guarantee if the same guy is,

1421
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,160
but it's more reliable than seeing the brand's name

1422
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,400
or even seeing the company behind it

1423
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,720
or like the publisher or the game studio or the,

1424
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,640
you know, the team.

1425
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,080
I mean, sometimes the team is just,

1426
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,520
it's not the same team, even if it's all the same people,

1427
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,800
if it's been like three decades, like with Ukulele,

1428
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,080
most of the old gang came back and it sucks.

1429
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:37,200
And it's just because they weren't doing that,

1430
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,200
that whole thing for so many years that they had changed

1431
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,600
and they didn't know what they were doing as much anymore.

1432
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,680
Yeah, that's a good point.

1433
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,240
Like, go ahead, Mitch.

1434
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,360
I wanna say, so we can sort of like agree

1435
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:53,160
that like the things, like criticizing things

1436
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,920
just because they're different from how they used to be

1437
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,880
isn't really a good sort of basis to criticize things,

1438
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,400
but it is okay to criticize things for actual faults

1439
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,080
that things have.

1440
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,880
So like, basically just take your nostalgia goggles off

1441
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,360
if you wanna criticize new games

1442
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,640
because you have to consider like,

1443
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,280
are they good on their own, you know?

1444
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,120
Like your games-

1445
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:16,960
That's definitely true.

1446
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,680
Yeah, I mean, a lot of people, they don't do that

1447
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,920
because they're judging it based on the idea

1448
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,280
that they want a new version of this franchise

1449
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,880
and that is what they're being sold,

1450
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,240
but they're not getting it because it's different.

1451
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,600
And that cuts both ways though.

1452
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,160
Like some people, because they played the old thing,

1453
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,280
will be more critical.

1454
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,560
I think that's most of us here,

1455
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,800
but then other people have like a rose colored

1456
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,920
nostalgia glasses and like they'll see

1457
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,880
the Final Fantasy VII remake and like I grew up,

1458
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,880
myself saying this and my friends saying,

1459
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,160
whatever console Final Fantasy VII remake

1460
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,480
eventually comes out on, I will buy.

1461
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,800
And this was like more than a decade ago

1462
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,760
that me and my friends were like saying this shit

1463
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,800
because like this, like obviously

1464
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,160
it's going to be the best game ever,

1465
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,360
but of course we didn't know

1466
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,280
that like the compilation was coming, man,

1467
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,560
the compilation and like,

1468
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,360
and there were all these directorial issues,

1469
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,960
like the game isn't being worked on

1470
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,600
and like all these problems are happening in development.

1471
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,080
And most people still don't,

1472
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,360
most people don't like fucking, you know,

1473
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,520
follow gaming press and dev logs and all this crazy shit.

1474
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,760
So like they're not gonna know.

1475
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,600
They're just gonna be like,

1476
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,320
oh, I remember Final Fantasy VII and they're making it again.

1477
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,480
I think this is the problem

1478
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,520
and there's literally nothing we can do about it

1479
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,120
except possibly advocate that people change their mindset,

1480
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,840
but I think it's not going to happen.

1481
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,040
The problem is that people stop

1482
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,640
when they see the name of a thing

1483
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,960
and like the company behind it possibly,

1484
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,640
even that is probably too much.

1485
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,640
They just see like new Marvel movie

1486
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,200
and they think, okay, gonna be great.

1487
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,720
Or, you know, or like new Final Fantasy game,

1488
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,280
okay, it's gonna be great, new Kingdom Hearts,

1489
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,440
okay, it's gonna be great.

1490
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,880
But what they need to do is investigate

1491
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,000
who's directing it, what have they done recently?

1492
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,040
What is the team developing?

1493
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,880
It's a bit much to ask that people do that for everything.

1494
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,960
But that's why we YouTubers

1495
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,720
can bring them that information, you know?

1496
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,960
I think that the most I can do specifically

1497
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,600
to quell this problem is just to be like,

1498
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,640
I don't even know his name.

1499
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,160
The guy who made Calvin and Hobbes,

1500
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,560
he's a genius and he's a school.

1501
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,760
George Harrison.

1502
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,160
George Harrison.

1503
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,000
That's the-

1504
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,200
Bill Lauderson, you fucking fools.

1505
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,400
Don't sully his name.

1506
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,880
The greatest human I've ever lived.

1507
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:22,480
All I can do is when an if, no, when,

1508
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,480
I make a big, giant franchise, like big thing,

1509
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,320
like, oh, everybody wants to make a movie of my thing.

1510
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,960
I'm gonna say no, and I'm gonna write my will, fuck you.

1511
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,960
Nobody will ever touch anything I make

1512
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,800
and they'll be great as a result.

1513
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,000
That's what I want, man.

1514
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,840
That's what I want.

1515
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,680
I didn't wanna say the-

1516
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,040
I made it if you were gonna say.

1517
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,120
It's okay to sort of like, you know,

1518
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,040
have initial dislike or like of a thing to reaction.

1519
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,480
Like, you can't control your emotions to a thing.

1520
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,920
Like, so you might have a knee-jerk reaction.

1521
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,360
But if you're gonna like,

1522
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,360
don't go and pick fights with people

1523
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,440
over your silly emotions

1524
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,720
and just like, think a little bit before you do that.

1525
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,720
I mean, I totally hear you on the image,

1526
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,640
but like, what I'm advocating for

1527
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,440
is a severe and massive amount of rage

1528
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,160
if you have a well-researched opinion at like, for example,

1529
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,360
my feelings on the Final Fantasy VII remake.

1530
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,800
I feel like I know the score.

1531
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,520
I have done the research.

1532
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,280
And again, I know likely what issues are to be.

1533
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,440
So I will continue to raise these concerns.

1534
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,080
But however, when the game is finally before me,

1535
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,520
I will drop all of that as best I can

1536
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,280
and attempt to give it a sincere, thorough, clean slate.

1537
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,600
And you will buy the collector's edition.

1538
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,280
He'll get the cool cloud statue

1539
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,120
and he will fucking do it all.

1540
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,880
I think something really important

1541
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,080
when looking at franchises and remakes and stuff

1542
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,920
is that there's a difference.

1543
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,520
You have to understand yourself.

1544
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,760
There is a difference between saying,

1545
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,400
I don't like this because it's not what I wanted it to be.

1546
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,440
And this thing is terrible and I hate it

1547
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,080
because it's possible for something to be really, really good

1548
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,960
but just not at all what you wanted.

1549
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,040
That was what happened with me when Kill La Kill came out.

1550
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,480
Like, I just had the wrong expectation.

1551
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,040
I went in thinking like, you're in login too, here we go.

1552
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,200
I did the exact same thing.

1553
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,040
That was a huge mistake.

1554
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,200
Yeah, I didn't have that explanation.

1555
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,040
I quite liked it.

1556
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,800
The reason that happened is because they advertise it

1557
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,760
as like another Gurren login.

1558
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,080
If you watch all of the previews and stuff.

1559
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,000
I mean, I accept responsibility for misreading it,

1560
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,320
but yeah, I mean.

1561
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,880
At the end of the day, I've never seen a Gurren login.

1562
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,720
Oh my God!

1563
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,560
Well, well, good luck.

1564
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,000
I watched one episode, it's not for me, it's not for me.

1565
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,680
Oh, oh, oh, do we have to, all right, all right.

1566
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,160
Everybody, we have to disconnect mage,

1567
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,280
we have to hold hold vote right now.

1568
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,320
Kick mage, yes or no?

1569
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,160
How you can't?

1570
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,640
Well, how interesting.

1571
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,600
So you watched episode one and just didn't like it?

1572
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,360
Yeah, I think I watched like two or maybe two episodes.

1573
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,320
Go watch, go watch this anime ever, Gurren login part,

1574
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,160
one and two.

1575
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,640
I don't, I don't wanna, you can't,

1576
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,720
the more you force me, the less likely I'll be to watch it.

1577
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,400
I'm not forcing anybody, blame Tom, it's not me.

1578
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,320
Yeah, stop nagging.

1579
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,880
No, oh no, I'm so sad.

1580
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,480
Don't be like everyone's mother.

1581
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,360
I'm so sad now, I have to be mage's mom on this.

1582
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,760
You know what's funny, Tom is like almost as big a fan

1583
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,880
of Gurren login as I am, I mean, you know,

1584
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,880
maybe not as intellectual, an analyzer of a fucking anime.

1585
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,960
You like it with your brain, I like it with my heart,

1586
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,800
okay, Mr. Gurren?

1587
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,800
Remember when I was, yeah, yeah, sure.

1588
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,720
When I was working on that video,

1589
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,200
I remember discussing it with you,

1590
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,400
like the thought of possibly getting you involved.

1591
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,720
I mean, it just didn't work out that way,

1592
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,040
but I remember that came out,

1593
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,800
that was like four, three years ago,

1594
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,640
it was something.

1595
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,480
It was a long time.

1596
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,320
Yeah, yeah.

1597
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,320
I remember Ghost in the Shell coming next, man,

1598
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,920
I can't wait for Nate to release his third video.

1599
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,760
I know, right?

1600
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,600
I know, right?

1601
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,640
I like the memes, though, I'm aware of it.

1602
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,200
The memes are good, all good.

1603
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,080
That's pretty good, right?

1604
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,320
I don't know, weaponized thickness,

1605
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,160
not from that video, but, you know.

1606
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,720
All right, team.

1607
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,040
I think we've, I'm actually pretty happy

1608
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,360
with where we've arrived with this.

1609
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,280
That was a pretty decent summary.

1610
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,400
The issue is just, you gotta do research,

1611
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,640
and the problem is that no one ever will,

1612
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,200
like the problem is that the dummies of the world

1613
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,960
who don't know anything, they see like, you know,

1614
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,200
it's Marvel, baby, and they're like,

1615
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,040
yeah, I will get my mind to this uncritically

1616
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,520
and have no, you know, whatever.

1617
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,320
Just a quick disclaimer to people who,

1618
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,400
like, because we namedropped a lot of games,

1619
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,480
and there might be people who are like,

1620
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,240
oh, you like this game, but there were like these faults

1621
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,840
in it, or like, oh, you dislike this game,

1622
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,360
but like, it has these and these good things.

1623
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,600
Like, this is not a game review podcast,

1624
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,920
so we can't go in-depth about all the things

1625
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,040
good and bad about games.

1626
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,320
If you like any video game viewer,

1627
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,520
you are a fucking idiot piece of shit, loser,

1628
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,440
and literally delete yourself from real life.

1629
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,560
And basically, if we let something out,

1630
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,120
it's not because we're ignorant, it's just like,

1631
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,680
we had to move on, especially me and Nate,

1632
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,720
we talked a lot.

1633
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,240
That's, sure, sure.

1634
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,600
Yep, that's true.

1635
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,120
All right, I think we're done here.

1636
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,440
Gib, Tom, any final thoughts on this?

1637
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,560
Thanks, everybody, for listening to the 108th episode

1638
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,920
of the Procrastinators franchise.

1639
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,760
That's right.

1640
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,680
I look forward to getting to 180,

1641
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,560
so we can do a 180 degree change

1642
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,720
to do something completely different

1643
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,520
from the PCP up to this point.

1644
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,760
That'd be very funny.

1645
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,800
Like, upload, that would be a great idea.

1646
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,200
It's dead now, we killed it.

1647
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,440
That'll be great, that'll be great.

1648
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,600
Gib, any thoughts, any final thoughts here?

1649
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,880
Oh, we should pretend to be each other on the 180th.

1650
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,000
You're not Gib.

1651
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,840
Whoa.

1652
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,160
No, there are no more thoughts.

1653
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,000
Zero.

1654
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,440
I am out of thoughts.

1655
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,640
There's nothing left in my brain.

1656
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,920
No more simple thoughts, they're done.

1657
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,640
Yes.

1658
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,680
All right, well, all right, it's time to switch on gears

1659
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,360
over here to our hashtag ask PCP section, everybody.

1660
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,960
I, on the Twitter, I use hashtag ask PCP every Saturday

1661
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,560
when we record, I send out a tweet,

1662
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,600
if you, well, don't respond to it,

1663
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,760
but you just send a thing with hashtag ask PCP.

1664
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,720
You'll see it, you'll see it.

1665
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,240
All right, I just want to give a shout out

1666
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,520
to this guy, Cult of the Yellow One.

1667
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,240
Someone's been continually asking about, like,

1668
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,280
our stances on gun control,

1669
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,680
and I think it's this guy, like, every time.

1670
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,920
It's just like, I don't know,

1671
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,360
I don't want to get into that shit.

1672
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,400
I have no fucking idea what the right,

1673
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,040
I'm just saying, like, I don't know.

1674
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,720
Every baby should have a gun,

1675
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,840
but anyone over the age of two should be killed.

1676
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,760
I have no complaints.

1677
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,440
I'm satisfied by that answer.

1678
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,880
Wait a minute, oh, here's actually a relevant question.

1679
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,040
It's at discount Picasso asks,

1680
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,120
are normies the root cause of all problems with art?

1681
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,600
I think that really sums up.

1682
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,560
I mean, what we covered in this podcast.

1683
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,560
That pretty much sums it up,

1684
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,360
because, like, the people who don't care

1685
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,440
determine they're the vast majority,

1686
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,640
the vast majority of people don't care,

1687
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,400
and the vast majority of people control

1688
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,240
the market conditions,

1689
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,120
and market conditions are responsible

1690
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,920
for all major decisions,

1691
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,640
because all major decisions are based on money and not art.

1692
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,480
Mm, there you go.

1693
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,920
Yeah, that's, and I don't see that changing

1694
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,720
until we become a post-scarcity society,

1695
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,560
which may never happen.

1696
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,720
I mean, we don't need to be a coma post-scarcity,

1697
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,440
we just need to have a lot of money to be like,

1698
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,080
I'll just give this strange artist like those.

1699
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,600
Or if we just have everybody after two years old be killed,

1700
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,880
there are no more normies anymore.

1701
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,320
I mean, that'll fix this problem right now.

1702
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,040
But the reason I don't agree with that, Gabe,

1703
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,920
is because as long as money has any influence,

1704
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,000
people will always want as much money as possible.

1705
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,200
So I think as long, and like,

1706
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,120
cause that equates to power.

1707
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,760
No, but like, like, the,

1708
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,840
there's like times in before big money crashes

1709
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,960
and bank collapses and whatever,

1710
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,960
more weird art was being funded

1711
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,080
because people were like, yeah, sure.

1712
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,080
You know, there's money to go around,

1713
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,920
there's jobs for you to have.

1714
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,960
We don't, it's not a big deal.

1715
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,680
We'll give this strange artist some funding.

1716
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,520
I agree.

1717
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,440
But now you have to be a giant super world

1718
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,840
dominating franchise or you're gone.

1719
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,840
I think the question though is less about

1720
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,360
like what art is being made

1721
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,240
and more about what art is being supported.

1722
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,160
Cause like, even now you can make whatever you want

1723
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,000
on the internet or whatever,

1724
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,800
the normies aren't always gonna do the normie thing.

1725
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,640
You know?

1726
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,480
And that's the problem.

1727
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,320
Yeah, that's right.

1728
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,320
Whatever's popular, it's just whatever's popular.

1729
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,640
Even if a studio threw a huge like budget

1730
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,520
behind like some crazy art film,

1731
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,880
like people are gonna be like, yeah,

1732
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,280
but Avengers 12 dude, and they'll just go watch that.

1733
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,000
Yeah, I mean, that's, yeah.

1734
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,200
There's a real consolidation of entertainment.

1735
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,600
Honestly, just behind Disney.

1736
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,760
Like Disney's just buying everything.

1737
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,600
I mean, if things are being funded,

1738
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,880
that's the main, if things exist, that's the main thing.

1739
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,320
It's not about whether you can convince

1740
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,880
the majority of people that your weird art thing is good.

1741
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,120
Well, what would you say to this though?

1742
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,160
Like let's say that...

1743
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,760
It's that the artist is allowed to express themselves

1744
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,600
in the way that you are.

1745
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,840
Okay, here's a real question though.

1746
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,960
And this is kind of a separate thing,

1747
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,840
but it's like, if, so let's say that like,

1748
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,600
there's enough money to go around for whatever reason,

1749
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,840
like we've got fucking, you know,

1750
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,880
universal basic income or whatever,

1751
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,680
where like everyone can make their art.

1752
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,960
But the thing is though,

1753
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,200
like there's so much market share dominance

1754
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,960
by like mainstream things like Avengers movies

1755
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:59,120
and you know, just like all the like normie stuff

1756
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,200
is so pop up that it like on social media,

1757
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,320
which is how people communicate,

1758
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,120
it just like drowns out that.

1759
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,600
So like all audiences are like,

1760
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,200
like there's always gonna be a couple people

1761
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,120
who are into your shit,

1762
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,040
but like the vast, vast majority of people,

1763
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,680
which I guess is actually true right now,

1764
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,600
are just like inundated with like, you know, Marvel

1765
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,320
and you know, like the new, I guess, Final Fantasy,

1766
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,920
even just like the AAA stuff,

1767
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,440
new Uncharted or whatever.

1768
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:26,080
And they don't like pay attention to the small things.

1769
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,320
I don't know, do you think that's like,

1770
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,080
I personally fear as things kind of like power seems

1771
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,640
like it's getting consolidated online these days,

1772
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,800
that things could end up in a place where like,

1773
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,460
just through a lack of ability to compete

1774
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,720
with the market share and like the budgeting,

1775
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,760
the advertising campaigns of like big Disney stuff,

1776
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,600
that like it'll really drown out people

1777
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,880
and they'll, you know, do bad.

1778
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,080
They won't get the word out about their stuff.

1779
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,920
Any thoughts?

1780
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,240
I mean, that's how it's always been.

1781
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,400
That is true, that is true.

1782
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,240
It's all marketing.

1783
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,720
I mean, that's the whole thing.

1784
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,280
That's why a lot of mediocre shit does so well.

1785
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,000
I want the world to be like,

1786
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,480
every man like is by his own strength and will

1787
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,280
can like break through and become, you know,

1788
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,680
like king of his own castle

1789
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,040
and acquire his own little domain or whatever way,

1790
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,080
as opposed to, and I don't know if that's realistic

1791
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,600
I feel like the reason then,

1792
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,720
there's clearly a reason that normies don't like weird shit

1793
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,880
and it's like the weird shit only appeals

1794
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,480
to a very specific mindset

1795
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,040
and only a certain amount of people have that.

1796
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,480
So even if everything that's weird gets funded,

1797
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,560
it won't be that important for most people

1798
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,720
that it gets funded.

1799
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,560
That's true.

1800
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,400
It's the same thing.

1801
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,360
Not everybody has the capacity to build their own castle.

1802
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,120
Some people just be the vassal

1803
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,200
and that's just the way they are.

1804
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,240
Yeah, fair point, fair point.

1805
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,240
So that's why you have to get to the top,

1806
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,560
have all the money and abuse all those stupid people.

1807
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,800
And that's what Comcast did

1808
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,080
and look how good they're doing.

1809
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,520
They're doing pretty damn well.

1810
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,840
Pretty fucking damn well.

1811
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,680
Did you hear they made a cash bid for Fox

1812
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,560
trying to take the rug out from under Disney?

1813
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,720
Oh, I didn't hear about that, damn.

1814
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,480
Yeah, they're gonna have like $60 billion.

1815
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,600
I'm gonna straight up here you go

1816
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,280
and they want to steal Fox from Disney.

1817
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,120
That's their big deal.

1818
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,400
Damn, okay, okay.

1819
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,640
Think about this though, everybody.

1820
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,800
Imagine like your internet and TV service provider

1821
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,080
also owns the entertainment company that makes the art

1822
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:24,920
that they distribute.

1823
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,640
They own like TriStar and like they own Coca-Cola

1824
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,480
and a bunch of crazy shit.

1825
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,960
Huh, I'm sure that doesn't cause any problems at all.

1826
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,120
I'm sure that doesn't influence

1827
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,600
like the stuff they create whatsoever.

1828
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,400
I'm sure I'm not gonna see Coca-Cola ads

1829
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,800
in front of every movie ever

1830
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,600
since like the late, the mid 90s.

1831
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,800
Oh wait, I do.

1832
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,040
Yeah, it's pretty fucked up.

1833
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,880
Hey, here's an interesting-

1834
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,920
Watch the Jack and Jill Red Letter Media review, everybody.

1835
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:45,760
Oh, I love that.

1836
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,520
That's one of the best.

1837
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,320
Hey, look, here's a good question.

1838
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,960
This is my hashtag down with Ben St.

1839
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,800
Oh.

1840
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,640
And this is in the page.

1841
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,520
It's a hashtag I can get by.

1842
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,440
The thing is, I think actually a bunch of people

1843
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,640
are using hashtag Ben St.

1844
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,960
So I'm just gonna, I clicked on this thing.

1845
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,920
It says center, I think this is center point.

1846
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,400
I think this name is center point.

1847
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,920
Is that the name before?

1848
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,080
Yeah, I think he pledged it like the RideCon fund and stuff.

1849
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,240
But anyway, I believe it's center point.

1850
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,400
And his question is,

1851
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,640
if you guys could get a sponsor for the podcast

1852
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,080
in exchange for slightly censoring yourself

1853
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,000
like bleeping the word nigger, would you do it?

1854
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,120
Would you do it?

1855
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,000
Cause I'm curious what you guys think.

1856
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,560
Cause I've always had a deep personal aversion

1857
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,480
to the idea of like getting a known sponsor.

1858
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,320
It's just-

1859
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,320
I never say the word anyway so it doesn't matter to me.

1860
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,160
That's true, that's true.

1861
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,960
I'm not against sponsorship deals

1862
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,440
because the, you can, like Game Grumps has shown

1863
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,920
you can make them really funny

1864
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,520
to the point where I don't care at all.

1865
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,720
Those are, yeah, I like that.

1866
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,800
Here's the thing, here's the thing for me.

1867
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,520
In that specific example,

1868
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,200
it would A, dependent on how much money it is.

1869
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,120
But if it was enough money to make it lucrative,

1870
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,640
I think that that specific censorship

1871
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,800
would have no artistic impact on the show itself.

1872
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,800
I think it would be funnier to bleep out certain words

1873
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,800
like that because-

1874
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,720
I mean, let's just say-

1875
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,560
Okay, go ahead, go ahead.

1876
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,120
But like if the deal was like,

1877
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,720
these are like certain topics or things you can't go into.

1878
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:09,120
Like if it was like legitimate like censorship,

1879
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,480
I'd be like, no, like fuck that.

1880
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,760
Like nothing's worth that.

1881
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,720
Cause then like the entire time,

1882
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,040
because even if you never like,

1883
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,920
even go near those grounds,

1884
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,240
the entire time in the back of your head,

1885
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,320
every time we record from now to the end of the time,

1886
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,320
we'll always constantly be thinking about not doing that.

1887
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,000
And then like 10% of our brain CPU is gonna be dedicated

1888
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,640
to making sure we don't go somewhere.

1889
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,000
And it'll just make the product worse.

1890
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,840
That's true.

1891
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,440
I'm okay with bleeping swears

1892
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,640
because a lot of the time bleeps are funnier.

1893
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,800
Bleeps are funnier than saying swears.

1894
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,200
That is definitely true.

1895
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,160
I don't know, people don't agree with me on this.

1896
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,560
I'm glad that you do.

1897
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,280
Listen to something back everybody.

1898
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,720
Bleeps are literally way funnier

1899
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,760
than just leaving in an actual swear.

1900
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,600
I don't know why.

1901
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,320
I like the idea of like having different bleeps every time.

1902
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,880
Like a different noise.

1903
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,120
Like I don't know, like a jackhammer or like,

1904
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,000
I don't know, like a siren or something that I...

1905
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,600
The whole podcast is just that one episode of SpongeBob,

1906
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,880
where they all swear.

1907
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,480
Wait a minute, I've got it.

1908
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,440
What if for each individual swear,

1909
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,480
we use a specific type of bleep

1910
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,000
so that it's like saying N-word or whatever.

1911
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,520
It's like, so they come to associate

1912
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,920
that specific noise, whatever it may be,

1913
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,280
with the actual word of question.

1914
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,680
No, they have to be common sounds

1915
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,920
you hear all the time in real life.

1916
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,680
So as you're just going around your everyday life,

1917
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,400
you just hear swears subconsciously.

1918
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,040
This is a great idea, we should do this.

1919
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,080
That is a good idea.

1920
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,840
We should do a censorship episode where we do that.

1921
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,480
That would be awesome.

1922
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,400
That would be awesome.

1923
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,320
I'll edit that, cause that sounds fun.

1924
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,280
It actually does sound fun.

1925
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,040
Like that should be, at the very least,

1926
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,880
a bonus episode for sure, locked.

1927
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,680
Oh, that'd be a great bonus episode.

1928
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,800
I wanna be honest, so please don't do it while I'm away.

1929
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,320
Well, we've already got one lined up for this month,

1930
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,760
so that'll be next month, at the earliest.

1931
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,800
Sick, all right, on the post.

1932
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,800
Okay, that'd be dope.

1933
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,360
But I don't have a microphone, by the way.

1934
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,920
I'm gonna take it to Lafayette, so.

1935
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,760
Oh, that's dope.

1936
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,880
Sick, awesome.

1937
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,200
Glad to hear it.

1938
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,160
Here's a question from Kajuro Bitterthorn

1939
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,480
on the Patreon, asks,

1940
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,040
question, I mean, this has a question for Dayton Tom,

1941
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,160
but anybody can respond.

1942
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,960
How do I abandon my nihilistic hedonism

1943
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,680
and embark on the path to becoming a productive boy

1944
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,040
that has goals?

1945
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,880
How do I convince myself that life will be better

1946
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,800
if I haven't achieved goals?

1947
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,120
I mean, I've got an answer to this.

1948
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,160
Yeah, what do you think, Tom?

1949
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:20,160
Shit, I guess you need to ask,

1950
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,520
I think for me, giving you an answer would really depend

1951
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,880
on knowing exactly what your current mindset is,

1952
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,520
like how you feel about being more hedonistic.

1953
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,520
If it feels good and you have no real desire to change,

1954
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,720
it's gonna be hard to really,

1955
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,520
anything that I would say or suggest to take your heart,

1956
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,640
because it has to start with a motivation to change.

1957
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,280
I'm going to assume that because you're asking the question

1958
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,520
that you have that desire,

1959
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,760
and that desire is probably stemming from the fact

1960
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,120
that you're sitting around doing nothing long-term

1961
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,360
and you feel like shit.

1962
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,920
And that's the first step,

1963
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,680
is because you have to realize,

1964
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,520
like for me, like what I make,

1965
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,680
my root source of all my good decisions,

1966
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,160
which I'm doing more of lately,

1967
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,560
is that like, especially like,

1968
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,240
even like a simple example is like dieting,

1969
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,680
because my diet's been on point for like three weeks now,

1970
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,520
and it's fucking great.

1971
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,360
Nice.

1972
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,680
And like I just ask myself,

1973
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,200
like a really simple question,

1974
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,600
like would I enjoy doing this now?

1975
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,520
The answer is usually yes,

1976
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,040
like going out and ordering a pizza.

1977
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,080
The answer is like, will I enjoy this in an hour?

1978
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,120
And the answer is always no.

1979
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,040
And that's like a really good,

1980
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,080
like kind of like stop gap for me,

1981
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,000
is just like realizing that like,

1982
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:27,920
instead of thinking like,

1983
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,160
oh, I can't wait to have this pizza,

1984
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,000
I'm gonna be so happy.

1985
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,480
I'm like, the real thing is like,

1986
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,680
I can't wait to have this pizza,

1987
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,920
I'm gonna be miserable for the rest of the day.

1988
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,760
And that's like-

1989
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,080
That is a great way to look at it, yeah.

1990
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,680
That is a great like way to be like, fuck that.

1991
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,840
I'd rather be like stoked later.

1992
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,280
And like in like 10 minutes, I'll just be fine.

1993
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,200
Like literally 10 minutes, I won't care anymore.

1994
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,520
The path to productivity is,

1995
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,520
it stems from the realization that suicide's kind of gay.

1996
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,160
And why would you-

1997
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,000
That's true.

1998
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,120
Why though?

1999
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:00,960
I mean-

2000
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,840
Like if you're not doing anything,

2001
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,320
you're gonna be depressed.

2002
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,440
And if you get too depressed,

2003
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,000
you think, why am I alive?

2004
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,800
And then you think, I'm gonna die.

2005
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,800
I'm gonna do it.

2006
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,760
But then if you think about it even further,

2007
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,400
you realize it's kind of pointless

2008
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,240
and who cares, nobody cares.

2009
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,160
I think the core of it-

2010
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,840
Nobody cares about you, except you.

2011
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,680
And if you don't care about you-

2012
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,600
It's true, no one's gonna give a shit.

2013
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,440
And like the thing is,

2014
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,760
is that one of the big things to realize

2015
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,640
if you wanna start being more productive,

2016
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,160
is understanding that happiness is not the goal,

2017
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,280
fulfillment is.

2018
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,240
And fulfillment means doing things

2019
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,800
that aren't going to make you happy.

2020
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,600
Because you need to fill yourself with a sense of purpose

2021
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,800
and feel like you are accomplishing something.

2022
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,840
That's what gives us a sense of more than just happiness.

2023
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,920
Happiness is like eating a pizza and feeling good.

2024
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,080
And it's not like you have to find a sense of purpose

2025
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,600
before you can do anything.

2026
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,160
You have to trick yourself into having one.

2027
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,000
Right, if you don't know what your purpose is-

2028
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,320
Sure, they could really make it.

2029
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,960
If you don't know what your purpose is,

2030
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,600
your purpose is try as much shit as possible

2031
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,080
until something clicks.

2032
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,920
Yeah.

2033
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,320
That's step one.

2034
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,320
So if like, oh, I don't know what to do.

2035
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,240
I don't know if I'm an artist or a viewer guy or anything.

2036
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,080
I don't know.

2037
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,160
It's like, yeah, you do.

2038
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,480
Your goal, your purpose is to find your purpose.

2039
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,120
And that's what everybody should be doing until they find it.

2040
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,680
Because the only way you find what it is

2041
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,640
is by trying a ton of shit.

2042
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,720
When my dad, when I was living with my parents

2043
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,240
and like looking for work and stuff,

2044
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,680
like my dad just said to me like,

2045
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,360
Nate, until you get a job, your job,

2046
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,720
your eight hour a day job is looking for a job.

2047
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,160
And like, that's basically the same sort of thing here.

2048
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,560
It's like, yeah, you should be focused

2049
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:30,960
on trying to settle this.

2050
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,040
And you know what, you're asking this question.

2051
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,080
So off to a great start.

2052
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,240
And here's what I would add to that.

2053
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,760
Like you're specifically bringing up the idea

2054
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,920
of nihilism and hedonism.

2055
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,200
And on a certain level, I agree that both of those things

2056
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,000
make sense in a way.

2057
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,840
But like, okay, like what do you want out of life?

2058
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,720
Is the question that you've got to ask yourself.

2059
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,880
Like we can accept all the realities that like,

2060
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,280
there doesn't seem to be any objective value to life.

2061
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,160
Okay, fair enough.

2062
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,280
But you're alive.

2063
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,320
So why not make the best of it?

2064
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,840
You know, and like hedonism.

2065
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,520
Like, okay, wouldn't it be nice if we could, in theory,

2066
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,800
just like pleasure ourselves at a max rate all the time?

2067
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,120
By let's say, you know, just doing heroin.

2068
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,640
But okay, would doing heroin every day

2069
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,440
actually give me the kind of life that would be the best?

2070
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,200
Like, am I going to enjoy having to do an illegal thing

2071
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,560
that could get me thrown in jail?

2072
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,280
Am I going to enjoy, you know,

2073
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,880
having to scrape up money to afford this thing?

2074
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,360
And it doesn't have to be that bad obviously.

2075
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,800
It could be a symbols ordering a pizza, like Tom said.

2076
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,640
Did you want to cut in give?

2077
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,000
Do you want to say something?

2078
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,840
I just thought like, doing heroin,

2079
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,360
doing any drug over and over will reduce

2080
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,880
like the impact it has on you.

2081
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,720
So you'd need more.

2082
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,560
Indeed.

2083
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,240
It goes back to being happy now

2084
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,400
but it's being happy in an hour.

2085
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,440
But you know, what doesn't fade.

2086
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,040
But you know what doesn't fade.

2087
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,360
I mean, so this is actually how I arrived

2088
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,120
at like what I want out of my life.

2089
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,200
You know what I want?

2090
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,800
I want a big happy family that loves me legitimately.

2091
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,360
I want to be financially secure

2092
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,080
so I don't need to worry about the world.

2093
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,880
And I want to live in an environment

2094
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,760
where I, you know, feel good about myself.

2095
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,360
I feel good about like my environment.

2096
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,120
It gives me positive vibes.

2097
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,440
And I want to physically like take care of myself.

2098
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,920
So I live as long as possible

2099
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,360
and get to enjoy all this stuff.

2100
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,560
So like, okay.

2101
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,560
Like if you disagree with those approaches

2102
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,960
then we're not going to agree.

2103
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,160
Like if you think like a good life

2104
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:21,200
is to just feel like, let's say sexual pleasure

2105
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,240
as often as possible.

2106
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,620
Let's say that's your goal.

2107
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,080
Then I would highly recommend

2108
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,680
you start investigating how it is.

2109
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,360
You can actually like make a plan

2110
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,960
to have as much sex as possible.

2111
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,360
I mean, maybe the plan for that

2112
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,840
is to literally just get a wife who loves sex.

2113
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,000
Then you need to like, okay, gotta be able to support her.

2114
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,320
Gotta be able to fucking, you know,

2115
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,400
like what is your goal in life?

2116
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,060
That is where you need to start with this.

2117
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,720
You heard mine and that's what I want.

2118
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,840
So to get there, I'm doing things like

2119
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,760
pursuing careers that make me happy.

2120
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,680
You know, like making sure I make enough money

2121
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,760
so I don't need to worry about

2122
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,440
and have freedom to do what I want to do.

2123
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,200
You know, like in my relationship

2124
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,720
I try to make sure that I'm happy,

2125
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,000
that the other person's happy.

2126
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,240
Like all these things are worth thinking about.

2127
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,480
And to the point of being a hedonist.

2128
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,320
The thing is though, everything I described

2129
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,520
sounds like, I don't know, like fucking life coach,

2130
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,800
you're like, hedonism's wrong.

2131
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,640
I think that like every human is basically just a hedonist.

2132
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,720
I'm simply a hedonist who wants to maximize across

2133
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,440
like the entire 70, 80, 90, maybe longer years of my life

2134
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,360
how happy and enjoyable life is.

2135
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,360
And there's a completely rational basis

2136
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,360
to do your homework.

2137
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,120
Work out several times a week.

2138
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,680
Eat healthy and deny yourself sugary foods

2139
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,360
that are a fleeting high.

2140
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,480
See, it's a fleeting high versus delaying gratification

2141
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,240
to live a happier life.

2142
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,120
That's where I would start with you.

2143
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,560
Think about what you want out of life

2144
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,760
and think about how to get there.

2145
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,440
That hashtag emotional edging life, you know?

2146
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,960
Exactly, that's the one.

2147
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,880
I mean, yeah, that's pretty much all I gotta say about it.

2148
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,240
Good luck dude, I hope you fucking crush it.

2149
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:57,600
Yeah, Kajuro, crush that puss and crush that dog also

2150
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,680
with the opposite of puss, you get it?

2151
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,800
Excellent.

2152
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,360
Next question, this is a funny one actually.

2153
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,360
TamakiXaid asks, what is your most boring passion?

2154
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,360
Your most boring passion?

2155
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,280
I like that a lot, I like that a lot.

2156
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,600
Damn, that's interesting.

2157
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,800
Okay, this isn't a passion, but like for example,

2158
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,240
I like to count to the number eight repeatedly

2159
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,000
throughout the day, and I really enjoy doing it.

2160
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,720
That's, yeah, like it's like a text.

2161
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,160
Well, it's like when I'm driving,

2162
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,280
I'll do it, I'll play a little game with myself

2163
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,640
that I'll like, okay, it's gonna be hard to explain,

2164
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,800
but like I do a thing where like the telephone poles,

2165
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,800
like I try to count my own car lengths

2166
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,600
as I drive by them, and I count up to eight

2167
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:48,760
and then I start over, and I like to,

2168
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,320
it's really satisfying for me

2169
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:54,800
when my eighth car length lands right before

2170
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,840
a final finishing telephone pole

2171
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,240
and isn't one of several lengths,

2172
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,200
because you can fit like four cars in between telephone poles,

2173
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,160
and I do this constantly to myself.

2174
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:12,040
Yeah, that's what I've got, go to hell.

2175
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:12,880
I enjoy it.

2176
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,200
Anybody else?

2177
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,040
Yeah.

2178
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,200
I just wanna think of like a boring passion I have.

2179
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,120
Okay, it's just related to Nate's thing.

2180
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,400
I also do like a little counting thing in my head.

2181
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,240
Whenever I'm waiting for something.

2182
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,560
What do you count to?

2183
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,080
Yeah, whenever I'm waiting for something,

2184
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,880
and like, you know, like let's say

2185
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,440
I'm hitting something at the microwave

2186
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,000
or like something else, basically it's just,

2187
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,920
I count down from six to one, three times.

2188
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,400
Wait, I'm sorry, say that one more time.

2189
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,400
I'm trying to parse that memory.

2190
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,520
But I'm waiting for things.

2191
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,760
Let's say I'm hitting something in the microwave

2192
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,240
and like I see there's like less than a minute left,

2193
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,640
then I start counting in my head, like six, five, four,

2194
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,760
and I do it like, when I reach one, I go back to six

2195
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,800
and I count down again, I do it three times in total.

2196
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,320
The mark of the beast.

2197
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,040
That's so appropriate for Mage.

2198
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,320
Interesting, now let me, do you do that

2199
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,040
as a way to kind of force time to pass

2200
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,360
so that when you look back?

2201
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,760
Yeah, I totally get that.

2202
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,600
I totally get it.

2203
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,600
I just felt like that too.

2204
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,080
Yeah, it just like, because I'm dragging out the numbers

2205
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:28,080
like six, five, it sounds like I'm counting seconds,

2206
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,360
but like each second takes like five seconds to count,

2207
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,480
you know, so like.

2208
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,360
That makes sense, makes sense.

2209
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,040
You know what I do, when I'm on the treadmill at the gym,

2210
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,400
like, and I see that there's like a minute left,

2211
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,400
that's when I like really start to like,

2212
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,840
I try to really forcibly distract myself,

2213
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,520
like hardcore from not paying attention

2214
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,440
to like what I'm doing or the, you know, pain.

2215
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,400
It's not really pain, but like the pain of running.

2216
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,760
And then like, when I look back,

2217
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,760
I'm like, yes, 10 seconds have passed

2218
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:56,560
and I keep forcing myself to like be distracted by things.

2219
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,200
It really only works in that last minute,

2220
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,040
because like, I try to do it when I'm like running

2221
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,600
for like long-term things and like distract myself

2222
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,200
so that when I look back at the clock, more time has passed,

2223
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,360
but it's pretty ineffective, just because like,

2224
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,200
I don't know, whatever, it like,

2225
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,800
my brain is only like excited for the end to come

2226
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,040
when I'm actually close to it,

2227
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,400
like in that last minute or whatever,

2228
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,360
but whatever, just saying, I do that too.

2229
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,320
Like when I have to wait for longer things,

2230
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:24,440
I count down from 60 and I always count down

2231
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,920
because like, when I count up, it just feels like it doesn't,

2232
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:32,920
it's not as satisfying as reaching like the last 10, nine, eight,

2233
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,360
you know, it's just like, it's exciting.

2234
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,720
Like the lesser the number, the more exciting it gets.

2235
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,840
Like counting up is really, really tedious.

2236
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,240
It could go on forever.

2237
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,200
Like, well, okay, I reach 60,

2238
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,840
but I can't go like 61, 62,

2239
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,280
but when I'm counting down to like the last numbers,

2240
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,480
like I need to reach zero, zero, zero,

2241
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,840
and that's it, that's all, that's final.

2242
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,800
Everyone's dead.

2243
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:57,280
Tom or Gibb, do you have any boring passions in life?

2244
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:03,680
I have, well, I don't know whether it's like a boring passion.

2245
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,720
I thought just because like the things you said,

2246
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,080
what didn't seem like passions,

2247
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,600
they just seemed like funny things.

2248
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,600
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

2249
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,480
If we're talking about funny things,

2250
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,880
I like to open doors the absolute minimum amount

2251
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,360
that I need to slip through.

2252
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,120
Oh, okay, okay.

2253
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,560
Like, if I need to just leave my room,

2254
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,640
I don't open the door the full way, I don't push it.

2255
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,360
I just open it just enough to slip through like a cat.

2256
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,160
Yeah, I was gonna say you're just like a cat.

2257
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,000
Yeah, exactly like a cat.

2258
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,040
Cause I feel like, well, I mean, I'm quite thin,

2259
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,640
so I can slip through and I don't know why.

2260
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,120
I think it's just sort of something I've always done

2261
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,040
because why expend extra energy to push a heavy door

2262
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:45,880
even further?

2263
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,920
I would argue you're spending more energy

2264
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,000
by doing it this way.

2265
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,840
Okay, you know what?

2266
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:49,680
I'm not here to judge.

2267
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,520
This is just interesting.

2268
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:54,560
No, but like, I do movements like that for no reason,

2269
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,400
real reason.

2270
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,720
Like I just like weird pirouettes and like moving swiftly

2271
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,600
from like, I sort of glide.

2272
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,040
Like when I'm getting a cup of tea, you know,

2273
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,960
I put another kettle on and I sort of,

2274
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,040
when it's time to get the milk in,

2275
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,560
I sort of glide over to the fridge,

2276
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,040
pull it open with enough force to like,

2277
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,280
open the seal so that it's not like sticking

2278
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,280
and then the door slowly opens and while it's opening,

2279
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:21,200
like I let go of it to, to let it swing open slowly.

2280
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,160
I grabbed the milk and then I kick it back

2281
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,560
as I swoosh round like I twill around.

2282
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,600
Like it's completely pointless,

2283
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,480
but it's sort of like nice to have like a flow

2284
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,320
to random pointless movements.

2285
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,840
You've completely failed this question

2286
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,040
because this isn't boring at all.

2287
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,000
This is fascinating.

2288
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:36,840
Yes.

2289
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,400
Where was, where was this during

2290
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,160
Give Makes Breakfast on the rag?

2291
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,520
Yeah, I want to see those pirouettes and shit.

2292
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:46,600
Well, it's only when I'm like really, really into,

2293
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,720
not into, but like familiar with the location.

2294
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:50,560
Right, right.

2295
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,880
So like if I do something a lot,

2296
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,080
I get, I get bored of like doing it normally.

2297
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:54,920
So I just do it.

2298
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:58,160
We need a candid camera of Give Makes Breakfast

2299
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,000
in the home.

2300
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,840
That's true.

2301
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,680
Clearly.

2302
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,680
I mean, I do a lot of talking to myself in the car

2303
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,800
that I feel might be a similar sort of thing

2304
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,680
where I'll just like yell things at myself.

2305
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,520
Like just cause like I feel like I wouldn't do it

2306
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,360
if there was a crowd,

2307
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:13,080
but I like feel free and I can just like go crazy in my car.

2308
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,000
It's why I love driving.

2309
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,840
It's just like, I can just,

2310
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,680
I'm free.

2311
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:18,640
There's a sick animation video of a guy.

2312
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,720
I can't remember what it's called.

2313
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,920
I'll link it to you later.

2314
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,560
It's like a guy is in his car.

2315
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,080
He's going, he's doing a Mickey Mouse voice

2316
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,200
and he's been all completely retarded.

2317
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,160
And then he gets out of his car

2318
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:32,120
and then he walks over to someone and just says, hey,

2319
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:33,720
it's just like when you're in your car,

2320
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,880
you're completely insane.

2321
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,320
As soon as you come out, just like a normal person.

2322
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,160
It's awesome.

2323
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,000
Shout out to Sick Animation.

2324
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,960
Maybe we can find that later and look at the shots.

2325
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,000
I don't know how people do that.

2326
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,080
Even when I know I'm completely alone

2327
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,040
and no one can hear me,

2328
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:48,480
I still can't like bring myself to do like noises,

2329
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,480
like yell or sing loudly or something that I hear.

2330
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,120
I do it all the time.

2331
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,280
Yeah, I just turn into a complete idiot.

2332
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,320
I just let my full autist just come out

2333
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,160
when no one's around.

2334
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,000
I do something.

2335
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,840
I think you're joking, but that's kind of a half.

2336
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,680
When I forget.

2337
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,600
Like I'll just make weird sounds to myself.

2338
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,360
I'll be like, ew, ew, ew.

2339
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,200
I'll just do that.

2340
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,440
I do that sometimes, but only when like I'm thinking,

2341
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,320
I was like, I forgot how this sounds.

2342
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,000
Or like, would I be able to make,

2343
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,640
like would I be able to pronounce this thing?

2344
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,760
So I just randomly say things sometimes, but not loud.

2345
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,280
My brain just needs to like make sure it's alive sometimes.

2346
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,680
So it just gives me like these weird vocal spasms.

2347
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,480
It's like, yeah, your vocal cords still work.

2348
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,640
Just double checking.

2349
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,360
Oh, oh, I've actually got a boring passion.

2350
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,200
Okay.

2351
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,280
All right, I enjoy, I don't have a scrapbook,

2352
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:35,080
but I collect things as if I was going to put them

2353
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:37,120
in a scrapbook and I leave them in a drawer.

2354
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:41,400
Things like every plane ticket I have,

2355
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,320
every like thing, when they wrap the thing around the bag,

2356
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,280
the bag tags, I keep those after I rip them off.

2357
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,120
I just put them in there.

2358
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,720
Cause any tickets or things that I've been to,

2359
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,440
I'm like, you know what, that has a date on it.

2360
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,600
I can look at that date and try to remember what happened.

2361
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,920
So I'll keep it.

2362
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,640
So that's really boring, but I enjoy doing it.

2363
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:00,480
Yeah, okay.

2364
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,200
That qualifies, that qualifies.

2365
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,680
Like a stamp collecting thing.

2366
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,000
It's pretty boring for people.

2367
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,480
I mean, you know, other people don't care.

2368
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,320
Yeah.

2369
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,000
All right, all right.

2370
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,280
Tom, did you have one?

2371
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,440
I'm like trying to think of something actually.

2372
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,400
I know it's hard, right?

2373
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,800
I think mine was the total failure though.

2374
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,640
I can't think of a good one.

2375
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,040
I think there are probably things,

2376
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,800
but they just blend into my life

2377
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,720
cause I don't think about them 99% of the time.

2378
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,760
Yeah, yeah.

2379
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:26,400
It's hard to think of something that you can understand

2380
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,560
as boring and also something that you are passionate about.

2381
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,400
Yeah, that's true.

2382
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,760
Cause if you are passionate about it,

2383
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,800
you don't think of it as boring.

2384
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,640
You know what?

2385
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,520
I think I actually have one.

2386
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,720
And this is sort of demonstrably boring.

2387
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,800
It's like, I have a passion for playing video games alone

2388
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,320
or like to like just like Zen, like cause like in college,

2389
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,360
my friends would all gather around

2390
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,280
and we'd play like all these games together.

2391
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,080
But like when I was playing like

2392
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,360
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep came out during that time

2393
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,000
and like people would like try to talk to me.

2394
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I'd be like, fuck off.

2395
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,280
I'm playing like I care about what's happening.

2396
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,120
Shut the hell up.

2397
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,200
I can't stream games for that reason

2398
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,760
because I still feel like there's a crowd of people.

2399
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,800
Yeah, yeah.

2400
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,880
I mean, I would only stream a game I like don't care about

2401
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,200
or like have beaten a bunch of times.

2402
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,040
That's the only thing.

2403
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,520
If I play a new game, like get the fuck away from me.

2404
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,360
Yeah, yeah.

2405
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,520
Like when I talk to you, I don't want to see you.

2406
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:13,200
When Ben and I did our legendary T-Bat plays

2407
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,880
of Equestria Bound, I think one of the reasons

2408
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,760
it was so nightmarishly horrible

2409
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,440
and it lasted for more than a hundred episodes

2410
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:24,080
was just because like, because of this like new game syndrome

2411
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,880
where like I actually like was trying to like figure out

2412
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,600
what was going on and I'm incapable of both like being

2413
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,680
a funny let's play boy.

2414
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,120
I mean, this was years ago at this point

2415
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:35,760
and also like trying to like enjoy a new game.

2416
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,960
I can't do both at the same time.

2417
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:40,840
For a while I was streaming Devil May Cry 5

2418
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,160
or DMC Devil May Cry.

2419
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,400
And I could stream that fine

2420
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,760
because like I'd already played that game

2421
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,720
by like at least seven times by the time I streamed it.

2422
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,760
So I was like just talking in the chat

2423
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,040
and like having discussions and just like mindlessly

2424
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,400
like destroying that game because it's super easy.

2425
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,360
It's like me and my like in Boston

2426
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,480
there's this awesome theater.

2427
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,400
I don't know if it still does.

2428
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,240
I assume it still does.

2429
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:01,680
It plays the room like every like Friday night or something.

2430
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:03,840
And it's like a big event and everyone has so much fun

2431
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,960
because there's so many like community things.

2432
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,520
Like we all win the spoons appear on screen.

2433
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,400
We all throw spoons at the screen.

2434
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,240
I've seen stuff about that.

2435
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,760
You actually participate in those.

2436
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,080
Oh, that sounds so fun.

2437
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,040
We went a couple of times.

2438
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,080
Dude, it's so much fun.

2439
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,680
You guys should definitely come sometime.

2440
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:20,360
But the thing is I took my friend John to one.

2441
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,040
He had not seen the room before

2442
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,520
and this was a nightmarish experience for him.

2443
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,680
He had no idea what was going.

2444
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:28,520
He was a mistake.

2445
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:29,880
It was just like we were going anyway

2446
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:30,720
and he was in town.

2447
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:31,880
I actually haven't seen the room.

2448
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,760
I keep planning on watching it.

2449
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,000
Doug, you're gonna love it.

2450
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,840
I promise you.

2451
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,160
Yeah, I know enough about it.

2452
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,280
It's even better than Gern-Loggin.

2453
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,760
Well, let's not get crazy.

2454
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,800
I feel like I'm overhyped for the room.

2455
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,080
I feel like if I actually would have watched it,

2456
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:45,920
it wouldn't be that fun.

2457
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,480
I just, it seems fun to just like throw spoons

2458
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,120
at the screen whenever spoons appear

2459
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,960
and everyone's, spoons!

2460
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,360
It just sounds so stupid.

2461
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,200
I love it.

2462
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,560
There's times when they go outside

2463
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,720
and throw the ball around

2464
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,440
that in the theater we have footballs

2465
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:02,440
that we toss around to each other.

2466
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,000
Oh God, it's, I mean,

2467
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,640
just one of the best movie watching experiences

2468
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:06,480
I've ever had.

2469
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,800
But yeah, don't get overhyped.

2470
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,800
I remember hearing about that movie first

2471
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,840
from the nostalgia critic and his review of the room.

2472
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:14,680
That was a lot of change.

2473
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,000
And I must have watched a dozen times,

2474
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,920
a dozen times I watched that video.

2475
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,960
And then I was like, you know what?

2476
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,280
Let's actually check out the movie.

2477
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,240
And amazingly, it was even better

2478
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,040
than the nostalgia critic review.

2479
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,400
Of that movie.

2480
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,240
I know, I know.

2481
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,080
Shocking.

2482
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,880
Okay, I've got one more question.

2483
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:31,360
Actually, Tom, did you think of anything?

2484
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,200
I mean, I don't know.

2485
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,320
I mean, the only thing I can come up with

2486
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:35,680
which is super fucking mundane and really boring

2487
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,480
is that like when I'm just doing nothing sometimes,

2488
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,920
I'll have like my phone or like a computer or whatever.

2489
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:41,960
I kind of like just playing

2490
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,840
with like the little animations that they put in

2491
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,640
and just like trying to like slowly look,

2492
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,200
like sometimes like I got an iPhone right now

2493
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,840
if you swipe down, it goes like the search bar

2494
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,000
but it slowly blurs out the background.

2495
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,600
Like just slowly playing with that sometimes

2496
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,560
like watching the animation.

2497
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,640
Yeah, it's dumb.

2498
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:56,640
I'm just like, yeah, this is cool.

2499
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,480
It's a blur.

2500
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,320
Fun.

2501
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,160
And like any little thing,

2502
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,720
I'll like play with little transitions like that

2503
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,880
because I'm easily amused by things that move.

2504
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,400
I am very passionate about like whenever I'm bored

2505
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,400
or tired that I don't want to go to bed,

2506
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:14,520
placing my forehead on the table and just sitting there.

2507
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,360
Oh, that's awesome.

2508
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,040
That's a perfect example.

2509
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:20,240
She's passionate about placing her forehead on her desk.

2510
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,080
I love that.

2511
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:21,920
That's fantastic.

2512
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:22,760
Waiting for death.

2513
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:26,520
Somebody please draw a mage, waiting for death,

2514
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,200
sitting at her desk with her forehead pressed to it.

2515
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,040
Oh, I love that.

2516
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:30,880
That's so visual.

2517
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:31,720
I love that.

2518
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,400
How long will you sit there for?

2519
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,880
I sometimes actually sit for more than an hour

2520
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:36,720
because I just-

2521
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,560
Oh my God.

2522
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,880
What a logic.

2523
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:40,720
God damn.

2524
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,880
To be fair, I am thinking about things

2525
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,800
while I'm doing it.

2526
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,000
I just don't, I just can't or don't want to go to bed

2527
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,800
and I'm just too exhausted to do anything on the computer.

2528
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:51,680
I knew we'd get a good one.

2529
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:52,520
That's perfect.

2530
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,360
Yeah, that's-

2531
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:54,440
I love that.

2532
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,680
Sometimes I do something similar,

2533
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:58,040
but it's not when I'm tired,

2534
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,760
it's when I feel like death.

2535
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,040
When I'm really sick.

2536
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:05,640
And I curl up in like the prayer pose for like,

2537
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:08,200
you know, how Muslims pray,

2538
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,040
they do that pose.

2539
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,440
No, they're like head to the ground sort of thing.

2540
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,920
Yeah, I just, that's the most comfortable position.

2541
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,680
I go into the bathroom, I sit down there

2542
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,720
with my head on the ground.

2543
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:16,560
I know.

2544
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,640
And I stay there for like until I feel better.

2545
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,480
Wow.

2546
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:22,000
And it works, it works like a charm.

2547
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Mohamed has blessed you, I guess.

2548
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:24,840
I guess so.

2549
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,280
Yeah, well, fantastic.

2550
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:27,600
Are you facing Mecca when you do this?

2551
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,440
Yeah, so that's an ask.

2552
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:29,760
Are you facing Mecca?

2553
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:30,600
I've never checked.

2554
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:31,920
Oh, maybe you are.

2555
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,720
I'm probably facing Mecca like one quarter of the time.

2556
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,600
Your bathroom's positioned in such a way

2557
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,440
that you just happen to be facing the Holy Land.

2558
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:43,880
He's facing Mecca, AKA Gurren Logan, AKA Gundam.

2559
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,520
Get it, do you understand the joke?

2560
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,360
No.

2561
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,200
All right, excellent.

2562
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,040
I hate you.

2563
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:48,880
Mecca, I get it.

2564
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,040
Excellent, excellent.

2565
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:50,880
Terrible.

2566
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,240
All right, all right.

2567
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:53,720
Here's one more question.

2568
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,880
We should, where did it go?

2569
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,520
This is from RU guy, or RU guy says,

2570
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,800
I can't come up with a question.

2571
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,120
What's your favorite anime?

2572
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,920
Okay, no, I'm just kidding.

2573
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,240
This is that actually was a question though.

2574
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:06,280
You already made a terrible joke like that last week.

2575
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:08,400
That I, it's funny to me every time.

2576
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,480
Please keep asking what's your favorite anime.

2577
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,320
No, don't.

2578
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:15,000
It's so funny, I can't stop laughing every damn time.

2579
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,520
Oh shit, where did it go?

2580
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,360
Fuck, sorry.

2581
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,240
I lost my place.

2582
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,080
No, that wasn't it.

2583
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,480
It was, God damn it.

2584
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:24,320
I know I was gonna read something.

2585
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,280
This is why you don't read the ones about anime.

2586
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,280
The fucking anime questions are the bane

2587
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,000
of this fucking question section.

2588
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,960
No, I already read that one.

2589
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,720
How about, no, that's shit.

2590
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,960
Okay, here's one sort of relevant.

2591
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,120
A meme slayer, and I think another person asked this to,

2592
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,720
Iroxen basically asked,

2593
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,800
biggest dip in quality from a franchise?

2594
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,440
Like started good and did terribly.

2595
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:47,840
I mean. I'm stuck.

2596
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,280
Oh shit, and that was like, that wasn't even a reboot.

2597
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,800
That was just the same thing.

2598
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,160
It's just the same thing, it got so bad.

2599
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,160
It got so bad.

2600
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:59,000
I don't know, like, I really gotta watch that

2601
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,080
American Psycho 2,

2602
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,280
because I think it might be American Psycho 2

2603
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,320
from what I've heard.

2604
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,840
I think American Psycho 2 just makes me think of like

2605
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,960
all those not really made by Disney,

2606
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,080
not high budget Disney sequels.

2607
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:12,920
Harvest Moon.

2608
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,560
Right, Harvest Moon, really, you think so?

2609
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,640
I've only played one, and only barely.

2610
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:19,000
I've played one on the PC.

2611
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,560
Have you played that one, or seen anything about it?

2612
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,000
I've been playing Stardew Valley, but no, no, I have not.

2613
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,640
Stardew Valley is not from the franchise.

2614
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,800
It's like, there's like, it's been,

2615
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,800
Harvest Moon things sort of like split between

2616
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,680
like story of seasons and Harvest Moon,

2617
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,440
and like the original Harvest Moon people,

2618
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,560
I think are working on story of seasons games,

2619
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,040
and the current Harvest Moon is just like,

2620
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:43,400
absolute crap if you know anything about the PC one.

2621
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,120
Oof, oof, that's terrible.

2622
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,000
I never played, click disclaimer,

2623
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,680
I never played like the old Harvest Moon games

2624
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,560
because I never had a handheld.

2625
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:55,520
I played one of the story of seasons games, and it was okay.

2626
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,640
But the PC one, they charge like $40 for something

2627
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:03,240
that's like worse than like a mobile game, I feel sometimes.

2628
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,360
It's just like, oh, the graphics are so terrible.

2629
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,280
How can they charge so much?

2630
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,640
For something so horrible.

2631
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:13,280
And like, I've heard the reviews and sort of like

2632
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,600
the let's plays I've watched, I thoroughly researched

2633
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,760
because I really wanted to get a Harvest Moon for PC

2634
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,440
because I like PC games.

2635
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:24,160
But like, it's so terrible, it's not worth the money.

2636
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:28,280
It's so disappointing that I only got into the Harvest Moon

2637
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,440
when it started being absolutely shit.

2638
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,400
At least you got the old games, I guess.

2639
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,240
I've got one.

2640
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:40,040
Bionicle, the first six Bionicles were the coolest ones,

2641
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,200
and then after that, they all sucked.

2642
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,960
I totally stopped caring about Bionicle for that reason

2643
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,600
because I really liked the first designs,

2644
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,880
and they were super cool.

2645
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,200
People were really into Bionicle.

2646
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:52,080
Shut the fuck up, Nate, Bionicle's dope as shit.

2647
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,200
I will kill you.

2648
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:58,880
It literally is dope as adults of Bionicle.

2649
01:38:58,880 --> 01:38:59,880
This is a while ago.

2650
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,840
I want Bionicle so bad, but they're too expensive.

2651
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,080
And I lost all of mine.

2652
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:04,920
Dude, yes!

2653
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,640
No, Hippo, did you get like the Lego magazine back then?

2654
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,040
Did they have that in the UK?

2655
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:09,880
I did.

2656
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:12,200
Did you get like the original like DC comic book

2657
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,640
with like the little interactive CD

2658
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,040
that like introduced all the characters

2659
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,040
and like blew my mind to shit?

2660
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,160
I didn't get that little CD.

2661
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,280
It was so sick.

2662
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,080
It had like full 3D animations

2663
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,880
of like all the characters and introducing the world.

2664
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:25,000
That is a big nostalgia, but I completely forgot about that.

2665
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,680
But yeah, it was like a game cube sized CD.

2666
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:28,680
Yes.

2667
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,800
And it came with like the, it was like the first comic,

2668
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,600
I had like the one with Kopaka, the ice guy,

2669
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,960
that was like his store, his back store,

2670
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,480
and then the disc had all the characters on it.

2671
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,520
And like for the next couple of issues,

2672
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,080
just kept up a comic that told about the characters.

2673
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,000
I was like, I love this.

2674
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,040
This is the coolest shit ever.

2675
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:40,880
It was dope.

2676
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:41,960
And I bought all the sets,

2677
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,680
my mom hated me because I spent all her money,

2678
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,840
but it was so cool.

2679
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:47,400
And then like two years later, or like a year later,

2680
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,760
they changed all the designs

2681
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:49,920
and nobody looked cool anymore.

2682
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,480
And I wanted to kill myself.

2683
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,520
They fucking nummered them.

2684
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,240
They nummered all of the blind people.

2685
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,400
And they had too many bells, too many whistles.

2686
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,280
The masks were not iconic anymore.

2687
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,120
I agree.

2688
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:01,960
They sucked.

2689
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:02,800
I agree, the worst.

2690
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,840
The only bionicle spin-off I liked

2691
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,000
were the little spinny guys that turned into a ball

2692
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,200
that you could ride around those with.

2693
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,280
I remember those, yeah, yeah.

2694
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:12,760
I think Biter told me about exactly what you guys

2695
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,600
are talking about, like how they used to be cool,

2696
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,880
but they're not anymore.

2697
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:19,560
A long while ago, it's just like, this is so weird.

2698
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,680
It feels like deja vu.

2699
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,680
It still haunts me.

2700
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,680
It still haunts me, the bionicle sucks.

2701
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,200
Yeah, it's awful.

2702
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,080
That's a good answer.

2703
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,960
That's a good answer.

2704
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,560
Well, hey guys, okay, enough questions for now, I guess.

2705
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,840
But I've got a thing though.

2706
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,240
So I've got two things to say.

2707
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,760
Now, the number of the first one is I want to announce

2708
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,280
on an actual episode, in case we haven't already,

2709
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,800
the PCP Highlights channel exists now.

2710
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,920
Did we mention that last time?

2711
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:42,880
I don't think we did.

2712
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,240
I don't think we did.

2713
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,840
So there's a new channel, it's called PCP Highlights,

2714
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:50,040
and it is highlights from various PCP episodes.

2715
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:51,480
Now, it's time of recording, there's only one,

2716
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,160
but there's going to be a bunch out

2717
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,360
by the time you see this shit.

2718
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:55,680
So I'm just letting everybody know.

2719
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,440
That's where we're going to be putting highlights

2720
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,240
in little clips, episodes and shit.

2721
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,320
It's kind of trying to get off the floor right now.

2722
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,720
It's basically just me doing it.

2723
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,560
But you know, we're working on it, we're exploring.

2724
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,160
I think people are going to appreciate it.

2725
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,720
So there's that, there'll be,

2726
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,480
I'm sure there'll be a link in the description,

2727
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,160
and I'll probably put like a link in the channel banner

2728
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:14,520
as well, you know, if you have links for that.

2729
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,960
Are there people making their own clips as well already?

2730
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,600
Yeah, a bunch of people have, I only made one,

2731
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,240
a bunch of people have like submitted clips,

2732
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:23,120
and a bunch of other people have just given time codes

2733
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,480
for things they think are good things to do.

2734
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,640
And if you go, if you're a patron,

2735
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,800
and you go to the PCP Highlights channel

2736
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,520
on the PCP Patron Discord,

2737
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,200
then people are submitting stuff there

2738
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,440
that I'm like taking suggestions from.

2739
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,840
So if you just give a good moment, you know,

2740
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,080
I'll give it a look over, and we'll see how this goes.

2741
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,760
So, you know, just letting you know, just letting you know.

2742
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:46,400
Should we announce the, I think we already announced it,

2743
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,880
but like the contest for our theme?

2744
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:52,120
Yes, that was announced two episodes ago

2745
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,800
as of this happening.

2746
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,280
And it's- Yeah, we forgot to mention it last time.

2747
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,280
That's right, because like the episode hadn't come out yet,

2748
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:59,680
so nobody's submitted anything.

2749
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:02,680
But we've gotten at least one submission already

2750
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,320
from our buddy AJ Shoup.

2751
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:09,920
Now, like I, full disclosure, I have not listened to it yet.

2752
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,320
I'm like, so like we're getting them in.

2753
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:15,640
I think what we should do is by next time,

2754
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,320
by next time we should wait for them,

2755
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:19,480
some more ones to roll in, see how many we get,

2756
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:22,360
and then do a review, or like kind of go over it

2757
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,240
as a segment and see what we've got.

2758
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,520
I mean like musical themes or something.

2759
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:27,360
Yeah, yeah.

2760
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,760
Intro themes for the procrastinators.

2761
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:30,600
That's right.

2762
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:31,720
So I guess for now what we'll say is,

2763
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:34,480
so people, keep submitting them

2764
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,320
and keep sending us your shit.

2765
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:40,080
If you're a patron, go to the fanart warehouse

2766
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:40,920
and submit them.

2767
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:43,080
If you're not a patron, feel free to tweet us.

2768
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:43,920
You know, what do we say?

2769
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,800
Like hashtag PCP theme, I think was the deal,

2770
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,880
or at TPCrastinators and we'll take a peek.

2771
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,080
So do that and it sounds good.

2772
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,760
Now, the only other thing I wanted to say

2773
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,280
at the end of the episode here was,

2774
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:59,600
so a while ago we did talk about doing like highlighting

2775
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,920
people's like art and stuff.

2776
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,560
And I think we should do that.

2777
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,360
I think we should do that.

2778
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,680
So we still got that fanart warehouse

2779
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,480
in the patron discord there.

2780
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,800
Other than that, you'll have to tweet at us

2781
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,080
if you want to send us your shit.

2782
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,080
So feel free to add TPCrastinators

2783
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:19,320
and I guess hashtag PCP fanart?

2784
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,160
PCP art?

2785
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,080
I don't know, I'll check both of those.

2786
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,440
So if you guys are in the fanart warehouse thing

2787
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,240
on the patron discord, I'm looking there.

2788
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,320
I also linked one in the main chat.

2789
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,440
Check out this drawing who showed up

2790
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:34,200
in the last bonus episode of the Lord of Ghosts himself

2791
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,320
by Lens Lines.

2792
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,920
I think it's Lines Lines, I think it is.

2793
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:41,080
Looks awesome.

2794
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:41,920
It looks awesome.

2795
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,200
Does the Lord of Ghosts canonically have a gun?

2796
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:47,360
Let's be serious here.

2797
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:48,680
Well,

2798
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:49,520
I mean,

2799
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,360
Autistic Liberty is taking care.

2800
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,200
It's the ghost of a gun because gun control laws

2801
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,280
and they killed all the guns.

2802
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,360
So now it's just the ghost of a destroyed gun.

2803
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,160
Yeah, when you outlaw something,

2804
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,200
the ghosts are now, they have it.

2805
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,360
So they used to be drunk a long time ago

2806
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,680
and now they're all hooked up on drugs,

2807
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,840
but now weed is legal.

2808
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:10,800
So now all they have is guns.

2809
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,200
Excellent, excellent.

2810
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:17,680
Check out this other one from the Undertailer fan account.

2811
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:18,640
I think I've seen this around,

2812
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:20,280
but it's submitted here regardless.

2813
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:21,920
It's like, it's a magenta filter

2814
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,480
overlaid picture of Briska

2815
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:28,680
that says I have so much sex with my husband, Tavros.

2816
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,880
This is Sublime.

2817
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:31,720
This is Supreme.

2818
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,000
That's Digi.

2819
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,640
It's definitely like Digi, Briska.

2820
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:35,600
I forget the,

2821
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:39,560
I remember there was context to why he drew this

2822
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,400
and I can't remember it.

2823
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,240
Was there?

2824
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,760
I mean, I get that it's like Digi, Briska.

2825
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:45,560
Like this is what Briska would be like

2826
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,680
if she were literally Digi.

2827
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:49,280
But I like the,

2828
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,760
I actually like everything about this.

2829
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:51,600
This is great.

2830
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,520
This is fantastic.

2831
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,480
Now next one here is coming from

2832
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,960
ya boi Chip in the Franks or Chip Wiseman

2833
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,000
at Chip Wiseman Art on Twitter.

2834
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,400
And it's a picture of a good ol' arm

2835
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,360
defeating Digi for good and all

2836
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:08,880
in the legendary Radcon 3 Royal Rumble.

2837
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:09,720
I read what I-

2838
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,560
One of the most amazing moments.

2839
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,480
How he drew that, like the motion,

2840
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:13,320
so it is-

2841
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:15,160
And the impact feels tangible, I like it.

2842
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,160
Yeah.

2843
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,080
It's so dynamic.

2844
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:17,960
It's so dynamic.

2845
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,120
I love it.

2846
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:20,880
By the way, these are from like months ago.

2847
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,840
So like nobody's been submitting them.

2848
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,000
Anything that has Digi getting his ass beat

2849
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,160
is great day material to me.

2850
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:30,200
I don't know about you guys.

2851
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,040
That's, yeah.

2852
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,040
I mean, that's pretty good for now.

2853
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,320
The problem is we've just totally let this like lie

2854
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,840
and like haven't been doing it at all.

2855
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:36,680
So like we gotta-

2856
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:37,800
We've been talking about it, we never really started.

2857
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,920
So, you know, the best is right.

2858
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,440
This is the start.

2859
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:45,640
People send in images of PCP related stuff

2860
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,920
and we will talk about it next episode

2861
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,800
if you put it in or tweet at us.

2862
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,680
I think the most reliable way is to use Twitter to,

2863
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:55,760
let's develop a real hashtag right now for things for this,

2864
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,160
that I can just search the hashtag and it'll all be there.

2865
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,560
What we should do is if we're gonna do it on Twitter,

2866
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:03,120
we should just create a moment on the PCP Twitter account

2867
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,440
and gather all the tweets we got.

2868
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,760
What the hell is a goddamn moment?

2869
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,600
I don't know what-

2870
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:07,440
You never use that.

2871
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:10,000
A moment is a thing where you can save tweets

2872
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,120
in like a gallery.

2873
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,200
In a place.

2874
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,840
That sounds actually super helpful.

2875
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,040
It's what I use on Twitter for all my 3D stuff.

2876
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:16,880
I just put them in a moment.

2877
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,760
I have a moment of like when I invented

2878
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,600
the alley-oop character.

2879
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:24,960
Oh shoot, can I like make like a moment out of all

2880
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,480
like the art sort of tutorial things that I favor?

2881
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:30,320
The favorites.

2882
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,520
Yes, you can make a moment for whatever you want.

2883
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,360
Ah, that is so useful.

2884
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:35,920
I've been wanting that.

2885
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:36,760
There you go.

2886
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:37,600
Yes.

2887
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,440
Well that's cool, that's cool.

2888
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,160
So all right, so maybe we'll do that

2889
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:42,060
but I guess we should still just have a hashtag.

2890
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:45,080
All right, let's call it hashtag PCP art.

2891
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:46,000
All right, we'll go with that

2892
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,840
and just whatever you wanna submit, we will look at it.

2893
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,760
We'll do, we have to develop some like infrastructure

2894
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,520
to actually listen to like music or something.

2895
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,560
I don't know how we could work that in.

2896
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:56,640
All right, but we're working on people.

2897
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,400
We're trying to improve, we're trying to expand.

2898
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,720
And you know, people have also been asking

2899
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:02,680
about like having a voicemail box to listen to voicemails.

2900
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:04,000
I'm totally down for that.

2901
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:04,840
I'm totally down for that.

2902
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:05,720
I mean we brought that up a while ago

2903
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,320
but the problem was that logistically

2904
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:09,200
we just don't know how to do it yet but I'm sure.

2905
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,040
Yeah, that's right.

2906
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:11,120
I'm sure we're a little bit of Googling

2907
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,040
and maybe some actual effort.

2908
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,560
Please send us instructions on how to do it.

2909
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:18,640
I don't know, I'm too baby, I'm a baby.

2910
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:19,760
I hope someone sends you a link.

2911
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,520
When I hit two years old I'm gonna die

2912
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,520
and I'll be replaced by another baby.

2913
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,480
I'm not allowed to live.

2914
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:28,760
My gun won't protect me from that age limit of my life.

2915
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,800
But that's a good name.

2916
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:30,640
It's a quality name.

2917
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:33,600
Please draw that and send that to hashtag PZBR.

2918
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,200
Please draw every baby with a gun.

2919
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:39,080
Draw this perfect society of under two-year-old babies

2920
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:41,000
all armed with guns and all the two-year-olds

2921
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,960
being shipped off to the glue factory.

2922
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,440
That sounds perfect.

2923
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,840
No, to the gun factory.

2924
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:46,960
The babies become the guns.

2925
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,200
They get turned into guns.

2926
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,400
Oh my God.

2927
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,040
Well, I've done half your work for you artists.

2928
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:55,040
Now get out there and put pencil to paper.

2929
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,520
I'm the Ideas guy around here.

2930
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,600
He is the Ideas guy.

2931
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,320
All right, I think we're actually done now, everybody.

2932
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,560
Hopefully we covered everything.

2933
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,920

01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,240
Oh my God.

2942
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,480
Someone should make it so it works that way.

2943
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,440
Incredible.

2944
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:27,360
One dollar and you're in, you get into the main chat.

2945
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:31,400
You're in the fucking, the chat, the TPC.

2946
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,240
Fuck, what is it?

2947
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,520
The goddamn questions bar, the questions bar.

2948
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:35,680
But we read lots of those questions

2949
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:38,720
from in addition to the hashtag AskPCB on Twitter.

2950
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,040
And also there's like 14 fucking bonus episodes.

2951
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,600
And you get them all for patroning five dollars.

2952
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,440
That's five dollars.

2953
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:48,040
And beyond that, well, you're just a bit of a madman.

2954
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:49,040
Well, that's it everybody.

2955
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,560
Thanks for listening.

2956
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,320
Thanks for joining us for this intellectually

2957
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:53,960
stimulating conversation.

2958
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,080
I had fun.

2959
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:56,360
I had fun.

2960
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,600
I hope you did too.

2961
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,320
Yeah, me too.

2962
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,800
Four people is a nice chill sort of discussion time.

2963
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:03,640
Yeah.

2964
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:06,320
We should not have 70 people on the next episode.

2965
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,280
Well, I will be on the next episode.

2966
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:10,320
So there you go, one last person.

2967
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,600
Look forward to Mages next game review

2968
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,320
on the next episode of the PCP.

2969
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,160
Indeed.

2970
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,520
We'll insert it post, you know, in editing.

2971
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,160
We'll get a little robot to say it.

2972
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:24,800
We'll fly a little drone around Mages wherever she goes

2973
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,760
that just pipes back audio only about game review

2974
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,240
and game analysis.

2975
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:31,360
It's got an algorithm to determine.

2976
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,640
Draw that to everybody, this drone.

2977
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:34,960
This game analysis drone.

2978
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:35,800
Fucking everything.

2979
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:36,880
Draw it all, people.

2980
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,240
Draw it all.

2981
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:40,280
All right, thanks for listening, everybody.

2982
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Give us your money, you know, do that.

2983
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,080
And also, thanks for watching.

2984
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,800
See you next week, everybody.

2985
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:47,800
Bye.

2986
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:48,800
Goodbye.

2987
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,800
Bye.

2988
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:56,080
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2989
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:01,760
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2990
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,480
But I'm not working.

2991
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:07,080
I'm doing nothing.

2992
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:10,440
Why did I come jerking myself?
