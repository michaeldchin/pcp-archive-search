1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I want to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello. It's morning in America. That's not true. It's 3pm.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's not true.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Recordingly.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's the one time it isn't morning in America.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Any other day, any other week, I could have said that.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're back for some reason.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay. What's up?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, it's up for me.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, oblivionful is here. Hello.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm back-ish. I was away for a while.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Were you?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, I couldn't do anything.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Like away from the podcast or away from something else?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Away from being able to record anything, whether it be PCP or drawcast or anything else, because

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was helping Kai recover from his top surgery because he got it.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Right.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
All right, that happened.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, I didn't know that was happening, but makes sense. Well, how is he feeling? Good?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He's feeling okay.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Cool.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He's mostly got all those functions back. He just can't lift his arms over his head for a while.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Maybe a couple more months, he'll be a fully functional human again.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can only imagine, but it probably hurts. I mean, I would guess.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They take a samurai sword to it and just go.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just slice fatides right off.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
One single, it's an EI motion.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Jesus.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
God, I don't want to.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And his blood is spurred to go through everywhere.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
All over the floor, out the window.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Look, I didn't get a good look at it.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think I walked past Fatidhi Ben when the surgeon was letting me check up on him afterwards.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Are you serious?

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Are you serious?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, there was just a bin that had like some blood stains around it.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I didn't peek inside.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What do you mean a bin?

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, God, no.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's not like the kind of bin you have in your house.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I know.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It was like on wheels.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It was made out of some sturdy looking plastic.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It was like a mobile contraption.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It was just in the hallway next to the room where the surgery had taken place.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I would not.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What do you expect?

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Are we going to put it in jars?

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Look, I don't know.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I just wouldn't want to see that.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You dissolve it in acid.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Same as you do with people that assassinate presidents.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Same as you do to people on Breaking Bad when you kill them.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That was the top of last week.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Damn.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Did that happen?

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Who did they dissolve in acid?

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They dissolved a bunch of people.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They dissolved Crazy8 and that other guy.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, in the bathtub.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right, right, right.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In the bathtub, then they dissolved some other guy.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, the Victor who was like Gus's guy.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Gus slices him across the throat and they do that.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then there was that time the boy got shot by what's his face when they were doing the train robbery.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They had to put him in acid.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I mean, the character is called Todd.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So it goes.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So it goes.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Todd in the shadows.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Todd was a freak.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He was an incel.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's the most dangerous villain of all.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He was, I mean, yes, he was not good with women.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's very awkward, but he's scary because he's like actual psycho behavior.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He doesn't have any sense of remorse or sadness when killing happens.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's just like, yeah, yeah, I killed him.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I mean, it's no emotion comes through.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's like whoopsy.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not even whoopsy.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He just doesn't think much of it.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And then like when he like locks up Jesse as like a slave to make meth for them.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's just like, he acts as if Jesse is one of his friends.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's like, hey, little buddy.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But he's like still like keeping him as a slave.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hey, little buddy, whom I tortured.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How are you doing?

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
How are you doing, buckle?

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How was he doing?

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Not good.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's too bad.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
At least he can lift his hands over his head.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
At least he didn't have his chest at least severed with a samurai sword.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Alyssa is not forced to sleep on his back for a month and a half, possibly two months.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, so he should sleep on your back.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can't.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I mean, imagine a lot of people do that.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't sleep on your front.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Like if you got butt surgery and you have to sleep face down.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's fine.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I should get that because I'm already doing what you need to do to deal with it.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Sleeping face down is what you do when you're dead because you don't have to breathe.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Face down?

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, sleeping on your face.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I find it very difficult to sleep face down.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can only sleep on my side.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I can't sleep on front or back.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I used to sleep on my side.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now I sleep face down always.

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Where does your nose go?

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I mean, I don't know.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have like a pillow in my head.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is your head turned to the side?

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Are you straightening your neck?

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No, no.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I keep my face directly straight forward, like directly nose pointed towards the core

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
of the earth into the pillow.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, yeah.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I turn my head to the side.

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I keep my arms, arms up, arms up crossed, head on the arms, head to one side.

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sometimes my neck hurts, but not usually.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What do you mean arms up?

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How are you?

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
As in my arms, like above.

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, like above, yeah, yeah, I get it.

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Like forward, like I'm laying on my front and arms.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I was thinking like you were crossing them backwards over your back.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Like behind your back.

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Arms up from my downwards sideways laying orientation.

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you understand.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But like if you're trying to say.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Where do your giant titties go?

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you have like holes cut out in the back?

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's a secret that I will take to my grave.

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Maybe we should get new.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Maybe we should get new to draw a comic about that.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Not so at all.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I mean, I would like to see a new, new comic.

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
True.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That would be cool.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I guess we can.

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I was inspired by new.

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I drew Gib with giant titties a few weeks ago.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
When did, when was that?

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It was a birthday gift.

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, I don't know if I saw that one.

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, it turned into a birthday gift, I think.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You were planning to do it anyway, but it was great.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I started drawing it and I was like, I was like slow because, okay.

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I was recovering.

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He took my bed and the futon that he was sleeping on,

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
we just put in the closet and I've been sleeping in the living room,

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I guess to give him space, but for the first week,

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
he couldn't like leave the bed at all except to like use a bathroom,

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I guess.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So I was using his computer in our room and just changing,

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
like just putting on like long YouTube videos to help him sleep

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because he was like, he had a lot of pain medication and he was just

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
kind of sleeping for like most of the first week.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And the plan was to use his Sintiq and draw a little bit,

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but it was hard because the Sintiq is clunky.

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sintiqs are not as good as XP pens in my experience having used both of them now.

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But yeah, I wanted to draw like for the whole like couple weeks,

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'd be looking after him.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I only got a little bit of drawing done and one of them was a drawing a gib

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and it was taken a long time because I was distracted by a bunch of things.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But then, but then I found out, oh, give his birthday tomorrow.

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I'm like, oh, shit.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can't, I don't know if I can finish that in time,

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but I'll, I'll try and get it done soon.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And then I did a couple of days later.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh, yeah.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And I guess I can, we can't exactly, we'll have to like censor it

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
because there's some nudity, but I can post here.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I haven't posted it anywhere outside of big boobie mommy milkers yet.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, that's the place for it.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That is the place.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's early access to the place to be.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I want to guess my Patreon discord slot too, but I'll just drop that in the chat.

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, there they are.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yep.

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What do you draw in?

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Program.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I use clip studio paint.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I also use clip studio paint.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I got frustrated with it.

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I got mad at it this week.

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What did it do to you this weekend?

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Uh, uh, what did I, what did I need?

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I needed to, oh yeah, I was working on, I'm trying to finalize the like print files

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
for the slime and punishment book and I needed to adjust the greens.

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I needed to adjust my colors to account to, to minimize the damage

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
that converting from RGB to CMYK.

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, so I'm trying green.

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's very hard to print for some reason.

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I remember.

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So I'm trying to like, you know, reduce the harm that will be done

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and to do that I'm trying to, I need, I wanted to make a layer

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
that would basically apply a filter only to areas that were green, right?

208
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I wanted to, you know, maybe shift the hue into more of the yellow

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to make it a little easier to print

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
or maybe just brighten them to account for the loss of saturation

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
or something like that.

212
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Uh, and it was just impossible to do it in Clip Studio Paint.

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It just doesn't have what it takes.

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There's no, I couldn't even like, even though, like, oh yeah,

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
that's more of a Photoshop thing.

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah, I ended up having to use Photoshop.

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I ended up having to use Photoshop and then once I gave up on Clip Studio

218
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and I went to Photoshop, I found how to do it in like five minutes.

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I was like, oh, okay.

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's literally just a button I can hit.

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, that's as close to yours for art.

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And Photoshop is for image manipulation in general.

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I mean, it seems like a lot of people draw in Photoshop.

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's funny.

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I think Photoshop, a lot of people got into Photoshop as a drawing tool,

227
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
not really thinking to use it as an image manipulation thing

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
because it was like, ah, this is really good for all these things,

229
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
all these tools.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But actual drawing programs are much more limited on all that extra stuff.

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So you sort of, if you started with Photoshop,

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
it seems like all these other programs are missing something.

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You know, I tried to...

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's actually not true.

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I started out thinking I could do it.

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was like, okay, I'll take the layer, I'll duplicate it,

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and then I will, you know, use the color curve tools

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
to take away all the blue and the red and leave only the green.

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And that gave me a layer, but the whites still became...

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It kept the whites, and I was like, okay,

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but I want to get rid of the whites.

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I only want to keep the things that are green and not anything else.

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So then I did that, and then I did it again,

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
but I took away the green,

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
so I was left with something that was only blue and red.

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And then I subtracted that purple layer from the green layer

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
to get one that was all the greens

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and nothing that was not specifically green.

249
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And then I had sort of a map layer of the original image,

250
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and I was like, okay, now I want to use this sort of brightness map

251
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
as a, what's the word, a mask for a, you know,

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
an adjustment layer to change hue and brightness.

253
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And you can't do it.

254
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can't like copy paste an image to be a mask layer

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
for like a color adjustment layer.

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The only thing you can do to like the mask for that is like,

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
just draw directly, like erase areas with like an eraser tool.

258
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And that sounds so convoluted.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah.

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And after effects, you could just like literally use

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
via the Luma key, like select the green, like a green screen,

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
but instead of removing it, you use that to like create like a mask

263
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
where you can like have like a more brightly saturated green

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
or where you could just like apply like hue, like filters and shit

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
to like the green parts to like make them stand out more.

266
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You can do that with a couple layers.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
In Photoshop, there's literally, I couldn't believe it.

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
All you had to do was make a hue adjustment layer

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and there's just a button in the layer panel.

270
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's like, do you, you can like select where on the color spectrum

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
you want it to specifically apply to.

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's literally just, there's a button for it.

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You don't have to do anything.

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I couldn't believe it.

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah.

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So that was neat, I guess.

277
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was glad to discover.

278
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I was glad that I gave up on Clip Studio Paint quickly.

279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, her vast specific task, yeah.

280
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I was a little intimidated by Photoshop.

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I haven't really used it that much.

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I find it kind of a hassle.

283
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And sometimes it has trouble like launching on my computer for some reason

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
because I have a pirated copy.

285
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I didn't pay for it.

286
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I have a paid for copy in it.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I can confirm it's slow as fuck.

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
My biggest issue with Photoshop is though.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There's funny things you can do with like caching things

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and stuff to make it run quicker.

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't know.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There's tutorials.

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I've ever had similar problems.

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I had to look into like how to make Photoshop boot up quicker.

295
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And there are like some things you can do.

296
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But it worked out fine.

297
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It was pretty good.

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If it boots up quickly, I'm still going to be annoyed.

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Photoshop is just filled with a bunch of like little annoying things

300
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
that just make me pull my hair out.

301
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Like the workflow, especially for like art,

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
the workflow in Clip Studio is a lot faster.

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Like messing with layers and stuff like that

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
is just a lot quicker and easier and more intuitive, I feel.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But Photoshop has one glitch

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
that is the worst fucking thing in the world.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Like let's say like you click on a layer

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and you click on the opacity

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and you want to change it from like 100 to 50

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and then you go to click out.

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The opacity button will stay selected like no matter what you do.

312
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And then I'll like try to like go to some other box

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to change the brush size and I type in 20 for brush size.

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Even though I clicked on the brush size box,

315
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
it'll change the opacity to 20 instead.

316
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I can't like deselect opacity

317
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
or if I'm trying to change the zoom.

318
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Because in Clip Studio, you can just like,

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I just have a wheel on my tablet that lets me zoom in and out.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That doesn't work on Photoshop.

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So I have to type in the zoom level manually

322
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and when I go to type it in, it just changes the opacity layer

323
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
to just font size layer or whatever.

324
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Like any box where you type in a number,

325
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
it won't let you deselect it for some reason.

326
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And you have to like try clicking out of it

327
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
like 20 times before it works.

328
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I fucking hate it.

329
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's been like this for the last couple of updates.

330
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And it's annoying.

331
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I scream when I use Photoshop.

332
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It sucks.

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I like Photoshop for doing like sweeper and hella Jeff style.

334
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Like Photoshop fuckery.

335
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, I'm just messing things up.

336
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And like it looks bad on purpose.

337
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's the perfect program for that.

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It looks bad in ways you couldn't even imagine

339
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that things could look bad.

340
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It looks bad in ways you couldn't imagine.

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
New ways to ruin art.

342
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Very nice.

343
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Very good.

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's true.

345
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm trying to look for...

346
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I got a thing to say.

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's not that big a thing.

348
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Is it like that misfit song?

349
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is there a song where the misfits that goes like

350
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I got something to say

351
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I raped your mother today.

352
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm pretty sure that's a song.

353
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's not that.

354
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's there's heat wave time in the UK.

355
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Today it reached like 30 degrees,

356
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
which is like 87 or 86 Fahrenheit.

357
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Tomorrow though,

358
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
it's going to go predicted to go to 40,

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
41 degrees,

360
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
which is 106 Fahrenheit.

361
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's the highest temperature,

362
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
potentially not happened yet.

363
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Biggest temperature ever to be recorded in the UK.

364
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Wow, really?

365
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

366
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And a few summers ago,

367
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it was like 38 point something centigrade.

368
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And now it's 41.

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's like Mediterranean like

370
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
summer levels in the UK,

371
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
which is not very exciting.

372
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That's very exciting for you.

373
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, it's no.

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We don't have.

375
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I love that for you.

376
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We don't have the facilities.

377
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
People are definitely going to die of heat related things

378
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
like dying.

379
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't know how you die from heat.

380
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Like a water probably.

381
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll show you.

382
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Damn.

383
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Air conditioning is not common

384
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
because we don't need it.

385
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And it's expensive.

386
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And the buildings are designed to keep.

387
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's what you think winter.

388
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah.

389
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Because it does like big old green houses,

390
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
but they're bricks.

391
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, I don't know about green.

392
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Brown house green.

393
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I didn't paint it.

394
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Brick Brown.

395
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So yeah, to today,

396
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
green, whether you can't,

397
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
you can't print those then.

398
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You can't print the CMYK.

399
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
How the fuck did they make green paint?

400
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It doesn't make any sense.

401
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Green is like the anti-pain.

402
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It would consume itself and vanish from the surface.

403
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This is an Omega based play for an artist,

404
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
like a real physical artist.

405
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You take green paints

406
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and you make a really big green image.

407
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And then when people try to like,

408
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know, sell like prints of it,

409
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
it's not going to look as good.

410
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You got to actually go to the museum

411
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and see it or own it.

412
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's a real experience sort of thing.

413
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Paint with green.

414
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, you know, I ordered a test,

415
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
a bunch of like paper samples

416
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
from this company called

417
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Comics Wellspring,

418
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
which has horrible pricing.

419
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Absolute horrible.

420
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I would never actually buy from them.

421
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Thanks for the samples, you suckers.

422
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But they do offer.

423
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You can do a thing where like,

424
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you can designate an area of the page,

425
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
but they'll put like foil in the page.

426
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You know, you can have like a little like,

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
a little like reflective foil kind of poke through

428
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
some parts if you want it to be shiny.

429
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's like, what if I made it,

430
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
what if I made it like green foil?

431
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What if I made the slime, you know,

432
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
reflective green?

433
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Wouldn't that be nifty?

434
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That would be nifty.

435
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I think there are, okay,

436
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
there are fluorescent inks

437
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
that you could print with,

438
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
but if they're not standard,

439
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
it would have to be like a custom job.

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm sure it would balloon the price.

441
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And I mean, the price is fucking high enough already,

442
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
printing a whole book in full photo color.

443
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So, you know, sorry, it's terrible.

444
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Just terrible.

445
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Although I did find a company on Alibaba

446
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
that seems to have some like pretty decent price.

447
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I found one that I think I might be able to get them

448
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
for like a hundred copies for like $15 a piece,

449
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
including shipping, which is like, that's pretty good.

450
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That's pretty good as long as the quality is not terrible.

451
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So, yeah, I'm hoping that.

452
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hoping that works out.

453
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
She won't, she hasn't gotten back to me.

454
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
She's bad about responding.

455
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I asked that lady for a template.

456
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I was like, can I have a page template, please?

457
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And then it was Friday.

458
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And I think like her shift ended.

459
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And then she didn't get back to me and I'm waiting for Monday.

460
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm gonna have a goddamn page template.

461
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sending my damn files.

462
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Damn.

463
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's, that's, that's what's going on.

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You know, I was doing some crafts this week.

465
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I had some ideas for things that I could potentially do

466
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
as stretch goals for the Kickstarter.

467
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And I've been crafting.

468
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I learned how to etch a glass.

469
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Which is, yeah, with like chemicals.

470
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
With like a, um.

471
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Like you put a stencil and you just spread a thing on a glass.

472
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes.

473
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I found, okay, most of the time, like stencils like that,

474
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
they're like not reusable.

475
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But I found a company called Icon Art that sells these stencils,

476
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
or it's like a system for making stencils that are reusable.

477
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Like they are a sort of like vinyl covering over a fine mesh.

478
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And so you can sort of get a design into the vinyl

479
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
that will hold together and it won't fall apart when you use it.

480
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And it's theoretically reusable.

481
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But you have to do it.

482
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay.

483
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
They sell this system for doing it that costs like two or $300.

484
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And it comes with like these sheets of this like, you know,

485
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
this mesh and coating.

486
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And then it comes with this stand with like a black light,

487
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
or like a UV light.

488
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And you're supposed to put your design over it

489
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and then shine the black light on it.

490
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And then that will like do some reaction to the coating.

491
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And then you rinse it off.

492
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And like if you did it right,

493
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
the covered parts that you covered with your design

494
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
wash off the stencil and the parts that were uncovered

495
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that got exposed to UV light,

496
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
like they harden and they stay on.

497
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And this is how it creates this reusable design.

498
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And so I was like, that sounds great,

499
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
but I don't want to spend $300.

500
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So I just bought the, I bought some sheets of the stuff

501
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and then I just bought my own little like black light

502
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and I just fucked around with it.

503
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I cut out a little piece and I did experiments with it.

504
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And I found out just how to do it myself.

505
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Didn't buy the stand,

506
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
saved like $150 because I just figured out

507
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
how do you kind of sort of shine my own little light on it

508
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and get it to work.

509
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Fuck you icon art.

510
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I love your product.

511
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And that was my, that's my story.

512
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's my glass etching story.

513
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What are you etching into the glass

514
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and what sort of glass is it?

515
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Like is it the size of a little key chain?

516
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's a, it's a bottle.

517
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's bottles.

518
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh my God.

519
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah.

520
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You're going to put slime in a bottle with etched glass.

521
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I won't admit that that's what I'm going to do.

522
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That's insane.

523
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Do you want to, yeah, do you want to see?

524
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, I can show you.

525
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I do want to see.

526
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I saw you post a picture of slime earlier.

527
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
All right.

528
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Well, give me a second and I will show you what I've got.

529
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah.

530
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That, that one pencilmation episode featuring Ben St is coming true.

531
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Wait.

532
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Why?

533
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
What, what happens?

534
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Because you're going to fall into a slime.

535
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Um, one second.

536
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I got to take a picture.

537
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Actually, I got to take two pictures because I'll show,

538
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'll show you in, in like regular light.

539
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And I'll show you in black light because it looks really good.

540
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Now, I don't know.

541
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
This might be like too much.

542
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This might be too much work and impossible.

543
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So like,

544
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I feel like the amount of labor and materials you're putting in is unheard of.

545
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I might, it might be going a little bit up for it.

546
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That could be like a super high donation thing.

547
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The etching doesn't really, it's kind of hard to see.

548
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Ah, it's kind of hard to see on the camera.

549
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Okay, I'll show you.

550
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You can see it on an empty bottle.

551
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
They're all filled with slime.

552
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay, here we go.

553
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's, it's a little bit hard to see.

554
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
All right, come on.

555
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah.

556
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Uh, all right, give me a sec.

557
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I got to find my, I got to find my black light.

558
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
The only thing I know black lights for is that they show semen.

559
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Wow.

560
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Because they use that in the, the shows where they're like, what's, let's find.

561
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh, there's for blood.

562
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
They find blood as well.

563
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But mostly I remember the semen.

564
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I remember the semen.

565
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Maybe it doesn't find blood actually.

566
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm not sure.

567
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I don't think it finds blood.

568
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Luminal finds blood.

569
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That's the different thing.

570
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah.

571
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I remember that from Ace Attorney on DS, the secret extra thing, the lady, science lady.

572
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I know that from Detective Conan from the other thing called Japan.

573
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
They're both from Japan.

574
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Wow.

575
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm sorry.

576
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Detective Conan.

577
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

578
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm back.

579
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Welcome back.

580
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Show this stupid, stupid.

581
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Oh, Marin.

582
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Marin's going to get excited when he sees this.

583
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh.

584
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh.

585
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Oh my God.

586
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Yeah.

587
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It looks pretty good, right?

588
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah.

589
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Hang on.

590
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yo.

591
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's blowing up big.

592
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So like product of New Los Angeles City, AKA Neo Milwaukee.

593
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That looks, that text looks very clean.

594
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That is kind of a big bottle.

595
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I was thinking of like a tiny little slime thing.

596
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's like a smallish, like olive oil bottle.

597
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah.

598
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's like a shower gel.

599
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It looks like.

600
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's only six or eight fluid ounces that it actually holds.

601
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So anyway, that's what I did this week.

602
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean, I didn't spend the whole week on that.

603
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But like I bought, I think I bought this stuff like shortly after we discussed.

604
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I think on the PCP last week, I said, haha, what if I gave people slime?

605
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And now it's here.

606
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And now there it is.

607
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Be disastrously expensive to ship.

608
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Not if I pretend that it's not in the box and I ship with media mail.

609
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Here's the thing.

610
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I hope that works out.

611
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Oblivion fault.

612
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Here's the thing.

613
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
We talked about this last week.

614
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And the book is already going to be disastrously expensive to ship.

615
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
True.

616
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The only way that it won't be is if I use media mail.

617
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm going to just kind of, I'm going to try and like send some shit through media mail

618
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
that like technically shouldn't be sent through media mail and just like see if it works.

619
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And like if it works, I'm just going to do that.

620
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And like if some of them get caught, like, oh well.

621
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Alternatively, you could just make it up the price that people have to pay for it.

622
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So that way it works out.

623
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I want, I will, I will have to charge for shipping.

624
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I mean, I mean, I don't want to charge people more money.

625
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's bad.

626
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Foreign shipping will be like $40.

627
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So that's, so that's a nightmare.

628
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
That's a nightmare.

629
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But I think if I, if I can get away with using media mail domestically, then I think I can

630
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:34,000
slightly overcharge for shipping domestically and then like undercharge for fucking, you

631
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
know, I don't want to charge people $40 shipping for international.

632
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And because like most orders will not be international, I feel like I might be able to get away with

633
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
that margins wise.

634
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That's my, that's my plan.

635
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
If I actually had to spend like $30 on shipping every individual order, which is like what

636
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
it is, I don't know, that's like, that almost makes me think I just shouldn't do it.

637
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So, you know, that can't, that can't be true.

638
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah.

639
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
All right.

640
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
That would, that's my crafts.

641
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That's my craft.

642
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Craft corner with Ben.

643
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Thanks.

644
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's edible.

645
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's, it's, it's edible by the way.

646
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You can eat it.

647
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Oh, you can eat.

648
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Okay.

649
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah.

650
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I mean, I probably wouldn't want to because it's so cool.

651
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah.

652
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What, what is it?

653
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Is it like, is it syrupy?

654
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It is.

655
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I mean, it is mostly not to, not to, not to break the illusion or anything, but it is mostly

656
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
corn.

657
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
No, no, don't say it.

658
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's mostly, it's mostly corn syrup.

659
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
No, the illusion shattered.

660
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The slime is mostly corn syrup.

661
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's, it, you heard it here.

662
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, true.

663
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's quite, it's quite tart.

664
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's quite sour.

665
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's, it's good.

666
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You could make a slime and tonic out of it.

667
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh, you could put that in a shot glass and do a little slime shot.

668
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah, you could.

669
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You know, I mean, you could, you could make, you could make your own if you wanted to.

670
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, actually, I mean, the, the only like hard to find thing in it is like the fluorescent

671
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the fluorescent additive that stuff.

672
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I mean, I don't know.

673
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You have to get it yourself.

674
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That's a work around here.

675
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Here's a media mail, minimum eight pages.

676
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's a book just explaining where to buy the bottle, how to do the glass etching, how

677
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
to make the slime, just all the instructions to make yourself at home.

678
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
My, my idea was that I would send it with the book.

679
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So, oh, oh, you mean like instead of sending the bottle, just, just send a little pamphlet

680
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
explaining it.

681
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah.

682
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah.

683
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Pay for my secrets.

684
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I ordered a bunch of rocks too.

685
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I ordered a bunch of different kinds of greenish rocks.

686
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And we'll see which ones look the best and which ones are the most cost effective.

687
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What do they got?

688
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I got floor, I got calcite.

689
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I got the, I don't think I bought, I don't think I bought green jade because I thought

690
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
that was stuff was kind of expensive.

691
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Calcite is pretty cool though.

692
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm optimistic.

693
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
The calcite looks pretty good in the promo photos.

694
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm optimistic to see how that's going to look.

695
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You got to secure all these rocks because if they, if they crack into the glass, you

696
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
get slime all over your book.

697
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah.

698
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah.

699
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And in a box, I would probably fill it with like packing peanuts or something.

700
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I would probably wrap every individual piece with like bubble wrap or something is the

701
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
idea there.

702
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Where did I, I got Amazonites.

703
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I don't think I'll use Amazonites.

704
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I think it's that shitty company.

705
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't, I don't feel like that's a good one.

706
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah.

707
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Or no, no, no, not Amazonite.

708
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Aventureen.

709
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Aventureen is what I was thinking.

710
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I don't think I'll go with that.

711
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I think it's like more like a pale, like turquoise color.

712
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So like, I got the crazy light, which I'd never even heard of before, but it's green.

713
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So worth a shot.

714
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And I think that's all I just got before.

715
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I bought like a pound of each.

716
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I don't know.

717
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's going to be fun.

718
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's going to be fun this week waiting for the, I know, I know.

719
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm just having fun with it.

720
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm just having fun with it, you know.

721
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Very whimsically.

722
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I just, I like making, making funny little, funny little themed gifts, I guess.

723
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I don't know.

724
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And trinkets.

725
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You should have a real, you should have a potion shop.

726
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You should have like a real, you could be a traveling like trinket vendor.

727
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Bizarre.

728
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah.

729
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Like the guy in at the beginning of Aladdin.

730
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
He sells the thing that makes Julian fries.

731
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yes.

732
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah.

733
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah.

734
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
He sells, he sells it on Alibaba.

735
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Alibaba is.

736
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
That's the name of the camel.

737
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Alibaba is so good.

738
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
They just have stuff for just.

739
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Just have everything cheap.

740
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Just have everything cheap.

741
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah.

742
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
There's like a, there's a million, there's a million vendors and they all have names

743
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
that I can't pronounce or even distinguish from each other half the time.

744
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But if I sift through them, I will always find stuff at like half the price I would

745
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
pay for something from the Western of Western vendor.

746
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Only then the shipping costs like 10 times as much.

747
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So it's sort of evens out.

748
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But unlike Western vendors that have things like minimum wage and all that expensive.

749
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The children want to work.

750
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
How dare you bar?

751
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
How dare you keep all these children unemployed against their will?

752
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Joe Brandon dark Brandon rising.

753
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That's crazy.

754
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Gas prices going down.

755
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
That's the worst of dark Brandon.

756
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Gas prices going up.

757
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Yeah.

758
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Oh, fucking.

759
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That was a thing that happened a couple of days ago.

760
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Elon Musk and Trump were having a little fight.

761
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
They were having a little.

762
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, yeah.

763
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
A little spat.

764
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I am that that Irish accountant that Irish like a finance YouTuber that I watch.

765
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
He had a video explaining the Elon Musk situation.

766
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And Elon is like boned.

767
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
He's like totally toast.

768
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah.

769
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's like he didn't know what he was doing at any step.

770
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
He 100% is like by any reasonable metric like already agreed to buy the company and

771
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
there's no backing out.

772
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Just look at that power stance.

773
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh, does he actually have to spend the what was it 40 billion?

774
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
He might be able to negotiate a there was like a backing out fee of a billion.

775
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But or but like the agreement was to buy it for 40 billion.

776
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But like he's passed the point where he would have been able to just pay the 1 billion to

777
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
get out of it.

778
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So he will probably have to either.

779
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Go through with the deal and maybe he can negotiate a lower price than the 40 billion

780
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
or he will have to back out and probably negotiate a bigger fee than the 1 billion.

781
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But it's, you know, going to cost him a lot.

782
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Lol.

783
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah, lol.

784
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
He totally fucked it up.

785
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I saw him like making means like coping means.

786
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah.

787
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Twitter.

788
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That will definitely be that are already being used against him in court.

789
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Like his legal team.

790
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Just should have told him don't post memes about an ongoing legal dispute.

791
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Sir.

792
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Sir Musk, please.

793
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But he couldn't help it.

794
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Can't help it.

795
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
No one tells him what to do.

796
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Well, I hope he can.

797
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That's it.

798
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
He's a very distasteful man.

799
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The very distasteful man in my opinion.

800
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You know what it isn't a distasteful man.

801
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
The Eye of Sauron.

802
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Hmm.

803
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah.

804
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
True.

805
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Did you know?

806
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
He is no man at all.

807
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
In fact, he is one of the Vaynor or whatever.

808
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The Aeneir?

809
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah.

810
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The deities of some kind.

811
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
There's like a, I forget all of the mythology.

812
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I saw a YouTube video about it one time and I think I know what I'm talking about.

813
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yes.

814
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Who'd you be graded a fucking video?

815
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh, he's one of them.

816
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
He's one of them.

817
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah.

818
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah.

819
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But like I noticed.

820
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I noticed the other day that was just drawing endless war.

821
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Just doodling him.

822
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
As one does.

823
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah.

824
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And I was like, I'll draw endless war.

825
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Just doodling him.

826
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
As one does.

827
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah.

828
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And I was like, I'll draw endless mud next to him.

829
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And it's like, wait a minute.

830
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Eye of Sauron is an eye on a plinth on a pillar.

831
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
He must be related.

832
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
He must be like, he must be another endless.

833
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The resemblance is uncanny.

834
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Oh my gosh.

835
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It's a little racist though, don't you think?

836
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You think they all know each other?

837
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah.

838
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Eyes.

839
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
They're so tall.

840
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
They have eyes.

841
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
They can look.

842
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
They can see each other.

843
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Well, we just had the last RFCK art contest was about death furnaces.

844
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And there were a bunch of different ones.

845
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Let's see what was there.

846
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
There was Endless Oil, Endless Mochi, Endless Entertainment.

847
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Endless Mochi.

848
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Endless Mochi is awesome.

849
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Prince Annihilation drew.

850
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's like a big mouth.

851
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I want to see these.

852
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I agree.

853
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You know what?

854
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'll find that one.

855
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
There was also Endless Expansion in the Big Booby Mummy Mocha one, which is a giant dome

856
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
that looks like a booby.

857
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
That one's got to count for something.

858
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
That's on a death furnace.

859
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That's a breast furnace.

860
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yes.

861
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Let's see here.

862
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm going to find it.

863
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Sauron would be called Endless Search.

864
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Endless Orcs.

865
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The One Ring.

866
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Endless Orcs.

867
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Endless Pain.

868
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Rar.

869
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Rar.

870
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
He would say Rar.

871
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Sorry.

872
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm going to be quiet for a minute while I find the thing.

873
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
That's right.

874
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I have a small in the middle tangent speaking of racism.

875
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah.

876
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You know how GitHub got rid of master and slave terminology?

877
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, yeah.

878
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I did hear about that.

879
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
No, I did not.

880
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Some people, it's like a coding thing where one code drives another code or some shit.

881
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I don't know.

882
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm not a codeman, but they're like, we're changing the terminology because it's just

883
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
tasteful, which is like, sure, whatever.

884
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I don't care.

885
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Some people get super mad over it, though, which is funny.

886
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah.

887
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Because we were talking about Photoshop earlier.

888
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Ben was talking about getting rid of the whites, which I thought was really funny.

889
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I did say that and I almost made a joke about it.

890
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But listen, I was on an important tangent and I didn't want to get distracted.

891
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I know.

892
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I understood.

893
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I laughed.

894
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,500
But there's another terminology that I hear a lot when talking about color grading, which

895
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,000
is crushing the blacks.

896
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yes.

897
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I know about crushing the blacks.

898
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Believe me.

899
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
How long are we going to keep that around for?

900
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I wonder.

901
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I haven't heard anyone talk about it being problematic, but I'm like, surely, surely

902
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
someone would complain.

903
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It's fine.

904
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
What is it describing, though?

905
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It's when you adjust the contrast of an image so that the dark areas become pure black.

906
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Like 00 on the RGB, basically.

907
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah.

908
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I don't have a problem with that one.

909
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I feel like that is just describing what it is.

910
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's like darkening the blacks.

911
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Darkening.

912
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
What did I see?

913
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:33,000
There was somebody on Twitter, I think, I saw someone added Crayola because they had

914
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
a black colored pencil and it said Negro on it.

915
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And they were like, yeah, Crayola, what the hell is this?

916
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And they were like, yes, we're an international company.

917
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That is the Spanish word for black.

918
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And he was like, no, he was actually mad because they also had the French translation and he

919
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
made a joke like, why would you include French?

920
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I hate France.

921
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's like, ha, ha, ha.

922
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Very, very, how drool.

923
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Anyway, it's like that.

924
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I mean, it's like that, though.

925
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It's just the word.

926
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's also the word for the color.

927
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah.

928
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I think the GitHub thing makes more sense just because many words can replace this fake

929
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
thing that you made up of a thing being in charge of another thing.

930
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I've seen parent and child be used in a monster and slave.

931
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We wouldn't want to offend any slaves who are using the code to build any programs for

932
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
their masters.

933
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The thing that would be annoying is the code terminology changes and now all the coders

934
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
have to learn or their code breaks and they have to fix it.

935
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But, you know, I don't know.

936
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Here, I found not going to be a major problem.

937
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I found this from Prince's Death Furnace art.

938
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That's cool.

939
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Well, that mountain has a big fucking sideways.

940
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It was the dark spooky one.

941
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That's Endless Oil.

942
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
He was new.

943
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
There was Endless Mochi.

944
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That's Endless Mochi on the bottom right there.

945
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I like that one a lot.

946
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Just a mountain with a sideways mouth.

947
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's got that, I don't know if you call it, but that like sort of like flat cloud design

948
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
thing going on.

949
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I don't know.

950
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
What do you mean?

951
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I mean, the way that like the smoke looks, it looks like, I don't know, it looks like

952
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:51,000
a very stylized sort of like, oh, the clouds are a flat geometric shape.

953
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
In a sort of Asian way, I don't know how to describe it.

954
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I mean, sometimes clouds do be like that.

955
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Oh, what?

956
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah.

957
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Sometimes they do have a flat bottom and then like a bulb is swirly atop.

958
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And it's like, wow, that's just like Toy Story.

959
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It's almost like art is based on real life.

960
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's almost like art is based.

961
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh, no, I hate art.

962
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I hate art now.

963
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't like it anymore.

964
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So thanks for that.

965
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah.

966
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Thanks for reminding me how bad art is.

967
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Yeah.

968
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
How much it sucks.

969
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I have to pee.

970
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'll be back in a minute.

971
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I have to clean.

972
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I have to help clean.

973
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We'll take a break and spend his pee.

974
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'll be back.

975
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I believe in fall has gone for a second.

976
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Ow.

977
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Okay.

978
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Well, now that's the episode.

979
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
No.

980
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
What do we go?

981
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I mean, we've been going for a long time, right?

982
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
We've been good.

983
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
That's an episode.

984
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That's another one in the can.

985
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
No, no, no.

986
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yes.

987
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You must die.

988
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yes, yes, yes.

989
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Kill me.

990
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
End it.

991
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
End this charade.

992
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I can't do it.

993
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You're so cute.

994
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Come on.

995
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Come on.

996
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Pussy.

997
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Nah.

998
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Thor's gone away into boiling acid.

999
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Fine.

1000
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
World peace.

1001
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Okay.

1002
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Okay, I guess.

1003
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I don't know why we have open vats of boiling acid in world peace.

1004
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
World peace?

1005
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
What?

1006
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Are you describing a real phenomenon?

1007
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
What are you talking about?

1008
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
World peace?

1009
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I can't even comprehend this.

1010
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I just realized Elon's tie is a little short.

1011
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Elon's tie doesn't even reach to his belt.

1012
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah.

1013
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You gotta have a lead lined tie and droop it low so that if you're hit with radiation,

1014
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
your penis and genitals are protected with the lead in the tie.

1015
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So you can't get zapped by aliens with their radiation guns.

1016
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I continue to wonder whether I should shave my head or not.

1017
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I am continuously on the fence about whether my hair is worth keeping.

1018
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And I just can't.

1019
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Does it fill you with joy?

1020
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
No.

1021
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Well, get rid of it.

1022
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Burn it.

1023
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Throw it away.

1024
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Well, that, I mean, would that make me feel even worse though?

1025
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Yes.

1026
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
No, I'm already filled with that actually.

1027
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Fuck.

1028
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yeah.

1029
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Sorry.

1030
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
No more.

1031
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
No vacancies.

1032
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
There's no fixing that problem.

1033
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I mean, would you consider taking like chemicals to grow your hair back?

1034
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That's not something.

1035
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
That's not an option.

1036
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It's not an option.

1037
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
How do you know it's not an option?

1038
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Well, I know that you can't.

1039
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I mean, haven't you heard the freaking, what do you call it?

1040
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Keeps.

1041
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The keeps is the company that like advertises on YouTube.

1042
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You know, they say in their ads, you know, you can't reverse hair loss.

1043
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You can only, you can only prevent it.

1044
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah.

1045
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So.

1046
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You got to get one of those Jordan Peterson hair transplants.

1047
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Your hair plugs.

1048
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You got to go that route.

1049
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Listen, I don't, I'm not going to say that I have never thought about it.

1050
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I don't know.

1051
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I don't know.

1052
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Certainly be a lot simpler to have a shaved head.

1053
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But yeah.

1054
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I don't know.

1055
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I don't know.

1056
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Wait, actually.

1057
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I don't like.

1058
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
This might be true.

1059
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I hope maybe I'm misremembering.

1060
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
What's that?

1061
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Does estrogen bring your hair back?

1062
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I, we just said no.

1063
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It doesn't.

1064
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Once the hair follicle is completely gone.

1065
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I don't think it does.

1066
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
But.

1067
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I've, I've, I've heard.

1068
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Stop it from falling out.

1069
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I've heard the opposite.

1070
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
But.

1071
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
That like.

1072
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I mean, I've heard so many things about what estrogen does.

1073
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And there's no like, there's no absolute like certainty to a lot of it.

1074
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
People are just hoping and like they've got a, what do you call it?

1075
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Small sample size.

1076
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
What do you call that?

1077
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's just one guy saying something.

1078
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Anecdotal evidence.

1079
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Anecdotal evidence.

1080
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
There's a lot of anecdotal evidence and not a lot of research.

1081
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
My favorite kind.

1082
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It's hard to know what is true about what estrogen does.

1083
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Obviously, obvious things like boobs growing and like skin changing.

1084
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So.

1085
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Softness and various other things.

1086
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
For like.

1087
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Fat goes in.

1088
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
The fat goes to your hips and thighs.

1089
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Hair is unknown.

1090
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
As far as I understand.

1091
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It's, it's not, it's not unknown.

1092
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It doesn't bring your hair back.

1093
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
There.

1094
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Well, I mean, maybe there's magical.

1095
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Ooh.

1096
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I mean, women are magical, I guess.

1097
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So like, who knows what could happen?

1098
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Well, all right.

1099
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I don't know.

1100
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I ain't seen the stats.

1101
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I ain't seen the truth.

1102
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm not holding out hope for it though.

1103
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I, my hair is receded already and I can't do anything about it.

1104
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
At some point I might shave my hair off and start wearing wigs.

1105
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Cause it just doesn't look that good.

1106
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I think, I don't know.

1107
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I can say this before like.

1108
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,000
On the one hand, maybe I'm just like, uh, maybe it's just cooler.

1109
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Maybe it's, it's just a cooler look.

1110
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And by look I mean in the more general sense, not of how you look in like visually, but

1111
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
just how you look to others as a human.

1112
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It might just be a better look to just say fuck it and embrace whatever nature bestows

1113
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
upon me.

1114
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I respect that.

1115
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I respect that sort of thing in others.

1116
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Uh, but do I have the courage to do it myself?

1117
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I'm going to say probably no, probably no, I lack that in my heart.

1118
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Seeing guys with, with no hair doesn't make me think anything in particular.

1119
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
No.

1120
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It's just like a normal guy.

1121
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah.

1122
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
With a really bad receding hairline.

1123
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Seeing a really old guy with a full head of hair is like, wow, lucky.

1124
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That son of a bitch.

1125
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
How do you do that?

1126
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Oh, he got the right gene.

1127
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Well, fuck you.

1128
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Fuck you, Gene.

1129
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You don't deserve happiness.

1130
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Uh, I don't know.

1131
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I just, I just want to complain.

1132
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I sort of complain about being old.

1133
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So thanks for letting me, let me do that.

1134
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
No, it's, it's fine.

1135
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It's old.

1136
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
We're all old here, except a blue and full.

1137
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah.

1138
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Only a few years ago in Gib.

1139
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Where do you like 20, you know, like 27, right?

1140
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah, I'm 27.

1141
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
29.

1142
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Oh, you're 27.

1143
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
No, I meant, yeah.

1144
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah.

1145
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah.

1146
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Okay.

1147
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I don't know.

1148
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Man, I don't know.

1149
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I just, uh, it's starting to, you know, I got, I got, I got, I got my thing that I'm

1150
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
working on, not the book.

1151
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I mean the book too, but like, I got that video thing that I was going to make.

1152
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I've sort of have been more focused on just getting the book done lately.

1153
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I haven't been focusing too hard on it, but I, but I, I, I'm excited to make it.

1154
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm excited to finish it and put it out.

1155
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And like, I think people like it.

1156
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And, uh, so that's cool and all, but like, uh, I feel, I don't know.

1157
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I wonder if I've really like made the most of my, uh, my internet career.

1158
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Have I, have I really like, have I really done anything worthwhile with it?

1159
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I don't know.

1160
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I've been, I've been, yeah.

1161
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I mean, that's fine.

1162
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah.

1163
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That's true.

1164
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
No, those were good.

1165
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Those were, those were good and they were worth making.

1166
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Like I should have, I should have done more.

1167
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I should have done more and I'm, I don't know.

1168
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Uh, you know, I guess when I think about it, it's a little bit, it's a little rough that

1169
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,000
like, hmm, my, my most, my most important achievements, if you just go by the numbers,

1170
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
are just things wherein I like discuss some shit that other people made.

1171
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That makes me depressed.

1172
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Uh, you know, I think it's funny to talk about Sonichu or whatever.

1173
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It's funny to talk about, uh, fucking unicorn jelly, but it's a bit like, it's a bit, it's

1174
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
a bit shit.

1175
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But like, oh yeah.

1176
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Ben saying that guy who talked about Sonichu, that guy who talked about unicorn jelly.

1177
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah, that is, that is me.

1178
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
That is my legacy.

1179
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I don't know what YouTubers are, but like half of them.

1180
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I know and they suck too.

1181
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Those people are also shit and worthless.

1182
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
So there, they're not worthless.

1183
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You need to learn about how like the UI has one extra pixel on the side on a remake of

1184
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
a video game.

1185
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That's true.

1186
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I love that content.

1187
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I gobble it up and, but I don't respect, but I don't respect it.

1188
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I actually don't like that content.

1189
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I don't, nothing against the people who make it.

1190
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I just like, why do people care about such a tiny little detail?

1191
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I mean, I don't know.

1192
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I don't know.

1193
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I mean, when I say that content, I mean like game related, like split speed run stuff I

1194
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
like, even though it's like, it's pretty vapid at the end of the day, but I still like it.

1195
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I think it's, it's just what you make of it.

1196
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I've was watching, um, this guy called settled makes RuneScape content.

1197
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah.

1198
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And, um, I found him from this odd like challenge run he's doing of an Iron Man RuneScape run,

1199
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
where he can only move one tile if he gets a certain amount of experience.

1200
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And then I was like, oh, that series is still ongoing.

1201
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
We'll wonder what else he's done.

1202
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And he's done like this, um, leveling every stat to 99.

1203
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Well, not every step.

1204
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I'm just like doing like everything you can, but, uh, relegated to one area of the entire

1205
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
map where you can't do a lot of things normally.

1206
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And it's just an extremely tedious grind.

1207
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And he loves it.

1208
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Like he loves the, like he, he grinds for like 1500 hours trying to find this one thing.

1209
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So that he can get like, he can, he can finish, uh, like, uh, I don't know.

1210
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It's hard to explain because there's so many moving parts in RuneScape.

1211
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I don't even know the first thing about RuneScape.

1212
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Uh, you get experienced by doing crafts and fighting and leveling up and stuff.

1213
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Okay.

1214
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You run around, um, MMO.

1215
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah.

1216
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I mean, I know, I know that much.

1217
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah.

1218
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Uh, but he like, he gets really, really happy and excited whenever he breaches a milestone

1219
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
or like a certain item drops that there's like one in 1600 drop chance and he's killed

1220
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
like hundreds of these fucking enemies trying to get it.

1221
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And he gets it and he's like, oh, Pog.

1222
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
He, and it's just like, I can't imagine.

1223
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Like, carrying.

1224
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I'm so jealous.

1225
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I'm so jealous.

1226
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
For so long.

1227
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Like he, it's just his enthusiasm for the seemingly completely pointless, arduous, tedious task

1228
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
of playing some video game.

1229
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
His enthusiasm is infectious.

1230
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Yeah.

1231
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It makes me like really happy for him.

1232
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yeah.

1233
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And everyone loves him and he's, he's just literally riding on cloud nine or whatever.

1234
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It's, it's, it's just great.

1235
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You know, when you're, when you're passionate about something.

1236
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yeah.

1237
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It's like, uh, one, it's not work to, you know, do it.

1238
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And two, other people who might not even care.

1239
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Yeah.

1240
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
They might just enjoy your enthusiasm for it.

1241
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And for, you know, for both of those reasons, that's like, oh, that's good content.

1242
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You know, if there's something you really care about and enjoy, it's like, hey, if you

1243
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
turn that into content, you know, that's like, that's pretty good.

1244
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
It's good work.

1245
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
If you can get it.

1246
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Yeah.

1247
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So like, you know, yeah, I wouldn't like, I wouldn't have a problem.

1248
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I don't think there's anything wrong with like doing vapid content.

1249
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Yeah.

1250
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's just whether you're enjoying what you're doing.

1251
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yeah.

1252
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah.

1253
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I guess Ben, did you enjoy making the lectures or, or like having the, the videos, other

1254
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
videos you've made?

1255
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Um, yeah.

1256
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I guess, I guess, sure.

1257
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I mean, they only took me like, they didn't take very long.

1258
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Sure.

1259
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
They were fun to make.

1260
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
It's not like I've like spent that much time doing them.

1261
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
They were so fleeting in the grand scheme of things.

1262
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Um, I guess, I mean, I think the reason they're, they're so like enjoyed is, is your enthusiasm

1263
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
for the things you're talking about.

1264
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Yeah.

1265
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Like, I guess what I, I guess what bums me out a little bit is that I feel like it's

1266
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
not that I think they were bad to make or anything, but I do feel like, uh, I don't know.

1267
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,300
I just, I don't know where they leave me in terms of like, what, what can I, what is

1268
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,000
my next move?

1269
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,600
What, what is, what does Ben St. who has, you know, this list of things that he's done

1270
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
and that he's somewhat known for?

1271
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:44,600
Like, what does he do with that, uh, in terms of like, uh, I don't know.

1272
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:51,600
Uh, I mean, you learned how to etch glass for like a potential slime bottle thing.

1273
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,600
Yeah.

1274
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,600
Yeah.

1275
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
And.

1276
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:59,600
Well, you could make funny, cool things on Etsy.

1277
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,600
No, I hate it.

1278
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,600
I hate that idea.

1279
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,600
I hate it so much.

1280
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,600
I don't know.

1281
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,600
I don't know what you mean.

1282
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,600
Like, you don't know what you mean on YouTube specifically.

1283
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,600
I don't know.

1284
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,600
Yeah.

1285
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,600
Or whatever.

1286
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,600
As a content creator or as a person who, or just as an artist, just as an artist in general,

1287
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,600
like whatever that means.

1288
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:29,600
Uh, I guess I'm just, uh, I don't know what to do with my life there.

1289
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,600
That's it.

1290
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,600
That's what I'm getting at.

1291
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:38,600
Uh, this is, this is all part of my, this is all part of my crisis of being 34 and being like,

1292
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,600
what have I done?

1293
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
What have I done?

1294
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,600
And now what do I do?

1295
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
And, uh.

1296
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,600
You're 34.

1297
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,600
Yeah.

1298
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,600
You should follow the rules.

1299
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
What?

1300
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
Draw porn.

1301
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,600
Rule 34.

1302
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,600
Oh.

1303
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,600
Oh.

1304
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,600
Isn't it?

1305
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,600
Rule 34, when you hit 34.

1306
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,600
You have to just draw porn.

1307
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,600
That's all you can do.

1308
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,600
I'm getting a head start.

1309
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,600
I'm cheating.

1310
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:10,680
I don't, I don't want to, I'm, I'm too, um, this might speak to like a broader failing

1311
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,320
of me as a person, but I'm too like, I'm too shy.

1312
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,520
I'm too shy to draw porn.

1313
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,480
I don't want to be that vulnerable.

1314
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,800
I would feel way too vulnerable, like drawing porn that like, I'm like, yeah, this is what

1315
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,800
I'm into.

1316
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,800
Okay.

1317
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,600
Now I'm, now I'm posting it on the internet.

1318
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,600
Yeah.

1319
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
No fucking way.

1320
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
I felt like that.

1321
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,600
No fucking way.

1322
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,600
I felt like that before.

1323
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,600
Yeah.

1324
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
But I feel that way.

1325
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
I still kind of feel like that.

1326
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
I feel that way.

1327
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,600
I felt like that for a long time, but then the bandit got ripped off and that was easy.

1328
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:47,600
Now, now I can't wait to share all the other crazy porn ideas, ideas I have that no one

1329
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,600
has drawn before, but only I can draw unless I pay someone and fuck that.

1330
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,600
I mean, yeah, I'll do it.

1331
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:01,600
I should have just, I should have just paid someone, should have just paid someone to

1332
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,600
like format my fucking book for me.

1333
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:09,600
I shouldn't have spent like weeks and weeks working on my stupid book.

1334
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
It seems like it's such a simple step.

1335
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:19,600
Just organize it into a file, find a printer, but no, months go by and it's still not done.

1336
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,600
You know, I got a specific complaint.

1337
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:30,600
I mean, I really hate, I think it's going to be the case that the book will have to be,

1338
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:36,600
you know, long, you know, like bound on the short end and it's going to be kind of long.

1339
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,600
It might end up being like eight by 12.

1340
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,600
And that's just too long.

1341
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,600
I don't like that.

1342
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,600
It's annoying.

1343
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,600
Yeah, it's a flappy.

1344
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,600
That's an annoying, yeah, it's an annoying flappy size for a book.

1345
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,600
But like, that's what, that's the shape.

1346
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,600
That's the shape of the panels, man.

1347
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:03,600
I mean, in the Homestuck books, they have like the panels don't take up the entire,

1348
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,600
like four panels don't take up the entire thing.

1349
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,600
They're smaller and then they've obviously got the text underneath.

1350
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,600
Yeah.

1351
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,600
But then there's like the commentary right at the bottom.

1352
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,600
Yeah.

1353
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:21,600
If you had the commentary there, it would make it a taller book, I guess.

1354
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:29,600
Yeah, but no, some pages have like, I have like a lot of commentary and some and like,

1355
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,600
it just wouldn't fit.

1356
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,600
Some pages have a lot of commentary and some have very little or none.

1357
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:40,600
I could just add, I mean, I could just add space in between and at the bottom and top.

1358
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,600
It's just like, that's a waste of space.

1359
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:48,600
And that's just like making it cost more to print, like for what, like just to make it

1360
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:53,600
taller, to make it less oblong.

1361
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,600
It seems kind of stupid.

1362
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:05,600
And yet I want, I kind of want to just because eight by 12 bound on the eight.

1363
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,600
It doesn't fit on a bookshelf.

1364
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
It's going to stick out.

1365
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,600
Oh, yeah.

1366
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:17,600
All the things I have on my, on my like cool comics shelf will be sticking out.

1367
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,600
I have to put at the edge.

1368
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:26,600
I could bind it on top, like I could make it so that you have to flip through it, like hold it sideways.

1369
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,600
You know what I mean?

1370
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,600
That would be so weird.

1371
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:35,600
Yeah, it's that seems just as awkward, if not more so.

1372
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,600
I'd have to like open it like a laptop.

1373
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,600
Exactly.

1374
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,600
Rest it on my knees.

1375
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,600
Exactly.

1376
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,600
Exactly.

1377
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,600
So I don't know if that's a good solution.

1378
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:51,600
I guess I could, I could make it really tall.

1379
01:03:51,600 --> 01:04:00,600
What if I had, ooh, I could have eight panels on a page.

1380
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:08,600
I mean, if they don't end up being too small, that could work.

1381
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,600
I would cut the page.

1382
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,600
But then it would be 16 by 12, wouldn't it?

1383
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,600
It would cut the page count in half.

1384
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,600
It would be 16.

1385
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,600
Yeah.

1386
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,600
Oh no, it wouldn't be 12 then.

1387
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,600
No, yeah, would it be?

1388
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,600
Yeah, it would still be, it would still be 12 long.

1389
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,600
It would be 16 by 12, or I mean, I could shrink it to eight by six.

1390
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,600
That's too small.

1391
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:41,600
It's almost like a Twitter image size sucks for books.

1392
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,600
Almost.

1393
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,600
What if you just squished it all so all of the images were distorted?

1394
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,600
Ooh, yeah.

1395
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,600
Ooh, yeah.

1396
01:04:52,600 --> 01:05:01,600
And I could like just use like the, the Morph tool and like have it set on like hard, hard

1397
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,600
edge transform settings so that like.

1398
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,600
Nearest neighbor.

1399
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,600
Yeah, yeah.

1400
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:11,600
Like it ends up with like all these jagged, like pixelated everywhere.

1401
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Yeah.

1402
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,600
Thinking, that's thinking.

1403
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,600
This is, this has been my week.

1404
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:28,600
I have not, again, I have not left my house for another week has gone by.

1405
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,600
So you know, that's where I'm at.

1406
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:35,600
Just contemplating my hairline and all this stuff.

1407
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:41,600
That's, that's how, that's how it's been for me for a while.

1408
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,600
Listen, I'm not in a great place.

1409
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,600
Listen, I'm not in a great place mentally.

1410
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,600
All right.

1411
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,600
It's what I'm trying to say.

1412
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,600
It's not clear.

1413
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,600
Okay.

1414
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:54,600
If you can't pick up on, if you can't pick up on, on subtext, let me just spell it out

1415
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
for you.

1416
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,600
Okay.

1417
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,600
All right.

1418
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,600
All right.

1419
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,600
Why is hairline the most important thing a human can have?

1420
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,600
It's, why is that, why is that so like such a thing?

1421
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,600
Yeah.

1422
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,600
You know, scholars wonder, yeah, why is the hairline the single most important thing

1423
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,600
about a person?

1424
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:19,600
It is kind of weird how like 70% of what makes someone attractive is their hair a lot of

1425
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
the time.

1426
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,600
That's not even a joke.

1427
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,600
God, I was gonna say, please tell me you're joking.

1428
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,600
That's just like my estimate because like I've noticed the like.

1429
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,600
Is that for you personally?

1430
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:36,600
Well, I and I, I think other people have noticed that like the way someone wears their hair

1431
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,600
like has such a huge effect on like how they look to other people.

1432
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,600
Yeah.

1433
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,600
Like having shitty hair can make you look like a gala and having good hair can make you

1434
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,600
look fucking great.

1435
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,600
It's, it's, it makes such a huge difference.

1436
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
It does make a difference.

1437
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,600
I would say for me, it's definitely not 70%.

1438
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:03,600
I would say for me, it might make like feel like someone who is otherwise attractive,

1439
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:09,600
the difference between them having like a really nice hair cut hairdo versus them being

1440
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,600
like disheveled.

1441
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,600
Their hair looks like shit.

1442
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:17,600
Maybe like a picture of Elon Musk 25% before his hair was fixed.

1443
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,600
Who?

1444
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:23,600
Elon Musk, you've seen what it looked like before he got his hair like.

1445
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,600
Yeah.

1446
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,600
Yeah.

1447
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,600
I mean, he looks, he looks better.

1448
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,600
He looks better with the, with the hair.

1449
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,600
People kept making fun of Donald Trump for his funny wig, but he would have looked worse

1450
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,600
if he didn't have it.

1451
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,600
That's not true.

1452
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,600
That's not true.

1453
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,600
I've seen him with his hair like combed back.

1454
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,600
It looks fine.

1455
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Like he doesn't even have like a receding hairline.

1456
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,600
I guess I haven't really seen him.

1457
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,600
No, he actually looks fine with his hair normal.

1458
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,600
Like there's no reason why he does such freak shit with it.

1459
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:55,600
This is so funny.

1460
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,600
He literally looked, literally looked older when he was like, what is he like in his 30s

1461
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,600
in that first one?

1462
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:07,600
Literally looked older with his, with his receding hairline.

1463
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:14,600
I do like some of these, these comedy moments.

1464
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,600
I miss these.

1465
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,600
Okay.

1466
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,600
And that one, he does look like it's like a wig or something.

1467
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,600
Hmm.

1468
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,600
What's that?

1469
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,600
Weird.

1470
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,600
Oh my God.

1471
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,600
What a weirdo.

1472
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:35,600
He truly is just a real fucking weirdo, honestly.

1473
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,600
His wife just, or his ex-wife just died.

1474
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,600
So we can't, we shouldn't make fun of him.

1475
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,600
He's going through a hard, he's going through a hard time.

1476
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,600
I forgot what I was doing.

1477
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,600
What are we talking about?

1478
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,600
Hair.

1479
01:08:53,600 --> 01:09:04,600
I mean, I feel like my hair looks all right when it's nice, but the hairline thing is a

1480
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,600
constant like aggravator.

1481
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,600
You know, because, because it's, it's not just that, oh, it's looks kind of bad.

1482
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:19,600
It's, it's like telling of my masculinity that I have a receding hairline like that.

1483
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,600
And it's like, oh, dysphoria on top of all that.

1484
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,600
It's really, really gets me sometimes.

1485
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,600
I have to wear hats whenever I go outside.

1486
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
It sucks.

1487
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,600
You know whose hair was fascinating to watch progress?

1488
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:41,600
I feel like I bring this guy up like an unusual amount, but Dan Olson, his, he used.

1489
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,600
Oh yeah.

1490
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,600
Yeah.

1491
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,600
He used to do a thing with it where like, you could kind of tell that it was thinning,

1492
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:53,600
but he sort of wore it over his forehead in a kind of like, almost like deliberately

1493
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,600
shitty way.

1494
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:01,600
And I think, I don't know, there was a period there where it was like, it doesn't look good.

1495
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,600
Like you're, like you're, you're kind of clearly sort of trying to do something with it that

1496
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,600
like you don't have enough there to do that with.

1497
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:15,600
And then at some point he just, at some point he just made the switch, the switch flipped

1498
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:25,600
and he, he went from a disheveled looking, you know, youngish guy to a pretty, pretty

1499
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:35,600
like well put together a middle aged man when he shaved his head and beard went white and

1500
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,600
you know.

1501
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,600
Yeah.

1502
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,600
I mean, it's a good look for him.

1503
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,600
I would say he overall looks better.

1504
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,600
Yeah.

1505
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,600
Which is what makes me like, maybe I should just, maybe is it, is it time?

1506
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,600
When will I have to take the plunge?

1507
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,600
The day will come.

1508
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,600
Whatever you do, don't, don't do a fucking comb over like that one voicemailer suggested

1509
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,600
like a few weeks ago.

1510
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,600
No.

1511
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,600
Comb over is part of a devil.

1512
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,600
I would, you gotta, you gotta grow your hair right at the back of your neck really long

1513
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,600
and then come all the way over.

1514
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:11,600
I would never want to like wear my hair or anything in a way that's like I'm like trying

1515
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,600
to disguise something.

1516
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,600
Like I brush my hair to the side now and it's just, that's just how I do it and it's not

1517
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,600
like, I don't know.

1518
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,600
I'm not, yeah, I wouldn't, I would never do a comb over.

1519
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,600
That's just stupid.

1520
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,600
I would just, just shave it at that point in my opinion.

1521
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,600
Yeah.

1522
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,600
In my opinion, I agree too.

1523
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,600
Yeah.

1524
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,600
I just, just when, when do I, when do I pull a Dan?

1525
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,600
Am I there yet?

1526
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
I don't know.

1527
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,600
One of the, one day.

1528
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,600
Is it today?

1529
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,600
It's the sort of the sort of Damocles.

1530
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,600
The sort of Damocles is dangling.

1531
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,600
The sort of Danocles.

1532
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,600
Ah, yes.

1533
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,600
Ah, yes.

1534
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,600
Ah, yes.

1535
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,600
That's all, that's it.

1536
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:59,600
That the scissors of Damocles or the razor of Damocles.

1537
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,600
Yeah.

1538
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,600
Because you're cutting your hair.

1539
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,600
Right.

1540
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,600
I lost.

1541
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,600
Yeah.

1542
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,600
You know what, you know what?

1543
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,600
On a more, on a more exciting hair related, this is very exciting.

1544
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,600
The stuff we talk about on this podcast is like a thrilling to our audience.

1545
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,600
I gotta say, I have a beard again.

1546
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,600
I have like a real beard, which like I have not had one since Radcon 2 basically.

1547
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,600
Oh, comb the beard up over your hair.

1548
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,600
I have like an actual like full beard again and it feels great and I feel like a more

1549
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,600
complete human for that.

1550
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,600
So I got that going for me.

1551
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,600
Yeah.

1552
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:42,600
Even though, even though it is, even though it is kind of white on the, on the near the

1553
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,600
ears, but like, that's fine.

1554
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,600
I don't really mind it.

1555
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:51,600
Is it, is it like lumberjack size the same as the first TBAP Q&A?

1556
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,600
It's not that big.

1557
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,600
It's not, it's not that length yet, but like it's getting there.

1558
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,600
Maybe in another two months or something.

1559
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,600
Yeah.

1560
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:08,600
I remember like I, it's bizarre, but like around TBAP time, maybe like a little before

1561
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,600
TBAP or in the very early days of TBAP, I had like a long beard.

1562
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:18,600
I had like, like it was like, it must have been like seven or eight inches long.

1563
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Uh, very strange, very strange to think that ever.

1564
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,600
Yeah.

1565
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,600
Uh, only time I ever did that in my life.

1566
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,600
Uh, maybe I'll just do it again.

1567
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,600
Maybe I'll just freaking do it again.

1568
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:38,600
I have, I have managed to avoid, my, my trick or telemania has been, uh, I have managed

1569
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:46,600
it, uh, in a way that has, uh, allowed my beard to be normal more or less.

1570
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:51,600
Uh, uh, and that's an accomplishment for me.

1571
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,600
It's very difficult.

1572
01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:04,600
So it's kind of strange that I have managed that these days when I am feeling so such despair.

1573
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:10,600
Uh, uh, but I guess, you know, that's just, uh, that's life.

1574
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,600
That's the way the beard crumbles.

1575
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,600
That's true.

1576
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,600
That's true.

1577
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:20,600
Speaking of beard crumbling, um, my, my laser hair removal thing that I've been doing.

1578
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,600
Yeah.

1579
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,600
To get rid of my facial hair forever.

1580
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,600
Yeah.

1581
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:31,600
Um, it has progressed to a point where, uh, the last session, I had a session recently,

1582
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:39,600
but before that, um, there was, uh, there was a problem after I got home from America,

1583
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,600
I had gained a bit of a tan because we went to the beach one day.

1584
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,600
Right.

1585
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,600
And they said, Oh, we can't do it.

1586
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,600
Yeah.

1587
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,600
You mentioned, uh, you mentioned that.

1588
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,600
So.

1589
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,600
Oh, very strange.

1590
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,600
That's been, that was, that was a thing.

1591
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,600
Yeah.

1592
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:01,600
And now I've done it, but in the interim, I had to wait an additional six weeks and my

1593
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,600
beard barely grew back at all in that entire time.

1594
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:12,600
And I, I, I've always had like an extremely fast growing beard, um, compared to people

1595
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,600
my age or the round the age that I started growing it.

1596
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:21,600
Um, so it was really cool to see that after six weeks, it was like very faint.

1597
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,600
Yeah.

1598
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,600
Yeah.

1599
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,600
Like if you didn't look at it, you probably didn't notice.

1600
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,600
Is it, is it like, okay, did it grow back?

1601
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,600
Like just, there were fewer hairs.

1602
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,600
Like there just weren't many hairs or was it like, they were like, like, like the hair

1603
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,600
on your arm, like they're finer and, and like softer and thinner.

1604
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,600
No, no, no.

1605
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,600
There were just fewer hairs.

1606
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,600
Yeah.

1607
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,600
Um, round my cheeks, there's nothing.

1608
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,600
Um, on my chin is where a lot of it is and on my lips, uh, above and below my lips is

1609
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,600
where.

1610
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,600
On, on your lips.

1611
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:51,600
Yes.

1612
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,600
Glowing directly out of the lips.

1613
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,600
Yeah.

1614
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,600
The lipstick's a nightmare.

1615
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,600
Um, but.

1616
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:03,600
I gotta shave my lips before I apply lipstick every single time.

1617
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:11,600
Um, but yeah, it's like, there's like a countable number of hairs, probably not actually countable,

1618
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,600
but like it's so stark from the way it used to be.

1619
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,600
It's, it's, it's really gratifying.

1620
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,600
I like it.

1621
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,600
I like looking at it.

1622
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,600
I like, I like, I don't like looking at it because I can still see that there is hair

1623
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,600
there, but I like knowing that it has been such a long time and I don't have a beard that

1624
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,600
goes like, like protrude from my chin.

1625
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,600
I don't have a moustache that goes into my mouth.

1626
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,600
You know, you know, moustache gets too long.

1627
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,600
Yeah.

1628
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,600
Doesn't happen anymore.

1629
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
Yeah.

1630
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Yeah.

1631
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:53,600
The hairs were like the length, like about half a millimeter length maximum.

1632
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:59,100
My, I, my moustache is a bit shorter than the rest of my beard because I did, I did pull

1633
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:03,600
out like a part, not a lot, but like a little like section of my moustache.

1634
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,600
And I was like, shit, shit, shit.

1635
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:11,600
Uh, so I avoided plucking at it for a while and it has grown back and it's like few.

1636
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,600
Okay.

1637
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,600
It's complete again.

1638
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,600
I must, I must never again.

1639
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,600
I must never again do that.

1640
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:24,600
Uh, so, uh, it's back, but it's just shorter because it started growing later, basically.

1641
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,600
Uh, but it looks deliberate.

1642
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,600
It doesn't look fucked up.

1643
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,600
I swear it doesn't look fucked up.

1644
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,600
I look normal.

1645
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,600
I look normal.

1646
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,600
I say screaming into the mirror.

1647
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,600
Thank you.

1648
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,600
Someone, someone finally, someone believes it.

1649
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,600
I believe it.

1650
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,600
You know, I went to a hairdresser for the first time in like two years.

1651
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,600
Oh yeah.

1652
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,600
Recently.

1653
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,600
Since COVID.

1654
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,600
Yeah.

1655
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,600
When COVID started, I just said, fuck it.

1656
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,600
I'm just going to like shave my head once every six months.

1657
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,600
That's what I was doing.

1658
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,600
Yeah.

1659
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,600
I mean, um, makes sense.

1660
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,600
Yeah.

1661
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,600
The way my hair grew back looked really weird.

1662
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,600
I look like a freaky, freakazoid.

1663
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,600
How's, how so?

1664
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,600
I don't know.

1665
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,600
It's just like, it looks like I was wearing like a fucking, like a helmet, like a fucking

1666
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,600
Minecraft helmet.

1667
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,600
Like you just grew back as like a shapeless like orb.

1668
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:24,600
Well, well, it's like, you know, like my, my fringe is, you know, was like just above

1669
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,600
my eyes.

1670
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,600
And then right before it hits my ears, the hair just drops down like four more inches

1671
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,600
and then just goes around the back.

1672
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,600
Um, so my, my face is like in this fucking square window.

1673
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,600
Um, oh, cause it was like long on the sides.

1674
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,600
So it like kind of, yeah.

1675
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,600
Yeah.

1676
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,600
Yeah.

1677
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,600
Cause I have like a straight, I have a straight hairline on them by my ear as it just goes

1678
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,600
right down.

1679
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Yeah.

1680
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,600
And it was really weird.

1681
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:51,600
I went to a hairdresser and I, and I thought, you know, I'm actually going to tell them,

1682
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,600
I'm actually going to tell them to aim for style for the first time in my life.

1683
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,600
Cause I would always just walk in there and be like, I don't know, just take like half

1684
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,600
the length off, I guess.

1685
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,360
And they would just do whatever the fuck.

1686
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,600
And my hair slowly got like really bad.

1687
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:12,520
Uh, but this time I'm like, I don't know, vaguely just shape it vaguely so that like,

1688
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,000
if I just sort of brush it, it'll sort of sit on my face the way like emo hair from

1689
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,600
like the late 2000s would, but without all the product.

1690
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,600
It's a good, it's a good style.

1691
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,600
Yeah.

1692
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,600
Yeah.

1693
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,600
And she was like, I got you a fan.

1694
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,600
And then she, uh, shaped it.

1695
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,600
She didn't take any line call, but she just shaped it and it looks good.

1696
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,600
I feel like it looked good.

1697
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,600
I feel like it looked better than I have.

1698
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,600
Wait, that's how it looks now?

1699
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,600
Yeah.

1700
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,600
That's how I look now.

1701
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,600
And I think I look better than I have in a long fucking time.

1702
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,600
Yeah.

1703
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,600
Um, even pre-cut.

1704
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:47,600
I don't, well, I can't compare to how you looked pre haircut, but, uh, looking good.

1705
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,600
Looking good, man.

1706
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,600
I, I should probably find it a pre haircut image.

1707
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,600
Actually, I definitely can.

1708
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,600
You just re-posed the Donald Trump image.

1709
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,600
This is what I looked like before.

1710
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,600
Oh, I, I, let me go for my 2019 folder.

1711
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:10,600
Uh, I, uh, I might go, I, I, I cut my own hair, but I might go to like, uh, a stylist

1712
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:16,600
or something to get a real haircut maybe before I am ready to film that, uh, that

1713
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,600
video project that I've put off for the book for the moment.

1714
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,600
Uh, although I'm, I don't know.

1715
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,600
I don't know, it makes me nervous.

1716
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,600
Sometimes I get a haircut and I hate how it looks.

1717
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:37,600
Sometimes I feel like, uh, when I just kind of let the hair do whatever it wants, I just

1718
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,600
end up feeling like more comfortable with it.

1719
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,600
Like I'm just like, eh, it's fine.

1720
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,600
It is what it is.

1721
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:50,600
But then if I get a haircut and it's bad, I'm like, it's, it's, it's not, it's bad,

1722
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,600
but it's like deliberately bad.

1723
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:57,600
Like it's like, it feels worse cause like, okay, but it's like, I don't like how it was

1724
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,600
made to be.

1725
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,600
If it, if it just looked bad by accident, I could just be like, eh, well, I didn't even

1726
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,600
try.

1727
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,600
Eh, it's just how it grows.

1728
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,600
Hey, you were in the broop shirt.

1729
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,600
Yeah, it is.

1730
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,600
Let me see.

1731
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,600
That was like three years ago.

1732
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,600
That shirt is in very, very bad condition now.

1733
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,600
It was already starting to get in bad condition then.

1734
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,600
You should probably get a new one.

1735
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,600
You looked fine.

1736
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,600
It's faded.

1737
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,600
You looked fine.

1738
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,600
The white is gray.

1739
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,600
It's full of holes.

1740
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,600
Oh, you're talking about me.

1741
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,600
Yeah.

1742
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,600
I mean, I, my hair was like really poofy on the front.

1743
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:37,600
So like at the front of my head, above my forehead, my hair like jutted out like two inches forward

1744
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,600
in this like weird round like bulb.

1745
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:47,600
Which is not super apparent in that screenshot, but I don't know.

1746
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:54,600
It was odd as I, I don't know, I look better now and I'm going to be even more better because

1747
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,600
I'm going to keep growing it for a bit.

1748
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,600
I'll be sexy boy, sexy oblivion is coming back.

1749
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,600
He is.

1750
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,600
Did I, did I mention that the last time I saw my dad, he told me he was going to grow

1751
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,600
a ponytail.

1752
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,600
I, I vaguely remember that.

1753
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
I just think that's so funny.

1754
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
He called himself an old hippie.

1755
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,600
He's like, he was like, eh, I'm an old hippie.

1756
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,600
I might as well grow a ponytail.

1757
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,600
I was like, yeah, yeah, cool.

1758
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,600
I should, I should go, I should go sailing with him.

1759
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,600
I haven't gone sailing in like 10 years, but I think he wants me to go sailing with him

1760
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:36,600
sometime and like I should do that before the summer is over, maybe sometime next month

1761
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,600
before puts the boat away.

1762
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,600
So you have like a sailboat.

1763
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:48,600
Him, him and his friend co-own a sailboat together.

1764
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,600
Yeah.

1765
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,600
It's their, it's their thing.

1766
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,600
It's their, it's their hobby.

1767
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,600
They love it.

1768
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,600
They love, they love that freaking boat, man.

1769
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,600
They're just all about it.

1770
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
More than you.

1771
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:05,600
I don't like boating, but you know, whatever.

1772
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,600
It's not, it's about.

1773
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,600
The ocean will kill you.

1774
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,600
Yeah, I know.

1775
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,600
Yes, I know.

1776
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,600
That's why I don't like it.

1777
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,600
Exactly.

1778
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,600
Exactly.

1779
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,600
I'm terrified of it.

1780
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,600
Boats are cool until you're on one.

1781
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:26,600
I remember being on like, on like holiday once somewhere and it was like, oh, this wooden

1782
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:31,600
like pirate ship kind of looking boat is going to like take us on a tour around the rocks.

1783
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,600
We're going to see the rocks, but it was like a real boat.

1784
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,600
It went up and down and I felt sick.

1785
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,600
What?

1786
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,600
I thought it was going to be okay, but I'm going to throw up.

1787
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:50,600
I think it's probably scarier for me to contemplate than it would be to, to actually go out and

1788
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,600
do that.

1789
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,600
Like I'm, I feel like it'll be fine.

1790
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,600
Just thinking about it.

1791
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,600
I'm like, God, on the sea.

1792
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,600
I'll drown.

1793
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:04,600
Uh, you know, I'll be eaten whole by a, by a lurker fish.

1794
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,600
Oh.

1795
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,600
Drowning in footwear.

1796
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,600
Yeah.

1797
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,600
What?

1798
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,600
No, that was a give and take.

1799
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,600
That was a hypocrite.

1800
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,600
Yeah.

1801
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,600
You remember Jack and Daxter?

1802
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,600
Yes.

1803
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,600
That's what I was, that's what, yeah.

1804
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,600
Yeah.

1805
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,600
I'm going to, no, no father of you.

1806
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,600
Don't, I don't want to be thrown into the sea.

1807
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,600
Yes.

1808
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,600
Yes.

1809
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,600
Classic.

1810
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:34,600
I was, I was, I think I was calling like, no, I wanted, I don't want to go fishing.

1811
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,600
Yes.

1812
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,600
This was Jack and Daxter.

1813
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,600
I'll be eaten whole.

1814
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:46,600
God, I like some of my videos.

1815
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,600
They're good.

1816
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,600
I also like some of your videos.

1817
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,600
It's a shame making videos so strange now.

1818
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:59,600
Now that I have a big brain, I don't feel the compulsion to just talk about things.

1819
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,600
I think my brain is small and stupid.

1820
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,600
You think you have a big brain now?

1821
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,600
You think your brain's gotten bigger?

1822
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,600
I don't feel, I don't feel that way at all.

1823
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,600
I feel, all right.

1824
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:19,600
What I feel is that my, my, having seen so many good analysis videos, I feel like I can't

1825
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:29,600
just make a video and just be happy with whatever I come up with because I need it to be worth

1826
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:34,600
something to the larger gaming analysis scene.

1827
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,600
Yeah.

1828
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,600
Like I don't, I don't want to talk about a game that somebody's already done an amazing

1829
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,600
video on.

1830
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,600
Yeah.

1831
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:45,600
Every other game reviewer does a retrospective on some other thing.

1832
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,600
And even though the retrospective has been done by 70 other people, I don't feel like I

1833
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:55,600
would benefit the world by doing my own, even though people would probably like it.

1834
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:02,600
Cause like if the nostalgia chick reviews, reviews Good Burger, then the, then the nostalgia

1835
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,600
critic can't review Good Burger.

1836
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,600
So like only one of them can do it.

1837
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,600
Ironically, yes.

1838
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,600
And Good Burger is a classic.

1839
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,600
And we, we, this is like highly contested.

1840
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,600
Obviously.

1841
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,600
The rights to Good Burger.

1842
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,600
The rights to discuss Good Burger.

1843
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,600
Obviously there's like, um, there's no like dibsies on, on a review.

1844
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:29,600
If somebody made a review of a game, I actually, I actually would do this.

1845
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,600
I would see if, and somebody had made a video on a game like Rayman one.

1846
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,600
And I was like, ah, these videos suck.

1847
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,600
I can, I, I'll do that.

1848
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,600
And I'll do that video.

1849
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,600
And then I did.

1850
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,600
No.

1851
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:45,600
But it's, it's just sort of like now that I've seen so many good, like really in depth

1852
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,600
videos, I feel like I want to be smart when I make it.

1853
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,600
I don't just, I want to be like bringing something new to the table.

1854
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:57,600
I want to be a big, the big Joel of like, um, video game analysis.

1855
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,600
I want to be saying something while I review the game.

1856
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,600
Yeah.

1857
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,600
I know what you mean.

1858
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,600
And I have, I feel the same way.

1859
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,600
Like, do you feel like if you're not, like if you're not, if you're not making something

1860
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,600
that's like amazing, you're just like, why, why bother?

1861
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,600
Like, is that what you're saying?

1862
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,600
Kinda.

1863
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:27,600
I mean, when it comes to videos for sure, I feel like I, I have that compulsion with

1864
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,600
comics and drawings as well.

1865
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:36,600
But I, I don't feel quite so bad about making what I currently make, which is good.

1866
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:43,600
But like, I don't know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say anything I've made so far as a masterpiece,

1867
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,600
even though there's good parts to them.

1868
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:55,600
I, um, I think I'm a little, I'm pleased to announce that my, the video thing that I'm

1869
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:02,600
currently, is currently on hold is, it's, I think it's, it's the only thing, it's the

1870
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,600
only thing like it.

1871
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:10,600
There are like adjacent things about like similar topics, but there's nothing, there's

1872
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:14,600
nothing like exactly the idea that I'm, that I'm working on.

1873
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,600
So like that's good.

1874
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,600
But that's like kind of stupid because like even if there was, like it wouldn't matter.

1875
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:25,600
Like it really should be fine if there was, if someone else had already done a similar

1876
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,600
thing.

1877
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,600
That shouldn't stop me.

1878
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,600
But I think it would.

1879
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,600
Uh.

1880
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,600
Yeah.

1881
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,600
Yeah.

1882
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:39,600
I've had ideas, but then I, I, for, for little things, like I kind of wanted to like understand

1883
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:45,600
all of the World of Warcraft lore from the very beginning of time to presently.

1884
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,600
Um, and I would have taken a lot of research and I would put it all in a video.

1885
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,600
But of course, World of Warcraft is gigantic.

1886
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:58,600
There are already people who have entire channels dedicated to documenting World of Warcraft

1887
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:04,600
lore and they do it really in an entertaining way with animations and voiceovers and I'm

1888
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:08,600
like, okay, well, I mean, why would I spend all that time researching?

1889
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:14,600
But is there like something that was subpar compared to what was already around?

1890
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,600
But maybe they're doing subpar because they're not funny.

1891
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,600
Yeah, I guess.

1892
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,600
They are funny.

1893
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,600
You would need.

1894
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:27,600
I mean, I guess you would need to find an angle to it that would like, it's like, okay,

1895
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,600
but has anyone does it like this?

1896
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,600
Like has anyone done it in this way?

1897
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:37,600
Like, like I said, the thing that I'm doing, other people have made videos about similar

1898
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:43,600
things, but no one has done it in the format that I am planning to do it.

1899
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,600
So I'm like, that's, that's good.

1900
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,600
Interpretive dance.

1901
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,600
Yeah, exactly.

1902
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,600
Uh, like that's, that's good enough.

1903
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:58,600
You know, I mean, maybe, uh, yeah, maybe other people make like World of Warcraft lore videos,

1904
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:06,600
but nobody has like organized it into like a comprehensive, uh, I don't know, uh, the

1905
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:15,600
fucking eight hour long, uh, yeah, spoken word poem about it.

1906
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,600
All right, get right on that.

1907
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,600
Yeah.

1908
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,600
That's, that's an untapped market.

1909
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:29,600
No, nobody's just dryly spoken the lore, uh, while they play, um, Counter-Strike in the

1910
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,600
background.

1911
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,600
I think that that's an untapped market.

1912
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,600
Yeah.

1913
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,600
I want heavy interruptions.

1914
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,600
You're like, oh, wait, wait, I gotta wait.

1915
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,600
Hang on.

1916
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,600
Give me a minute.

1917
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,600
Okay.

1918
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,600
Yes.

1919
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,600
Double kill.

1920
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,600
Double kill.

1921
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,600
Okay.

1922
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,600
So anyway, uh, so anyway, Thrall is green.

1923
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,600
Oh, fuck.

1924
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,600
Oh, fuck.

1925
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,600
Oh, I said campers, man.

1926
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,600
Oh, bullshit.

1927
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:53,600
Okay.

1928
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,600
So anyway, uh, uh, the horde is good and the alliance is bad.

1929
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,600
Huh?

1930
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,600
Um, yeah.

1931
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,600
Yeah.

1932
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,600
So you should Thrall go to the mall.

1933
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:05,600
Thrall.

1934
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,600
Thrall plays Super Smash Bros.

1935
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,600
Cool.

1936
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,600
Brawl.

1937
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,600
Uh, I don't know.

1938
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:14,600
I don't know anything about anything about the World of Warcraft lore.

1939
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,600
I didn't even know it when I was playing it.

1940
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,600
Uh, I knew that Arthas was bad.

1941
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,600
What, uh, race were you?

1942
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,600
Uh, my main was a troll.

1943
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:30,600
So did you, you got like the, when you made your character, there's like the cutscene

1944
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,600
that zooms around and ends on your character.

1945
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,600
And there's like a narrator saying stuff about your, your kind.

1946
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,600
What, what's the trolls up to?

1947
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,600
I mean, I, I, not, not much.

1948
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:48,600
They're kind of just, you know, they sort of have their like witch doctor stuff and

1949
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,600
like, you know, they're in the horde.

1950
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,600
They're allied with the orcs and like, that's it.

1951
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,600
You got it.

1952
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,600
I'm pretty sure there's just not that much else too.

1953
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:06,600
I remember the, the Draenei kind of had, the Draenei had like their own, uh, they were

1954
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,600
like alien.

1955
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,600
I thought the Draenei were really cool.

1956
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,600
And then I, um, crash landed on the planet because they were fleeing the Burning Legion

1957
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,600
who were also in space.

1958
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,600
Yeah.

1959
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,600
And they're like, oh man, I love the dry.

1960
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:27,600
I, uh, I, how like they're, I didn't realize it at first, but like they look exactly like

1961
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,600
demons.

1962
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,600
And like they are demons.

1963
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,600
Like they're the same creature.

1964
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:37,600
It's just those are like the evil version of what was originally these like these peaceful

1965
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,600
like blue people.

1966
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,600
They're peaceful blue people.

1967
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:46,600
They got like, when the Burning Legion conquers a planet, um, they enslave the race and they

1968
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,600
turn them into demons.

1969
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:52,600
And then all the different demon enemies you see in World of Warcraft are different races

1970
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,600
of different things that have been conquered over the galaxy.

1971
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,600
And we see the Draenei and it's like, oh, well, they're not all like.

1972
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,600
I saw, I saw one of those demons and I was like, huh, you know, now that I think about

1973
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:08,600
it, and I kind of do just sort of look like, you know, regular old like hoof footed, like

1974
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,600
Satan demons, just blue.

1975
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,600
Oh yeah.

1976
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,600
Neat.

1977
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,600
Uh.

1978
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,600
Yes.

1979
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,600
Kind of like.

1980
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,600
So much richness.

1981
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,600
There's so much layer.

1982
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,600
Hmm.

1983
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,600
Someone should make.

1984
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,600
So much onion.

1985
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:29,600
There's so much content to be mine for like an eight hour long YouTube video that people

1986
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,600
post around like, oh my God, I can't believe somebody made an eight hour long video explaining

1987
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,600
the lore.

1988
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,600
Oh my God.

1989
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,600
Who would do that?

1990
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,600
Haha.

1991
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,600
Let's make clickbait articles about it.

1992
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,600
Do people make clickbait articles now about those?

1993
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,600
Yeah.

1994
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:50,600
Like, uh, when Quinton reviews put out the fucking like seven hour long victorious review, just

1995
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:56,600
like, just the fact that he did that, like fucking news outlets were making like shitty

1996
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:04,600
non-articles about like, some guy made a seven hour video discussing every episode of victorious

1997
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,600
lull and just got a ton of exposure from that.

1998
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:15,600
Just from the fact of being like a very stupid endeavor that someone like fully, fully executed.

1999
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,600
I mean, it's playing the meta.

2000
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,600
He knows how stupid that looks.

2001
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,600
Yeah.

2002
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:22,600
Absolutely.

2003
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:30,600
It's just, it's, it's, it was objectively a smart thing to do because of how stupid it

2004
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,600
is.

2005
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,600
You need to make a 100 hour video talking about the lore.

2006
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,600
Oh, but I, I'd lose my voice.

2007
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:48,100
Uh, I don't know exactly how long this video project that I am working on is going to be.

2008
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:55,100
I am considering ways that I could make it, ways that I could extend the length and wondering

2009
01:34:55,100 --> 01:35:01,100
like, can, can I make it absurdly long, like stupidly long?

2010
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:03,100
And, and if so, should I do that?

2011
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:08,100
Uh, I am taking it under consideration.

2012
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:14,100
You should obviously not pad it because like a super long video with a lot of fluff would

2013
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,100
make me click away.

2014
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,100
No.

2015
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:20,100
But I mean, I wouldn't want to pad it.

2016
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,100
Don't, don't like leave things out.

2017
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:24,100
If you want it to be.

2018
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:30,100
No, I'm thinking, I'm thinking, like comprehensive and just allow it to be whatever length it

2019
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,100
is.

2020
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,100
Yeah.

2021
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:37,100
I'm wondering like how long can I, can I make it by just like being as comprehensive as

2022
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:40,100
possible and like how much.

2023
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,100
Yeah.

2024
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,100
And I don't know.

2025
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,100
I genuinely don't know.

2026
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:48,100
I think that there's two ways to approach it.

2027
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:56,100
There's like the, the cliffs notes of the most interesting parts, which is going to be

2028
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:03,100
like, you know, depending on what the subject is, would be a shorter video, but a longer

2029
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:08,100
video people would just put on and listen to.

2030
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,100
Yeah.

2031
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,100
And the droning is like relaxing.

2032
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:20,100
So if it's like all, if it's really interesting stuff, I would say try to make it a shorter

2033
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,100
video.

2034
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:26,100
But if it's a lot of stuff that is just sort of odd that they have all that information

2035
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:32,100
about them, then you would go for a longer video because it's not like, you know, imagine

2036
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:36,100
if you're like trying to sleep and you got this video playing.

2037
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:42,100
You want it to be like the same sort of interestingness throughout.

2038
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:49,100
I, I, I'm just going to have to, going to have to see, I'm going to have to see how long

2039
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:51,100
it ends up being.

2040
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:57,100
I'm, and I'm going to have, I think I'm inclined to try and like rush past things and like

2041
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:04,100
keep things short and concise, but I think I'm going to like maybe try and maybe try

2042
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:11,100
and like resist that urge that I have and like not like force it to be shorter than

2043
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:13,100
like maybe it needs to be.

2044
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:19,100
Like if it, if it's long, like let it, like if it needs to be long, let it be long is

2045
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:22,100
kind of my thinking about it.

2046
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:23,100
Yeah.

2047
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:24,100
Because people like long videos.

2048
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:30,100
The long videos do well and there's really no reason to not do that.

2049
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:34,100
I wish, I wish that my lectures had been longer.

2050
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:42,100
It would only be better, they would only be better for having been longer, I think.

2051
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:43,100
I agree.

2052
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,100
Yeah.

2053
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,100
It's funny.

2054
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:47,100
I saw a long video recently.

2055
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,100
Yeah.

2056
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,100
I'll let you finish first.

2057
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:54,100
Oh, I was just going to say, I remember like people have commented on like how long they

2058
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,100
are.

2059
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:59,100
And like looking back, like, yeah, those, like the Sonata lecture came out in an era before

2060
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:06,100
you know, people making seven hour retrospectives about Pokemon Ruby, 12 hour long retrospectives

2061
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:12,100
about, you know, Skyrim, a seven hour long retrospectives about victorious, you know,

2062
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:17,100
compared to all that, like two hours, 10 minutes is nothing.

2063
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:20,100
It's funny in hindsight.

2064
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:21,100
I've watched a long video.

2065
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:26,100
I watched a, I think it was, I don't know.

2066
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:30,100
I think it was, oh God, what was it?

2067
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:33,100
I watched like an eight hour long video yesterday.

2068
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:35,100
I just put it on like all day.

2069
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:38,100
It was a, well, I don't remember.

2070
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:41,100
And I'll think, I'm probably, it'll come to me.

2071
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,100
Was it a no cold world travest?

2072
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,100
No.

2073
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:46,100
No.

2074
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:51,100
I don't know.

2075
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:54,100
I don't know.

2076
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:58,100
Oh, was it Pokemon?

2077
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:01,100
I, listen, we, I don't, I don't remember.

2078
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:03,100
I will probably remember at some point.

2079
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:06,100
We don't have to dwell on it.

2080
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,100
Were you going to say oblivion?

2081
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:16,100
I was going to say, I saw, I got a video recommended to me that reminded me of a thing, a mini rant

2082
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:17,100
perhaps.

2083
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,100
But yeah, it was like a long video.

2084
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:23,100
It was like the first 100 levels of the back rooms explained.

2085
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:27,100
And I'm like, the back rooms, I know that mean, what do they mean levels?

2086
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:33,100
I thought it was just, thought it was just yellow, yellow empty office building.

2087
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:35,100
You know what the back rooms is, right?

2088
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,100
Yeah.

2089
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,100
No.

2090
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:39,100
It's, all right, you may have seen this.

2091
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,100
It's like based on liminal spaces.

2092
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:48,100
There's like a, I think there was a video series or just a short film made of the

2093
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:58,100
back rooms, which is like a, a dingy office building with uncanny architecture and like

2094
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:01,100
weird hallways and it doesn't make sense.

2095
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:03,100
And it goes on and on forever.

2096
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,100
Yeah.

2097
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:08,100
It's like the sense of a liminal space, but a video of it.

2098
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:12,100
But then there was a monster and monsters scary.

2099
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:14,100
That does sound scary.

2100
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:17,100
I think that would scare me a lot.

2101
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,100
Yeah.

2102
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:23,100
Well, I think nowadays there's like at least 10 or 20 people who are making back rooms

2103
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:27,100
videos that are actually, for the most part, a lot of the ones I've seen are very, very

2104
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,100
well made.

2105
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:30,100
It's not a genre video.

2106
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:39,100
People really like this idea of like the, the, the sort of the feeling of being a kid

2107
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:45,100
and lost in some, in your parents like office building or like in a place where there's

2108
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:52,100
no people around and it's just like oppressive fluorescent lights and, and it's just sort

2109
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:58,100
of unnerving that it's like, cause like the idea is that you're there and there's no,

2110
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:04,100
like you just black out and you wake up there and there's no way out and you're just trapped

2111
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,100
there forever.

2112
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:06,100
Yeah.

2113
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:09,100
And that's a, that's an appealing prospect.

2114
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,100
For a horror setting.

2115
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,100
Yeah.

2116
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:16,100
For a horror setting, it's like this infinite space that just kind of looks the same, but

2117
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:19,100
like, it doesn't really make sense and it just stretches on forever and you're just kind

2118
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:22,100
of stuck there.

2119
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:27,100
You know, so yeah, like I was watching that video and the video has to go through like

2120
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:29,100
a hundred like versions of this.

2121
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:31,100
So like there's like one that's an office building.

2122
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:34,100
There's one that's like a basement full of pipes that goes on forever.

2123
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:38,100
There's one that's like a hotel lobby that goes on forever, et cetera.

2124
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:43,100
And the video was sort of like, I guess he wanted to be concise.

2125
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:45,100
Like he didn't really spend a lot of time on each one.

2126
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:49,100
The video was only an hour long to talk about a hundred things.

2127
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:53,100
So I feel like that could have been a video that could have benefited from its length.

2128
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:58,100
But the other thing that I was thinking about watching it, it's not directly related to

2129
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:04,100
this conversation is I kind of, I kind of hate how like this cool idea of just like an infinite

2130
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:06,100
space that goes on forever.

2131
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:09,100
Like everyone's like, yeah, but where's the monster?

2132
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:14,100
Where's this scary stick figure that jumps out at you and goes, blah, we need like ten

2133
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:17,100
pages of lore and there has to be a bunch of monsters and they come in different types

2134
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,100
and they have these rules.

2135
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:21,100
And if you you blink three times and then like it's just all this.

2136
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:24,100
Well, that's I mean, that's just that's just good horror writing.

2137
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:28,100
You know, it needs you need to have like a really clear explanation of like what everything

2138
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,100
is.

2139
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:33,100
You need to be able to like put it on a spreadsheet.

2140
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:35,100
They overcomplicate everything.

2141
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,100
It's it I get the compulsion.

2142
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:40,100
If you can't I mean it's a mystery.

2143
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:41,100
I want to figure it out.

2144
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:42,100
I want to figure it out.

2145
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:47,100
But like people that just would just make up an idea for like something and then people

2146
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:50,100
like, oh, yeah, that's probably that's that's a good idea.

2147
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:53,100
So that's now canon in our fan and world.

2148
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:58,100
If there isn't a well understood explanation for what the monster is and its exact capabilities

2149
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:03,100
and what sort of taxonomy and hierarchy it exists within, then like, what are we going

2150
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,100
to make a wiki about?

2151
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,100
Yeah.

2152
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:08,100
I I didn't like the the monster.

2153
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:14,100
I I didn't realize how much the monster detracts from the feeling.

2154
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:17,100
I always like the liminal spaces posts.

2155
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:23,100
They're like, ah, that's it's just it's an odd feeling to see something that is a liminal

2156
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:29,100
space because it just it's it's like nostalgic but like I'm nerving.

2157
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:40,100
And like the it's still and it's like, what do I do here?

2158
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:43,100
But the the back rooms with the monsters.

2159
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:49,100
It just sort of becomes like, oh, no, you're there's a minotaur in this maze and he's going

2160
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:50,100
to get you.

2161
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:55,100
These rooms would be so awesome to be in with like people.

2162
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,100
Yeah.

2163
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:57,100
Yeah.

2164
01:43:57,100 --> 01:44:02,100
So what I'm posting here is a offshoot of the back rooms called the pool rooms.

2165
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:07,100
Actually, that descending staircase into the abyss is actually scary.

2166
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:09,100
I don't like that one.

2167
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:10,100
Yeah.

2168
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:13,100
Yeah, these are great.

2169
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:16,100
The pool rooms is like the better version of the back rooms for me.

2170
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:21,100
And the main thing like some people have made videos where like spooky spooky monster jumps

2171
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:22,100
out of the pool.

2172
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:26,100
But like there was one animation I saw that's really well done.

2173
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:33,100
I'm going to link it by what's his name like Matt something hold on.

2174
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:42,100
I think the the thing that's just it's really captivating is is the the apparent stillness

2175
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:47,100
like if you're standing here and you're looking at this there's nobody around you can keep

2176
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:52,100
walking you can look around but like there's no like sense of urgency.

2177
01:44:52,100 --> 01:45:00,100
I feel like the sense of urgency is contrary to what the liminal space images like bring

2178
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:03,100
to the table.

2179
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:09,100
It's like if you had a doom level in a little more space back rooms level is like or a quake

2180
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:10,100
level.

2181
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:13,100
It'd be fun but it would just be a quake level.

2182
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:14,100
Oh God.

2183
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,100
Yeah.

2184
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:16,100
Although I would like that.

2185
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,100
Now they say it.

2186
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:25,100
This is like even knowing that like there's no like jump scare and this like it's too

2187
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:27,100
tense for me to watch.

2188
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:30,100
I know it's really well done though.

2189
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:33,100
Like this is all just an animation.

2190
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:37,100
I mean you think they built all of us for real.

2191
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:40,100
Oh it's animated.

2192
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,100
Yeah.

2193
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:47,100
I guess that makes sense is the camera motion.

2194
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:48,100
Yeah.

2195
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:52,100
The found footage but like the footage is so fucking weird.

2196
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:54,100
I mean where are they.

2197
01:45:54,100 --> 01:46:00,100
I mean I yeah so I mean some of these rooms seem like they might exist in some capacity

2198
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:06,100
somewhere but like not a whole complex like this yeah.

2199
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:11,100
It's a feeling of like going into an abandoned building and not being sure if there's like

2200
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:15,100
somebody is going to tell you to get out of here.

2201
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:16,100
Yeah.

2202
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:24,100
You're just like you know it's real life so real life doesn't have random encounters

2203
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:26,100
so like there's no monsters going to come.

2204
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:31,100
It would actually be really man I don't know.

2205
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:35,100
I don't know what would scare me more like the prospect out of this.

2206
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:41,100
There's like if I was here in one of these pool room places it would be scary to be

2207
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:49,100
all alone and think like I'm the only one here like there's like nothing.

2208
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:54,100
This just goes on forever and ever and I'm the only one and like there's nothing else.

2209
01:46:54,100 --> 01:47:00,100
It's just an expanse but it's also scary to think like what if someone did show up.

2210
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:07,100
Like what if what if there was someone like I don't know I would feel like.

2211
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:12,100
Are they going to get me or are they going to do something like.

2212
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:15,100
I'm going to have sex with me or what's going to happen.

2213
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:20,100
I would feel like if someone finds me if someone finds me here it's like they're going to think

2214
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,100
I'm not supposed to be here they're going to do something to me.

2215
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:24,100
Yeah.

2216
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:30,100
It's the sense of that that possibility because you don't know anything about this place.

2217
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:35,100
It's not like oh in 5am the janitor will come and open up.

2218
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,100
It's like you have no idea what the hell is going on.

2219
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:42,100
The fear comes from not seeing anything.

2220
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:45,100
Not actually seeing a monster running after you.

2221
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:49,100
And but assuming that it could could be there.

2222
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:53,100
I remember good fucking atmosphere.

2223
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:57,100
It's it's thick the atmosphere is thick.

2224
01:47:57,100 --> 01:48:02,100
By the way I remembered the long video I watched it was the new LS mark ranking every

2225
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:06,100
SpongeBob SquarePants episode ever seven hours.

2226
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,100
It's good.

2227
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:10,100
Oh I think I saw that and recommended.

2228
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:15,100
I had I have what I have watched the one he did it with the Simpsons he did it with family guy.

2229
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,100
I watched both.

2230
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:17,100
Oh yes that guy.

2231
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:19,100
I haven't watched any of those.

2232
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:21,100
It's something about.

2233
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:22,100
His avatar.

2234
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:30,100
No well that but also just the the idea of like ranking every episode of.

2235
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,100
I don't know.

2236
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:35,100
I I feel like I can't imagine game.

2237
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:36,100
I'm down for it.

2238
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,100
Like yeah.

2239
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:38,100
All right.

2240
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:46,100
Well I I mean you can you can tell me then do they get into an acceptable or satisfying

2241
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:50,100
level of depth with their regards regards their opinion on each episode.

2242
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:54,100
It or do they like say yeah this one was pretty good.

2243
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,100
Next one.

2244
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:59,100
He will generally give.

2245
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:05,100
I mean he goes more into it like that if he doesn't like it he'll explain why if he

2246
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:10,100
does like it he'll explain why they do tend the explanations tend to get shorter and

2247
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:16,100
shorter but it's because like they start to fall into patterns that like you've seen already

2248
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:22,100
like if a season has like a recurring theme that he finds really annoying like you know

2249
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:26,100
he doesn't have to explain it multiple times he'll just be like oh it's another episode

2250
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:32,100
like this only instead of this situation it's in that situation but it still does this this

2251
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:39,100
and that so you know really annoying didn't like it bottom of the list anyway next episode.

2252
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:45,100
Some some of them he'll have give a pretty short explanation for but you know usually

2253
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:49,100
have a thing or two to say about each one.

2254
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:55,100
I mean I guess I like the real gyms like season.

2255
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:57,100
I love the real gyms.

2256
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:04,100
Season reviews because in a smaller capsule when he's only talking about so many episodes

2257
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:10,100
you can get more of a of a recommendation or like a sense of what it's like to watch

2258
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,100
that season.

2259
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:17,100
If you're doing like every episode you're gonna forget which ones are good by the end

2260
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:20,100
and it's just YouTube squish.

2261
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:25,100
Yeah I mean yeah you definitely forget.

2262
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:29,100
He doesn't keep like a running tally of the full list.

2263
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:35,100
He keeps a list of a by season like as he goes through the season he'll rank all the episodes

2264
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:41,100
in the season and then only at the end does he give you the full list of like all you know

2265
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:46,100
900 episodes he'll read up the names off in order like this is the full master my full

2266
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:56,100
ranking for yeah I mean you definitely do not remember where every episode fell on the

2267
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:58,100
list as he goes through them.

2268
01:50:58,100 --> 01:51:00,100
It's like many.

2269
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:08,100
Like I appreciate that it's like type of like mindless content that's fun to just put on.

2270
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:14,100
Yeah but I always like it when there's a bit of a point to the video.

2271
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:20,100
Like Drew Gooden is a YouTuber who talks about all sorts of things.

2272
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:28,100
He made a video comparing every season of Saturday Night Live to see if it actually has gotten less funny

2273
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:34,100
or whatever and he had like that was the ideas like it's a question and he's gonna answer it by

2274
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:40,100
watching an obscene amount of media and it's like oh yeah you know at the end he has a conclusion

2275
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:46,100
and like something to talk about at the end of watching every Simpsons episodes I guess they just have

2276
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:48,100
their favorites and their least favorites.

2277
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:49,100
No.

2278
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:52,100
Which is less engaging for me but it's fine.

2279
01:51:52,100 --> 01:52:00,100
I think see I feel like it's kind of the same because like I mean there sort of is an implicit

2280
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:07,100
question there it's like well you know did it get as did it get bad like when did it get bad

2281
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:09,100
and when did it get bad?

2282
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:10,100
Yeah.

2283
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:12,100
Did it get bad after season 8? Season 10?

2284
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:17,100
He does come to conclusions at the end and he's like yeah so like after like this was

2285
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:24,100
kind of the point where it fell off and like this this was the this was the like how I felt about it.

2286
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:32,100
Like he has a different he comes to kind of different impressions of the of like Simpsons

2287
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:36,100
versus Family Guy versus SpongeBob.

2288
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:44,100
I think it's I think it's he gives a little bit of I guess you could call it analysis

2289
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:48,100
enough that it's engaging for me anyway.

2290
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:49,100
Alright.

2291
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:50,100
I like them.

2292
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:55,100
I have to pee again though so fuck.

2293
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:56,100
BRB.

2294
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:57,100
Damn.

2295
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:58,100
Dang.

2296
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:04,100
Eleazar put an image of Howard Hamlin smiling at the camera in the center of the screen

2297
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:08,100
and slowly zoom in for 20 seconds.

2298
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:12,100
And on top of that put a picture of Oyster smiling please.

2299
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:14,100
Oyster smiling?

2300
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:16,100
Do you know Celery Man?

2301
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:18,100
I don't.

2302
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:21,100
It's Tim and Eric's skit.

2303
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:23,100
Oh I love Tim and Eric though.

2304
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:29,100
Uh yeah it's uh yeah if you google Celery Man you'll find the clip.

2305
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,100
Damn.

2306
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:33,100
I think it's is it Paul Rudd?

2307
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:36,100
Is that his name?

2308
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:37,100
Guy who played Ant-Man.

2309
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:39,100
Yeah Paul Rudd.

2310
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,100
Oh my god.

2311
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:41,100
His coffee spilled all over.

2312
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,100
And he's Celery Man.

2313
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:45,100
Oh he's not Celery Man but he's working.

2314
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:46,100
And he's-

2315
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:47,100
That is Paul Rudd.

2316
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:50,100
Yeah he's got a computer.

2317
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:53,100
I believe today is Sunday and tomorrow is Monday.

2318
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:56,100
Better Call Saul Day.

2319
01:53:56,100 --> 01:54:00,100
You know Bob Odenkirk is on Tim and Eric as well.

2320
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:03,100
A few people from Better Call Saul.

2321
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:11,100
In fact a lot of the actors in Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad come from comedic backgrounds.

2322
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:18,100
Yeah I know in Breaking Bad there was the two guys.

2323
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:19,100
The big guy.

2324
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:20,100
And then the little guy.

2325
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:21,100
The ginger guy.

2326
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:24,100
The ginger guy is um fuck I know his name.

2327
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:25,100

I know his name.

2329
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:28,100
I know there's a B in his name.

2330
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:34,100
He was the guy for F is for Family and he's a great comedian as well.

2331
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:35,100

2332
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:36,100
Bill Burr.

2333
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:37,100
Bill Burr.

2334
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:42,100
And the other guy um what's his character's name?

2335
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:44,100
Big fat guy.

2336
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:45,100

2338
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:47,100
Hewl.

2339
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:49,100
He is I think a comedian as well.

2340
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:50,100
I'm back.

2341
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:52,100
What are we talking about?

2342
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:57,100
I'm talking about comedic actors being in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.

2343
01:54:57,100 --> 01:55:02,100
You know I found a clip that didn't have that many views.

2344
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:07,100
It was from like an older show Bob Odenkirk did way before Breaking Bad where he was like

2345
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:13,100
man I had a job at a law firm and I had to quit for Chuck.

2346
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:15,100
Wait you're talking about Mr. Show right?

2347
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:17,100
I think so.

2348
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:20,100
Yeah the law school sketch for Mr. Show.

2349
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:28,100
I've seen people suggest that it's a yeah that it's the same character.

2350
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:33,100
Well there's the law school sketch that has the actor for Chuck playing a law professor

2351
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:35,100
with you know Bob Odenkirk.

2352
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:36,100
Right.

2353
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:40,100
In the background but there was like another show where he said where he said he had to

2354
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:45,100
quit a law school quit like a job at a law firm for a guy named Chuck.

2355
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:46,100
Oh I haven't seen that one.

2356
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:47,100
That was like not Mr. Show.

2357
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,100
That was like a separate clip.

2358
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:49,100
Let me find it.

2359
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,100
Oh weird.

2360
01:55:50,100 --> 01:56:00,100
The Bob Odenkirk Law Breaking Bad Mr. Show Chuck Saga Law Web is very tangly.

2361
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:05,100
Here it is.

2362
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:07,100
Welcome to law school.

2363
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:10,100
I'm Professor Peans.

2364
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:15,100
Oh that guy was on Tim and Eric as well.

2365
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:16,100
No maybe.

2366
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:19,100
Wait you mean David Cross?

2367
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:22,100
The glasses guy.

2368
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:24,100
There's two glasses guys.

2369
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:26,100
The glasses guy with the no hair.

2370
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:29,100
Oh my god they both have no hair.

2371
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:31,100
The glasses guy with the gray hoodie.

2372
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:32,100
That's David.

2373
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:33,100
That's David Cross yeah.

2374
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:34,100
Yeah.

2375
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:36,100
Bob Odenkirk on news radio.

2376
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:39,100
Wait this isn't Mr. Show.

2377
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:42,100
Yeah I don't think this is Mr. Show.

2378
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:45,100
This is like some other thing where he's like again pre-breaking bad.

2379
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:50,100
Oh this is some other sketch comedy show that he did with David Cross.

2380
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:52,100
But not Mr. Show.

2381
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:55,100
I have to feel like the creators of.

2382
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:57,100
And it's got all the same fucking people.

2383
01:56:57,100 --> 01:57:01,100
Both of these other all four of these people were in Mr. Show.

2384
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:02,100
I don't know.

2385
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:04,100
I recognize all of them.

2386
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:11,100
There's another guy from Mr. Show who appears in like one episode of Better Call Saul in the most recent season.

2387
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:14,100
I don't know if you've seen it yet.

2388
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:17,100
I haven't watched, no I haven't seen the new season.

2389
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:20,100
I haven't seen a single Better Call Saul.

2390
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:27,100
Mr. Show has so many actors that like went on to do other things like Tom Kenny is in Mr. Show.

2391
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:28,100
That's crazy.

2392
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:29,100
Oh shit really.

2393
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:33,100
Yeah he's really funny.

2394
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:37,100
There's the girl.

2395
01:57:37,100 --> 01:57:42,100
I don't know some girl who was in I think in 24.

2396
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:47,100
It was like Jack Bauer's assistant in like the first couple seasons of 24.

2397
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:51,100
Was in Mr. Show.

2398
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:53,100
There's a bunch more.

2399
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:58,100
Yeah I think a bunch of people who went on to be in Tim and Eric and stuff.

2400
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:04,100
Yeah this guy from this Tim and Eric skit was also a major character in Better Call Saul as well.

2401
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:07,100
He played Cliff Mane.

2402
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:12,100
I can't wait to watch that and be like oh the Cinco Phone Guy.

2403
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:16,100
Yeah he plays a very important character.

2404
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:19,100
Well maybe not super important but I think he's important.

2405
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:20,100
I love Cliff Mane.

2406
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:23,100
He's just an old man who's trying to be a good lawyer.

2407
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:30,100
It had been a long time since the last Better Call Saul season came out right?

2408
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:33,100
Yeah like a two year gap or something.

2409
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:39,100
Okay then I think I was caught up because yeah I watched it a few years ago.

2410
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:44,100
Did he get to the part with the Germans?

2411
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:47,100
Ooh I don't know that doesn't ring a bell.

2412
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:50,100
German engineers building.

2413
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:52,100
Does that ring a bell?

2414
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:54,100
Not really so maybe I did.

2415
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:57,100
Oh my god you might not have even seen season 4 then.

2416
01:58:57,100 --> 01:59:00,100
You know what I don't think I did see season 4.

2417
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,100
Shoot you gotta catch up.

2418
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:04,100
And I don't remember what happened in season 3.

2419
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:07,100
I'm so fucking stupid man I don't remember anything.

2420
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:09,100
Oh god no.

2421
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:12,100
I don't remember what happened in the show.

2422
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:14,100
I almost said Mr. Show.

2423
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:18,100
You gotta watch a retrospective more video.

2424
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:22,100
I should watch LS Mark rank every episode of Better Call Saul and that will tell.

2425
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:25,100
No just watch the show instead.

2426
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:31,100
Why would I watch the show when I can watch an 8 hour long YouTube video explaining the show?

2427
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:35,100
Yeah instead of watching a season for 8 hours.

2428
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:41,100
Watching even longer even more time listening to a YouTuber tell me about it.

2429
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:44,100
I should watch a fucking...

2430
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:48,100
Oh I just watched a video.

2431
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:56,100
It was explaining how react content is basically wage theft.

2432
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:59,100
No.

2433
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:02,100
No he's pretty much right.

2434
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:04,100
No I agreed with it.

2435
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:06,100
They made a really compelling case.

2436
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:08,100
What was the case?

2437
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:10,100
This is basically...

2438
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:19,100
He used an example of some YouTuber who like his whole thing is just reacting to stuff.

2439
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:27,100
It's basically just the idea that someone who does reaction content

2440
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:34,100
basically it's other people invest the time and the effort and the money into making content

2441
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:41,100
but that just becomes the content of a react streamer

2442
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:52,100
and at the same time that person's reaction content is also taking views away from

2443
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:59,100
not just the person that made the content originally but just the broader YouTube ecosystem.

2444
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:03,100
Are you certain that they're taking views away?

2445
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:07,100
He made a pretty compelling case that they do yeah.

2446
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:12,100
I'm pretty sure that for certain things once you see somebody react to it

2447
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:16,100
you don't care to go and check it out yourself because you've already seen it.

2448
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:18,100
I think that's most things.

2449
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:20,100
Well react channels now...

2450
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:24,100
I think it really depends on the relative sizes of the audience though.

2451
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:27,100
If they're like a big channel and you're like a small channel

2452
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:30,100
that would probably bring more exposure than you'd have otherwise

2453
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:33,100
and then you could get a lot more fans from that.

2454
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:37,100
Okay, yes?

2455
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:39,100
I wonder what the math is on that.

2456
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:45,100
Like if you're small and a big react channel reacts to something

2457
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:49,100
then yeah that's gonna bring exposure

2458
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:57,100
but I think in terms of the entire ecosystem of YouTube

2459
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:01,100
of like what are people watching

2460
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:05,100
the general trend is like if people are watching react content

2461
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:09,100
they're not watching original content and so on the whole

2462
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:13,100
it does like take views away from other people who make content

2463
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:19,100
and funnel it into people who merely aggregate it

2464
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:24,100
in the form of reaction content.

2465
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:26,100
And I think it's true, I agreed with it.

2466
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:32,100
I only ever look at reaction videos for things I've already seen.

2467
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:35,100
Yeah, I don't think...

2468
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:39,100
I'm not sure if that's how most people do it

2469
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:42,100
but I don't... how did I even get on this topic?

2470
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:45,100
I guess most people are just...

2471
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:48,100
I don't know, we're talking about Better Call Saul and then this happened.

2472
02:02:48,100 --> 02:02:50,100
Wait, fuck, why did I bring this up?

2473
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:53,100
I had a point that I wanted to make.

2474
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:56,100
You mentioned someone made a video about react channels being bad.

2475
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:59,100
Yeah.

2476
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:02,100
No, but why did I bring that video up?

2477
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:06,100
Shit, what were we talking about before?

2478
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:13,100
Something on the topic of watching long explanations of things instead of watching the thing.

2479
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:16,100
Oh, yeah, I think I was just gonna...

2480
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:20,100
I think that was all in service and I was gonna joke that I was just gonna watch

2481
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:25,100
and go and react to Better Call Saul instead of watching Better Call Saul.

2482
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:28,100
Yeah, that was it.

2483
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,100
Yeah, that's it, that's all.

2484
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:35,100
I do watch people react to Better Call Saul and because...

2485
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:38,100
When it's like network television, I feel like...

2486
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:42,100
When it's network television, I don't think it has the same.

2487
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,100
I don't care that much.

2488
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:47,100
Well, especially because to avoid copyright detection, they have to like...

2489
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:51,100
They can't even show the whole episode, they just kind of have to edit it down to like...

2490
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:52,100
Yeah.

2491
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:56,100
Like just like half the length of the actual episode, just like the highlights.

2492
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:58,100
That makes sense.

2493
02:03:58,100 --> 02:04:02,100
Actually, you know, what I would agree is wage theft is when channels are like...

2494
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:06,100
If you want to see the unedited full reaction, sign up for my Patreon.

2495
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:08,100
People who do that, I'm like, that's a little scummy.

2496
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:09,100
What the fuck?

2497
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:14,100
Wait, hey, I reacted to How to Train Your Dragon if you want to watch...

2498
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:17,100
I only show like 30 minutes worth of highlights on YouTube.

2499
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:19,100
If you want to see my full unedited reaction, go to Patreon.

2500
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:22,100
I'm like, wouldn't that be more of a copyright violation since people...

2501
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:24,100
It's behind a paywall?

2502
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:25,100
Also, who would pay for that?

2503
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:27,100
Yeah, it absolutely is.

2504
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:30,100
Like, who would pay money to see that?

2505
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:34,100
Like, you could buy the movie for the price of that.

2506
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:39,100
I mean, reaction content has always been like a...

2507
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:43,100
How legal is it, actually, sort of thing.

2508
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:44,100
If you just...

2509
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:47,100
I feel like if somebody is like commentating...

2510
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:50,100
Like, you can do a commentary of a thing.

2511
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:53,100
You're not really supposed to put the film in there.

2512
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:57,100
You can have a commentary track that you can play with the film that you own.

2513
02:04:57,100 --> 02:05:04,100
But like a reaction YouTuber, is it a video they have of just the whole film?

2514
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:08,100
Here's the video I saw.

2515
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:11,100
Uh, yeah.

2516
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:15,100
Reactors, the professional parasites, how everyone loses except...

2517
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:17,100
I believe it, even if it was false.

2518
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:20,100
Because I just don't like reaction content.

2519
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:22,100
Uh, I hadn't really thought about it.

2520
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:26,100
Oh, wait, I know this guy. He attacked Dream.

2521
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:30,100
Wait, uh, Dark Viper or Asmongold?

2522
02:05:30,100 --> 02:05:35,100
Yeah, Dark Viper, he fucking confronted Dream on his cheating bullshit

2523
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:38,100
and like called him out pretty hard when it happened.

2524
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:41,100
And Dream was like, oh, no, no, no, no, man.

2525
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:44,100
Oh, let me convince you, but I'm not cheating and he would...

2526
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:45,100
Oh, well.

2527
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:46,100
Pretty good.

2528
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:47,100
Well, we all know how that...

2529
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:48,100
Dream was a duity cheater.

2530
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:50,100
Yeah, I don't think...

2531
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:53,100
I've never seen or heard Dream,

2532
02:05:53,100 --> 02:06:00,100
but I have a strong negative opinion of him from everything that I've heard.

2533
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:05,100
He makes...

2534
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:10,100
He's able to pull off cool Minecraft stunts

2535
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:12,100
when playing against his friends and speedrunning.

2536
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:14,100
Well, they try and kill him and all that shit.

2537
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:21,100
Well, over time, more and more, it feels like the videos are becoming more staged.

2538
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:22,100
Yeah.

2539
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:25,100
And he's also kind of a dickhead.

2540
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:30,100
He's a real Ben St on that Twitter just going out attacking people

2541
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:33,100
or some shit I actually don't know if he attacks people.

2542
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:38,100
I don't believe for a second that he is anything like me.

2543
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:40,100
You know, probably not.

2544
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:42,100
That just doesn't track.

2545
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:45,100
Look, I can't roll it out if I haven't checked.

2546
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:48,100
I'd be okay, yeah, true.

2547
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,100
Yeah.

2548
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:52,100
Maybe.

2549
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:54,100
Oh, take any chances.

2550
02:06:54,100 --> 02:06:56,100
Oh, there's a new Sean video.

2551
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:57,100
The weirdest thing.

2552
02:06:57,100 --> 02:06:59,100
I'll watch that later.

2553
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:04,100
The weirdest thing to come out of that was the fucking Numberphile guy making a video about Dream.

2554
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:06,100
Matt Parker?

2555
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:08,100
Yeah, Matt Parker.

2556
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:10,100
That was crazy.

2557
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:12,100
Oh, I don't know if I saw...

2558
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:14,100
I mean, I heard...

2559
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:16,100
I think it was Carl Yobbs.

2560
02:07:16,100 --> 02:07:22,100
I think I heard Carl Yobbs explain how Dream definitely cheated.

2561
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:25,100
Carl Yobbs?

2562
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:27,100
Or J-Jobbs?

2563
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:29,100
I don't know how to say it, yeah.

2564
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:30,100
I don't know how to pronounce it.

2565
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:32,100
Maybe you're correct.

2566
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:37,100
All I know is that this video is the best video by far on all of that stuff

2567
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:39,100
because it's maths.

2568
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:44,100
Yeah, I can trust Matt Parker to be somewhat good at maths.

2569
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:48,100
I was convinced that, like, yeah, mathematically.

2570
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:51,100
I mean, at this point, like, he's admitted to cheating, so...

2571
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:52,100
Yeah.

2572
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:55,100
It's not that there's any question about it, but, yeah, back then,

2573
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:57,100
when it was kind of a new thing, I remember I watched...

2574
02:07:57,100 --> 02:07:59,100
I think it was the Carl Yobbs video.

2575
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:02,100
I was like, okay, so the maths says that it's definitely...

2576
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:04,100
he definitely cheated and he's just a liar.

2577
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:06,100
Dream is such...

2578
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:14,100
I mean, he's a product of, like, the way, like, the algorithm and luck

2579
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:21,100
can elevate, like, complete who cares, nobody's into such positions of power.

2580
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:23,100
He's just some kid.

2581
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:27,100
And he's like, um, I think cheat.

2582
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:32,100
I've hired a real physicist, astrophysicist, to prove otherwise.

2583
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:35,100
And it became news.

2584
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:36,100
It's just some...

2585
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:37,100
Yeah.

2586
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:39,100
He's just a rat.

2587
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:41,100
And he's, like, a god.

2588
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:44,100
The world has made it a god.

2589
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:45,100
Yeah.

2590
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:47,100
What's even more of a dream is Mr. Beast.

2591
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:50,100
And specifically, Mr. Beast's worthless friends.

2592
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:55,100
They just look like kids who sat in school and played Call of Duty and did nothing,

2593
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:59,100
and now they're, like, millionaires because they're friends with a guy.

2594
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:03,100
I don't know anything about them or...

2595
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:05,100
All I know about Mr. Beast is just...

2596
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:08,100
That's just the guy who, like, spends tons of money on stuff, right?

2597
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:14,100
Well, he, like, gives, like, tens of thousands of dollars to people all the fucking time in his videos.

2598
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:15,100
That's pretty cool.

2599
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:18,100
I like that he gives, like, a lot of money away.

2600
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:26,100
It's very clickable content to see some person get given a free car in their reaction.

2601
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:28,100
And they're like, oh my god, what?

2602
02:09:28,100 --> 02:09:29,100
A free car?

2603
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:34,100
First person to leave, last person to leave this circle wins two million dollars,

2604
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:36,100
and it's like 100 people standing in a big circle,

2605
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:38,100
and every day they make the circle smaller,

2606
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:40,100
or they throw in little hazards to fuck with them,

2607
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:43,100
or they're like, oh, if you walk outside the circle on this plank,

2608
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:45,100
you can get, like, $30,000 right now,

2609
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:48,100
but if you fall off the plank, you get nothing.

2610
02:09:48,100 --> 02:09:50,100
It's just fucking with...

2611
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:53,100
Just dangling money in front of people like keys.

2612
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:56,100
But, like, even when people lose, they'll still give them a couple thousand anyway,

2613
02:09:56,100 --> 02:09:58,100
just to be nice.

2614
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:59,100
And it's like, okay.

2615
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:01,100
I mean...

2616
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:04,100
I mean, sure, yeah.

2617
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:06,100
I guess.

2618
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:09,100
I don't find the content, like, that interesting,

2619
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:13,100
but, like, the fact that it's as big as it is is amusing,

2620
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:15,100
and, like, interesting in that way.

2621
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:21,100
It's like, ah, well, like, I saw this video where he made a chocolate factory,

2622
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:23,100
like Willy Wonka,

2623
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:28,100
and he had people go through the chocolate factory doing tusks,

2624
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:31,100
and if they win, they get to own the factory.

2625
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:33,100
But then at the end, he's like,

2626
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:39,100
actually, you can sell me that factory for, like, $100,000 or something.

2627
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:42,100
And so it's just, like, giving people money.

2628
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:43,100
That's very funny.

2629
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:44,100
He had, like, a...

2630
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:45,100
That's a very funny thing to do.

2631
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:47,100
Yeah, and it's like, that's kind of cool.

2632
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:53,100
The actual content is kind of YouTuber, screamy, like, not really my thing.

2633
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:57,100
Just the fact that he had, like, all of that, like, a huge set,

2634
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:59,100
so many camera crews, like, all of these...

2635
02:10:59,100 --> 02:11:01,100
Like, when he built Squid Game,

2636
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:04,100
that was like, huh, he actually did that.

2637
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:08,100
I think it was just brown water, but, I mean, that's how it was in the movie.

2638
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:09,100
Yeah.

2639
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:12,100
Now, that's content.

2640
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:13,100
Yeah.

2641
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:16,100
Yeah.

2642
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:18,100
We need a hundred Mr. Beasts,

2643
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:21,100
and then there'd be so much great content.

2644
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:25,100
If we had a hundred Mr. Beasts, everyone would have a...

2645
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:28,100
Sorry, I was distracted by a dinosaur image.

2646
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:32,100
No, that's the ending of Better Call Saul, Kim Ghost of a Dinosaurs.

2647
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:33,100
It's true.

2648
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:35,100
Oh, darn.

2649
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:36,100
Let me spoil it.

2650
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:39,100
I don't know who any of that is.

2651
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:42,100
These are characters from Better Call Saul, and they're cool.

2652
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:49,100
That's a guy from Mr. Show.

2653
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:52,100
That was a famous guy who was on Mr. Show, just like everybody.

2654
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:55,100
More like Better Cock Saul.

2655
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:56,100
Am I right?

2656
02:11:57,100 --> 02:11:58,100
I don't...

2657
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:02,100
You know, before I watched Ivor's show,

2658
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:04,100
my friends were telling me about Better Call Saul,

2659
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:07,100
and I'm like, Better Call Saul, more like, Better Fuck Chuck.

2660
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:09,100
And they were laughing.

2661
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:12,100
They were laughing real hard, because little did I know

2662
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:16,100
what would actually happen when I watched the show.

2663
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:23,100
I just realized that picture of Saul and Mike is in the AVGN room.

2664
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:25,100
Oh, my God.

2665
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:32,100
Gained some lotion. They're looking a little tan.

2666
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:38,100
They're looking a little, yeah, I mean, blotchy.

2667
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:43,100
They look like they could use some grafts.

2668
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:48,100
Save them.

2669
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:50,100
Okay.

2670
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:52,100
With voicemails.

2671
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:55,100
Yeah, I was actually just gonna say,

2672
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:57,100
we've been going for two and a half hours.

2673
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:58,100
Is it time to go to voicemails?

2674
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:00,100
Yeah, yeah.

2675
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:03,100
Okay, well, let's do it.

2676
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:06,100
Go to speakbive.com.

2677
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:08,100
Is that the voicemails?

2678
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:10,100
Is that the...

2679
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:13,100
Yeah, to leave a voicemail.

2680
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:16,100
Okay.

2681
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:18,100
Let's see here.

2682
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:21,100
Did we listen to this one called Serious Question Time?

2683
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:24,100
I just got to close my window in case Moth's coming.

2684
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:29,100
I drew giant testicles during this recording, by the way.

2685
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:31,100
I just wanted to let people know about it.

2686
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:32,100
I'm back.

2687
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,100
Welcome back.

2688
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:34,100
Okay.

2689
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:36,100
Is the...

2690
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:40,100
Did we listen to this vocaru one called Son of a Glitch?

2691
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:42,100
No, we heard this one, didn't we?

2692
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:43,100
This one?

2693
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:45,100
This one called Son of a Glitch, a vocaru.

2694
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:47,100
Yes, we did.

2695
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:49,100
What is multiple, potentially?

2696
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:51,100
We'll listen just in case.

2697
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:54,100
All right, let's try this vocaru one.

2698
02:13:54,100 --> 02:13:56,100
Wait, wasn't this you, Oblivion?

2699
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:59,100
Yeah, these are me.

2700
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:03,100
I know I sent one in right after you stopped recording last week,

2701
02:14:03,100 --> 02:14:05,100
so this is probably a new one.

2702
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:07,100
Okay, okay.

2703
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:10,100
Yeah, well, let's listen.

2704
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:13,100
Uh, three, two, one, go.

2705
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:17,100
My favorite show on the internet, Son of a Glitch.

2706
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:20,100
Here's to top five video games I've put in my arsehole.

2707
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:23,100
Number one, Mario.

2708
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:28,100
You put them in?

2709
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:30,100
Now that's content.

2710
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:33,100
There is no game called Mario that's Super Mario Brothers

2711
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:37,100
or Mario Brothers or Mario Go typing.

2712
02:14:37,100 --> 02:14:41,100
I think the full quote was Mario, all of them,

2713
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:43,100
but I cut it short.

2714
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:47,100
So Son of a Glitch, I should confess, right?

2715
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:51,100
Me and my friend Maid, who the pilot he worked on

2716
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:53,100
is coming out like tomorrow.

2717
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:55,100
Pilot?

2718
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:57,100
It's called Monkey Wrench.

2719
02:14:57,100 --> 02:15:00,100
It's a show by Zarell, big YouTube animator.

2720
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:02,100
Oh, he's working on that.

2721
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:05,100
He made a 22-minute long pilot episode of a show.

2722
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:07,100
Maid worked on a bunch of scenes for it,

2723
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:10,100
and Zarell did all the cleanup.

2724
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:13,100
Imagine a 22-minute TV quality animation

2725
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:15,100
where all the line work for all the animation

2726
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:17,100
was done by one guy.

2727
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:19,100
That's insane.

2728
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:22,100
Yeah, Zarell did all the cleanup.

2729
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:25,100
How long did it take to burn?

2730
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:27,100
Oh, like at least three years.

2731
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:30,100
But anyways, me and Maid, we played Minecraft.

2732
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:32,100
We played the new update.

2733
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:34,100
It was spooky, it was scary, and we were just goofing around

2734
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:36,100
and I recorded it, and we were doing funny

2735
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:38,100
video game reviewer voices,

2736
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:40,100
and I just clipped a bunch of those

2737
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:42,100
and just made them into voicemails.

2738
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:44,100
So that's what all that shit is.

2739
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:49,100
Okay, I'm glad we know the back story

2740
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:51,100
of Son of a Glitch.

2741
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:54,100
There's probably going to be even more, who knows.

2742
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:58,100
Shower me with them.

2743
02:15:58,100 --> 02:16:01,100
The next non-worthless voicemail

2744
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:04,100
is I think it's this one called Pigeon Circus in Tampa.

2745
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:07,100
I just posted it there.

2746
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:10,100
Okay, three, two, one, go.

2747
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:11,100
Konnichiwa.

2748
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:13,100
Okay.

2749
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:15,100
Samurai-san.

2750
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:17,100
Venno Sentosa.

2751
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:20,100
You have this oneru.

2752
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:22,100
Samurai Master.

2753
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:23,100
True.

2754
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:25,100
Shinzo Abe-san.

2755
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:29,100
Conservative Nationally.

2756
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:30,100
Nationally.

2757
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:32,100
Icon-ness.

2758
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:34,100
Faka-yu.

2759
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:35,100
Practice.

2760
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:38,100
Venno Sentosa.

2761
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:40,100
Apo-yozo.

2762
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:42,100
Boku morare.

2763
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:44,100
Wiru-si.

2764
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:46,100
Buu kanseru.

2765
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:50,100
Until you next time.

2766
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:52,100
Sayonara.

2767
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:56,100
I fucking love that quote so much.

2768
02:16:56,100 --> 02:17:00,100
I gave the assassin his contraption.

2769
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:03,100
Yeah, I found it in my basement.

2770
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:05,100
Wait a minute.

2771
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:12,100
That reminds me of this guy who I found on Twitter.

2772
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:17,100
His name is Seth-sama or Sephiroth Sword.

2773
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:24,100
And I cannot tell if he is satirizing something

2774
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:28,100
or if this is like how he is.

2775
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:32,100
I don't know. Check this fucking tweet out.

2776
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:34,100
Just...

2777
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:36,100
Man.

2778
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:38,100
Okay.

2779
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:43,100
And then he made a video of himself.

2780
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:45,100
Okay, I got two more.

2781
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:48,100
Two more of this guy's tweets.

2782
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:50,100
His tribute.

2783
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:56,100
He made a video montage of himself drawing his tribute to Shinzo Abe.

2784
02:17:56,100 --> 02:18:02,100
And the tribute is this right here.

2785
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:04,100
And...

2786
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:10,100
Okay, looking at this, I know you'd think this is like a parody, right?

2787
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:13,100
You'd think this is like satire, but I don't know.

2788
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:15,100
Because this guy...

2789
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:20,100
I've checked out some of his videos and there's no artistry to them at all.

2790
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:24,100
There's no sense that he's doing a bit.

2791
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:28,100
There's no delivery. There's no comedy to them.

2792
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:30,100
It's just...

2793
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:33,100
How do you keep finding these weirdos?

2794
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:37,100
I found this guy a while ago when I just followed his Twitter because he was funny.

2795
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:42,100
But then I just saw this Abe tribute and I was like, whoa, this guy is delivering.

2796
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:46,100
This guy is delivering?

2797
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:49,100
Oh, I don't know.

2798
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:55,100
If anyone wants to look more deeply into Sephiroth's Sama...

2799
02:18:55,100 --> 02:19:00,100
He's even got a little Sonic on the end of his buster sword.

2800
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:09,100
I genuinely do not know what to think of this guy, but I am fascinated.

2801
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,100
That's all.

2802
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:15,100
The next...

2803
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:18,100
I had a realization even though I just realized something.

2804
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:19,100
What's up?

2805
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:21,100
Yeah.

2806
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:25,100
I'm just getting a screenshot here.

2807
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:28,100
I cannot wait to see what you've uncovered.

2808
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,100
Yeah, this is a little bit wild.

2809
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:34,100
I don't think we were meant to see this, but...

2810
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:36,100
Oh, no.

2811
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:38,100
Oh, no.

2812
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:41,100
Oh, no.

2813
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:43,100
Oh, no.

2814
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:46,100
Ben Orochi, Orochi-sama.

2815
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:49,100
I think I cracked the code.

2816
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:52,100
Is that Mike Scully?

2817
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:54,100
No, it's the other guy.

2818
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:56,100
It's James P. Sullivan.

2819
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:58,100
Mike Scully.

2820
02:19:58,100 --> 02:20:00,100
That's the green guy, right?

2821
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:02,100
I've never seen Monster's Inc.

2822
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:04,100
Why did I say Scully?

2823
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:06,100
Because this guy is Sully.

2824
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:10,100
Same energy. They're the same guy.

2825
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:12,100
They're identical.

2826
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:14,100
Fascinating.

2827
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:17,100
Oh, my God, there's a spider so close to me.

2828
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:19,100
Ew.

2829
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:24,100
There was a Daddy Long Legs the other day in my room.

2830
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:26,100
That's pretty rare.

2831
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:29,100
There's not usually bugs in here, which is the one nice thing.

2832
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:35,100
The one good thing I could say about my shitty apartment is that there's usually not bugs in my room.

2833
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:38,100
On that day, that failed.

2834
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:40,100
Even that...

2835
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:42,100
It failed to clear even that low bar.

2836
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:44,100
Anyway, what?

2837
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:49,100
It's like the tiny little garden spider, the size of a piece of crumb.

2838
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:51,100
I found...

2839
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:53,100
And he was leisurely walking up the wall.

2840
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:55,100
Oh, no, he stopped and then he's going.

2841
02:20:55,100 --> 02:21:01,100
Yeah, I found there was a Daddy Long Legs walking around near the end of my bed,

2842
02:21:02,100 --> 02:21:05,100
not on the bed, just at the floor near it.

2843
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:12,100
And then on a paper plate that I had been eating a sandwich on,

2844
02:21:12,100 --> 02:21:17,100
I found there was a tiny, tiny, tiny little spider walking around on it.

2845
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:19,100
Sucks.

2846
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:20,100
Hate this.

2847
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:22,100
Hate this shit.

2848
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:24,100
The next voicemail, I'm posting it now.

2849
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:26,100
Shit, I already posted it.

2850
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:30,100
It's called Prince in the Big City.

2851
02:21:30,100 --> 02:21:32,100
I think I know what this is about.

2852
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:35,100
Three, two, one, go.

2853
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:37,100
Wow.

2854
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:40,100
Boston, the Big Apple.

2855
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:43,100
I finally arrived.

2856
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:44,100
Amazing.

2857
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:48,100
RFCKcon7 here I come.

2858
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:55,100
Anyways, I guess the first thing I should do is go and kill Ben St.

2859
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:57,100
Yeah, number one.

2860
02:21:57,100 --> 02:22:02,100
I have to figure out one thing before I can get to his location

2861
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:06,100
by my preferred mode of transportation.

2862
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:11,100
Where are the bike lanes?

2863
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:13,100
Where are the bike lanes?

2864
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:18,100
This guy is like Danish or something,

2865
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:22,100
lives in some some frugal European country where they ride bikes.

2866
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:27,100
I heard Boston had great walkability and stuff,

2867
02:22:27,100 --> 02:22:29,100
but no bike lanes.

2868
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:31,100
Yeah, not bike ability.

2869
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:32,100
That fucking sucks.

2870
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:35,100
Fuck Boston.

2871
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:37,100
There aren't many bike lanes.

2872
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:38,100
It's true.

2873
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:39,100
You just got to have helis.

2874
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:42,100
You just got to have roller blades.

2875
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:46,100
Oh, you know, actually, you might be right.

2876
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:50,100
You know, I mean, people do ride bikes around.

2877
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:52,100
I don't think we don't have dedicated bike lanes.

2878
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:54,100
I think you just ride on the fucking...

2879
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:55,100
Oh my God.

2880
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:56,100
Just ride in the breakdown lane.

2881
02:22:56,100 --> 02:23:00,100
You ride right in the middle of the road to avoid cars going either way.

2882
02:23:00,100 --> 02:23:02,100
Actually, did you see...

2883
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:04,100
Yeah, right down the middle in between, yep.

2884
02:23:04,100 --> 02:23:05,100
Did you see that fruity...

2885
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:07,100
I have a storm.

2886
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:12,100
That fruity document that the Texas GOP cooked up a few weeks ago.

2887
02:23:12,100 --> 02:23:15,100
A fruity document from the GOP?

2888
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:16,100
Nah.

2889
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:23,100
Okay, the Texas GOP released a document that was full of absolutely psycho-insane shit

2890
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:26,100
that they want to do if they win.

2891
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:29,100
And it's textless, so they're going to.

2892
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:30,100
It's...

2893
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:34,100
Yeah, but this is like worse than you think if you haven't heard of it already.

2894
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:35,100
Like...

2895
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:40,100
I mean, I think they want to, you know, make gay marriage illegal.

2896
02:23:40,100 --> 02:23:42,100
That's one thing.

2897
02:23:42,100 --> 02:23:44,100
Outlaw, yeah, outlaw gender.

2898
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:48,100
Outlaw gender, period.

2899
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:49,100
Yeah.

2900
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:51,100
Okay, so like...

2901
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:54,100
Yeah, they want to get rid of, you know, gay marriage.

2902
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:55,100
Obviously, they don't fucking do that.

2903
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:56,100
Contraception.

2904
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:57,100
No more contraception alone.

2905
02:23:57,100 --> 02:23:58,100
Yeah, they want to get rid of contraception.

2906
02:23:58,100 --> 02:24:02,100
They want to get rid of all-sex education at all levels and all grades.

2907
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:05,100
Even a harm prevention and risk aversion.

2908
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:08,100
They want to get rid of that education too.

2909
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:09,100
Right.

2910
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:10,100
They...

2911
02:24:10,100 --> 02:24:12,100
So they can more easily take advantage of them.

2912
02:24:12,100 --> 02:24:14,100
Preventing harm is so fucking woke.

2913
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:16,100
We got to stop that.

2914
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:18,100
Yeah, we can't teach kids about stranger danger.

2915
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:20,100
Like, even that's got to go apparently.

2916
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:22,100
Yeah, that's pretty woke.

2917
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:24,100
Because they don't think we're strangers.

2918
02:24:24,100 --> 02:24:25,100
Yeah.

2919
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:29,100
They want to like make it like super hard to get a divorce.

2920
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:31,100
They want to abolish for minimum wage.

2921
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:36,100
They want to abolish paid leave of all kinds, including family leave and sick leave.

2922
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:40,100
They want to, you know, just normal stuff.

2923
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:43,100
They want to declassify carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.

2924
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:47,100
You know, they want to have it written into law that science is wrong apparently.

2925
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,100
They want to ban high-speed rail.

2926
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:51,100
They want to ban funding for...

2927
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,100
What do you mean ban high-speed rail?

2928
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:57,100
They want to make it illegal to build high-speed rail anywhere, even on private property.

2929
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:59,100
Because they want cars instead, right?

2930
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:00,100
What the fuck?

2931
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:01,100
That's just insane.

2932
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:05,100
They want to make it illegal to publicly fund slow rail.

2933
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:10,100
They want to make it illegal to fund alternate lanes for like, you know, bike lanes and bus lanes.

2934
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:15,100
And any infrastructure, even sidewalks potentially, I don't fucking know.

2935
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:17,100
You know, I didn't think you were going to surprise me.

2936
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:18,100
But yeah, wow.

2937
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:22,100
I mean, this is like comedically evil.

2938
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:27,100
But like, what are they trying to get votes from this?

2939
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:28,100
I don't know.

2940
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:30,100
Like, who likes this?

2941
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:31,100
I don't know.

2942
02:25:31,100 --> 02:25:34,100
I mean, I know some people liking...

2943
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:39,100
No gay marriage, you know, like Backwoods, Hillbillies, Losers, Bigots.

2944
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:42,100
They have their social issues.

2945
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:45,100
But like, who's against train?

2946
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:50,100
I mean, like, illegal to make new trains?

2947
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:53,100
Like, are people seething about trains existing?

2948
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:57,100
I think trains are commie shit, clearly.

2949
02:25:57,100 --> 02:25:58,100
I think it's just one of...

2950
02:25:58,100 --> 02:26:01,100
I think that's probably just one that like, most people don't care about.

2951
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:03,100
Yeah, but like...

2952
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:05,100
That's something they want to do.

2953
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:11,100
Like, that's not most people's like, top of their issues list.

2954
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:15,100
And the same document also has multiple sections about, we believe in small government.

2955
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,100
It's like, fuck off.

2956
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:17,100
No, you don't.

2957
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:18,100
Yeah.

2958
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:22,100
This is not small government banning, building basic shit.

2959
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:23,100
They also want to...

2960
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:27,100
Yeah, that's a say the line, Bart.

2961
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:28,100
Say the line, Bart.

2962
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:29,100
Small government.

2963
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:30,100
Yay!

2964
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:31,100
Yeah.

2965
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:35,100
Yeah, abolished environmental protection agency, repeal of the Endangered Species Act,

2966
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:37,100
eliminate campaign contribution limits.

2967
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:39,100
That's clearly a good idea.

2968
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:47,100
That's not the...

2969
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:50,100
If that doesn't just give the game away right there.

2970
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:55,100
Yeah, they also want electoral collage, like the electoral college for all like,

2971
02:26:56,100 --> 02:27:02,100
Congress appointments from Texas, which would basically like guarantee 100% Republicans

2972
02:27:02,100 --> 02:27:05,100
getting in from here, which would be dumb.

2973
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:06,100
Right.

2974
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:07,100
And anti-democrat.

2975
02:27:07,100 --> 02:27:08,100
Right.

2976
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:14,100
There's also a section about teachers being forced to have guns in class, among other normal shit.

2977
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:19,100
I think the average conservative doesn't want to minimum wage and wants no sick leave

2978
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:20,100
and family.

2979
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:21,100
That's pretty normal.

2980
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:22,100
It's pretty normal stuff.

2981
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:23,100
I think you're appealing to the base.

2982
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,100
I joke.

2983
02:27:24,100 --> 02:27:25,100
This is like insane shit.

2984
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:26,100
I don't know.

2985
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:28,100
Honestly, they might for all I know.

2986
02:27:28,100 --> 02:27:29,100
I don't know.

2987
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:30,100
I mean, I don't know.

2988
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:36,100
Kai's mom is like very conservative, but like, even she is like, this shit's like fucking

2989
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:37,100
nuts.

2990
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:40,100
I don't know what they're doing.

2991
02:27:40,100 --> 02:27:41,100
I don't know.

2992
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:44,100
It really does like...

2993
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:46,100
If only it would trigger some self-reflection.

2994
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:49,100
Like, is this what I've been voting for all along?

2995
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:50,100
Oh, actually.

2996
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:53,100
I mean, I think it actually might when it gets to this.

2997
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:54,100
No.

2998
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:55,100
No.

2999
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:56,100
This far.

3000
02:27:56,100 --> 02:27:57,100
No.

3001
02:27:57,100 --> 02:27:58,100
No.

3002
02:27:58,100 --> 02:27:59,100
I think...

3003
02:27:59,100 --> 02:28:00,100
Sorry.

3004
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:01,100
Sorry.

3005
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:02,100
It won't.

3006
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:03,100
I promise.

3007
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:04,100
Well...

3008
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:05,100
It would have already.

3009
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:06,100
It would have already.

3010
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:10,100
What I mean is that there are a lot of people who voted Republican, voted for Donald Trump,

3011
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:14,100
that aren't quite as insane as all of that.

3012
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:20,340
I feel like the people who love all of those things listed are not enough of a majority

3013
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:23,780
to win, like, the entire presidency.

3014
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:29,500
If they're going like full mask off, evil policies everywhere, the Republicans are

3015
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:31,340
not going to look as good.

3016
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:32,340
Right?

3017
02:28:32,340 --> 02:28:33,340
Yeah.

3018
02:28:33,340 --> 02:28:36,340
I don't think it...

3019
02:28:36,340 --> 02:28:43,060
They wouldn't share this information if it would hurt their electoral chances.

3020
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:47,340
My favorite addition that I haven't yet mentioned is compelled speech.

3021
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:51,500
Remember when Jordan Peterson lied about Bill C-16 and talked about how for governments

3022
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:54,500
going to force you to use people's preferred pronouns?

3023
02:28:54,500 --> 02:28:58,020
They're going to force you not to use people's preferred pronouns.

3024
02:28:58,020 --> 02:29:04,620
They've classified social transition as abuse, and anyone facilitating it in any way is breaking

3025
02:29:04,620 --> 02:29:08,820
the law is another thing they want to do for anyone under the age of 21.

3026
02:29:08,820 --> 02:29:14,180
So if you have a friend who's 21 or younger and you call them she, and that's not what

3027
02:29:14,180 --> 02:29:17,220
they were assigned, you're breaking the law.

3028
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:24,340
I would say, as a conservative, as a Republican voter, I would say that freedom of speech is

3029
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:30,140
pretty woke and should probably be abolished, yeah.

3030
02:29:30,140 --> 02:29:36,700
As a small government libertarian, I do think that freedom of speech is Marxism.

3031
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:44,140
I really, the long short, I want to get out of Texas.

3032
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:47,420
This place is starting to fucking suck.

3033
02:29:47,420 --> 02:29:49,420
It's getting real bad.

3034
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:51,260
Texas is bad.

3035
02:29:51,260 --> 02:30:02,660
Well, I mean, I like to think that human beings are not what these policies imply about humans.

3036
02:30:02,660 --> 02:30:05,660
There's plenty of people like what?

3037
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:06,660
Yeah.

3038
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:13,980
I don't think most people are like, yes, we should defund the railways.

3039
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:22,540
I don't think most people are like into that, but I just don't think, I think people who

3040
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:26,620
are socially conservative will continue to vote Republican, basically regardless of

3041
02:30:26,620 --> 02:30:28,860
all this other stuff, because that's all secondary.

3042
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:29,860
Yeah.

3043
02:30:29,860 --> 02:30:30,860
Yeah.

3044
02:30:30,860 --> 02:30:37,700
Like the impression I get from Cairo's relatives is that they would all, if you told them about

3045
02:30:37,700 --> 02:30:41,500
any of the stuff they'd say, that shit's all insane and crazy and stupid, but they're

3046
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:44,940
also like, well, I don't know, I'm never voting for a Democrat.

3047
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:53,180
My daddy voted Republican and they just do it, and that's as far as I think about it,

3048
02:30:53,180 --> 02:30:54,180
which is bad.

3049
02:30:54,180 --> 02:30:57,740
Another reason I have to get out is because I wouldn't be able to get a US citizenship

3050
02:30:57,740 --> 02:31:03,540
if they pass all this shit, because another thing, if citizenship becomes impossible

3051
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:10,740
unless your biological parents are US citizens, which is translation for no one can immigrate

3052
02:31:10,740 --> 02:31:12,820
at all.

3053
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:16,100
I heard, man, I don't remember where I read this.

3054
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:23,260
It might have just been an anecdote or something, but I think it was about Romney, apparently

3055
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:33,460
voters, Romney could say, I plan to, I am running for governor or whatever, I'm running

3056
02:31:33,460 --> 02:31:34,460
for senator.

3057
02:31:34,460 --> 02:31:43,220
My platform is, I am going to cut taxes, basically cut taxes for the rich and for corporations

3058
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:49,060
and raise taxes on the poor and middle class, and he could just say that, and people just

3059
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:50,780
would not believe it.

3060
02:31:50,780 --> 02:31:55,380
People would just like, and then you could tell someone, yeah, this is his platform,

3061
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:58,060
and people would just be like, there's no way that's his platform.

3062
02:31:58,060 --> 02:32:01,700
There's no way he's actually running, even though he was, right?

3063
02:32:01,700 --> 02:32:02,700
Maybe it wasn't about Romney.

3064
02:32:02,700 --> 02:32:03,700
It was something.

3065
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:11,180
I think people just don't, people just don't, I don't know, they'll vote Republican even

3066
02:32:11,180 --> 02:32:16,820
if you tell them that, they'll just be like, nah, that can't be right, nah, they can't

3067
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:21,180
really, yeah, but they're not really going to, no, that's all just, all that stuff about

3068
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:28,740
defunding the rail and no minimum wage and freedom of speech is illegal.

3069
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:32,220
That's not what, no, they're the party of small government, they're not actually going

3070
02:32:32,260 --> 02:32:35,900
to do that, so like we can still vote for them just to kill trans people and like, so

3071
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:39,100
it's, yeah, it's fine, it's fine, all the other stuff is just...

3072
02:32:39,100 --> 02:32:41,100
No joke about killing trans people, yeah.

3073
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:46,940
There's that guy, Mark Burns in South Carolina who was running for Congress, who went on

3074
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:52,260
a podcast and talked openly about how he wants to execute all the LGBT people and went through

3075
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:58,780
his step-by-step plan on how they would legally kill off all the fucking gay and trans people,

3076
02:32:58,780 --> 02:33:01,900
and he wrote about that for like two minutes, and then the people on the podcast clapped

3077
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:08,580
and said, wow, this is our guy, everyone, but they literally said the our guy thing.

3078
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:14,460
No, it's okay, you'd only have to kill like a few, you'd only have to do a few public

3079
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:19,260
executions and then like, you know, the fear that that would create would drive all the

3080
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:23,660
rest back into the closet, so like we wouldn't, we didn't actually have to kill that many,

3081
02:33:23,660 --> 02:33:25,660
so like it's good actually.

3082
02:33:25,660 --> 02:33:41,420
Let's give him a hand, let's give him a big round of applause, ladies and gentlemen.

3083
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:47,060
But he got 25% of the vote even after saying that, that's like half the way to win.

3084
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:51,300
I'm not surprised, yeah, because most people just don't care, yeah.

3085
02:33:51,300 --> 02:33:56,900
I put them all in one place and set it on fire.

3086
02:33:56,900 --> 02:34:03,540
I wonder, I'm starting to wonder if we're gonna balkanize.

3087
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:06,660
It's kind of starting to feel that way, I know that that's probably, I'm probably jumping

3088
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:16,220
the gun, but like, I don't know, we might balkanize over this shit, man.

3089
02:34:16,220 --> 02:34:18,460
What is balkanizing?

3090
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:22,980
You know, it's when, it's like what happened in the Balkans, it's like, you know, they

3091
02:34:22,980 --> 02:34:28,860
split up a country into like a bunch of small like independent states.

3092
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:35,660
I'm saying that the United States would like split into, split into small, several, yeah.

3093
02:34:35,660 --> 02:34:40,660
Then I know the people born in the wrong, that would be catastrophic for many levels.

3094
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:44,100
Especially for people who are stuck living with their parents who can't get out of the

3095
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:46,540
shitty part they were born into.

3096
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:54,180
Oh, I mean, aside from, oh yeah, it would be, it would, living in the balkanized like,

3097
02:34:54,180 --> 02:35:01,660
you know, fucking, I don't know, the conservative Republic of Texas or whatever with no like

3098
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:07,860
federal oversight would be like, it would be like Saudi Arabia, you know, it would be

3099
02:35:07,860 --> 02:35:15,780
on that level, like if you're, if you're not straight and white and probably male, like

3100
02:35:15,820 --> 02:35:17,380
he would not want to live there.

3101
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:27,500
So I'm not saying it's good, but I, I, COVID, COVID comeback, we miss you.

3102
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:31,180
No, it's still, it's still here, actually.

3103
02:35:31,380 --> 02:35:36,300
No, but I mean, like really come back, like, like put everyone, don't, don't, don't, don't

3104
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:37,980
think we're, don't think it's gone.

3105
02:35:38,180 --> 02:35:40,340
They want to ban contact tracing.

3106
02:35:40,340 --> 02:35:44,940
So if they're trying to bring COVID back, I mean, ban, ban contact.

3107
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:46,220
What does that even mean?

3108
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:50,860
Contact tracing is like, if someone catches COVID, like they would like, like, okay,

3109
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:54,660
like, where have you been, like for the last, like, you know, week or two, since

3110
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:58,140
you were contagious, what areas have you visited so we can like keep an eye out for

3111
02:35:58,140 --> 02:35:59,300
cases? How would you ban that?

3112
02:36:00,340 --> 02:36:05,620
They want to make it illegal to ask people where they've been, I guess, because they

3113
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:10,660
don't want information on where the disease is spreading, because I guess that invades

3114
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:13,020
privacy, maybe, I don't know.

3115
02:36:14,020 --> 02:36:16,740
Well, abolish, abolish no-fault divorce.

3116
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:19,260
Yeah.

3117
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:23,100
And also have a six month waiting period for any divorce, regardless of the reason.

3118
02:36:23,100 --> 02:36:26,460
So if like, they're like beating you and trying to kill you, well, you have to wait

3119
02:36:26,460 --> 02:36:29,380
six months, even in like extreme situations.

3120
02:36:31,860 --> 02:36:32,700
They're just crazy.

3121
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:33,780
They want you to die.

3122
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:34,700
They want you to die.

3123
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:35,540
They want you to suffer.

3124
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,820
They want you to have no money.

3125
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:40,540
They want rich people to control everything.

3126
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:43,060
They're like very transparent about it.

3127
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:44,580
I don't understand.

3128
02:36:45,020 --> 02:36:47,580
People, people like genuinely don't believe it.

3129
02:36:47,740 --> 02:36:50,580
Like the average person would see this lit.

3130
02:36:50,580 --> 02:36:55,420
I don't, I don't think they would read this list and be like, this is bad.

3131
02:36:56,180 --> 02:37:01,140
I think that it was just they would read it and be like, well, you know, this is all

3132
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:06,180
just this is all just talk, you know, I wrote that list myself.

3133
02:37:06,180 --> 02:37:07,300
I read the document.

3134
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:08,260
That's all in there.

3135
02:37:09,020 --> 02:37:09,980
Oh, very nice.

3136
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:18,380
Oh, uh, I just, um, most people got there like one or two issues and like anything

3137
02:37:18,380 --> 02:37:24,300
else is just not going to move them on, on whatever it is.

3138
02:37:25,380 --> 02:37:26,300
Uh, so.

3139
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:37,020
I, I self selfishly, I feel like it would be cool to be rid of these freaks if we

3140
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:42,100
balkanized and I would just, I would be safe in the, uh, in the, in the liberal,

3141
02:37:42,100 --> 02:37:43,180
uh, what do you call it?

3142
02:37:43,780 --> 02:37:47,660
I would, I would be straight in the liberal commonwealth of New England or whatever.

3143
02:37:48,260 --> 02:37:53,340
Uh, but then, but then, you know, uh, the, the Republicans would probably

3144
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:55,420
just like declare war or something.

3145
02:37:55,460 --> 02:37:56,700
They would probably do some shit.

3146
02:37:57,980 --> 02:37:58,380
Yeah.

3147
02:37:58,380 --> 02:38:02,540
So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's only a fantasy.

3148
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:05,420
Probably, probably shouldn't be rooting for it.

3149
02:38:07,140 --> 02:38:09,220
On his fucking, uh, true for a website.

3150
02:38:09,220 --> 02:38:14,580
He liked someone like truth, damn, I guess it's time for a civil war to deal with

3151
02:38:14,580 --> 02:38:16,100
these fucking gays or whatever.

3152
02:38:16,140 --> 02:38:19,860
I don't know the actual, well, the actual issue was about and Trump just liked

3153
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:24,180
that, that fucking truth, I fucking hate that.

3154
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:28,620
Truth, truth, the, uh, the, the website where instead of tweets, it's truth.

3155
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:29,660
I fucking hate it's annoying.

3156
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:32,020
It makes, they're destroying language.

3157
02:38:32,780 --> 02:38:35,300
They say we're destroying language, but they're destroying language, I swear.

3158
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:42,460
Um, do you want to listen to the next voicemail?

3159
02:38:42,580 --> 02:38:42,900
Yes.

3160
02:38:42,940 --> 02:38:43,420
Yeah.

3161
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:44,060
Please.

3162
02:38:44,260 --> 02:38:47,540
Uh, the next voicemail, I already posted it.

3163
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:49,260
It's Prince in the big city too.

3164
02:38:50,060 --> 02:38:51,820
Uh, it's up above the list there.

3165
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:52,180
All right.

3166
02:38:53,060 --> 02:38:54,940
Uh, three, two, one, go.

3167
02:38:56,460 --> 02:39:04,060
Ben, that is like the fourth cop car that I see riding around Boston.

3168
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:06,740
You're not doing your fucking job.

3169
02:39:07,580 --> 02:39:13,860
Uh, oh, by the way, um, I'm Dutch just, uh, to explain the last voicemail.

3170
02:39:14,100 --> 02:39:16,300
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm Dutch.

3171
02:39:17,140 --> 02:39:23,580
I don't understand why you people think it's acceptable to, uh, to paint

3172
02:39:23,580 --> 02:39:30,180
fucking, uh, bike signals onto the concrete road that huge fucking cars drive

3173
02:39:30,180 --> 02:39:31,180
across all day.

3174
02:39:31,260 --> 02:39:31,660
I know.

3175
02:39:32,620 --> 02:39:37,060
That's just asking for bike people to get turned into God damn roadkill.

3176
02:39:37,380 --> 02:39:42,380
Uh, but anyways, um, looking forward to the first, uh, cyclist I see

3177
02:39:42,380 --> 02:39:43,900
splattered across the pavement.

3178
02:39:44,820 --> 02:39:45,860
I haven't seen one yet.

3179
02:39:45,860 --> 02:39:47,380
Anyways, Boston is nice.

3180
02:39:47,980 --> 02:39:48,860
Uh, see you.

3181
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:50,500
Well, yeah.

3182
02:39:50,540 --> 02:39:51,740
There are hundreds of cyclists.

3183
02:39:53,100 --> 02:39:56,820
Uh, yeah, I think, um, I think he's here early.

3184
02:39:56,820 --> 02:39:59,500
I think RFC KCon is like this weekend.

3185
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:03,900
It's just a bunch of people, just a bunch of RFC K people, uh, getting

3186
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:05,900
together in a, in a house in Boston.

3187
02:40:06,700 --> 02:40:11,380
Uh, I'll probably go visit, uh, say hi.

3188
02:40:12,020 --> 02:40:12,900
So that'll be fun.

3189
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:14,020
But it is the weekend.

3190
02:40:14,020 --> 02:40:14,940
The weekend's almost over.

3191
02:40:17,300 --> 02:40:18,700
I mean, I mean, next weekend.

3192
02:40:19,060 --> 02:40:20,100
Oh, see.

3193
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:20,540
All right.

3194
02:40:20,540 --> 02:40:23,460
I think, I think it was, yeah, it's the 21st.

3195
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:28,220
I remember we were going to judge the next art contest during it on the 21st.

3196
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:31,700
So I think that's, or maybe it's all this week.

3197
02:40:32,020 --> 02:40:33,860
Uh, I, I don't actually know.

3198
02:40:35,060 --> 02:40:37,500
I should check, I should check when it's happening.

3199
02:40:38,300 --> 02:40:39,740
Uh, I guess Prince is here early.

3200
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:42,380
Uh, okay.

3201
02:40:42,380 --> 02:40:44,820
And then a bunch of worthless ones that don't count.

3202
02:40:45,020 --> 02:40:47,740
Um, okay.

3203
02:40:48,140 --> 02:40:53,260
Next one is an iconic PCP character returns question mark.

3204
02:40:53,940 --> 02:40:54,820
Posting it now.

3205
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:55,900
There it is.

3206
02:40:56,780 --> 02:40:58,500
Three, two, one, go.

3207
02:41:05,140 --> 02:41:05,780
Can you hear it?

3208
02:41:07,220 --> 02:41:15,180
No, I hear is the scrabbling is the joke that the iconic character is inaudible.

3209
02:41:16,820 --> 02:41:19,860
Wait, this is a guy from the other week who was just fucking whispering the whole

3210
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:21,100
time and you couldn't understand him.

3211
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:23,220
Yeah, I think so.

3212
02:41:23,780 --> 02:41:25,860
So that guy again, I turned it up really loud.

3213
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:26,420
It's just him.

3214
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:30,060
Uh, he's so funny.

3215
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:32,260
Can you tell what he's saying?

3216
02:41:33,140 --> 02:41:40,300
Uh, yeah, he's saying, oh, I see.

3217
02:41:41,380 --> 02:41:41,860
Cool.

3218
02:41:43,100 --> 02:41:45,540
Uh, the viewers will hear it next.

3219
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:51,820
Next voicemail, Prince in the big city, three, three, two, one, go.

3220
02:41:52,780 --> 02:41:56,620
Why are there so many flags in this country?

3221
02:41:57,420 --> 02:41:59,220
What are they trying to tell me?

3222
02:41:59,860 --> 02:42:01,700
What are they trying to say?

3223
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:08,420
Why are the flags in the metro station behind glass?

3224
02:42:10,380 --> 02:42:11,260
Let them out.

3225
02:42:13,180 --> 02:42:13,860
Let them out.

3226
02:42:15,700 --> 02:42:18,260
I don't, I don't know how to answer this.

3227
02:42:18,580 --> 02:42:18,860
Yeah.

3228
02:42:18,860 --> 02:42:21,020
Why, why are they behind glass?

3229
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:23,620
They just keep them clean.

3230
02:42:23,740 --> 02:42:24,740
Let them out.

3231
02:42:24,820 --> 02:42:26,420
Other flags can't be out.

3232
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:30,620
They've got to be kept safe from all the dirty leftists who are going to burn them down.

3233
02:42:31,220 --> 02:42:38,340
They put them in a nice frame to display them so that they don't get touched by dirty fucking tourists.

3234
02:42:39,220 --> 02:42:43,500
Dirty communist Europeans that come here and want to touch our flags.

3235
02:42:43,580 --> 02:42:48,220
I just wanted to put my greasy palms on their flag and I couldn't reach them.

3236
02:42:48,220 --> 02:42:48,900
I know.

3237
02:42:48,940 --> 02:42:51,100
That's what all you non-Americans want to do.

3238
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:54,900
You just want to get your fingerprints all over stars and bars.

3239
02:42:55,940 --> 02:42:57,260
Oh, my God, you know, setting.

3240
02:42:57,540 --> 02:43:00,260
I have, I have like a beautiful like New Zealand flag, right?

3241
02:43:01,420 --> 02:43:04,700
So sadly, the flag design, we never got the change.

3242
02:43:05,060 --> 02:43:10,220
I was like, if we were in a house, I want to fly the New Zealand flag and the American flag together.

3243
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:12,220
And I had to be warned.

3244
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:16,620
I can't fly a New Zealand flag higher than the American one.

3245
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:21,020
Or someone might just fucking shoot me and also it's against the law.

3246
02:43:22,100 --> 02:43:27,700
But wait, it's like there's a law about putting the American flag at the top.

3247
02:43:28,180 --> 02:43:29,780
Is it a Texas thing?

3248
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:34,620
It's against the law for other flags to be flown higher than an American flag.

3249
02:43:36,140 --> 02:43:37,220
That is cool.

3250
02:43:37,220 --> 02:43:38,780
Very normal, normal.

3251
02:43:38,780 --> 02:43:40,500
I love small government.

3252
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:42,540
It's so small, I can barely see it.

3253
02:43:42,540 --> 02:43:45,140
I love small, I love small government.

3254
02:43:45,860 --> 02:43:50,540
And that's why I like it that the big government

3255
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:56,780
isn't telling the smaller state governments that they have to not

3256
02:43:57,620 --> 02:44:02,460
take our rights away, letting them, letting them, letting them ban abortion if they want to.

3257
02:44:02,460 --> 02:44:03,660
That's small government.

3258
02:44:03,660 --> 02:44:07,220
Small government is when federal government lets state government

3259
02:44:08,620 --> 02:44:10,860
ban you from doing things.

3260
02:44:10,860 --> 02:44:13,900
Yes, I'd put like a bunch of flags.

3261
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:18,740
The trans flag at the top and a bunch of like other like LGBT flags.

3262
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:22,660
And then the American flag right at the bottom, tracking in the mud.

3263
02:44:24,300 --> 02:44:26,620
It's like sliding all over the mud.

3264
02:44:26,620 --> 02:44:28,020
That's what I would do.

3265
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:32,020
I'm going to take you, I'm going to take you out.

3266
02:44:33,180 --> 02:44:35,300
You can't fucking do this.

3267
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:36,660
Is this a date?

3268
02:44:36,660 --> 02:44:39,380
You can't. No, this is a war.

3269
02:44:40,140 --> 02:44:51,260
The next voicemail is called it was Ben's Twitter banner from when they outlawed vaping three to one go.

3270
02:44:52,580 --> 02:44:59,060
The first panel of that comic was inspired like you saying that was inspired by

3271
02:44:59,060 --> 02:45:02,060
yes, your old Twitter banner.

3272
02:45:02,060 --> 02:45:07,580
The one where I'm squatting next to the I have been heard a song called

3273
02:45:07,580 --> 02:45:09,340
Dancing is not a crime.

3274
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:10,260
The fire hydrant.

3275
02:45:10,260 --> 02:45:16,060
Unless you do it without me by panic at the disco.

3276
02:45:17,380 --> 02:45:23,380
And I see from that, I had this little parody idea in my mind.

3277
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:31,300
Following the song, I guess, where it's like vaping, vaping, vaping is not a crime.

3278
02:45:31,300 --> 02:45:38,180
Unless you do it, do it, do it, do it, do it without me.

3279
02:45:39,820 --> 02:45:43,260
And the melody of the song follows.

3280
02:45:43,540 --> 02:45:44,340
I see.

3281
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:49,980
I can never manage lyrics very well.

3282
02:45:49,980 --> 02:45:52,580
I just have that first day, the chorus.

3283
02:45:52,580 --> 02:45:53,700
No, I get you, man.

3284
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:56,220
But yeah, deep cuts.

3285
02:45:57,020 --> 02:45:59,260
So I'm just so much too deep.

3286
02:46:00,260 --> 02:46:05,220
I don't know if this voicemail needed to be a minute nine, but thanks for the explanation.

3287
02:46:07,340 --> 02:46:11,660
Next one is called Candyman Ben.

3288
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:14,260
Poston.

3289
02:46:14,260 --> 02:46:15,020
There it is.

3290
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:16,900
OK, three, two, one, go.

3291
02:46:18,020 --> 02:46:22,500
Hey, Ben, just wanted to say that orange slice candy fucking delicious.

3292
02:46:22,780 --> 02:46:25,740
I think it's a noble pursuit to try and recreate it.

3293
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:28,900
I do have a theory as far as how they're made.

3294
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:36,380
I think that they basically just whip a bunch of fucking air into the syrup to create that texture.

3295
02:46:37,140 --> 02:46:42,460
And maybe if you, I don't know, used a mixer or just took a whisk and beat

3296
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:47,780
the syrup as fast as you could while you're making it, you could probably get similar results.

3297
02:46:48,380 --> 02:46:48,820
I don't know.

3298
02:46:48,820 --> 02:46:50,860
I think it's worth a shot at the very least anyway.

3299
02:46:50,860 --> 02:46:52,780
Good luck with your candy making endeavors.

3300
02:46:52,780 --> 02:46:53,500
I think baking.

3301
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:56,460
So I saw I found a recipe that called for baking soda.

3302
02:46:57,460 --> 02:47:00,500
I never I never tried putting it in there.

3303
02:47:03,460 --> 02:47:07,300
I did. I did manage to make some that were solid.

3304
02:47:08,100 --> 02:47:09,660
They were very hard.

3305
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:13,380
They were very tough, not tough, but they were very solid and they really sticky.

3306
02:47:15,340 --> 02:47:18,660
But they didn't quite have the consistency I was looking for.

3307
02:47:18,900 --> 02:47:20,780
Baking soda might have improved it.

3308
02:47:20,860 --> 02:47:22,740
I kind of started.

3309
02:47:22,740 --> 02:47:24,860
I kind of changed my focus.

3310
02:47:25,380 --> 02:47:27,740
I might come back to that at some point.

3311
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:29,860
Next one is a God.

3312
02:47:29,860 --> 02:47:32,340
We got another Prince of the Big City.

3313
02:47:33,740 --> 02:47:36,860
The Prince of the Big City episode.

3314
02:47:36,940 --> 02:47:38,500
This is episode four.

3315
02:47:38,500 --> 02:47:40,540
There's no subtitle.

3316
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:42,940
Three, two, one, go.

3317
02:47:42,940 --> 02:47:47,900
So Ben mentioned on the last episode that he's thinking of getting on Tinder again.

3318
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:53,580
But Ben, unfortunately, I am in Boston right now.

3319
02:47:53,820 --> 02:47:56,460
And I am on Tinder right now.

3320
02:47:56,700 --> 02:48:01,060
And what I'm going to do is take all of the hot girls

3321
02:48:01,260 --> 02:48:04,780
and take them with me back to the Netherlands.

3322
02:48:05,020 --> 02:48:08,740
And I will make sure that you never get laid.

3323
02:48:08,900 --> 02:48:14,420
And Boston will be for virgins and not for lovers.

3324
02:48:17,820 --> 02:48:20,580
That's that's just that's just the status quo.

3325
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:23,500
Boston is for virgins.

3326
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:27,100
That's just how it that's just you're telling me more of the same is coming.

3327
02:48:27,100 --> 02:48:28,860
And I'm ready for it.

3328
02:48:30,860 --> 02:48:33,420
Next one is called.

3329
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:36,420
OK, there's an image link.

3330
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:37,500
But here's the voicemail.

3331
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:40,820
It's called Any Way Big News, three, two, one, go.

3332
02:48:47,060 --> 02:48:50,060
And here's the image.

3333
02:48:50,580 --> 02:48:54,460
It's back. Yes, a lobster.

3334
02:48:57,620 --> 02:49:00,380
Oh, it's lobster is back, I see.

3335
02:49:00,980 --> 02:49:03,660
This is this is another one from Prince.

3336
02:49:03,660 --> 02:49:04,980
This is Prince.

3337
02:49:04,980 --> 02:49:09,060
I think he might be lobster is back.

3338
02:49:09,740 --> 02:49:14,060
He might be reacting to Papageno's, which is he might have heard us talk about.

3339
02:49:14,780 --> 02:49:18,660
Me and Nate talk about that as like our favorite New England pizza chain.

3340
02:49:21,020 --> 02:49:24,020
Or one that we're familiar with, anyway, I was my favorite.

3341
02:49:26,100 --> 02:49:29,700
Anyway, lobsters back on the menu and it's never going away, baby.

3342
02:49:30,140 --> 02:49:32,300
OK, next one is a Vokeru link,

3343
02:49:33,980 --> 02:49:37,140
which I will get soon.

3344
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:42,660
Download.

3345
02:49:42,660 --> 02:49:46,180
Showing folder, there we go.

3346
02:49:46,180 --> 02:49:48,460
Here it is. OK, no subtitle.

3347
02:49:49,260 --> 02:49:51,100
Three, two, one, go.

3348
02:49:52,780 --> 02:49:54,620
Hello, friends.

3349
02:49:54,620 --> 02:49:56,740
I have a very important message for you.

3350
02:49:56,860 --> 02:49:58,980
It's one come fixer.

3351
02:49:58,980 --> 02:50:01,740
You go very close to the microphone.

3352
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:04,340
So you can hear a very important message.

3353
02:50:04,460 --> 02:50:06,740
OK, OK, yeah.

3354
02:50:06,740 --> 02:50:08,860
Closer, OK, closer.

3355
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:11,820
Oh, it's a fake, you idiot.

3356
02:50:11,820 --> 02:50:14,020
I bought it at the party store.

3357
02:50:14,020 --> 02:50:14,820
It's not one day.

3358
02:50:15,820 --> 02:50:18,500
I don't know what to.

3359
02:50:18,860 --> 02:50:21,900
OK, you got us with a SpongeBob.

3360
02:50:23,460 --> 02:50:25,020
Is that a SpongeBob?

3361
02:50:25,020 --> 02:50:27,420
I think it was a sound like Patrick and then Squidward.

3362
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:29,860
No, it didn't.

3363
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:33,420
I thought that was like the stalker episode of the guy who was like going to kill

3364
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:36,540
SpongeBob. What?

3365
02:50:38,500 --> 02:50:40,540
I just did not want to party.

3366
02:50:40,540 --> 02:50:42,340
I thought that was Squidward.

3367
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:45,020
The I don't even listen.

3368
02:50:45,020 --> 02:50:46,300
I just will listen to L.S.

3369
02:50:46,300 --> 02:50:50,060
Mark explain all the episodes and I don't know what you're talking about.

3370
02:50:50,060 --> 02:50:54,660
So you don't even know every good attention.

3371
02:50:54,660 --> 02:50:58,140
Every single bit of dialogue from every episode.

3372
02:50:58,140 --> 02:51:04,100
By the time I read, I really got my seven hours worth out of that experience,

3373
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:07,860
I guess. Anyway, that was the last voicemail

3374
02:51:08,860 --> 02:51:11,980
or the last one that I'm going to play because the rest are trash.

3375
02:51:13,340 --> 02:51:16,220
Oh, this guy, is this the

3376
02:51:17,220 --> 02:51:21,500
no, this isn't the thing I was talking about his mustache being a fake

3377
02:51:21,500 --> 02:51:23,220
that he bought at the party store.

3378
02:51:23,220 --> 02:51:25,940
He's been trying to kill SpongeBob this whole time and then he keeps going

3379
02:51:25,940 --> 02:51:27,860
interrupted. I'm pretty sure that's the plot of that episode.

3380
02:51:28,860 --> 02:51:32,580
I've been seeing, you know, that clown girl from

3381
02:51:33,380 --> 02:51:36,700
from a fucking ace, ace attorney.

3382
02:51:37,060 --> 02:51:38,740
Yes. Yeah.

3383
02:51:38,740 --> 02:51:41,900
I've been seeing a gift going around where, you know,

3384
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:46,540
she she snaps her suspenders and the boobs pop and then SpongeBob

3385
02:51:46,540 --> 02:51:49,060
and Patrick go, they were fake.

3386
02:51:49,060 --> 02:51:52,300
And then some tough biker fish goes, of course, they were fake.

3387
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:57,060
So I saw I saw that exact same thing you're talking about.

3388
02:51:57,380 --> 02:51:59,060
I've seen it posted a couple of times.

3389
02:51:59,060 --> 02:52:02,300
So that that's what that reminded me of, but it wasn't the same audio.

3390
02:52:02,300 --> 02:52:04,700
So I think it's just a coincidence.

3391
02:52:04,700 --> 02:52:08,700
I think I think that was that audio was from the SpongeBob movie.

3392
02:52:09,700 --> 02:52:15,540
With the I guess I just know my SpongeBob.

3393
02:52:15,820 --> 02:52:18,740
I haven't seen SpongeBob in like ten years, but I just have.

3394
02:52:18,860 --> 02:52:20,780
I saw it so many so many times as a kid.

3395
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:26,180
I, you know, it's funny.

3396
02:52:27,300 --> 02:52:29,660
I had watched. Yeah, I watched it some as a kid.

3397
02:52:30,180 --> 02:52:33,180
I rewatched the first couple of seasons a few years ago.

3398
02:52:34,180 --> 02:52:36,580
And it's really funny.

3399
02:52:36,580 --> 02:52:41,740
I mean, I remember thinking on my rewatch, I remember getting to the end

3400
02:52:41,740 --> 02:52:46,460
of season three and being like, I already kind of feel the quality declining.

3401
02:52:46,460 --> 02:52:50,020
Like it already, like it's not bad yet, but it feels like it's getting worse.

3402
02:52:50,020 --> 02:52:51,500
And we're only in season three.

3403
02:52:51,500 --> 02:52:55,420
And then I watched the video and I watched that that video.

3404
02:52:55,420 --> 02:53:00,420
And Mark is like, yeah, like right at basically after season like three or four,

3405
02:53:00,420 --> 02:53:02,140
it like goes way off the deep end.

3406
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:04,860
Like it gets immediately worse like right after that.

3407
02:53:05,020 --> 02:53:09,900
It's like, huh? Well, yeah, that's like that's the thing of most shows.

3408
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:15,780
I usually after they hit 64 episodes, they start fucking up.

3409
02:53:15,780 --> 02:53:17,860
We usually after a third season, they start fucking up.

3410
02:53:18,100 --> 02:53:21,740
Simpsons is kind of an outlier and then it managed to last for quite a bit longer.

3411
02:53:22,380 --> 02:53:26,620
I know Simpsons is an outlier, but like I feel like SpongeBob is kind of

3412
02:53:26,620 --> 02:53:32,140
the Simpsons of its generation in that it's like to to an extent.

3413
02:53:32,220 --> 02:53:35,260
So I thought it would stay good longer.

3414
02:53:35,820 --> 02:53:39,980
They did free seasons and then a movie and then immediately after the movie,

3415
02:53:39,980 --> 02:53:44,020
like it was pretty like it was like a sharp turn downhill, I remember.

3416
02:53:45,300 --> 02:53:48,100
I remember the movie.

3417
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:51,500
I don't think I've even watched a single full episode of SpongeBob,

3418
02:53:51,500 --> 02:53:54,100
but I saw the movies for some reason. Really? Really?

3419
02:53:54,460 --> 02:53:56,460
I've seen like clips. I've seen bits.

3420
02:53:56,460 --> 02:53:58,220
I've seen half of an episode.

3421
02:53:58,220 --> 02:54:01,980
I never watched it like at normal because it wasn't on TV.

3422
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:04,540
So like the channels I could access.

3423
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:10,740
Oh, that's so those are like only shows we could access in New Zealand, like consistently.

3424
02:54:11,620 --> 02:54:13,980
Was it not on British television?

3425
02:54:13,980 --> 02:54:16,500
It maybe was on satellite or something.

3426
02:54:16,940 --> 02:54:20,140
I didn't have Cartoon Network either.

3427
02:54:20,140 --> 02:54:22,220
I have Nickelodeon. I didn't have any of that.

3428
02:54:22,220 --> 02:54:25,620
I had like different things.

3429
02:54:25,620 --> 02:54:29,300
I had Dick and Dominic de Bungalow, which was great.

3430
02:54:32,620 --> 02:54:37,900
Yeah, you didn't have a you didn't have a Mega Man on the NES,

3431
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:42,500
but you had a fucking Jet Set Willy on the ZX Spectrum.

3432
02:54:42,500 --> 02:54:45,060
So this is just as good.

3433
02:54:45,060 --> 02:54:47,020
Just as good. Yeah.

3434
02:54:48,060 --> 02:54:52,980
Now, that was like occasional like things of SpongeBob.

3435
02:54:53,180 --> 02:54:55,460
I just don't remember like.

3436
02:54:56,620 --> 02:55:00,660
Like ever being like around when it started.

3437
02:55:01,460 --> 02:55:04,900
I just I caught the end of an episode a couple of times.

3438
02:55:05,140 --> 02:55:09,460
I remember when it started airing and I watched, you know, the premiere

3439
02:55:10,140 --> 02:55:16,580
because I was a kid and I, you know, I would just watch it sometimes when it was on.

3440
02:55:16,580 --> 02:55:19,460
I guess I liked it well enough.

3441
02:55:21,100 --> 02:55:24,900
And I think, you know, then I kind of stop watching cartoons for as much

3442
02:55:24,900 --> 02:55:27,860
like when I went to college or whatever, like I didn't watch much TV.

3443
02:55:28,020 --> 02:55:30,820
And then I was surprised, you know, maybe in the last

3444
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:37,580
in the last maybe probably less than 10 years, but in the last like five to 10 years,

3445
02:55:38,500 --> 02:55:41,980
the the sort of the dice of history

3446
02:55:42,580 --> 02:55:47,740
landed and it's like, yeah, SpongeBob was kind of like the like the show for

3447
02:55:47,740 --> 02:55:49,820
like Zoomer, the Zoomer generation.

3448
02:55:50,060 --> 02:55:53,060
Yeah, like like they all grew up watching it.

3449
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:55,900
And I was like, huh, really?

3450
02:55:55,940 --> 02:55:56,900
That that show.

3451
02:55:56,900 --> 02:55:59,140
I mean, I guess I mean, I guess it's fine.

3452
02:55:59,660 --> 02:56:01,860
I like it. I like it fine.

3453
02:56:01,860 --> 02:56:07,580
I guess I never would have suspected that that would happen when it when it premiered.

3454
02:56:08,180 --> 02:56:10,540
Comparing SpongeBob to The Simpsons is very appropriate

3455
02:56:10,540 --> 02:56:13,540
because The Simpsons and SpongeBob are the only two.

3456
02:56:14,540 --> 02:56:20,660
No, they would be only two cartoons that like never stopped airing in New Zealand.

3457
02:56:21,340 --> 02:56:23,980
Pretty much I think SpongeBob must have started right when I was a kid,

3458
02:56:23,980 --> 02:56:27,980
because I think like right when I was like of television watching age,

3459
02:56:27,980 --> 02:56:29,940
because every time I would come home from school,

3460
02:56:30,420 --> 02:56:33,180
you turned to Channel Two and Studio Two would be on

3461
02:56:33,460 --> 02:56:35,780
and the presenters would talk about a funny thing

3462
02:56:35,780 --> 02:56:38,740
and then they would play an episode of SpongeBob and then like an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh.

3463
02:56:38,740 --> 02:56:42,940
And then you switched to Channel Free and Malcolm in the middle is is on.

3464
02:56:42,940 --> 02:56:45,020
And then after that is The Simpsons.

3465
02:56:45,020 --> 02:56:49,020
And that was like that was like it for like 10 years.

3466
02:56:49,460 --> 02:56:52,260
And it was only the first free season of SpongeBob.

3467
02:56:52,260 --> 02:56:56,140
What more do you need in SpongeBob, Yu-Gi-Oh, The Simpsons and Malcolm in the middle?

3468
02:56:56,140 --> 02:56:58,260
Well, Yu-Gi-Oh would occasionally swap out for something else.

3469
02:56:58,260 --> 02:56:59,980
It would be a SpongeBob and another show.

3470
02:56:59,980 --> 02:57:03,860
And then Channel Free was Malcolm in the middle for a long time,

3471
02:57:03,860 --> 02:57:08,100
but there was always The Simpsons and they would do reruns all the time.

3472
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:10,820
Like the first free seasons of SpongeBob,

3473
02:57:10,820 --> 02:57:14,100
I must have seen at least like eight times because I was very familiar

3474
02:57:14,100 --> 02:57:16,380
with the order of the episodes would be in by the end.

3475
02:57:16,860 --> 02:57:20,740
Like I'm like, oh, next week is going to be the fucking Shanghai episode of the,

3476
02:57:21,220 --> 02:57:22,740
you know, they're on the flying Dutchmanship.

3477
02:57:22,740 --> 02:57:24,300
And after that, they'll be like this episode.

3478
02:57:24,300 --> 02:57:27,420
Like I mean, my sister would figure out and we'd like get excited

3479
02:57:27,420 --> 02:57:33,260
for the episodes coming up that we really liked and I know SpongeBob was good.

3480
02:57:33,260 --> 02:57:36,780
It's funny. It holds up the first few seasons anyway.

3481
02:57:36,980 --> 02:57:39,060
It's good.

3482
02:57:39,060 --> 02:57:42,100
Yeah, like I said, I watched them a couple of years ago.

3483
02:57:42,820 --> 02:57:46,340
And yeah, I mean, I only watched the first three seasons and they were all good.

3484
02:57:46,980 --> 02:57:48,620
That's good. Yeah. That's all you need.

3485
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:49,620
Yeah.

3486
02:57:49,660 --> 02:57:53,780
Any UK heads in the audience, remember, Mona the Vampire?

3487
02:57:54,900 --> 02:57:57,100
Actually, that's familiar.

3488
02:57:57,100 --> 02:58:00,300
Mona the Vampire.

3489
02:58:00,300 --> 02:58:04,580
This is like all those like funny, like Canadian puppet shows.

3490
02:58:05,380 --> 02:58:08,700
Yeah, except I've never heard of but only Canadians know.

3491
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:11,220
Yeah, there's the story of Tracy Beaker.

3492
02:58:12,260 --> 02:58:13,340
These are so fucking funny.

3493
02:58:13,340 --> 02:58:16,620
You're just you may I know you make some of these up like these.

3494
02:58:16,620 --> 02:58:18,180
I've never made anything up.

3495
02:58:18,180 --> 02:58:22,340
Dick and Dom in the in the bungalow is probably the funniest sound in one.

3496
02:58:22,580 --> 02:58:25,060
I can't be real. So real program.

3497
02:58:25,100 --> 02:58:26,100
No, it was great.

3498
02:58:26,100 --> 02:58:31,580
It's like you get a bunch of rowdy, like seven year olds, seven to not seven year

3499
02:58:31,580 --> 02:58:37,620
olds, like 10 to like 11, nine year olds, get them in a room.

3500
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:45,500
And it's like a game show variety show with two like wacky zany

3501
02:58:45,980 --> 02:58:51,900
comedian guys who are in their early 20s, jumping around,

3502
02:58:51,900 --> 02:58:56,060
throwing custard pies at each other and all the kids are screaming.

3503
02:58:56,420 --> 02:58:59,660
And then they watch cartoons and there's like puppet shows

3504
02:59:00,580 --> 02:59:05,060
and like games and it's insane.

3505
02:59:06,660 --> 02:59:08,660
I loved it. It was my favorite show.

3506
02:59:08,660 --> 02:59:11,940
It came on every Saturday from nine to eleven.

3507
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:19,220
Did you guys see some I think a guy who was in Black Panther

3508
02:59:19,220 --> 02:59:23,100
is like making a a dark and gritty Barney reboot.

3509
02:59:25,020 --> 02:59:29,580
Ah, yeah, stupid.

3510
02:59:30,460 --> 02:59:33,660
They already did that. It was called Deltarune.

3511
02:59:36,220 --> 02:59:41,260
Yeah, it seems like a project that shouldn't exist and maybe it won't.

3512
02:59:41,660 --> 02:59:43,860
But this saw the story going around Twitter.

3513
02:59:45,140 --> 02:59:47,140
The quote was like.

3514
02:59:49,820 --> 02:59:52,580
Oh. Oh, ew.

3515
02:59:53,220 --> 02:59:56,100
What? Oh, ew.

3516
02:59:57,180 --> 03:00:00,260
I think I just had a I think I just sped up a tonsil stone.

3517
03:00:03,220 --> 03:00:05,020
Ew.

3518
03:00:05,020 --> 03:00:07,220
It's a terrible.

3519
03:00:07,220 --> 03:00:09,220
That's that's terrible.

3520
03:00:09,980 --> 03:00:15,660
Oh, God, I hope that's not a new thing that's going to start happening for me.

3521
03:00:16,860 --> 03:00:19,860
Oh, and Yvonne Yvonne of the Yukon.

3522
03:00:21,460 --> 03:00:23,460
I was going to say something.

3523
03:00:23,460 --> 03:00:26,100
Wait, I have to say the quote of the Barney quote.

3524
03:00:26,140 --> 03:00:31,540
He was like, Barney asked us, like, won't you say you love me, too?

3525
03:00:31,860 --> 03:00:34,980
But what if that's what if that wasn't true?

3526
03:00:35,740 --> 03:00:38,740
I don't love you.

3527
03:00:39,740 --> 03:00:41,740
No, it's horrifying.

3528
03:00:41,740 --> 03:00:43,700
Doesn't necessarily imply hatred.

3529
03:00:43,700 --> 03:00:49,620
It's just sort of I thought music is coming out of your fucking speaker.

3530
03:00:49,620 --> 03:00:51,420
Give when you said you don't love me.

3531
03:00:51,820 --> 03:00:54,180
It was like like sad music started playing on my computer

3532
03:00:54,180 --> 03:00:56,460
and I thought it was going for this chord.

3533
03:00:56,460 --> 03:01:01,660
I clip that sell it to the to the highest bidder.

3534
03:01:02,660 --> 03:01:08,940
I sell it to fund the next Republican gubernatorial race.

3535
03:01:08,940 --> 03:01:11,820
It was just like the first sound of me saying, I don't love you.

3536
03:01:11,820 --> 03:01:14,420
And then the Republicans marching.

3537
03:01:14,420 --> 03:01:16,620
No, it was just the first six seconds of that video.

3538
03:01:16,620 --> 03:01:20,660
It just started playing randomly on what I don't know how it happened.

3539
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:22,980
Some tab open and I click this.

3540
03:01:25,980 --> 03:01:27,980
Yeah, yeah, that's appropriate.

3541
03:01:32,180 --> 03:01:38,260
Well, that they should make a Barney reboot.

3542
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:42,620
He says, I love you, but you don't like me.

3543
03:01:42,620 --> 03:01:45,660
I'll go gets his hat.

3544
03:01:45,660 --> 03:01:47,900
Wouldn't get the fuck out of here, Barney.

3545
03:01:49,780 --> 03:01:54,260
What a that's that's going to be me when I'm on Tinder after Prince

3546
03:01:54,260 --> 03:01:58,980
has taken all the all the cute girls back to Deutschland or whatever.

3547
03:01:59,980 --> 03:02:04,700
I might as well not even try, you know what?

3548
03:02:04,700 --> 03:02:07,300
I might as well just give up before even give it a shot.

3549
03:02:07,700 --> 03:02:10,220
Spare myself the spare myself the embarrassment.

3550
03:02:10,820 --> 03:02:12,700
Yeah, I think that's the move.

3551
03:02:14,580 --> 03:02:18,740
Now, you should you should give it into doing a Barney themed Tinder.

3552
03:02:19,180 --> 03:02:23,620
I think I think Nancy Reagan said, you know, failure.

3553
03:02:23,620 --> 03:02:26,980
It's not about how many times you get knocked down.

3554
03:02:27,900 --> 03:02:31,500
It's about how many times people see you doing it.

3555
03:02:31,820 --> 03:02:36,020
It's about how many times you get up again.

3556
03:02:36,700 --> 03:02:38,860
You're never going to keep me down.

3557
03:02:40,500 --> 03:02:42,900
Uh, OK, huh?

3558
03:02:42,900 --> 03:02:46,900
Oh, you were doing the tub thumping, tub, tub thumping.

3559
03:02:47,300 --> 03:02:48,900
No, it's tub thumping.

3560
03:02:48,900 --> 03:02:52,180
Chumbo Womba, Womba Chumba, right?

3561
03:02:52,780 --> 03:02:54,020
Is that Chumbo Womba?

3562
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:56,220
I don't know. Yeah, it's tub thumping.

3563
03:02:57,140 --> 03:02:59,140
Yeah, yeah. I get knocked down.

3564
03:03:00,740 --> 03:03:02,780
That damn end of the song.

3565
03:03:05,500 --> 03:03:06,500
I don't know.

3566
03:03:08,980 --> 03:03:10,860
What were we talking about?

3567
03:03:10,860 --> 03:03:13,780
The last voicemail and before that, nothing.

3568
03:03:15,540 --> 03:03:16,140
There are no more.

3569
03:03:16,140 --> 03:03:16,940
Yes, they just refreshed.

3570
03:03:16,940 --> 03:03:18,340
There are no more voicemails.

3571
03:03:18,340 --> 03:03:19,340
Thank God.

3572
03:03:20,340 --> 03:03:24,260
I want to I want to talk about a little thing, though.

3573
03:03:24,980 --> 03:03:25,980
OK.

3574
03:03:27,180 --> 03:03:31,620
I talked to my therapist about like, I'm not doing anything.

3575
03:03:31,780 --> 03:03:33,260
It's hard.

3576
03:03:33,260 --> 03:03:36,820
No, it's hard to not want to be doing stuff.

3577
03:03:37,620 --> 03:03:38,620
Uh-huh.

3578
03:03:39,380 --> 03:03:41,100
And she got me on.

3579
03:03:41,100 --> 03:03:44,020
I mean, can you be any more specific?

3580
03:03:44,940 --> 03:03:47,500
It's just like I want to get back into drawing, I guess.

3581
03:03:47,500 --> 03:03:48,940
I've got I've got commissions to do.

3582
03:03:48,980 --> 03:03:50,740
I've got stuff to draw.

3583
03:03:50,740 --> 03:03:54,140
OK, I need to do them by golly.

3584
03:03:54,700 --> 03:03:55,700
That's yeah.

3585
03:03:55,700 --> 03:03:57,780
And she got me on this thing

3586
03:03:57,780 --> 03:04:00,380
where she was telling me to get a piece of paper and a pen

3587
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:04,340
and to like, like she knows I have characters.

3588
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:07,220
So she told me to draw some characters, like, I mean, sure.

3589
03:04:07,220 --> 03:04:09,140
But like, where is this going?

3590
03:04:09,140 --> 03:04:09,980
OK.

3591
03:04:09,980 --> 03:04:12,580
And I then she asked me questions like,

3592
03:04:14,180 --> 03:04:15,860
so what are they doing with each other?

3593
03:04:15,860 --> 03:04:18,740
They just stand in there and make them interact with each other.

3594
03:04:18,740 --> 03:04:21,620
And I'm like, I guess this character does this.

3595
03:04:21,980 --> 03:04:23,660
It went on like that for a while.

3596
03:04:23,660 --> 03:04:25,820
I really didn't know what the point was

3597
03:04:26,100 --> 03:04:28,140
because it was like, it's eating into my therapy time.

3598
03:04:30,580 --> 03:04:31,820
But by the end,

3599
03:04:33,660 --> 03:04:36,740
it was like the point was that

3600
03:04:37,260 --> 03:04:40,500
forcing yourself to do to get work done

3601
03:04:41,060 --> 03:04:44,620
feels the same way as somebody just asking you to do it.

3602
03:04:45,620 --> 03:04:47,060
Hmm.

3603
03:04:47,060 --> 03:04:49,780
And it's but you have to be the one to do the asking.

3604
03:04:49,980 --> 03:04:51,700
And I was like, oh, cool.

3605
03:04:51,700 --> 03:04:54,140
Like, that's actually like good advice.

3606
03:04:54,700 --> 03:04:56,540
Wait, it was smart.

3607
03:04:56,540 --> 03:05:00,740
Someone getting work done feels the same way

3608
03:05:00,740 --> 03:05:02,340
as someone asking you to do.

3609
03:05:02,340 --> 03:05:05,540
Well, when when you don't want to do work

3610
03:05:05,540 --> 03:05:09,820
and it's like, I can put it off like, I don't want to do it yet, not now.

3611
03:05:10,140 --> 03:05:11,140
Hmm.

3612
03:05:12,380 --> 03:05:13,380
Having.

3613
03:05:14,380 --> 03:05:16,380
Having another person

3614
03:05:16,380 --> 03:05:19,860
shove you into it is like very useful.

3615
03:05:20,220 --> 03:05:24,100
And it's like so it's like you can be that person to yourself.

3616
03:05:24,420 --> 03:05:26,620
Yeah, I don't know how to do that yet,

3617
03:05:26,620 --> 03:05:28,380
but like it was a way of thinking about it.

3618
03:05:28,380 --> 03:05:30,220
It was like pretty good.

3619
03:05:30,220 --> 03:05:33,820
It's also why like writers rooms are so much more productive

3620
03:05:33,820 --> 03:05:36,540
than a writer sitting in by themselves with a typewriter

3621
03:05:36,540 --> 03:05:38,220
just trying to think of stuff.

3622
03:05:38,220 --> 03:05:40,700
And like you got to bounce ideas off.

3623
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:42,700
That's why that that works.

3624
03:05:42,700 --> 03:05:45,100
Like it's like if this is like someone.

3625
03:05:46,700 --> 03:05:48,300
This is why for years,

3626
03:05:48,300 --> 03:05:51,900
I found that the best way for me to be productive is to get

3627
03:05:51,900 --> 03:05:54,940
to sit in a call with other creative people and just vibe,

3628
03:05:55,340 --> 03:05:58,700
which is why when we work, which is why it works.

3629
03:05:59,140 --> 03:06:04,940
It works if if you're on a good time zone thing with them.

3630
03:06:05,340 --> 03:06:06,180
I tried to do that.

3631
03:06:06,180 --> 03:06:09,500
But everyone I know is like only awake when I'm about to go to bed.

3632
03:06:11,300 --> 03:06:14,420
I'm only around for a call when I'm about to go to bed.

3633
03:06:15,260 --> 03:06:20,340
I'm like if like it's like if someone else asked you

3634
03:06:21,220 --> 03:06:24,700
to draw something, you would do it.

3635
03:06:24,900 --> 03:06:28,620
You'd be like, OK, OK, well, I guess I'll figure out.

3636
03:06:28,940 --> 03:06:31,220
It's yeah, I guess I'll figure out a way to do it.

3637
03:06:31,500 --> 03:06:33,500
Yeah, it's not as simple as that.

3638
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:38,940
But like it's the it's the fact that like I hadn't drawn in such a long time

3639
03:06:39,580 --> 03:06:44,980
and drawing the doodles, it started with something that didn't matter at all.

3640
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:49,300
Draw anything is what she said, get a piece of paper, draw anything.

3641
03:06:50,100 --> 03:06:50,740
Yeah.

3642
03:06:50,740 --> 03:06:54,660
And then it's sort of like accelerated from there into

3643
03:06:55,260 --> 03:07:00,060
what is essentially a series of panels of two characters interacting

3644
03:07:01,020 --> 03:07:02,180
or three characters.

3645
03:07:03,180 --> 03:07:07,300
Oh, like like like some kind of comic or so like so some kind of comic.

3646
03:07:07,300 --> 03:07:11,900
And I'm like, man, it really is very easy to make these things

3647
03:07:11,900 --> 03:07:13,940
like to sketch this stuff out.

3648
03:07:14,940 --> 03:07:20,100
Yeah. It's the only thing holding me back is my desire to not do it.

3649
03:07:20,900 --> 03:07:24,380
And it's it's such a powerful desire.

3650
03:07:24,980 --> 03:07:27,260
But like it's it doesn't make any sense.

3651
03:07:27,660 --> 03:07:30,540
Like I could I could draw that so easily.

3652
03:07:30,700 --> 03:07:33,580
I think that the difficulty was starting is that.

3653
03:07:34,780 --> 03:07:39,900
I want to plan it out and throwing myself into the work

3654
03:07:40,540 --> 03:07:43,940
allowed me to get it done, even though I didn't know what it was at first

3655
03:07:44,060 --> 03:07:46,620
because it was just like an exercise.

3656
03:07:46,620 --> 03:07:50,700
But like that's something I need to get better at is throwing myself into work

3657
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:52,820
without a plan.

3658
03:07:52,860 --> 03:07:57,940
So that, yeah, so that I can get my, you know, my my momentum going.

3659
03:07:57,940 --> 03:08:01,100
And it's like, OK, well, now I'm working, now I've warmed up.

3660
03:08:03,820 --> 03:08:07,340
Now I can actually like think in terms of art

3661
03:08:07,740 --> 03:08:10,260
and maybe I can sketch a page or something.

3662
03:08:10,740 --> 03:08:16,100
That's kind of like how, you know, even if you don't know what you're going to do,

3663
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:22,020
like just doing something like just opening the program or whatever is like,

3664
03:08:22,140 --> 03:08:25,060
OK, you just you just like I don't know what I'm going to draw,

3665
03:08:25,060 --> 03:08:27,740
but I'm going to open the drawing program.

3666
03:08:29,060 --> 03:08:30,980
And I'm not going to worry about what happens after that,

3667
03:08:31,060 --> 03:08:33,300
but I'm going to take that step right now.

3668
03:08:33,580 --> 03:08:35,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3669
03:08:36,100 --> 03:08:40,020
How I've gone to work recently is I just throw myself into my Patreon server

3670
03:08:40,020 --> 03:08:41,380
and do the Hangout channel.

3671
03:08:41,380 --> 03:08:47,860
I I ping the role for my patrons who like want to be notified when I'm hanging out

3672
03:08:48,380 --> 03:08:51,820
and they pop in and then I work for like four hours and I get a lot done.

3673
03:08:52,020 --> 03:08:57,260
And I'm going to start doing that twice twice a day, starting tomorrow.

3674
03:08:58,500 --> 03:08:59,540
What are you working in the morning?

3675
03:08:59,540 --> 03:09:03,300
Four hours at night, just drawing or animating or whatever I need to get done.

3676
03:09:06,140 --> 03:09:07,700
I want to be productive.

3677
03:09:07,700 --> 03:09:11,020
And I also want to invite more friends in there, too,

3678
03:09:11,180 --> 03:09:13,300
because if there's not enough patrons around,

3679
03:09:13,300 --> 03:09:16,220
I know it's good to have access to friends who can hang if they're available.

3680
03:09:17,180 --> 03:09:21,220
Yeah, both of you could get in if you wanted, I could just pop you right in

3681
03:09:21,220 --> 03:09:25,020
if that sounds like a time or not.

3682
03:09:25,940 --> 03:09:30,100
Sure. I mean, I mean, so I mean, so many servers,

3683
03:09:30,380 --> 03:09:34,860
but I'd I'll I'll accept I'll accept an invitation.

3684
03:09:35,460 --> 03:09:39,020
Of course, my nighttime stream would be would typically start

3685
03:09:39,660 --> 03:09:43,220
about an hour or two from now and my morning stream would start

3686
03:09:45,060 --> 03:09:47,860
let's see, like six and a half hours ago.

3687
03:09:48,860 --> 03:09:51,500
I could catch a morning stream.

3688
03:09:51,780 --> 03:09:53,900
Yeah, I could.

3689
03:09:53,900 --> 03:09:55,980
Yeah, I'll take that.

3690
03:09:55,980 --> 03:09:57,700
Epic throw me in there.

3691
03:09:57,700 --> 03:09:59,100
I'll throw you right in.

3692
03:09:59,100 --> 03:10:00,740
I'll give you the art friend role.

3693
03:10:02,500 --> 03:10:08,220
I I found this tweet the other day.

3694
03:10:09,700 --> 03:10:11,540
I liked it.

3695
03:10:11,540 --> 03:10:13,540
It's like a bunch of.

3696
03:10:14,540 --> 03:10:19,900
You know, we got this little artist here saying like each one,

3697
03:10:19,900 --> 03:10:25,180
he's like he's facing a problem and he's he has an unproductive way

3698
03:10:25,180 --> 03:10:28,540
of thinking about it versus like a productive way of thinking about it.

3699
03:10:29,140 --> 03:10:35,620
Like this first one is not I need to be in a better mood before I will draw,

3700
03:10:35,620 --> 03:10:39,180
but I will be in a better mood if I draw.

3701
03:10:39,860 --> 03:10:41,860
Right. Yeah, true.

3702
03:10:41,860 --> 03:10:43,300
That's true. Yeah.

3703
03:10:43,340 --> 03:10:45,140
It's so true.

3704
03:10:45,140 --> 03:10:47,140
These are pretty good.

3705
03:10:48,380 --> 03:10:52,460
I like in your server, there's a self there's a role self assign.

3706
03:10:52,940 --> 03:10:58,180
And if you want the horny, there's lots of people who click yes.

3707
03:10:58,300 --> 03:11:00,660
They want the horny role, please.

3708
03:11:00,660 --> 03:11:04,580
I would do access for first posting channels, because people were first

3709
03:11:04,580 --> 03:11:06,660
posting everywhere and I had to contain them.

3710
03:11:07,380 --> 03:11:08,980
Well, well.

3711
03:11:09,780 --> 03:11:14,860
Mm, that's that doesn't surprise me so much.

3712
03:11:18,260 --> 03:11:21,460
Also, those comments you linked are unironically based.

3713
03:11:21,580 --> 03:11:23,700
I'm going to hold on to that.

3714
03:11:23,700 --> 03:11:25,700
Yeah, right. I thought they were great.

3715
03:11:29,180 --> 03:11:31,780
I had to go through my Twitter likes.

3716
03:11:31,780 --> 03:11:33,020
I need to be in a better mood.

3717
03:11:33,020 --> 03:11:34,380
I need to be in a better mood to draw.

3718
03:11:34,380 --> 03:11:37,580
That's always that's why I get like nothing done for like eight hours

3719
03:11:37,580 --> 03:11:39,340
after I wake up.

3720
03:11:39,340 --> 03:11:41,340
Yeah.

3721
03:11:42,420 --> 03:11:43,940
Yeah. Yeah.

3722
03:11:43,940 --> 03:11:46,820
I've I've been there 20 times.

3723
03:11:50,180 --> 03:11:51,340
Well, I'm glad you like that.

3724
03:11:51,340 --> 03:11:52,020
I had to go through.

3725
03:11:52,020 --> 03:11:55,060
I had to go back through my Twitter likes for a few days to find them,

3726
03:11:55,060 --> 03:11:56,380
but I did.

3727
03:11:56,380 --> 03:11:57,980
That's great.

3728
03:11:57,980 --> 03:12:02,500
I hope to be making progress

3729
03:12:02,500 --> 03:12:05,980
on one of my comics, probably Clarissa.

3730
03:12:07,580 --> 03:12:09,300
Soon ish.

3731
03:12:09,300 --> 03:12:14,940
I don't know when I want to hope that I also hope that I am.

3732
03:12:17,380 --> 03:12:21,660
I am hoping to hear back from this this printer lady.

3733
03:12:22,420 --> 03:12:28,540
I'm hoping to very soon be done with this stupid fucking book

3734
03:12:28,900 --> 03:12:31,580
formatting job and send that off.

3735
03:12:31,580 --> 03:12:35,540
And then as I wait for them to send me the test print,

3736
03:12:36,140 --> 03:12:40,060
then I can get back to working on that video that I was excited about.

3737
03:12:42,740 --> 03:12:45,180
That's my plan.

3738
03:12:45,180 --> 03:12:46,780
That's a good plan.

3739
03:12:46,780 --> 03:12:48,740
I know. Thank you.

3740
03:12:48,740 --> 03:12:50,100
Hell, yeah.

3741
03:12:50,100 --> 03:12:51,180
Wait a minute.

3742
03:12:51,180 --> 03:12:53,540
I got to share another tweet.

3743
03:12:53,540 --> 03:12:55,980
You got to share another one.

3744
03:12:56,180 --> 03:12:58,700
It's a it's this one.

3745
03:12:59,340 --> 03:13:01,660
He's practicing the Among Us alphabet.

3746
03:13:02,140 --> 03:13:04,820
And as you can see, oh, my God, all the.

3747
03:13:06,540 --> 03:13:08,740
Fucking volume wouldn't appear.

3748
03:13:08,740 --> 03:13:09,500
Sorry. I'm sorry.

3749
03:13:09,500 --> 03:13:12,940
Yeah, I didn't realize it had a sound.

3750
03:13:14,340 --> 03:13:18,620
The sound adds a lot, but I couldn't access the volume.

3751
03:13:19,340 --> 03:13:23,380
Yeah, I mean, I I like the Q on the S.

3752
03:13:23,380 --> 03:13:25,220
The S looks like a worm.

3753
03:13:25,220 --> 03:13:27,940
Some of these are better than the O is the best one.

3754
03:13:28,260 --> 03:13:30,220
I like the V. The V is just upside down.

3755
03:13:33,260 --> 03:13:34,260
Yeah.

3756
03:13:35,900 --> 03:13:38,620
A is just the boy.

3757
03:13:41,020 --> 03:13:42,140
You is you.

3758
03:13:42,140 --> 03:13:43,860
There's an upside down grade.

3759
03:13:43,860 --> 03:13:44,980
These are great.

3760
03:13:44,980 --> 03:13:46,460
Look at these. This is delightful.

3761
03:13:49,140 --> 03:13:50,740
Oh, what do we got here?

3762
03:13:50,740 --> 03:13:51,740
Plomocus.

3763
03:13:53,300 --> 03:13:56,740
I just don't mind because of a song.

3764
03:13:56,740 --> 03:14:00,140
Jesus, that's fuck.

3765
03:14:02,140 --> 03:14:03,860
Literally.

3766
03:14:03,860 --> 03:14:05,340
Yikes.

3767
03:14:05,380 --> 03:14:07,380
You came back from the dead.

3768
03:14:08,420 --> 03:14:10,780
Well, oh, it counted.

3769
03:14:11,180 --> 03:14:12,820
Oh, it counted down.

3770
03:14:12,820 --> 03:14:14,420
Counted down.

3771
03:14:14,420 --> 03:14:16,820
Oh, I didn't even like register that.

3772
03:14:18,020 --> 03:14:20,860
I just thought it was like a really distressing like

3773
03:14:21,300 --> 03:14:23,740
lots of people kill themselves in one word.

3774
03:14:23,740 --> 03:14:25,060
Just did it.

3775
03:14:25,060 --> 03:14:29,060
No, so it's like oh, I see.

3776
03:14:29,060 --> 03:14:30,220
I see. Excellent.

3777
03:14:30,220 --> 03:14:32,060
That this is a good reaction image

3778
03:14:32,060 --> 03:14:35,180
when you're sad and something cool happens.

3779
03:14:35,180 --> 03:14:37,380
Yeah, exactly.

3780
03:14:37,820 --> 03:14:40,220
Don't don't be a statistic.

3781
03:14:40,220 --> 03:14:43,900
Oh, shit, like turn the clock back like me when I play

3782
03:14:43,900 --> 03:14:45,100
that new Cuphead deal.

3783
03:14:45,100 --> 03:14:46,260
See, I haven't played it yet.

3784
03:14:46,260 --> 03:14:48,260
I should get on that.

3785
03:14:50,980 --> 03:14:53,340
I haven't been playing video games.

3786
03:14:54,540 --> 03:14:58,620
I've been I've been playing games today.

3787
03:14:58,820 --> 03:15:03,940
I dual played Adventure Quest and RuneScape at the same time.

3788
03:15:04,340 --> 03:15:06,740
Now, that's productivity.

3789
03:15:06,740 --> 03:15:08,620
That's shitty games in one.

3790
03:15:08,620 --> 03:15:11,060
Even though they're neither shitty, they just are great.

3791
03:15:11,060 --> 03:15:12,220
And I love them.

3792
03:15:12,220 --> 03:15:16,420
How are you in the early 2000s twice at the same time?

3793
03:15:16,940 --> 03:15:20,500
Because the technology exists late 2000s.

3794
03:15:20,500 --> 03:15:24,380
I've always respected Jagex for like just giving the player

3795
03:15:24,380 --> 03:15:27,380
base what they wanted and making old school RuneScape

3796
03:15:27,860 --> 03:15:30,220
a permanent thing that they will upkeep.

3797
03:15:30,980 --> 03:15:33,780
Yes, because they asked for it.

3798
03:15:33,860 --> 03:15:37,500
I like it when my character has a triangle for a face.

3799
03:15:38,980 --> 03:15:42,180
Yes, they're so stupid looking.

3800
03:15:42,180 --> 03:15:44,180
It's it's a perfect.

3801
03:15:45,940 --> 03:15:48,020
My name is Five Polygon Man.

3802
03:15:49,340 --> 03:15:51,500
And I have a Five Polygon plan.

3803
03:15:55,060 --> 03:15:57,940
My tonsil is sore.

3804
03:15:57,940 --> 03:16:00,500
I wonder if there's anything to do with that tonsil stone that just.

3805
03:16:01,220 --> 03:16:04,500
Yes hurts a little bit and I don't like it.

3806
03:16:06,020 --> 03:16:08,140
Don't like not knowing what's going on.

3807
03:16:10,060 --> 03:16:13,140
With stuff, especially inside of me.

3808
03:16:14,860 --> 03:16:17,980
Better cut your open and find out.

3809
03:16:19,220 --> 03:16:22,460
Or get a tiny submarine shrink shrink people down

3810
03:16:22,740 --> 03:16:25,540
to go inside your body and look around.

3811
03:16:27,620 --> 03:16:29,620
Why didn't I think of that?

3812
03:16:31,140 --> 03:16:35,980
Get a tiny little magic school bus and the kids can like learn about

3813
03:16:36,580 --> 03:16:41,060
whatever the fuck's going on and sell my body to science

3814
03:16:41,060 --> 03:16:44,740
while I'm still alive by swallowing a little magic school bus.

3815
03:16:47,700 --> 03:16:53,020
Ms. Frizzle can pay me a stipend for the use of my body.

3816
03:16:53,020 --> 03:17:02,340
OK, that's the end of the podcast.

3817
03:17:04,580 --> 03:17:09,980
Patreon.com slash the procrastinator gets you some of them bonus episodes.

3818
03:17:09,980 --> 03:17:10,740
There is a new one.

3819
03:17:10,740 --> 03:17:12,940
There is a new behind the scenes bonus episode.

3820
03:17:12,940 --> 03:17:14,780
Oh, my God. Last week.

3821
03:17:14,780 --> 03:17:17,900
Yes, I'm like 40 bonus episodes behind.

3822
03:17:17,900 --> 03:17:19,700
I got to catch up.

3823
03:17:19,700 --> 03:17:22,700
I think that's number 59.

3824
03:17:22,740 --> 03:17:27,020
I think there are 59 bonus episodes of which only nine of them

3825
03:17:27,580 --> 03:17:31,940
are behind the scenes or something like that.

3826
03:17:34,420 --> 03:17:36,940
Send us a voicemail.

3827
03:17:36,940 --> 03:17:41,860
Hey, quit spamming the PCP voicemail with like.

3828
03:17:42,980 --> 03:17:46,220
Nonsense, because like I'm just going to ignore it.

3829
03:17:47,060 --> 03:17:49,420
What do you what do you get out of it?

3830
03:17:49,420 --> 03:17:52,180
What do you what do you as a man

3831
03:17:52,300 --> 03:17:56,620
get out of posting the same YouTube link over and over.

3832
03:17:57,740 --> 03:17:59,900
In our voicemail.

3833
03:17:59,900 --> 03:18:02,180
Who? Yeah, who gain who benefits from that?

3834
03:18:02,380 --> 03:18:04,500
I don't know. Maybe they don't even watch the show.

3835
03:18:04,820 --> 03:18:07,100
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

3836
03:18:07,100 --> 03:18:10,980
But then but but still the question still still who.

3837
03:18:12,740 --> 03:18:13,740
No.

3838
03:18:16,220 --> 03:18:17,300
That's all.

3839
03:18:17,300 --> 03:18:19,140
Patreon, speak pipe.

3840
03:18:19,380 --> 03:18:20,980
Uh, I don't know.

3841
03:18:20,980 --> 03:18:23,460
Follow the PCP Twitter, I guess.

3842
03:18:23,460 --> 03:18:26,340
Follow us. Oh, yeah.

3843
03:18:27,060 --> 03:18:28,300
Sure.

3844
03:18:29,020 --> 03:18:33,140
Join Big Booby Mommy Milkers or my Patron, if you want to see.

3845
03:18:33,140 --> 03:18:33,980
I don't even know.

3846
03:18:33,980 --> 03:18:36,460
I don't even know where the link to that is.

3847
03:18:36,460 --> 03:18:37,380
Just link it.

3848
03:18:37,380 --> 03:18:38,980
We'll put it in the description this one time.

3849
03:18:38,980 --> 03:18:40,860
This one time. Oh, my God.

3850
03:18:40,860 --> 03:18:43,780
And then if you scroll through my post, there'll be new people

3851
03:18:43,780 --> 03:18:45,420
and they'll be like, oh, shit.

3852
03:18:45,420 --> 03:18:46,820
Check out a blibby.

3853
03:18:47,300 --> 03:18:49,620
We don't want them seeing Gibbs, a big old titties.

3854
03:18:49,620 --> 03:18:50,980
So I drew. That'd be terrible.

3855
03:18:50,980 --> 03:18:55,940
The one the one person who clicked this episode,

3856
03:18:56,060 --> 03:18:59,620
who has not already seen previous episodes

3857
03:18:59,620 --> 03:19:01,820
and is familiar with Oblivion Fall,

3858
03:19:01,820 --> 03:19:04,340
you should check out Oblivion Fall on Twitter.

3859
03:19:04,340 --> 03:19:06,740
I mean, on YouTube, I mean, I guess also on Twitter.

3860
03:19:06,740 --> 03:19:07,860
Why not?

3861
03:19:07,860 --> 03:19:11,420
I mean, I guess mainly Twitter is easier to like Twitter

3862
03:19:11,420 --> 03:19:15,700
at Oblivion Fall underscore D, where I'm going to post

3863
03:19:15,820 --> 03:19:20,380
little gibbon images eventually along with other stuff,

3864
03:19:20,380 --> 03:19:24,180
like the booze and balls I've been drawing this episode.

3865
03:19:24,180 --> 03:19:27,620
I drew some giant nuts and I shaded them and they look good.

3866
03:19:27,620 --> 03:19:30,580
But none of you can see them.

3867
03:19:31,220 --> 03:19:33,460
OK, let's draw my patron.

3868
03:19:33,460 --> 03:19:35,780
Nice. Cool.

3869
03:19:37,780 --> 03:19:40,180
The nuts will blot out the sun.

3870
03:19:40,500 --> 03:19:42,100
That's all. That's all I got.

3871
03:19:42,100 --> 03:19:44,220
The leading world is nothing but come.

3872
03:19:46,060 --> 03:19:47,260
Good night.

3873
03:19:47,260 --> 03:19:48,260
Good night, everybody.

3874
03:19:48,260 --> 03:19:49,300
See you later.

3875
03:19:49,300 --> 03:19:50,980
Or good morning, everybody.

3876
03:19:50,980 --> 03:19:52,780
Or good day, everybody.

3877
03:19:52,780 --> 03:19:54,140
Good night. Thanks for listening.

3878
03:19:54,140 --> 03:19:54,980
Everybody.

3879
03:19:54,980 --> 03:19:56,340
I'm going to go swab.

3880
03:19:56,340 --> 03:19:58,980
I'm going to go swab the inside of my mouth

3881
03:19:59,820 --> 03:20:02,660
and see what develops.

3882
03:20:02,660 --> 03:20:05,180
I'm going to go swab the inside of his mouth as well.

3883
03:20:05,820 --> 03:20:07,820
OK, yeah.

3884
03:20:07,820 --> 03:20:10,460
I'm going to go swab the man on my.
