00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey, what's up listeners? It's Ben Saint in the Boomer Radio Show Podcast Pro Crastinators Podcast Soundboard.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's Ben Saint in the morning.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Announcement, bonus episode, emergency bonus episode. We recorded an emergency bonus episode this week.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you're interested, there is for Trixie's funny appearance on who are these podcasts where she attempted to dunk on us.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:47,000
As of right now, I have not listened to it, but me and Simsie and Gibb, if she ever fucking shows up on time, are about to listen to that, record that, and have a live reaction to that.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That will be the bonus episode. It should be up now, when you're listening to this, patreon.com.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you want to hear our hot takes, my live take on that, and I will give you a live rating, 1-10, of how much my feelings were hurt, and how much I was coping, and how much I was seething.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will give 1-10 ratings of those three things, and I will chart them as the segment progresses.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, link in the description, patreon.com.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
For Crastinators bonus episode, special. Okay, back to the regular episode. Bye.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I had a nightmare last night that I, well, it wasn't really a nightmare, but it was a dream where I recorded the podcast, but then I didn't save it.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I didn't close it without saving it and lose it, but I hit the save button, but I didn't hit the okay on the where to save it, so it didn't actually save.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So I left the audacity file open on my desktop, and I left, and then I realized, oh my god, I didn't actually save it.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's just open, it still needs to be saved. If anything happens to my computer, the file will disappear.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh god, but I'm not at home right now, because I left, and I was like, I gotta get back there. I gotta save the podcast.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, if you have enough nightmares, you can put them in a stable.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh my god. Oh my god. Yeah, true, true though.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Gotta use your head.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That was a good, that's a pretty, I was watching some, I've been watching a channel that is specifically about Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow and Aria of Sorrow.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The entire channel is about that.

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Wait, what?

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You mean the whole channel is dedicated to those two games?

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, yes.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Wait, hold on. I want to see, what's the name of the channel? I've been watching it a lot. Yeah, he did a countdown of like, he ranked, he did tier list rankings of all the red souls in Dawn, all the red souls in Aria, all the blue souls in Dawn, all the blue souls in Dawn, all the yellow souls in Dawn, all the yellow souls in Aria.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And the nightmare, there's one, I think it's called Nightmare where you shoot a big horse, and that one's apparently pretty good.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's a high tier soul from Dawn.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, I seem to remember.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No, Aria.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I remember the big horsey soul.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wait, hold on. It is a tier list Aria.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want to give this guy props.

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He's got a tiny channel. Yeah, the channel is Jupiter Climb. He's got 1000 subscribers.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He ranked all the weapons. I just really like, I really like Dawn of Sorrow. I really like Aria of Sorrow. So it's just cool.

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I haven't played that shit. It's probably great.

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You never played those? It is great.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The only Castlevania.

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They're the best of the Metroidvania Castlevanias.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The Castlevania I've played is three because I downloaded it on the Wii, eStorm.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's, those are, three is like before Symphony of the Night.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, yes.

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, it makes me so mad. I feel like it's so obvious that it almost doesn't even bear mentioning.

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And yet every time I see Dawn of Sorrow and Aria of Sorrow, I can't help but be so upset at the art style change between the two games.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't. Let me look it up.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The, the art, Aria of Sorrow, I think that, yeah, the first one, it has the beautiful like painted art style of, oh, who's the artist who did like Symphony of the Night, Castlevania?

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's an anime. You mean the front cover? No.

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Or the backgrounds?

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Co, is it Kojima? Is it Ayami Kojima, the guy who did all that?

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, no. Or maybe his last name is Kojima.

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I know who you mean. It's the guy, the Castlevania guy.

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The only Kojima I know is Hideo Kojima.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's definitely not him. Symphony of the Night.

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The guy who got the, he made a Kickstarter for a different non-Kojima, I mean Castlevania-esque thing that was pretty good, I think.

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Koji something. I think his name is Kojima.

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Kojikondo.

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Not Kojikondo. Yeah, Igarashi, I think.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, okay, no, but I'm talking about the art specifically, which yeah, is apparently this guy Ayami Kojima.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, yeah. I didn't know that.

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Anyway, they didn't, I guess they didn't have him for the sequel, Dawn of Sorrow, and so they just kind of look like fucking anime, and it sucks so bad.

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, Dawn of Sorrow had more of an anime look to it.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's so bad. It's so like, it's so flat and boring compared to the first one.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The front cover, I'm looking at them.

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The front cover and the portraits.

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Art of Sorrow looks like a Final Fantasy-esque sort of painterly-esque thing, and then Dawn of Sorrow does look like some anime-type tie-in game.

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Dawn of Sorrow looks like fucking, it looks like, I mean, no offense, I guess, but it looks like fucking, what do you call it, like Ace Attorney or something.

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No, the front covers for Ace Attorney are the worst part, for sure.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But yes, look, look, compare the two front covers, and that's exactly it.

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Like all the in-game character portraits are painted like that, and then in Dawn they look like fucking, they look like fucking 90s anime characters.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It sucks.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know, I didn't mind it too much, but I guess it depends on how much you like that kind of anime art style.

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you're a big fan of anime, maybe you would like it.

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's just so much more generic. It's so much more like you would see this kind of art anywhere.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am looking at an image, oh god, I went to look at the image, it's asking me to download it, fuck off, no, I will grab a screen grab.

75
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This looks a little bit like Fire Emblem characters portraits, which I don't mind, I actually quite like those.

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This isn't annoying me too much.

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I only don't like it because I think the first one is so much more unique.

78
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I feel like it's a big downgrade.

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Maybe Ben is just racist against anime.

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's true.

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Putting these together though, I can see, is that the same guy?

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Well, that's him at the end of the game when there's just a certain thing going on with him.

83
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He's beast mode.

84
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's a spoiler.

85
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh my god, Dracula's in Castlevania.

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The story of Dawn of Sorrow is awesome because every Castlevania is about you're a vampire hunter hunting down Dracula, and in this one you're just a guy.

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
First of all, it's in the future for some reason.

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It doesn't really even matter that it's in the future, it just is.

89
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're just some kid who wanders into the castle who gets trapped there.

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But it turns out in the end that you were called there because you are Dracula reincarnated.

91
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And then you have to resist your fucking fate to stop yourself from becoming Dracula.

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's awesome.

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think there's a secret ending in one of the games where you do actually become Dracula and you get killed by the other characters.

94
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Before you fight them, it's one of the other...

95
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's Julius Belmont, I think.

96
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes.

97
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you go down to the secret ending mode, you fight Julius Belmont, and he's a tough boss.

98
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And you don't kill him though, and you tell him, like, I'm gonna go stop myself from becoming Dracula.

99
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If I don't do it, I want you to kill me.

100
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And then if you go and you get the bad ending, it's the scene from the beginning where Dracula is sitting on the throne and he has a miserable pile of secrets and he throws the wine glass.

101
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And then, yeah, you get that scene, but it's you.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're sitting on the throne and you throw the glass, and Julius shows up and he's like, I'm here to keep that promise I made for you.

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what a video game.

104
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, that was pretty cool, I remember that.

105
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So good, yeah.

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But you know, since we're on the subject of Metroidvania, shouldn't we talk about the new one, Metroid Dread?

107
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I haven't played it.

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't have a Switch, I haven't played it.

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Everyone seems to be really liking it.

110
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, it's too bad Tom isn't here because I think he has played it, right?

111
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes, I think I just tweeted about it.

112
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, I kind of got it a bit later than everyone else because that issues with my order, but I beat it recently.

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I beat it once on normal mode, and I got a playtime of like three hours and 50 minutes, which is pretty good.

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And then I beat it again on hard mode following one of those sequels.

115
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But you beat the whole game in three hours?

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, it's not, that's the in-game timer.

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It actually took me longer than that, but the game doesn't count on you.

118
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Is it because you died over and over?

119
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah, I died a lot and it doesn't count your death.

120
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Fair enough, I guess.

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So it took longer than that, but that's like an accelerated speedrun time.

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So when I beat it on hard mode, I was following one of the sequence breaking guides,

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and I managed to get the playtime to like two hours and 40 minutes, which is, you know, not bad for a normal non-speedrunner.

124
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That seems so short though. It seems like a really short game.

125
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, normally it would take you around like 10 hours probably to beat it.

126
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, that's what I would expect for a casual play.

127
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But you know, most Metroid games can be beaten in under two hours speedrun time.

128
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, yeah, but I mean you, but it was your first play, so it's not like you're using speedrun strats.

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, I did the second time around when I played on hard mode.

130
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The first time I just went real fast. I got lucky on the first time.

131
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I only just barely made it under four hours, which is what you need to do to unlock, you know, all the artwork and stuff.

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But anyways, CC says he wants to talk about Castlevania, should we let him in?

133
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know, that's your call.

134
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I got nothing to say about castles and vanias.

135
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But I don't mind, I guess.

136
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I've gushed enough. I've gushed enough. Nah.

137
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I just figured we should die.

138
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I figured we should talk about Metroid Dread so you can put it in a thumbnail and in the title.

139
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh, yeah.

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Get all those SEO points.

141
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's pretty good.

142
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Dude, Metroid Dread, two dimensions.

143
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I played Metroid though. I can talk about Metroid, not Dread.

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's the clickbait.

145
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can talk about Zero Mission and Fusion. Those are my ones.

146
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Zero Mission is the remake of the original one, right?

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

148
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The first one I ever played was Fusion on the GBA, and then I played a GBA port of Super at some point.

149
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think those are the only two I've played, but they're cool.

150
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There is no GBA port of Super. I think you're thinking of Zero Mission.

151
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Maybe I played it on an emulator. No, I've definitely played Super Metroid.

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's the big one.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Everyone says it's the best one or the most iconic, and I still haven't gone around to it.

154
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I like Metroid and Zero Mission and Fusion though a lot, so I probably would like it.

155
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Super Metroid is my favorite, but I think my second favorite probably is Zero Mission.

156
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Zero Mission is, even though it's a remake of the first Metroid, it's a lot like Super Metroid.

157
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It takes a lot of inspiration. A lot of the upgrades and bosses and stuff are taken directly from Super Metroid.

158
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, it's such a cryptic game for trying to figure out some of these things.

159
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There's that one bug that's blocking your way from one angle, and it's got a really weird creepy music.

160
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You have to go all the way around to the other side of it, and then it's just like the chrysalis is left,

161
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and you walk through it, and then that is turned into a bus.

162
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, I remember that.

163
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's something they added in the remake that's not in any other game.

164
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, it's really hard to...

165
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I was quite young when I played Zero Mission.

166
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It was one of those video games that actually does justice to the wonder and exploration mind of a child sort of thing.

167
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I wonder if you could go there. I wonder if you could do this and that.

168
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I wonder if you bounce on explosions, one of the bomb balls.

169
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, the bomb jump.

170
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, the morph jump ball jumping.

171
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What if you could jump all the way on the surface of the planet up to a ledge, and you could?

172
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And I got up there, and I'm like, fuck yeah.

173
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There's so many places where you can do that.

174
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's basically what Metroid is all about, and Super Metroid kind of does that even better,

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
because in Zero Mission it tells you where to go, but Super Metroid doesn't tell you where to go at all.

176
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Well, I was so confused playing Zero Mission, I had no idea where I was going at any point.

177
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was too stupid to understand when there was a cutscene, that there was a way to get there.

178
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's just sort of like you go to a chozo, you get an upgrade, and then it goes...

179
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and then it shows your map.

180
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It goes...

181
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and then a funny little orange marker on the map.

182
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And they mark on your map.

183
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But I didn't even have the map, so it was just like a dot off in the distance.

184
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm like, how do I go that way?

185
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, Zero Mission, it was a...

186
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I explore the entire world over and over again every time, because I kept not finding the right way to go.

187
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It was great.

188
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Zero Mission, it had a pretty good balance between not giving you too much information about where to go,

189
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
but it does give you at least a little nudge with that little icon.

190
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So you still have to figure it out on your own mostly, but you at least have some sense of direction and where to go.

191
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Because in Super Metroid and Metroid 1 and 2, you had no indication whatsoever.

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You just had to randomly search the map and figure out where to go.

193
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You just sort of run up against a wall.

194
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You run around until you can't run around anymore, and you're like, how do I do this?

195
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And then you try and figure out how to do that.

196
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Right.

197
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But what I like about Super Metroid is that even though it never tells you where to go with icons and stuff,

198
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
the level design kind of has a lot of direction to it.

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So as long as you follow the basic philosophy of, if I haven't been somewhere, I should probably go there,

200
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you will almost always find a way forward.

201
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There's a couple of exceptions to that, but that general strategy,

202
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
it pretty much always works.

203
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It kind of funnels you into where you need to go just through the natural geometry of the world.

204
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And I think that's pretty cool.

205
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You know how I was playing for a little time?

206
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I said I was going to play a bunch of NES games or franchises from the beginning.

207
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So I beat Mario 1, and I sort of stopped doing it at Mario 2, but I want to do that.

208
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And then Mario 3.

209
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I also want to do that for Zelda and Metroid as well.

210
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I could maybe play Super Metroid on stream at some point,

211
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and then mute the comments because people tell me where to go,

212
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and everyone would be seething and coping about how bad I am.

213
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And that would be fun.

214
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I would definitely watch that stream.

215
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm a big fan of watching people play games that I grew up with, but it's their first time.

216
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think I mentioned that before.

217
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
For some reason, I get a lot of satisfaction out of that.

218
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I guess it's just because I've beaten these games so many times that I don't remember what it's like to experience it for the first time.

219
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So whenever I get the opportunity to see somebody else experience it for the first time, I'm always pretty excited about that.

220
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, it's like vicariously getting something that is impossible to get yourself.

221
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Even if it's been a long time, you'll eventually remember parts of it, and you're like, oh yeah, I get it.

222
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I remember this.

223
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
They play a game you've played before, and they walk past something, and then they stop and stare and be like, whoa, what the hell?

224
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
They're surprised at something, and you have gotten so used to it that you didn't even register it.

225
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You've forgotten it was there. You've forgotten it was funny or interesting.

226
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, sometimes I'll be reminded of when I first played a game and the kinds of mistakes I used to make when I see somebody else have trouble with the same areas.

227
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So that's pretty interesting. At least I find it interesting.

228
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What game are we talking about? Which Metroid?

229
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, I was going to ask, with regards to Metroid Dread, how does it feel similar or different to Zero Mission?

230
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Because that's the one I know.

231
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, it's definitely pretty similar.

232
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a lot more similar to Zero Mission in Metroid Fusion than Super Metroid, as far as the controls and the design and stuff.

233
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But it's probably the most similar to Samus Returns on the 3DS, because I think it uses either the same engine or a similar engine to that one.

234
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That one had the free aim mechanic where you hold down one of the shoulder buttons, and you can aim in 360 degrees pretty smoothly.

235
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I think probably one of the big differences between Metroid Zero Mission and Fusion compared to Super Metroid is the bosses.

236
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Because in Fusion and Zero Mission, the bosses are kind of hard. They're pretty dang hard.

237
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In Metroid Dread, the bosses are also pretty difficult.

238
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
They're strangely dark souls-esque, not just because they're hard, but because you fight a lot of dudes, night dudes or night guys.

239
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Just big, all-king guys in armor with a spear and stuff.

240
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You fight a lot of that for some reason in Metroid Dread.

241
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If you like that kind of boss fights, you'll probably like this as well.

242
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I really enjoyed boss fights personally in Metroid Dread. It was a lot of fun.

243
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They're very hard. You die a lot, but they have really cool attack patterns to learn.

244
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Every single attack has a tell.

245
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Every time you know the tells, you can predict what attacks they're going to do before they do it.

246
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's really satisfying to just get a no-damage kill on a boss that killed you 50 times because you completely figured out his attack pattern.

247
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There's also the counters, the melee counter.

248
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Every once in a while, the boss will flash yellow.

249
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If you do a melee counter, that mechanic is from Samus Returns.

250
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If you do a melee counter when he flashes yellow, it triggers a really cinematic animation where you just unload all your missiles into the boss and do massive damage.

251
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's extremely satisfying to pull off.

252
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
True, though. I assume.

253
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:20,000
As far as exploration is concerned, it's pretty much like any other Metroid from Super Metroid, Zero Mission and Fusion.

254
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It has a pretty massive map and there's a billion upgrades to collect.

255
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You know those Shine Spark puzzles from Metroid Fusion? I think Zero Mission also had them. There's a lot of that here as well.

256
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Did you ever do any of those Shine Spark puzzles?

257
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I got it. I got my baby bells. I'm good now. I got them.

258
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What flavor?

259
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's regular.

260
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh, fucking pathetic.

261
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I know.

262
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
A Metroid flavor?

263
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
A Metroid flavor. You put it on your head and it sucks your life force out.

264
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
There is Metroid flavored cheese just for you.

265
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The plot to Metroid Red, which I'm not going to talk about because it's a spoiler, but it's kind of weird.

266
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It gets kind of shown in towards the end.

267
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I heard it in very minimal storytelling. There's not cutscenes and stuff in it.

268
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:37,000
For the most part, there's very few cutscenes. The story is kind of done in Fusion where you go to the computer room and you talk to Adam.

269
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Adam the computer and he just tells you what's going on for the most part.

270
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But Adam doesn't talk as much here as he does in Fusion.

271
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:00,000
For most of the game, there's no real cutscenes. But then, all of a sudden, in the middle of the game, there's a giant 10 minute cutscene that basically explains everything.

272
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The very end just feels really shown in to me because the main villain is all like, oh, I let you live, Samus, because I wanted to see you reach your true potential.

273
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I wanted to see how strong you'd get.

274
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Is it for Chozo Dad?

275
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yeah, that's basically...

276
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Abusive Chozo Dad. Samus, you're supposed to be a bird, idiot.

277
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah, basically.

278
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Works for me. The Metroid game is about collecting shit and getting super powerful, so it seems automatically appropriate.

279
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:03,000
In some ways, I kind of like it because I sometimes like the cheesy, shonen tropes, but at the same time, it also feels kind of lame that this is what all Metroid has resulted in.

280
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It just resulted in cheesy, shonen tropes.

281
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
They just reinvented anime.

282
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I was kind of expecting something different because the previous Metroids didn't do that for the most part.

283
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:32,000
To see this is a big, massive revelation at the end, it's kind of weird.

284
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The boss fight, the final boss is really cool, so it kind of works.

285
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's interesting because I don't think of Metroid.

286
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There's a lot of world building and aliens and things you can study up on, but I think of Metroid Zero Mission and I think, I gotta blast those aliens.

287
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I gotta jump and I gotta morph ball.

288
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's not a thinking series, not that a heady Metroid thing is bad or whatever, but when I think of the plot of Metroid, it's usually just go to a planet, do your job, and then get out of there before it blows.

289
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's like an 80s action movie plot of a video game.

290
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That is for the most part accurate.

291
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It was really only Metroid Fusion that started to step up the storytelling a lot, but all the previous ones barely had any cutscenes and Zero Mission since it's a remake of Metroid One.

292
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That's why it has almost no story in it because that's what Metroid One was like.

293
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
They're mostly just side-scrolling action exploration games.

294
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The story is pretty secondary to the game.

295
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's mostly just lore. There's a lot of lore, but there's not a whole lot of plots.

296
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
There's a lot of lore, but it's like lore that I don't feel curious to learn about.

297
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I know that there's space pirates with Ridley.

298
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't really care what they're being space pirates about or where they're from or what the state of the galaxy is in.

299
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Who does Samus work for? Do they work for anyone?

300
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't really feel curious about these things, even though there might be cool tidbits of information.

301
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
In Metroid Prime you can scan everything, and I'm like, yeah, but I don't actually care about anything.

302
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I just want to shoot.

303
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But it's weird because in other sci-fi universes I would like to know a lot more.

304
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't really care about the scan information in Metroid Prime.

305
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I think most of that is just fluff.

306
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The writers had to earn their paychecks, so they just had to put together as many words as they can and increase those word counts.

307
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
But I think the lore of the series is something you would only care about if you played all the games and you're a hardcore fan.

308
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
If you're not that big of a fan, it's like Zelda.

309
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The Zelda games don't have big plots either, and you'd only care about the Zelda timeline if you've played all the games and you're a big hardcore Zelda fanatic.

310
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't know.

311
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I feel like I do care, or I am interested in the Zelda timeline, probably just because it was an interesting infographic when I first saw it.

312
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I was like, oh, what do you know?

313
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
They're linked to the past.

314
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And the future.

315
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Am I right? Hell yeah.

316
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Cool.

317
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
If there was a map of all the planets in Zelda, Ella, Ratchet and Clank or something, I was like, oh, look at all those planets.

318
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Well, what about?

319
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Screw Attack.

320
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I think the bottom line of Metroid Red is that if you like Metroid, you're probably going to like Metroid Red.

321
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I probably will.

322
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'll steal it.

323
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's more of what you like about Metroid, basically.

324
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Well, that's good.

325
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But I felt like a lot of the bosses took a lot of inspiration from Mega Man, because most of the bosses are like one-on-one fights with a dude, as opposed to a giant monster or alien.

326
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And there were a lot of mechanics added in this game that felt like Mega Man, like there's a slide move, a Mega Man style slide.

327
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And then there's also like, there's something that's kind of like the dash move from Mega Man X and the air dash.

328
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Those mechanics, they really make the bosses way more enjoyable.

329
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Because you can kind of air dash over the bosses to avoid their attacks and stuff.

330
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Wait, it's on the switch. I don't have a switch. I couldn't even play it if I wanted to. Damn.

331
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You could steal it.

332
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
There are switch emulators.

333
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah, I heard there's an emulator actually that fully plays Metroid Dread, I think.

334
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Really? Seriously?

335
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah, I read that in an article somewhere.

336
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The switch emulator has been around for a while. My brother was like, oh, like he googled it one time and it just came up and it was easy to use to play switch games.

337
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I think there's two major emulators that run Dread. One partially runs it and the other one runs it all the way. I guess it's fully playable, I think.

338
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But I haven't tried it, so I don't actually know from firsthand experience how well it works.

339
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
My hands are clean.

340
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah, my hands are clean because I washed them.

341
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Same.

342
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I should stop. I shouldn't look at Twitter. I shouldn't look at Twitter.

343
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Ben, don't be Twittering right now.

344
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh yeah, that reminds me of something else I wanted to bring up.

345
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So Riley challenged you to like a boxing match or something?

346
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Oh god, we're going to talk about that. Yeah, he said he wanted to punch me or something.

347
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It's kind of funny because at one moment it seemed like you two were working together to conspire against the May break-in story.

348
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah, I don't know.

349
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And now you're like at odds with each other again?

350
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No, it was the other way.

351
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
What did he say?

352
00:31:48,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't know. He posted some shit on a YouTube comment that was like Ben just doesn't like Trixie because he's jealous because he wants her back but we've got her now.

353
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And I'm like, okay, that's wrong. That's a lie. You're lying about me.

354
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And he was upset. He was mad that I said he was lying about me.

355
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And he said I'm going to punch you and he kept posting gifs of people being punched to illustrate what he intended to do to me.

356
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And then the May thing came up and suddenly he's like, he completely switches to and suddenly he's like, oh yeah, you know, Ben, you know, Ben, you know, me and Ben are both just real genuine guys.

357
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You know, we had our differences but you know, it's like, okay.

358
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So you've fallen to a temporary truce?

359
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I didn't. Nobody did. I don't know. That's just what happened. That's just what happened and it's pretty funny.

360
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah, I just rolled with it because I thought it was funny.

361
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That was pretty much the end of the conversation. We exchanged one or two things about how the break-in story sounded kind of fishy.

362
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah, Riley says it's like fake and made up. I don't know if he says it may lie about it.

363
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't know if I trust him but I don't really trust her either so I don't know what to think about it.

364
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh yeah, that's the thing. He's pretty untrustworthy but...

365
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I would say so, you know.

366
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I think so, yeah.

367
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You can't really take anything he says seriously.

368
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's not really.

369
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh yeah, Trixie wrote that sub-stack article this week where she, in so many words, basically says that it's transphobia that I don't like her anymore and that's it.

370
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So that's funny.

371
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That was only a matter of time.

372
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah, pretty shitty thing to do.

373
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Clearly dishonest. Clearly a misrepresentation of it but it's convenient to believe it so I guess it's sure.

374
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Why not?

375
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Why not?

376
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
She gives a list.

377
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
She says, I don't experience transphobia in the real world.

378
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I only experience transphobia in very specific circumstances and then she gives a list of circumstances.

379
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And one of the things on the list is like people, someone that used to be close to me, you know, encouraging my patrons to not be patrons anymore.

380
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
One of the things on the list is Ben St.

381
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You know, I don't experience transphobia in the real world but I do experience it through Ben St.

382
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Through Ben St. specifically?

383
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yes, Ben St. of Boston, America. This is his telephone number.

384
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Ben, you're trying to ruin the careers, the livelihoods of a trans creator.

385
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I mean, what the fuck?

386
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's literally what I'm doing and I don't feel good about it.

387
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's a good point.

388
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I feel heroic for doing so.

389
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Who made me mad? Who made me mad to see that?

390
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I saw a short clip on, it's part of a longer video, but I saw a short part of it where Trixie, somebody asks Trixie what you would have to do in order for her to forgive you.

391
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yes, and she said she would only forgive you if you commit harakiri, is that how you say it?

392
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Harakiri, yes.

393
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,000
She said harakiri but the yigs didn't know what that meant so she amended it to seppuku.

394
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And they knew what that meant?

395
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah.

396
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I think that's more of a well-known term.

397
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I think so, I think so.

398
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
She wants you to commit sodoku.

399
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
That's probably why, it's because of the memeability of seppuku.

400
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh, I remember, I learned the word seppuku from that one kid's show.

401
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's called Mystic Ninja, I think it's called, but it's like the kid's show with the little goofy ninja.

402
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:23,000
One of the bad guys is a guy named seppuku maru who, his whole thing is just that he commits suicide and he cuts his guts open and kills himself.

403
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's a weird thing to be in a kid's show.

404
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It is, but it's true.

405
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Wait, let me show you seppuku maru.

406
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Seppuku maru?

407
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
No, okay.

408
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
If you've never seen this before, I mean it's real.

409
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Wait, I'm in the wrong server.

410
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Make sure your seats are belted.

411
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah, this guy, he's like the evil henchman guy and he's just always like, oh, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna seppuku myself this time.

412
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
He's so confident and cocky looking with his knife dangling.

413
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
This looks really familiar to me.

414
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
He loves disemboweling himself.

415
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's from Goemon.

416
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
He's got a one ton thing around his wrist.

417
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, one ton wrist weight, I didn't even notice that.

418
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah, I think it's called Mystic Ninja in the English dub.

419
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah, Goemon.

420
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
He commits seppuku in 10 times Earth gravity.

421
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's in one of the games because I played all the Goemon games.

422
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I used to be a big fan of the series.

423
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I didn't know there was an anime.

424
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You said this is from an anime?

425
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah, Goemon, wait, Ganbare Goemon is the show, I think?

426
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Was there a video game about this guy?

427
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
If he was a boss, he would win instantly.

428
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I feel like I might have played a Super Nintendo game about the same old Ninja man.

429
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah, he's from one of the Super Nintendo games I think that never came out in the US.

430
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I can't remember which one though.

431
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Hold on, hold on.

432
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
NES game, there's a...

433
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
This game, this fucking game right here.

434
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I remember renting this game from Blockbuster, Blockbuster Video, and thinking it was cool,

435
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
but not really understanding how to play it and progress in it.

436
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Oh, Game Grumps played that, I think.

437
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I think they did, I think they did.

438
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yeah, I played this briefly, I never beat it, but this is one of the early Goemon games.

439
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Okay, well I don't remember Sepakumaru from this game, but he doesn't even look like the same character, barely.

440
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
There were a lot of the Super Nintendo games.

441
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
There's like four or five Super Nintendo Goemon games, most of which did not come out here,

442
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
but I beat them all in the early 2000s when I first discovered Emulation,

443
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and I'm pretty sure he's in one of the games, I think, because he looks really familiar to me.

444
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Well fuck, okay, I typed in Goemon and Google, and I did see the kid, but I first got Ishiwaka Goemon,

445
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
a legendary Japanese outlaw hero who stole gold and other valuables to give to the poor.

446
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
He and his son were boiled alive in public after their failed assassination attempt

447
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
on the Sengoku period warlord Totoyomi Hideyoshi.

448
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
This is a cool guy, he's got a whole Wikipedia.

449
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You mean you don't know about the legend of Goemon?

450
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, Goemon is based on a real person.

451
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't know nothing.

452
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I knew that it was based on a legend or something, I didn't know it was a real person.

453
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's neat, I guess.

454
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
He's like Robin Hood?

455
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I think it's like Japanese Robin Hood.

456
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
The whole live thing reminds me of what happened to spoilers in One Piece.

457
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh, I don't even know what you're talking about.

458
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I think Goemon is based on a real person, but there's probably a lot of myths and legends surrounding him as well.

459
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Of course, I mean, outlaw heroes are cool, everyone has them.

460
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
He's Robin Hood?

461
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah, he said fuck the police.

462
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Goemon says fuck the police.

463
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And he's right to say that.

464
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You do get attacked by cops all the time, you know, from that period, whatever the response.

465
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yes.

466
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
The guards.

467
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Samurai.

468
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
No, I don't think so.

469
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
No, okay.

470
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Right.

471
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yeah, I couldn't beat it.

472
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I didn't understand.

473
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I was too stupid.

474
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I didn't know how video games worked.

475
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You should have played Mystical Ninja for the Super Nintendo and also the N64.

476
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Those were pretty good Goemon games.

477
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Well, I'm sorry.

478
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm sorry, I didn't.

479
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
They didn't call them Goemon.

480
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
When they brought them here, they didn't call them Goemon at first.

481
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
They just called them Mystical Ninja.

482
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Which that title doesn't mean anything.

484
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
No.

485
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Neither does Goemon.

486
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Because he's not even a ninja.

487
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Is he not a ninja?

488
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
He's just a guy, I guess.

489
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah, I suppose so.

490
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
A guy with a sword.

491
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He sort of has a...

492
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I guess, yeah, he's not really a ninja.

493
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
He holds like a pipe.

494
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
He has a fucking pipe that he smokes weed out of, and that's his thing.

495
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
In the games, he uses a pipe as a weapon.

496
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What's even funnier is that he gets a chain pipe later on that he can use as a hookshot or something.

497
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
A what pipe?

498
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
A chain pipe.

499
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
A chain pipe with a chain.

500
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It becomes like a long-range melee weapon in the N64 game.

501
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Dude, like Castlevania, the whip.

502
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah, exactly, it's like a whip.

503
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Is it King of Fighters?

504
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
No, it's Soul Calibur that the IV has the chain sword.

505
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Yeah, there's a chain sword in Dawn of Sorrow, too.

506
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Ah, Bog.

507
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Ah, video game.

508
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Fire Emblem, there's a...

509
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Souls, you get the lightning puppet soul, lightning bolts.

510
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And an axe with a chain on it.

511
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
You make the red minotaur, you make the big axe that goes around the whole screen.

512
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
A chain sword sounds cool, but I don't know if it would be really practical.

513
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It seems kind of pointless.

514
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I feel like...

515
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, they had one in...

516
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What's that video game?

517
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Bloodborne.

518
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So, I guess it would be useful.

519
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You mean the cane sword?

520
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh, right, it was a cane sword.

521
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah, it wasn't a sword, it was a cane.

522
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
No, it would probably not work in real life, I think, in my opinion.

523
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I feel like the Go Amon series is pretty underrated.

524
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
More people should check out those games.

525
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Well, I don't know a damn thing about it, so I guess you're right.

526
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Actually, most of the Super Famicom games have recently been translated,

527
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
so if you are into emulation, you can play them now in English.

528
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
There's like four of them, I think.

529
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Wow.

530
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So, I would recommend that.

531
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
When I beat those games back in the day, there were no translations,

532
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
so I had to beat them in Japanese,

533
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and it definitely hindered the experience a bit,

534
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
because those games do have some funny dialogue.

535
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes, good.

536
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I remember one of the bosses of the Super Nintendo games

537
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
is a guy who's obsessed with sports,

538
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and all the enemies are themed after baseball and stuff.

539
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
An evil athlete by the name of Seppuku Maru

540
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
has been tearing my home apart.

541
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
That's where he's from, actually.

542
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
That's from Super Go Amon 4, I think,

543
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
or, you know, Go Amon 4, whatever it's called.

544
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Sure.

545
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So, that's why I recognize this guy,

546
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
because I beat this game that this screenshot is from...

547
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Excellent.

548
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Whoever is editing this should put this in the episode, this image.

549
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Eleazar.

550
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Yes, that is correct.

551
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Get on it. Get on it.

552
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Cool.

553
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Speaking of Japan, period.

554
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yes!

555
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I've been getting into...

556
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
In order to get away from re-watching Red Letter Media

557
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
for the 70th time in my off hours,

558
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
when I'm just not really... I don't need to do anything.

559
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I've been trying to get some anime into my veins.

560
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Oh, no!

561
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
No, but it's good.

562
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I was recommending Legend of the Galactic Heroes

563
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
to some people yesterday.

564
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah, I think I tried to watch that.

565
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It was boring, though.

566
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh, jeez.

567
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Well, all right.

568
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Maybe it was something else.

569
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
But I watched some classic stuff,

570
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
because, you know, the past is cool.

571
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
All good, you know.

572
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah, a lot of cool stuff happened back then.

573
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah, I can always agree with that.

574
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I saw a fucking Gauche, the cellist, the sealist.

575
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
How do you say celloist?

576
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Cellist.

577
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Cellist. Gauche, the cellist.

578
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
That was pretty cool.

579
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And then Panda Copanda, which I love.

580
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It's a cute little Totoro-esque Miyazaki film, pre-Ghibli.

581
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Oh, yeah.

582
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I saw your drawing.

583
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah, and I note that, because it was so good.

584
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
My art is so incredible and impressive

585
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
that people had no idea that I drew it.

586
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
They thought it was promotional material,

587
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and I feel pretty cool about that.

588
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Everyone was fooled.

589
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, I mean, it did.

590
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It looked like you didn't draw it.

591
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
It was too on-model.

592
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah, I saw that.

593
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That was pretty nice.

594
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah.

595
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Panda Copanda.

596
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
That's a good one.

597
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Hang on, I got a list.

598
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I got a list of stuff.

599
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I watched the Inferno Cop, that was cool.

600
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That was a cool little one.

601
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That sounds cool.

602
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's a web series where it's barely any animation.

603
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Was it a trigger thing?

604
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I can't remember.

605
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I liked it, though.

606
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Hey, anime.

607
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Japanese colloquialism.

608
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It's true, though.

609
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
A couple of years ago,

610
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I watched, for the first time,

611
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I watched Yu Yu Hakushu.

612
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
That's so enormous to watch.

613
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I liked Yu Yu Hakushu as a kid.

614
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I never finished it.

615
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I feel like they never aired the end of it

616
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
on Cartoon Network or wherever I was watching it.

617
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I never saw the end.

618
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It was good, though.

619
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
A good program.

620
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I first found out about it

621
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
because I kind of got into a lot of

622
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
emulation in the early 2000s.

623
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I randomly downloaded

624
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yu Yu Hakushu Super Famicom ROM

625
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
back in the day.

626
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I quickly found out that the game

627
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
was based on

628
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
the original game.

629
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It was based on the original game.

630
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I quickly found out that the game

631
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
was based on

632
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
an anime,

633
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and then I proceeded not to watch the anime

634
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
for a decade,

635
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
but I kept hearing about it

636
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and I kept wondering about it

637
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
and I was really curious.

638
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
One day, I just decided

639
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
a couple of years back, I decided

640
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I want to watch this thing.

641
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I want to see what it's all about.

642
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
When I went into it, I had no idea it was considered good.

643
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
At first,

644
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I thought I made a horrible mistake

645
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
to commit to watching to

646
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
several hundred episodes of

647
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
a new show that maybe

648
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
sucks.

649
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
What was the show?

650
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yu Yu Hakushu.

651
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I didn't know it was good,

652
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
but I remember while I was watching it,

653
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I saw

654
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Trixie

655
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
back when she was

656
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Digibro.

657
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I saw her tweet out

658
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
a recommendation.

659
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I saw her recommend

660
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yu Yu Hakushu.

661
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
She said it was one of the best

662
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
animes or something.

663
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
She liked that one.

664
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
When I saw that,

665
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I felt kind of vindicated.

666
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
When I saw that, I felt kind of vindicated.

667
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I felt like I made a good choice.

668
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
If the anime expert

669
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Digibro thinks it's good,

670
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
then I must have picked well.

671
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I watched the whole thing

672
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and I really liked it.

673
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Her recommendation

674
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
is probably

675
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
one of my favorite shounen

676
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
so far that I've seen.

677
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Her recommendation is what got me to

678
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
watch Ultimate Survivor Kaiji,

679
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
which is so good.

680
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
When people talk about

681
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Squid Game, I can go,

682
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Kaiji did it first.

683
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Kaiji was better, probably. I haven't actually seen Squid Game.

684
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I haven't seen it either.

685
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
When people say it's like Kaiji,

686
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I know what they're talking about.

687
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Because I guess they're both about

688
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
people in death games

689
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
trying to get out of debt.

690
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
The most recent

691
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
anime film.

692
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Well, yeah.

693
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
They were both about society.

694
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
The most recent one I watched

695
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
was The Little Prince and the Eight Headed Dragon.

696
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I've never even heard of that.

697
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's an early Toei,

698
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
really early.

699
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I think it said in the

700
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
credits that Issao Takahata

701
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
was one of the assistant directors.

702
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Who's Takahata?

703
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
What did he do?

704
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Takahata and Miyazaki are the two big guys

705
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
at Ghibli.

706
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Oh, Takahata is probably

707
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
the guy that made this.

708
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
He's probably the guy that made this.

709
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
What's that stupid one?

710
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Only yesterday?

711
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That one that

712
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
kind of sucks.

713
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I don't know actually.

714
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Is the dragon based on

715
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Orochi or whatever it's called?

716
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It is. This Little Prince is

717
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Susano and it's Orochi.

718
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Oh, I played

719
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
the dog game.

720
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I played Okami.

721
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I recognized it's like Nagi and

722
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Nami and Susano.

723
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's like

724
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
really, really well animated.

725
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Really quite western.

726
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It's so early on in anime production

727
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
that they're like still lip-syncing.

728
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
They're lip-syncing to the actual sounds

729
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
that the actors are making

730
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
rather than just opening the mouth flaps.

731
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
This looks really bizarre.

732
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It's really good.

733
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It looks very

734
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
modern?

735
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It doesn't look...

736
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah, it looks like

737
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Samurai Jack. I see there's

738
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
something. Yeah, Samurai Jack

739
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
was inspired heavily.

740
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Samurai Jack was inspired heavily from this.

741
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
This is like a 60's

742
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
anime movie and it's like

743
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
one of the big

744
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
early things that is like super influential

745
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
and I noticed

746
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
that Susano himself

747
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
looks so much

748
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
like Toon Link that

749
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
it can't be a coincidence. This is definitely

750
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
like the inspiration for Toon Link

751
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
and a lot of other little things.

752
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
He really does now that you mentioned it.

753
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Why is he writing

754
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
My Little Pony?

755
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That is

756
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
a cute little freaking horse.

757
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's a flying horse, not a Pegasus.

758
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
No, he just flies.

759
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
He's so cute because instead of

760
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
flapping wings, he just

761
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
kicks his little legs really, really fast

762
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
to move quicker.

763
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm trying to find a cool gif.

764
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
He flies with the power of friendship.

765
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
He flies with the power of

766
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I'm a flying horse.

767
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
He flies with honesty, loyalty,

768
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
laughter,

769
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
friendliness,

770
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
kindness,

771
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
kindness,

772
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
this play, why will it not play?

773
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
No, stick to it in this

774
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
trustworthy, loyal, helpful,

775
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
friendly, courteous, kind of beating, cheerful,

776
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent, I believe.

777
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
How do I get a, I don't know

778
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
how to fucking make a gif be posted

779
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
in a fucking chat. I hate this so much.

780
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Right click it,

781
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
and save it, and then

782
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
click it and drag it.

783
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
This sucks. This sucks so much.

784
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yeah.

785
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Hell yeah, it does.

786
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I want you to see the funny little

787
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
leg kicking.

788
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Well, go to the web page.

789
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You'll see them. Oh, fine.

790
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Okay.

791
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Let's see this little,

792
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
he's just flapping his little legs.

793
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
What?

794
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
This does not look like it was from the

795
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
60s.

796
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Well yeah, this is before anime has

797
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
solidified a look.

798
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's very much like

799
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
copying the western

800
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
animation that is around before that.

801
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It feels a bit like

802
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
like, um,

803
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
oh god, what were they doing

804
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
at this time?

805
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
In Disney and stuff, I'm not sure.

806
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
But it feels familiar with a lot of the

807
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
backgrounds and stuff, but different

808
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
because it's made in Japan.

809
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's cool.

810
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's kind of like how Astro Boy doesn't

811
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
look like a lot of modern anime.

812
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
What was called Astro Boy?

813
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
This looks like

814
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
they were,

815
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
you know,

816
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Astro Boy and all the,

817
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
who's the Astro Boy guy?

818
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
The guy who made every fucking thing?

819
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Osamu Tezuka, I think?

820
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yes, Tezuka.

821
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
The Tezuka, what do you call it,

822
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
ethos, is like,

823
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
cut down

824
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
on everything. Minimize everything.

825
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Cut frames,

826
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
animate on thirds instead of twos.

827
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
This looks like it's the exact opposite.

828
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
They were like, no, we're gonna

829
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
make this

830
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
as hard as possible.

831
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
We're gonna fully animate all the mouths.

832
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
It's gonna be every frame.

833
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It looks like they were like, nah,

834
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
fuck cost saving measures.

835
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
We're going all out and we're gonna make

836
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
a masterpiece was what they were going for

837
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
here.

838
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Doesn't look lazy at all

839
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
because, you know,

840
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
early anime was made

841
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
because

842
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
they made it as cheaply as possible.

843
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
They pumped it out.

844
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah, this is before all that

845
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
bullshit.

846
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
This is that real shit.

847
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Is this before Tezuka?

848
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Uh...

849
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
No.

850
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Let's see.

851
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Osamu Tezuka.

852
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I don't think so because I think

853
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Atomic, I mean,

854
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Astro Boy was one of the first enemies ever

855
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and I think it originally aired in black and white.

856
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Plus, it's TV.

857
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
This is a movie. They used to make movies

858
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
before they were doing TV as an anime thing.

859
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah.

860
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Okay, so Astro Boy,

861
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
the Astro Boy manga was serialized

862
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
from 1952 to

863
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
1968.

864
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So it would have been contemporary

865
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
with Astro Boy and

866
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Tezuka and stuff.

867
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So I guess it was kind of at the same

868
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
time.

869
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Well, since then you had a dragon

870
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
d-d-d-d-d, released in 1963.

871
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So maybe it'll be after.

872
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I don't think the Astro Boy

873
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
anime would have been around, but

874
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
the manga certainly, certainly would have been.

875
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
The Astro Boy...

876
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Okay, the Astro Boy...

877
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yeah, the anime series started

878
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
in the same year, 1963.

879
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Wow.

880
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah.

881
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Everybody's like, everybody's like,

882
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
let's just be animators now, and they all did.

883
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
It premieres...

884
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Why does it say this? Is a Japanese television series

885
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
that premiered on Fuji TV on New

886
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Year's Day, 1963.

887
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
A Tuesday.

888
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I don't know why it mentions that it's a Tuesday,

889
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
okay. It was a Tuesday.

890
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It was a Tuesday in case you were wondering.

891
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Thanks, I was.

892
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Well, at least it wasn't a Monday.

893
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I don't even know...

894
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I hate Monon's days. Anime would never have gotten

895
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
off to... would never have gone

896
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
the places it went if it started on a Monday.

897
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Could you imagine

898
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
a fucking Japanese made

899
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Garfield strip?

900
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It's the same, but Garfield

901
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
just likes, I don't know,

902
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
sushi instead of lasagna.

903
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I bet...

904
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yeah, the Japanese

905
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Garfields.

906
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I bet there are, like,

907
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
some equivalent.

908
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Like, someone in Japan,

909
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
where comics are so popular,

910
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
someone in Japan had to be like,

911
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
wow, Garfield is the most popular fucking thing

912
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
in the universe.

913
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I should just basically make Garfield,

914
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
but...

915
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
but me, but it's me doing it.

916
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I bet someone did it.

917
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's hard to find, because if you type in Japanese

918
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Garfields, you'll get memes upon memes.

919
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You'll never find an actual real thing.

920
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I mean, if you're a manga artist

921
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and you're looking at, like, the landscape,

922
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
you're, like, and you're looking at, like, hmm,

923
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
you know, what is successful in my industry?

924
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You're, like, oh...

925
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Garfields.

926
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
That's, like, the Garfields

927
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
and peanuts. At some point, you must have

928
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
looked at the landscape and been, like, Garfield is dominating.

929
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I have to make my own Garfield.

930
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I have to ride Garfield's coattails.

931
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
That's the only way. Somebody must have done it.

932
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Hmm.

933
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Garfield, uh, why did you eat all my sushi?

934
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Terrible.

935
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Just terrible.

936
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Garfield, let me...

937
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
You better commit seppuku now.

938
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Garfield does not do that.

939
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You better commit hirakiri. I mean seppuku.

940
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Dude, the cat side of the bag now.

941
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Rip off.

942
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Japanese... I'm gonna look at a Japanese Garfield rip off.

943
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Uh...

944
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It turns out it was...

945
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
There was a Japanese Garfield that came out before

946
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
that inspired it.

947
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Inspired Garfield.

948
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Oh, Japanese Garfield leak.

949
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Urusei Yatsura?

950
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Oh.

951
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Urusei Yatsura.

952
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I think it's just a joke because she wears the

953
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
the orange stripes.

954
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Okay, never mind.

955
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
This is a serious deep dive.

956
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I want to find the one Japanese artist

957
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
who is like, oh, Garfield, I could do that.

958
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I have a cat. I could do this.

959
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm not finding it.

960
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I'm not finding it, so maybe it didn't happen.

961
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
No.

962
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
They must have had...

963
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I mean, they had, like, newspaper

964
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
strips, right,

965
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
in...

966
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Not even sure.

967
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Well, they would probably do, like,

968
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
4-coma, right?

969
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Like the vertical. I mean, they probably formatted

970
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
differently, but, like, people made...

971
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Japanese?

972
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Maybe that kind of, like,

973
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
newspaper strip, basically.

974
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah, I guess they would usually do the

975
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
4 panels instead of 3.

976
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I don't know.

977
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah.

978
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
There must have been some

979
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
publication, some magazine or newspaper

980
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
that was like, let's run comic strips

981
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
like an American style.

982
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Let's just kind of do it like that.

983
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Maybe it'll take off.

984
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Maybe it didn't.

985
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I don't know.

986
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
But...

987
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
When I Google

988
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Japanese Garfield Rip-Off, for some reason

989
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I get the real Ghostbusters

990
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
1993 video game.

991
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
That's probably where Garfield

992
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
was ripped off.

993
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It was, like, cat in the game.

994
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Okay, the Japanese version is

995
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
based...

996
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Based on Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse,

997
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
which is part of the Mickey Mouse side

998
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
of Chemco's Crazy Castle series,

999
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
while the European version is based

1000
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
on Jim Davis's Garfield comic strips

1001
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and the animated series Garfield and Friends,

1002
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
what are you talking about?

1003
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
What are you talking about?

1004
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I don't know. That sounds pretty crazy.

1005
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Depending on which version is played,

1006
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
the player controls Mickey Mouse,

1007
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Peter Venkman, or Garfield.

1008
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Okay.

1009
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
What's this?

1010
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
They just made

1011
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
the same game

1012
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
and just they made 3 different versions

1013
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
of it and one of them

1014
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
is Garfield and one of them is

1015
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Peter Venkman from Ghostbusters

1016
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
and one of them is Mickey Mouse.

1017
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Is this Peter Venkman

1018
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
supposed to be, like, the John of this

1019
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
universe? The real Ghostbusters

1020
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
known in Europe as Garfield Labyrinth

1021
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
and in Japan as Mickey Mouse 4

1022
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Maho no Labyrinth.

1023
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I see, so they just rebranded the same game

1024
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
multiple times. Why do they do it?

1025
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Why not just

1026
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
release it the same?

1027
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It must have just been, they made the game. I gotta play this.

1028
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Yeah, we gotta play all three

1029
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
and compare.

1030
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
They must have just made the game and they were like,

1031
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
okay, we've got the Mickey Mouse

1032
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
license for Japan, but

1033
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
we don't have it for America, so

1034
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
we gotta get another license. Okay, we'll

1035
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
put Ghostbusters in it.

1036
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
There's no information here. There's no, like,

1037
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
why did they do this?

1038
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Here's what the gameplay is and here's how people

1039
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
thought about it. This kind of thing has happened

1040
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
before with some of these old

1041
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Japanese games. Sometimes

1042
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
they would get rebranded with different IP

1043
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
characters and stuff.

1044
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Then actually

1045
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
it originally happened

1046
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
with the original

1047
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Donkey Kong.

1048
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
The original Donkey Kong was supposed to be a

1049
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Popeye license game, but they couldn't

1050
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
get the rights, so they

1051
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
just redid all the characters

1052
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
and it was the same game, basically.

1053
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But then later on, they did

1054
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
get the rights to Popeye

1055
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
and they did actually release a Popeye game

1056
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
that nobody nowadays knows about.

1057
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I think they played that

1058
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
on the Game Grumps, right? They played the

1059
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Popeye game on Game Grumps, I'm pretty sure.

1060
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I don't know, but I played it on my

1061
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
channel.

1062
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I'm pretty damn sure that, wait,

1063
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
you played it?

1064
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
When I was young, we had this

1065
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
family computer and there was

1066
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
a Popeye game on it. I don't know

1067
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
whether it was a rip-off of the Popeye

1068
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
game or a strangely emulated version

1069
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
that my parents got given

1070
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
a bunch of, like, here's some games

1071
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
for the kids.

1072
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
There was also a Huckleberry Hound

1073
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
game

1074
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and some other cartoon thing.

1075
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Fascinating.

1076
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
But I feel like I've played the Popeye version

1077
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
of the thing, because you got bladders and the shit.

1078
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Yeah, I played

1079
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
the, you know, let's

1080
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
play, let's pun, whatever

1081
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
you want to call it, of the Popeye game

1082
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
on my channel.

1083
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
It's quite a few years ago now.

1084
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I'm not sure if I saw that one.

1085
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
What a game.

1086
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
What a choice of game.

1087
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
What a world.

1088
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I mostly show

1089
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
it because it was short.

1090
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You know, I know.

1091
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It's the one where you gotta like

1092
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
collect Olive Oil's hearts.

1093
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Like her, she's like extruding hearts

1094
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
and they're floating up and you gotta catch

1095
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
them.

1096
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
You know, the plot is that, you know,

1097
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Bluto, the antagonist, he wants to

1098
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
know which is Popeye's girlfriend and

1099
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
you know, the joke I told in my play

1100
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
through is, you know, Popeye

1101
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
likes his girl, Popeye likes

1102
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
his Olive Oil extra version.

1103
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Oh, god.

1104
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Yeah, true.

1105
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
True, yeah.

1106
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
It's a pretty good line, I think.

1107
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I saw, I saw a,

1108
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I saw a

1109
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
a strip.

1110
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
No, it's Popeye 2. Sorry, I had to interrupt.

1111
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But I found Popeye, it's Popeye 2

1112
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
of the PC.

1113
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I played Popeye 2 of the PC when I was young.

1114
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
This is nostalgia.

1115
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I saw a Popeye strip where like an

1116
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
interviewer is asking Popeye

1117
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
like his opinions on like

1118
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
various political issues of the day

1119
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
and Popeye gives

1120
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
like his, his,

1121
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
he's asking him about like, Popeye,

1122
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
are you a fan of like prohibition

1123
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and stuff and

1124
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I mean, I'm trying to find it.

1125
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And Popeye's response is just,

1126
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
you know, I just eat spinach, man.

1127
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I don't know what to tell you.

1128
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
No, he says, he says,

1129
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
he asks, what do you think about

1130
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
prohibition and he says, I don't like

1131
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
to think about it or something.

1132
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
But that sounds like something he'd say.

1133
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
There was more though.

1134
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
He asked him like a dozen questions about

1135
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
like the various social

1136
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
ills that were plaguing like

1137
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
prohibition era America.

1138
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
He mostly, he mostly doesn't have

1139
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
opinions about them.

1140
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Have you seen that Twitter account

1141
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
that is like official Popeye

1142
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
but Popeye is like super trans positive?

1143
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
No.

1144
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Wait, it's official. I don't know what it's called.

1145
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I think it was official. It's just so like

1146
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Popeye, the official Twitter account

1147
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and it's just sort of like celebrating

1148
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
like, you know, LGBT

1149
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
issues and stuff.

1150
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And people like, oh, based Popeye.

1151
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
No, I like it.

1152
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
It was cool. It was cute. I feel like

1153
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
if you asked Popeye about

1154
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
that sort of thing, you'd be like

1155
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
hey, Popeye, what do you think about

1156
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
transgenderism and he'd be like

1157
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
trans-what-ism?

1158
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
He'd be

1159
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
he'd be funnier

1160
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
about it.

1161
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I am what I am.

1162
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Damn it. I found this.

1163
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
They am what they am.

1164
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I found this

1165
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
cropped version which doesn't have

1166
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
all the questions.

1167
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It only has like half of them.

1168
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
There was more. He asked me about prohibition.

1169
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Do you-do you drink?

1170
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I refuse this to answer on account of

1171
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
it might incrinimate me.

1172
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
What is your religion? Treat everybody right.

1173
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And if they steps on your sockum.

1174
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Yeah, like based.

1175
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Such wisdom. It was like that

1176
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
attitude but for trans rights, it was great.

1177
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Right, right.

1178
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Sockum.

1179
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Rockum. Sockum.

1180
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Robots.

1181
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Paised. Okay, cool.

1182
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Popeye is a

1183
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
he always taught the kids to eat spinach

1184
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
and spinach is pretty good for you.

1185
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Yeah.

1186
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I-I-I...

1187
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Damn it. I just thought it was interesting

1188
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
to see them being like

1189
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
hey, Popeye.

1190
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
It's the past.

1191
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
We are in the good old days

1192
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
but our society has problems.

1193
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
What do you-what do you think about them?

1194
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Popeye, what's your opinion

1195
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
on cancel culture?

1196
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
What's your take on

1197
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
what's your take on

1198
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
the abortion bill that they just passed

1199
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
in Texas, Popeye? Please, we need

1200
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
to know.

1201
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
That would be a great

1202
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
political comic.

1203
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
That's what this would have been

1204
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
if this was made like today.

1205
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Instead of asking about prohibition.

1206
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Oh, wait.

1207
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
This is...

1208
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
You know, I used to strangely be a big fan

1209
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
of the Popeye black and white cartoons

1210
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
when I was a kid.

1211
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Look at him.

1212
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Look at him.

1213
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah, I'm disgusted.

1214
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Yeah, I'm disgusted. Great.

1215
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That's an all-timeer.

1216
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
That's like constipated

1217
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
but more disgusting.

1218
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Yes.

1219
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I'm disgusted and also constipated.

1220
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I hope so.

1221
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
What were we talking about?

1222
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Yeah, I was a fan of the old

1223
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
black and white Popeye cartoons

1224
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
mostly because I really liked the animation.

1225
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Sure.

1226
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
It was...

1227
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I think they made it in like the 1940s

1228
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
or 1930s or something.

1229
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It was a long time ago.

1230
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Before television.

1231
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And I was just really impressed

1232
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
with how well animated it was.

1233
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I guess they would have shown

1234
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
in like movie theaters, right?

1235
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Yeah, I read they used to show them

1236
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
in movie theaters before a movie

1237
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
either before or after a movie.

1238
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1239
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
The...

1240
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Yeah, the television like changed

1241
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
the format.

1242
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yeah, everything was either like a short,

1243
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
like an animated short,

1244
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
or like a feature-length film.

1245
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And then...

1246
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
That's Disney...

1247
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah, because like when Disney started,

1248
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
it was, yeah, it was pre-television,

1249
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
so they made movies because it's the only thing

1250
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
you could see animation in.

1251
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You'd see a feature length.

1252
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Yeah, the very first Disney...

1253
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Well, you would go to the theater

1254
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and there would be like a little short played

1255
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
like a live action movie.

1256
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
You would have the cartoons.

1257
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah, I think the very first Disney

1258
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
animated short was

1259
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Steamboat Willie.

1260
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And I think it came out in 1928.

1261
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Damn, Mickey Mouse is so old,

1262
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
he'd be dead if he was a real mouse.

1263
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Well, I sure wish

1264
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
he would enter the public domain by now,

1265
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
you know.

1266
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yeah, everyone's gagging

1267
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
to draw Mickey Mouse.

1268
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I can't do it.

1269
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
You know, those old Popeye cartoons

1270
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
were really... they had really impressive

1271
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
animation, even by today's standards.

1272
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Like, I saw somebody

1273
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
comparing the animation of one

1274
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
of the Popeye fight scenes

1275
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
to like a Dragon Ball Z

1276
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
fight scene.

1277
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And the Popeye scene actually looked better

1278
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
than the average Dragon Ball fight scene.

1279
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It's because they had...

1280
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Well, they're more animated.

1281
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
They animated on ones

1282
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
because the idea

1283
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
of saving money and time

1284
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
to make it

1285
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
so that you could animate on twos

1286
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and have less drawings

1287
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
would make it cheaper.

1288
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
But animation

1289
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
it was a high-skill, high-paid

1290
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
like luxury sort of industry

1291
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
initially.

1292
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
You only had so many of them working on it.

1293
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
And then since it became so popular

1294
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
it was like, oh, we got to mass-produce this stuff.

1295
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
We got to make it cheaper.

1296
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
And thus, Dragon Ball Z

1297
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
was one to the other.

1298
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Yeah, I was in a...

1299
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
When they syndicated the Popeye cartoon,

1300
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
they made it a lot more cheaply

1301
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
and it was a lot, you know, not as well animated.

1302
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I think this happened around the 60s and 70s.

1303
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And I didn't enjoy those

1304
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Popeye cartoons as much because

1305
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I just appreciated

1306
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
the better animation of the shorts

1307
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
they used to do in the past.

1308
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
By the way,

1309
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
this image here

1310
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
that I posted, I think

1311
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
this was blowing up on Twitter.

1312
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Somebody was saying, oh, based on non-binary Popeye

1313
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
because he's wearing women's clothes

1314
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
and he's like...

1315
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I promise you, I won't be mad at me

1316
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
for wearing something.

1317
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Of course, I won't be mad at my little wifey.

1318
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
What is it? I am amphibious.

1319
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Amphibious.

1320
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I wears both women's and man's clothes.

1321
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Arf, arf, I am Popeye.

1322
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
What the fuck is he talking about?

1323
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I don't know, this kind of confuses me.

1324
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I am old.

1325
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's just sort of like a funny like,

1326
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
oh, Popeye wearing both men and women clothes

1327
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
and then it's like, oh, non-binary icon Popeye.

1328
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I think it was like a joke.

1329
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
But then Popeye, the official account got in on it.

1330
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I agree.

1331
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
And then it started all that stuff.

1332
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I don't know if this was meant to be.

1333
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Why does he bark?

1334
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
After coming out is amphibious.

1335
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
He barks.

1336
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Yeah, you would think he would croak.

1337
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Yeah, definitely.

1338
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Popeye is definitely pretty cool.

1339
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
He should be in Spanish, actually.

1340
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I have no idea.

1341
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Why is he married to this

1342
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
surly strong man?

1343
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Probably for some reason.

1344
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I'm not familiar with this.

1345
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
One assumes it is for some reason.

1346
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I was going to say something else

1347
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
but I didn't think of it.

1348
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It's not for no reason.

1349
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
When you're right, you're right.

1350
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Okay, okay.

1351
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Dude, segue.

1352
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Quick, somebody segue.

1353
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I have a segue.

1354
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's from Popeye the Sailor, comic strip.

1355
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Clarissa Gunn-Spoke, comic strip.

1356
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Oh, right.

1357
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I finally read it.

1358
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
What do you think?

1359
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Well, I don't think it's

1360
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
much of a spoiler.

1361
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I'm very

1362
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
interested in

1363
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
what's going on

1364
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
with the temple

1365
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
and that dude's hat.

1366
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Something is up

1367
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
and I want to know what's up

1368
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
with that.

1369
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And that's where

1370
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm at with Clarissa.

1371
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Yeah.

1372
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Something's up and I assume

1373
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
one day I will learn

1374
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
what's up.

1375
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I'll string it along for like 50 years

1376
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
and then I'll tell you.

1377
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It's like, hey, buy my new comic

1378
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
and then you'll find out next time.

1379
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Never happens.

1380
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Ooh, that's how they get you.

1381
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Do the Dragon Ball Z thing

1382
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
where Goku trains in the

1383
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
chamber for like 50 episodes

1384
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
and every episode is like

1385
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
next time on Dragon Ball Z

1386
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
maybe something will actually happen.

1387
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
This planet will explode

1388
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
in five minutes.

1389
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
14 episodes later.

1390
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It finally blows up.

1391
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Yeah.

1392
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yes, it was cool.

1393
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Are you making more?

1394
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
When do I get to the end?

1395
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I will...

1396
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So I had written the end.

1397
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I want to go over it

1398
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
and like see if I can

1399
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
write it better because it's probably...

1400
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
First draft is always

1401
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
worse draft.

1402
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
You can always improve little bits here and there.

1403
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
So I want to go over it.

1404
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I anticipate

1405
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
that very soon I will be

1406
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
busy with Lord of Ghost kickstarter stuff

1407
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
because the plushes have arrived

1408
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
and they're sitting in a box.

1409
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I didn't want to take them out

1410
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
just yet, just in case

1411
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I don't know

1412
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
they get damaged

1413
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
from being exposed to the air

1414
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
or whatever.

1415
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Yeah, they crumble to dust.

1416
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Yeah, they're very fragile.

1417
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
So they're just sitting in a box

1418
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and I've got the pins

1419
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
and the rest of the artists

1420
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
are drawing a lot of ghost stories.

1421
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I have drawn eight pages.

1422
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I have one page left to go.

1423
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
One page left and then I can tell everyone else

1424
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Ben's Saint was faster than you

1425
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
and it's truly embarrassing.

1426
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I'm never faster than anyone.

1427
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
There's nothing more shameful

1428
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
than Ben's Saint being faster than you.

1429
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
It is, because not only am I slow

1430
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
but also mine was the longest

1431
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
by far.

1432
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But I did it, so

1433
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I haven't finished it yet, but soon.

1434
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I hope that shames them

1435
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
into action.

1436
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So all of that is going to be

1437
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
a lot of work.

1438
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
But I will be

1439
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
there at the ending of the Chorissa

1440
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
and then sketching out a bunch of it.

1441
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Probably not

1442
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
going to show anyone.

1443
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I was thinking of streaming it, but I'm not sure.

1444
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I feel like

1445
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I initially did those streams

1446
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
last year because like,

1447
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
oh shit, I'm so bad at working.

1448
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I need eyes on me to force

1449
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
me to work and that was the stream.

1450
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
But for this

1451
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
finishing

1452
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
of the comic and posting it,

1453
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I didn't stream it and I managed to work anyway.

1454
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
So I was like, you know what, I don't

1455
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
need to do that. It's fun, but

1456
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I don't need to. I'll do it if I really

1457
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
feel like making an event of it.

1458
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I've always been kind of conflicted.

1459
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I'd like to keep it more like secret.

1460
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I've always been conflicted about

1461
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
the idea of streaming a comic

1462
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
that you're drawing because

1463
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
on one hand it seems like

1464
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
a lot of fun, but on the other hand it kind of spoils

1465
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
the story and stuff.

1466
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
So I would

1467
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I would

1468
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I'll do it in secret

1469
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
and maybe

1470
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I'll stream other things. I'll stream

1471
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
the beating Mario 2

1472
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
or something, eventually. I'll get around to it.

1473
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I know the game is tough and you have been

1474
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
anticipating that.

1475
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I've been waiting for that

1476
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
momentous occasion

1477
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
when you finally beat Mario 2.

1478
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I'll be so much of a gamer

1479
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
to have beaten two Mario games

1480
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
to have beaten two Mario games.

1481
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
They'll make you

1482
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
two points above

1483
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
then Saint as a gamer.

1484
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I had all

1485
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
the old NES Mario games

1486
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
as a kid and I never beat

1487
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
any of them because I was

1488
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
a child and too stupid

1489
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
too stupid to beat the game.

1490
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That's absolutely

1491
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
shameful. I know!

1492
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
You had the real deal

1493
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
and you didn't even really do it.

1494
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
No. I couldn't.

1495
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I tried.

1496
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Game's hard.

1497
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I assume I could probably do it

1498
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
now. Probably I could

1499
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
beat Mario now

1500
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
if I wanted to. I just don't want to

1501
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
is all.

1502
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Well now I wish I had

1503
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
so I wouldn't be made fun of

1504
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
but it's too late.

1505
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
It's the only reason you would play a game

1506
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
so you can make fun of people who didn't play it.

1507
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yes.

1508
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I want to be the one making fun

1509
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
of others. I don't want to be on the receiving end.

1510
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I want to be dishing it, not taking it

1511
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
if you know what I'm saying.

1512
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Yeah, just like how

1513
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
you never beat Final Fantasy

1514
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Tactics either.

1515
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
No, I got stuck in the fucking

1516
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Y-Graph Castle or whatever.

1517
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Yeah. Stupid. And it's like one of

1518
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
your favorite games too.

1519
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I don't know if I would

1520
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
say it. I mean I like it a lot.

1521
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I don't know if I would say it was one of them.

1522
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yeah. For a time it was.

1523
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
The

1524
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Tactical RPG was my favorite genre

1525
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
for when I was like

1526
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
in high school. I love that shit.

1527
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I do admit though

1528
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
that game is pretty complicated for a child

1529
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
to beat.

1530
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah.

1531
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I'm not exactly sure how I beat it as a child

1532
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
but somehow I did.

1533
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I watched a speed run

1534
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
of Vanguard Bandits the other

1535
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
day.

1536
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
The speedrunner

1537
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
sometimes

1538
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
sometimes the

1539
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
speedrunner

1540
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
is annoying.

1541
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
The speedrunner

1542
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
was very like reddit

1543
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
core.

1544
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Her jokes were very reddit core and it made me go

1545
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
ugh god.

1546
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Stop.

1547
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
At least there weren't bad puns

1548
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
being made constantly.

1549
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Ugh.

1550
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
No.

1551
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
That would be the absolute worst.

1552
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Yeah. I can't imagine watching a

1553
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
let's play it like that.

1554
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Imagine doing a speedrun

1555
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
making puns like lightning

1556
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
speed

1557
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
like perfectly executing everything but still

1558
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
having time to say the puns.

1559
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
That'd be impressive.

1560
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
If you run the game

1561
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
enough you probably have

1562
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
you probably have a bunch of like jokes

1563
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
and gaffes and goose that you've

1564
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
thought up and probably said on stream

1565
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
before.

1566
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
For your big

1567
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
games done quick

1568
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
debut

1569
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
you bust all those out

1570
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
in a row. One after the other.

1571
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
You lightning, you machine gun them out

1572
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
for comedy

1573
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
because you have your whole repertoire

1574
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
to work with.

1575
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Then you can pull out all those

1576
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
reddit jokes

1577
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
to impress everyone.

1578
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Yeah.

1579
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Some gamers, man.

1580
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Some gamers are just

1581
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I'm trying to remember what specifically

1582
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
was so reddit core about that one.

1583
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I don't know. They were just

1584
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
very like

1585
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
laughing a lot about like

1586
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
dumb jokes.

1587
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
References to something.

1588
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
No. They were like

1589
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
they thought it was really like

1590
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
funny that like the game

1591
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
had like crude humor

1592
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
and like fart jokes in it

1593
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and like she thought she

1594
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
made a joke about that as though it was

1595
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
like a very embarrassing

1596
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
thing and how it was so silly that the game

1597
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
had politics but also

1598
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
crude

1599
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
jokes in it.

1600
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I don't know.

1601
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Could you believe it?

1602
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
The goal of this video game.

1603
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I didn't know that game had

1604
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
crude humor in it.

1605
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I mean it's got a little bit but

1606
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
like oh and there's a character

1607
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
who's like a ninja

1608
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
she's like a ninja made mech

1609
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
pilot and the speedrunner was just

1610
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
like can you believe this character

1611
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
yes you heard that right. A ninja

1612
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
made mech

1613
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
pilot and she's our waifu

1614
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
now. It's like oh god

1615
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
please spare me.

1616
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Please spare me.

1617
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Spare me. No.

1618
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So many things combined.

1619
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
That game sounds pretty cool now.

1620
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
It is it actually is

1621
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
a very cool game. I remember

1622
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
it was one of my it was like my favorite game

1623
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
in in high school or

1624
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
something like we're in like eighth grade or whatever

1625
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
and I

1626
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
rented it and I really liked it so I went

1627
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
to go buy it. I went to GameStop and I like

1628
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
asked the guy at GameStop like hey do you have

1629
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Vanguard bands and he's like yeah

1630
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I don't really like that game very much but we got

1631
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
it. I was like okay

1632
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
cool thanks for making me feel good about my

1633
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
purchase but it seems kind of

1634
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
unnecessary. Yeah

1635
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
why do you gotta judge me for it?

1636
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It reminds me of a reflexive

1637
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
game review. It's a

1638
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Final Fantasy Tactics tactical RPG

1639
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
but you put your guys in

1640
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
yeah you're in mech sort of like Front

1641
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Mission 3

1642
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and when you do an attack

1643
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
you like choose like how you want to respond

1644
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
to it and then it plays a little like 3D

1645
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
it has a cool like full 3D

1646
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
where like the two robot models will like

1647
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
you know counter attack each other and stuff

1648
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
it rules it rules.

1649
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Yeah I think you mentioned this

1650
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
on on here before and I was

1651
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I probably was there for that because

1652
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
it's so anime

1653
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I do remember this now. So fucking anime

1654
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I'll probably check it out eventually

1655
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
you know I have a kind of a big

1656
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
backlog of old games

1657
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
that I play. Sure.

1658
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I think it's pretty neat

1659
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
it's got multiple routes

1660
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
do you like

1661
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
depending on like your characters

1662
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
like relationships with each other

1663
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
you know you'll end up

1664
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
supporting like one

1665
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
like a different regimes

1666
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
like which country do you want to support in the war

1667
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
basically?

1668
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Which team of people do you ally yourself with?

1669
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
That was also the case of Front Mission 3

1670
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I believe

1671
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
but Front Mission 3

1672
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
was kind of based on

1673
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
real world

1674
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
it kind of had like a futuristic real world setting

1675
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
you know we'd use

1676
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
actual countries and stuff

1677
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Vanguard Bandits is as anime

1678
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
as it gets it's super

1679
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
fantastical there's like an evil

1680
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
mech that like runs on the blood of the innocent

1681
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
that like the bad guy pilots

1682
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
That kind of sounds

1683
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
full metal alchemist to me

1684
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
for some reason.

1685
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
It's very

1686
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I don't even know it's very

1687
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
it's very 90s fantasy shown in

1688
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
cool

1689
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
it's cool I like it

1690
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
but I remember

1691
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I played in Beat Front

1692
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Mission 1 a while back

1693
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
that one never came out

1694
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
you know out of the US

1695
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
officially but it has like

1696
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
a translation patch

1697
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
although I think it got officially released

1698
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
on the DS in English

1699
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
in the US but

1700
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I played the Super Nintendo version but

1701
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
anyways what I liked about that game

1702
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
that's kind of funny and the story is that

1703
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
in the beginning you are a soldier and you work

1704
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
for you know what's

1705
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
the equivalent of like the United States

1706
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
government or whatever

1707
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
but it has a different name in the game

1708
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
because it takes place in the future

1709
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
and yeah

1710
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
so eventually the government

1711
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
you find out the government's evil and they're doing evil

1712
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
experiments and

1713
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
you defect

1714
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
from the military and you become a fugitive

1715
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
but then you like

1716
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
you join

1717
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
the opposite side

1718
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
you join the enemy of the government you were working for

1719
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
and then you fight

1720
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
the government you were working for

1721
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
so I guess you know

1722
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
if you look at it in a real world setting

1723
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
it's like you work for the US

1724
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
you find out the US is evil

1725
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
then you defect and you join I don't know

1726
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
their enemy Russia

1727
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
but then the thing is you find out

1728
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
the KGB

1729
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
then you find out that this other government

1730
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
is also evil

1731
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
oh no who would have thought

1732
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
so then you just

1733
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
wind up at the end of the game

1734
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
a world wide fugitive

1735
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
all the governments hate you

1736
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
because all of them are evil

1737
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
and I don't know

1738
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I thought it was kind of funny

1739
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
um

1740
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
that's front mission one

1741
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I think it's either front mission one

1742
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
or front mission three I kind of forget

1743
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
now because they both have really similar plots

1744
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
uh

1745
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
uh the um

1746
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
yeah I played

1747
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
front mission three for the playstation

1748
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
and

1749
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I think yeah it's a tactical

1750
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
role playing game grid based

1751
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
fantasy tactics style thing but like

1752
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
okay I was hunting

1753
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I might have mentioned this before I was hunting for music

1754
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
to steal

1755
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
from a video game to put in phantom's revenge

1756
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
uh

1757
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
and I settled the music that I ended up picking

1758
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
that I thought was the most suited for the game

1759
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
was the music from front mission

1760
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
gun hazard

1761
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
which I assumed is like

1762
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
yeah I assumed it was it would be

1763
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
like the same tactical RPG but no apparently

1764
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
all the other front mission games

1765
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
are tactical RPGs but front mission

1766
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
gun hazard is like a side scrolling like

1767
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
action shooter for some reason

1768
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I think I told you about uh gun hazard

1769
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
one of the last times I was on

1770
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
is that how you found out about it

1771
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
no I think

1772
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I mentioned it last I had been I had been

1773
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
like searching through

1774
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
like games with like

1775
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
people saying like what games had good

1776
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
music I think I had found it

1777
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
uh myself

1778
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
somewhere I had I had been going through

1779
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
lots of like like uh

1780
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
youtube videos that have like uh uh you know

1781
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
video game soundtracks in them

1782
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
because I published

1783
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
this actually I published a review

1784
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
of gun hazard on my website back

1785
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
in uh I don't remember when

1786
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
it was like quite a while though

1787
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I was yeah I looked at because I was interested

1788
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I looked it up gameplay and I was like oh wow

1789
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
no it's it's just they they made

1790
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
one game in the series

1791
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
just a completely different kind of game

1792
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
for some reason yeah I did mention

1793
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
it uh one of the times I was on

1794
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
on here uh it's actually

1795
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
probably my favorite

1796
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
uh front mission game

1797
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
because I'm a big fan of uh

1798
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
side scrollers

1799
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
and it has a pretty interesting story

1800
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
you know also

1801
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
yeah it looks cool I kind of wanted to

1802
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
play it

1803
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
if you can even if you can believe that

1804
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
uh if

1805
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
sorry that blows your mind yeah

1806
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
well I certainly would recommend

1807
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
it it is uh

1808
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
you know this is the review that I

1809
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
published in 2007

1810
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
oh there it is

1811
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
which is when I first uh discovered

1812
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
and played this game

1813
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
yeah I think it was yeah you are the one

1814
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
that told me that it was a side scroller

1815
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
and I was shocked I was like what the why is it

1816
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
a side scroller

1817
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
yeah I seem to remember telling you about it

1818
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
um yeah that's right

1819
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I almost I forgot

1820
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
uh yeah yeah because this is

1821
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
this is a pretty obscure game that pretty much

1822
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
nobody knows about

1823
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I feel like I'm the only person

1824
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
that knows about this game and knows that it's

1825
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
good and I'm the only one that recommends it

1826
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
to people

1827
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
that's why I thought it was the perfect game to

1828
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
steal music from because nobody will have played

1829
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
it and nobody will be like oh this is that song

1830
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
from that other game

1831
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
yeah pretty much

1832
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
you know when it comes to obscure older

1833
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
games I'm kind of an expert

1834
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
on that so

1835
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
if you ever need advice

1836
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
on good music to steal from older

1837
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
games have a

1838
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
pretty huge list of obscure stuff

1839
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I think you you I think

1840
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
you also recommended Mystic Arc

1841
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
yeah I did I also

1842
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
have a review for that

1843
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I looked that one up and I

1844
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
thought the music was cool but it was too like

1845
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
fantasy I like I like that gun hazard

1846
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
had like had like a sci-fi

1847
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
kind of vibe to it

1848
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
it was more like yeah yeah

1849
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
well you know gun hazard is

1850
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
a game about giant mechs so

1851
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I know I know

1852
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
so it's definitely

1853
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
gonna have more sci-fi

1854
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
to it I um yeah

1855
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
yeah

1856
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
damn imagine reviewing video games

1857
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
yeah the Mystic Arc review

1858
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I published in 2014

1859
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
hmm

1860
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I think I think

1861
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
2014 was when Mystic Arc was

1862
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
first unofficially translated

1863
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
because there is no official translation

1864
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
for that one

1865
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
I see

1866
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I

1867
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
okay obviously I can't

1868
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
read these right now LeMau

1869
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
um

1870
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
you know by the way uh did you watch

1871
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
that video that I sent you

1872
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
a while back

1873
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
which one

1874
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
the Astros Playroom video

1875
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
review that I did

1876
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
yes I did I did watch the Astros Playroom

1877
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
video

1878
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
oh the little jumpity jump

1879
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
3D

1880
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
video was that

1881
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
what did you think about that video

1882
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
gave me a little chuckle

1883
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
gave me a little chuckle

1884
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
yeah

1885
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
you should link it you should put link

1886
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
there

1887
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
put it in the description

1888
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
gave me a little chuckle

1889
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
it was like a

1890
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
a different

1891
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
sort of comedy almost

1892
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
what's the word

1893
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
non sequitur but not exactly

1894
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
it's just sort of

1895
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
yeah a little wacky

1896
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
a little wacky

1897
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
there it is

1898
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
yeah it was a

1899
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
bit of an experiment on my part

1900
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
a lot of

1901
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
it was my first time

1902
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
trying to edit 4k footage

1903
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
which was awful

1904
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
really

1905
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
my editing software did not like that at all

1906
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
yeah

1907
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
it kept crashing

1908
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and

1909
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
you know first time doing a modern game

1910
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
first time doing your video review

1911
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
it's kind of weird

1912
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
because I've been doing traditional text reviews

1913
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
for like 10

1914
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
15 years

1915
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
but this is the first time I ever did a video

1916
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
review

1917
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I mean I feel like

1918
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I feel like that's where the eyes are

1919
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
that's where the eyes they're on youtube

1920
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
though you're more likely to get

1921
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
your review seen if it's a video

1922
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
essay than if it's just a written

1923
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
written one

1924
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
how easy do you think it would be

1925
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
get all of your text reviews

1926
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
and just say

1927
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
what the text was

1928
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
and then have game footage

1929
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
and then make like a million reviews

1930
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
like that videos

1931
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
well honestly

1932
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I don't think it would be too hard

1933
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I have over 500 of them so I could do that

1934
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
for quite a while

1935
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
oh my god that's content

1936
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
think of the content

1937
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
think of the amount of watch time

1938
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
you could accrue if people be like

1939
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
well I think

1940
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
they type in obscure game into youtube

1941
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
you gotta mind your paths for content

1942
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
you already created

1943
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
you already done most of the work

1944
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
yeah that's true the writing

1945
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
is kind of the hardest part

1946
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
at this point the only time consuming thing

1947
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I think for that would be

1948
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
to just capture the gameplay footage

1949
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
you know that could take some time

1950
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
yeah

1951
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
depends on the game

1952
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
could you steal it

1953
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
you could take a long play footage

1954
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I mean I've done that before

1955
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
it's like you credit the long play

1956
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
where you get it from

1957
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
but you have to provide credit for that though right

1958
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
yeah just say where you got it

1959
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
yeah

1960
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I don't know I have this kind of weird thing

1961
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
where I hate using other people's work

1962
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
you know

1963
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
the way I see it though

1964
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
is like if it's a long play

1965
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
it's just footage of a game

1966
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
it's not like they made the game

1967
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
they're just recording the game

1968
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
that they're playing

1969
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
that's a good point

1970
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
it's more of a service than anything

1971
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
it's not really there like intellectual

1972
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
property if it's just footage of the game

1973
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
in my opinion

1974
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
is that cheap

1975
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I don't think so

1976
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I suppose it's just a weird

1977
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
mental thing I have where I feel like

1978
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I have to do everything by my own hand

1979
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
including capturing the gameplay footage

1980
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
you didn't develop the game did you

1981
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I mean

1982
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
but the footage

1983
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
the footage will be identical

1984
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
if you capture it yourself

1985
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
or if you use someone else

1986
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
capturing the game right

1987
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
yeah I know it's just a stupid mental thing

1988
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I have you know where I feel

1989
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I just feel psychologically

1990
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I want to be able to take full credit

1991
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
for everything that's here

1992
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
without giving anyone else credit

1993
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I am stealing music

1994
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
from front mission gun hazard

1995
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
and I don't feel bad about it

1996
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
in the slightest

1997
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I'm taking it it's mine now

1998
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I feel like

1999
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
you can extrapolate

2000
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
that idea into like

2001
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
well you didn't make the game

2002
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
you didn't make the music

2003
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
you're using in the background if you're using music

2004
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
right

2005
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
it's like

2006
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I don't think capturing

2007
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
the gameplay is a line

2008
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
that is

2009
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
as arbitrary as any other I feel

2010
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
yeah I know it's a pretty stupid thing

2011
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I'm just being dumb about it

2012
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
you gotta be smart

2013
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
we're gonna kick your ass

2014
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
we're gonna kick your ass chrono

2015
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
this is bullshit

2016
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
in 2003

2017
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
in 2003 some guy

2018
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
made a banner from my website

2019
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
and I did use it briefly but then eventually

2020
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I got rid of it because I just

2021
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
didn't want to use anything

2022
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
like anyone else

2023
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
really?

2024
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
even though he made it for you

2025
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
he made it for free

2026
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
so I was just like

2027
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
okay that's cool

2028
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
yeah

2029
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
it was my hole

2030
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
it was made for me

2031
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I just felt bad

2032
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I wanted everything to be made

2033
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
by myself

2034
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I guess you can say it's a sigma male

2035
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
mentality

2036
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
definitely I would definitely call

2037
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
it a sigma male mentality

2038
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
very sigma trait

2039
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I made my own banner

2040
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
which was way worse than his

2041
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
and I used that instead

2042
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I mean

2043
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
alright

2044
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I still have this banner actually

2045
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
what if I

2046
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I'm gonna make you a banner

2047
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
just to torture you

2048
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
you won't be able to use it

2049
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
yeah I don't know if I'll allow myself

2050
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
to use it though

2051
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
yeah

2052
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
my

2053
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
my neck is really sore

2054
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I'm moving my head around and it sucks

2055
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
my neck hurts and I think the reason why

2056
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
is because I was walking yesterday

2057
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I walked out I took a shower

2058
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
and then I walked outside

2059
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
and I thought I had some water in my ear

2060
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I thought I got some water stuck in my ear

2061
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
so I did the thing where I like

2062
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
shook my head right you shake your head

2063
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
like shake the water to come out the ear

2064
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
like I jumped on one foot and I like

2065
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
jerked my head like get the water out

2066
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I didn't work

2067
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I don't think I actually had water in my ear

2068
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
or if I did it was so little that like

2069
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
it evaporated and it didn't matter

2070
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
but yeah jerk in my head like that

2071
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
fuck my neck up and

2072
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
it hurts now

2073
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
and also I'm hungover

2074
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
when I have water in my ear I always do the thing

2075
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
where you put you

2076
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
press your palm up against your ear

2077
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
and like suction it

2078
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I've done that

2079
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I've never tried

2080
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
you know that episode of Seinfeld

2081
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
where Kramer's got water in his ear

2082
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
and he like he keeps jerking his head

2083
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
and he like jumps up and down

2084
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Kramer doing that

2085
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
well that's what I

2086
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I've never tried the hand suction thing

2087
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
does that work?

2088
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
well it's like a plunger

2089
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
as long as the seal

2090
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
the air is airtight

2091
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
well yeah I mean

2092
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
no but I do it anyway

2093
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
it works because I learned it

2094
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
when I was like in the swimming pool

2095
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I got water in my ear and I did that

2096
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
and it's like and it's out

2097
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
it's like oh cool

2098
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
now I do that

2099
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
for me sometimes it works

2100
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
but actually I have now a

2101
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
kind of a thing

2102
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
a doohickey view

2103
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
you want to call it

2104
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
it's kind of like

2105
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I don't know what to call it

2106
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
it's like a weird suction thing

2107
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
that you can put in your ear to suck out

2108
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
earwax

2109
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
it's just a rubber

2110
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
rubber ball like thing

2111
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
with a tip at the end

2112
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I've seen those

2113
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
do those work?

2114
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
they can work if your earwax

2115
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
is like movable

2116
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
it would suck some of it out

2117
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
and I think

2118
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
maybe that could also work for water

2119
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
if you have any water in your ears

2120
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
yeah maybe

2121
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I've heard that like

2122
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
sticking things in your ear

2123
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
regardless of

2124
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
like Q-tips and all that

2125
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
it's a bad thing to do because you'll just push

2126
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
the wax further in

2127
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
the thing you gotta do

2128
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
is you gotta get some

2129
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
some olive oil

2130
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
and I don't know

2131
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
why this works but there's like

2132
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
medical grade olive oil

2133
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
ex-super virgin

2134
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I don't know what's the difference

2135
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
but you drop like a few droplets of olive oil

2136
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
in your ear and you lie down

2137
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
and you let it go in there

2138
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
and the olive oil

2139
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
softens all of the earwax

2140
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
and then you tip your head and it just all falls out

2141
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
gross

2142
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I know it's gross

2143
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I'm gonna puke just thinking about it

2144
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
but it feels like oh good

2145
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
it's gone

2146
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
yeah cause I had a really bad blockage one time

2147
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
where I couldn't hear like

2148
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
certain frequencies in my left ear

2149
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
oh dear god

2150
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I couldn't hear like low notes so I was like oh this is fucking with me

2151
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
cause my other ear could hear low notes

2152
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
that sounds awful

2153
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
so I needed to get that sorted out

2154
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
and it just softens up the wax

2155
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
so that it falls out

2156
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
if you try to scrape it out you'll just push it further in

2157
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
it'll be worse

2158
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
we're here in the USA

2159
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
we have special

2160
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
liquids you can buy at the store

2161
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
over the counter

2162
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
pharmacy stuff

2163
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
instead of olive oil

2164
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
special American liquids

2165
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
American like freedom liquid

2166
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
yeah maybe olive oil works

2167
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
just as well as that

2168
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
pharmacy stuff

2169
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I'm just imagining the feeling of like tilting your head

2170
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
and letting it just drip inside your ear

2171
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
it sounds like a nightmare

2172
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
it's strangely like good

2173
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
cause it doesn't go like

2174
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I don't know it doesn't penetrate

2175
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
it's just sort of like

2176
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
doesn't break the rain barrier

2177
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
no it's just sort of like

2178
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
the over the counter stuff I'm talking about

2179
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
like when there's a bit of water in your ear

2180
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
when the shower, when there's water covering it

2181
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
it's like

2182
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
it makes that sort of feeling

2183
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
the over counter stuff I'm talking about

2184
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
is like ear drops that softens

2185
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
the ear wax so I don't know I guess it's similar to

2186
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
olive oil

2187
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I have heard of

2188
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
stuff like that and also

2189
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
ear foam that you put in your ear

2190
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
that foams up

2191
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I don't understand

2192
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
thinking about putting stuff in my ear

2193
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
it's giving me the fear

2194
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
it's giving me the existential room

2195
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
it's giving me the ear fear

2196
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I had a bad blockage in my ear

2197
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
a few times and I just

2198
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I went to the ear doctor

2199
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
and they did this thing where they stick

2200
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
like a hose into your ear

2201
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
and they just shoot water into it

2202
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
wait really

2203
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
yeah they shoot

2204
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
a ton of water directly into your ear drum

2205
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
and it feels horrible

2206
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
and

2207
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
they call it like

2208
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
irrigation, ear irrigation I think

2209
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
irrigation

2210
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
yeah exactly

2211
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
and then the ear wax just kind of shoots out

2212
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
and it spills into like a little

2213
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
it shoots out the other side, goes straight through your brain

2214
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
it kind of pours

2215
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
into like a little cup they

2216
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
hold next to your ear

2217
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
you know

2218
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
it doesn't feel good at all

2219
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
but it did the job

2220
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
cleared up my ears

2221
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
that is

2222
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
so weird, I would never think

2223
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
to power wash the inside of my ear

2224
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
that would be so loud

2225
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
yeah it's loud and doesn't feel good

2226
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
that's for sure

2227
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I don't like it

2228
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I don't want to talk about this anymore

2229
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
but the good thing is

2230
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
it gives you immediate relief

2231
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
because the ear wax comes out immediately

2232
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
you don't have to wait

2233
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
like a few minutes or anything

2234
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Shiba Inu coin is up

2235
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
it's not Dojo coin

2236
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
it's a different coin

2237
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
did you see Bitcoin went up to like

2238
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
60 something

2239
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
yes yes I saw

2240
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
60 billion

2241
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I was and I'm still mad

2242
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
even last week I was mad

2243
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
about Bitcoin going up

2244
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
and again

2245
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
last week I complained about like

2246
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
I was looking at it when it was around 40

2247
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
and thinking maybe I should buy the dip

2248
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
nah and now it's 60

2249
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
so fuck me I guess

2250
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
fuck me

2251
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
what are you gonna do

2252
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I didn't buy any for a while

2253
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
because I kind of

2254
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
didn't do so hot last time

2255
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
so I would just like

2256
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
whatever

2257
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
and now it's

2258
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
it went up a lot so

2259
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I should have bought some

2260
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
it is

2261
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
yeah I mean obviously I wish I had bought it

2262
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
when it was low and sold it when it was high

2263
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
but you know

2264
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
the same old story

2265
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
the last time it was rallying

2266
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
the last time it was going really high

2267
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I bought some as it was still going up

2268
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
and yeah it went up some more

2269
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
and I was like yes but then you know

2270
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
and then I sold and I ended up

2271
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
basically coming out

2272
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I think I lost like 100 bucks

2273
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
or something so like

2274
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
maybe not 100 maybe like 50

2275
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
so

2276
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
yeah it's like it's so easy

2277
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
to look at the line going up and be like

2278
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
line going up I should buy

2279
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
line going up

2280
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
but then you know it always goes down eventually

2281
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
and then I don't know

2282
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
the last time I

2283
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
it's not like I was able to time it

2284
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
or anything so like what what makes me think

2285
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I would do any better this time

2286
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
yeah it

2287
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
it went up a lot it went up almost 50%

2288
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
in like a couple days there

2289
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
but now you know it peaked and now it's a bit

2290
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
down it's down like

2291
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
it's down like 10%

2292
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
which is a pretty big dip actually

2293
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
so like if you bought it when it was peaking at

2294
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
like 7

2295
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
like you know 66k

2296
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
and you're like oh shit we're going to the moon

2297
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
or whatever

2298
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
you've lost 10% of your investment

2299
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
so that's not good I mean maybe it'll

2300
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
maybe it'll bounce and keep going up

2301
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
who knows well the strategy

2302
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
pretty steep peak at the moment it's kind

2303
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
of

2304
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
the strategy I always use

2305
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
is you can't lose if you don't

2306
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
sell so if you buy and it goes down

2307
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
just keep waiting and

2308
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
hope to God it goes up again

2309
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
that's the I mean

2310
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
you could see it like that you could also

2311
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
you could also look at it as

2312
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
the long term value

2313
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
of any of any investment

2314
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
is zero like once you've invested

2315
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
anything the money the consider the money

2316
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
gone and like anything you

2317
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
get back from it

2318
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
is like okay

2319
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
it's just a bonus

2320
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
right like if you have a held asset

2321
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
and it's simply held it's not

2322
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
it's not worth anything you have to sell it

2323
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
eventually if you if you're going to get anything

2324
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
right

2325
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I suppose so that's

2326
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
you know that's not how

2327
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
that's not how the billionaires calculate

2328
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
their their self-worth you know

2329
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I guess I guess that's

2330
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
true I don't I don't really understand

2331
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
the mindset of the people who are like hold

2332
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
forever like literally hold forever

2333
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
like

2334
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
surely you will sell eventually I guess they

2335
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I don't think anybody thinks hold forever

2336
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
but they think it doesn't matter how

2337
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
bad it's getting if you hold it'll

2338
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
eventually go higher than it was

2339
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I guess they they might never sell out

2340
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
at a loss I think is what they they're actually saying

2341
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
well that's what I said

2342
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
they might be thinking that like

2343
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
it will you know it will see

2344
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
such mainstream adoption one day

2345
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
that eventually Bitcoin will just become

2346
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
their money right and then they will

2347
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
spend it you know with

2348
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
wallet to wallet transfers

2349
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
instead of spending their

2350
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
you know I think that's a

2351
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
overly optimistic

2352
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
viewpoint

2353
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I personally don't believe that would happen

2354
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I also

2355
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
don't really think it's good I mean I don't

2356
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
think it's going to replace money

2357
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I do I mean

2358
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
it might see some more mainstream

2359
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I mean it is becoming a bit more mainstream

2360
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
now I think that's what

2361
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
the like the hold forever I think that's

2362
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
what they're banking on they think that Bitcoin will just

2363
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
become money one day

2364
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
yeah yeah well

2365
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I don't yeah I guess all I

2366
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
can say is good luck to them

2367
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
you know yeah

2368
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I'm wondering about like

2369
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
how

2370
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
valuable Bitcoin can be

2371
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
because like say

2372
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
hypothetically everybody got in early

2373
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
and they've got like

2374
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
a bunch of Bitcoin sure and then

2375
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
it goes to the moon and then you've got

2376
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
like hundreds upon hundreds

2377
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
of billionaires spending

2378
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
money does that how does

2379
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
does that even make sense

2380
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
like how how does this

2381
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
wouldn't wouldn't Bitcoin itself

2382
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
lose value if everybody has so much of it

2383
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
no no because

2384
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
well everybody

2385
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
okay well what you're describing

2386
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
if you're thinking of physical things that people buy

2387
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
like food and whatever

2388
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
well if everybody had a little bit of Bitcoin

2389
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
if you had spread out the Bitcoin

2390
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
before it went to the moon you know it would still

2391
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
the total amount of Bitcoin

2392
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
worth would still would still be the same

2393
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
the market cap or whatever would still be the same it would

2394
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
just be more distributed among more

2395
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
people yeah I think Bitcoin

2396
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
there's a limited number there's a limited amount

2397
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
of Bitcoin that that can exist

2398
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
yeah I think there's a hard limit on how much

2399
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Bitcoin can exist so

2400
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
yeah that theoretically

2401
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
should never become

2402
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
valueless because of that

2403
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
you know like the dollar

2404
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
you know how the dollar is valueless because we just

2405
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
keep printing more of it

2406
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
what do you mean it's valueless

2407
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
well that's the case for like all

2408
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
fiat currency

2409
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
the government just determines what the

2410
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
value is it has no intrinsic

2411
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
value

2412
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
sure yeah of course

2413
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
and when I mean that's

2414
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
you know whenever a government is in debt

2415
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
they just print more money usually to

2416
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
kind of deal with that

2417
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
in addition to borrowing money and

2418
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
all the typical things they do

2419
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
borrowing money

2420
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
is good actually

2421
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
national debt is good

2422
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
actually

2423
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
well they certainly do a lot of that

2424
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
so

2425
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I guess maybe it's good

2426
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
it is

2427
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
it actually is good like it's not

2428
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
it's not bad that America like

2429
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
has debt to its citizens

2430
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
it's actually fine

2431
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
as long as they don't default

2432
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
this is business

2433
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
well didn't they default one time

2434
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I remember

2435
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
like years ago they

2436
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
they defaulted on a payment and then

2437
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
they had to raise a debt ceiling or something

2438
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I can't remember

2439
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
are you talking about with the under Obama

2440
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
this is

2441
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
this is related to that article I linked

2442
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
two weeks ago about the minting the coin

2443
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
the trillion dollar

2444
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
biden platinum coin

2445
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
yeah they had

2446
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
they had to raise the debt ceiling under Obama

2447
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
and the republicans were like

2448
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
oh he raised the debt ceiling

2449
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
that's bad but it's like no

2450
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
actually raising the debt ceiling is just

2451
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
what everybody knows you have to do sometimes

2452
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
but

2453
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
if you can get someone else to do it

2454
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
you can point at them and go aha

2455
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
he raised the debt ceiling

2456
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
he's a spendocrat

2457
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
he's a spendocrat Jerry

2458
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I think

2459
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
the only issue is if they like

2460
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
keep increasing the money supply too quickly

2461
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
which doesn't really

2462
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
I don't think is related to the debt

2463
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
but if they increase the money supply too quickly

2464
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
then the value of the currency goes down

2465
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
yeah hyperinflation

2466
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
it can happen

2467
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I don't think we're at risk of it happening right now

2468
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I suppose that

2469
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
was supposed to be the point of bitcoin

2470
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
to try and prevent that from happening

2471
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
but I don't know

2472
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
the point of bitcoin

2473
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
to replace fiat currency

2474
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
was supposed to be the point of bitcoin

2475
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
not memeing the point of bitcoin

2476
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
is to be able to

2477
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
have money

2478
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
and buy things without paying taxes on it

2479
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
that is the point of bitcoin

2480
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
is to

2481
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
be undetectable by the government

2482
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
that sounds pretty cool to me

2483
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
taxes

2484
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I guess so

2485
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I guess I can see the appeal

2486
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
but I mean it's

2487
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
it's not gonna

2488
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
it's just gonna get regulated

2489
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
it's just gonna get regulated and become

2490
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
a regular thing

2491
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
that you gotta pay taxes on

2492
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
there's two outcomes

2493
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
either the government just outright bans bitcoin

2494
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
or they regulate it

2495
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
like regular

2496
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
like anything else

2497
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
well it's hard to ban bitcoin

2498
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
I don't think they can do that

2499
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I don't think they'll be able to

2500
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
if two people

2501
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
one guy has a thing and they accept bitcoin

2502
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
another guy has bitcoin

2503
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
what can the government do to stop that

2504
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
transaction taking place

2505
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
delete the apps

2506
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
crack down on it

2507
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
it's a little hard

2508
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
bust in their door

2509
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
they can ban that kind of thing

2510
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
they ban child porn

2511
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
and that's just

2512
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
digital files that people trade

2513
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
tyranny

2514
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
tyranny

2515
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
yeah

2516
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I mean they could make it illegal

2517
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I just don't think it would work

2518
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I don't think it would be enforceable

2519
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I think it would lessen

2520
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
the amount of people using it openly

2521
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
but like at this point

2522
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
it'll happen no matter what

2523
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
for a while at least

2524
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
well I mean the same can be said about

2525
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
almost any laws

2526
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
there's always gonna be some people that

2527
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
commit a crime and get away with it

2528
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
yeah

2529
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I guess so yeah

2530
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I think it would

2531
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I think trying to ban it would just be

2532
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
kind of like giving up

2533
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
it's sort of like

2534
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
drugs are illegal like marijuana was illegal

2535
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
for a while

2536
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
and it was like stupid because like the government

2537
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
could have

2538
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
they could have gotten

2539
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
raised tax revenue

2540
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
if they just made it legal

2541
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
and like saleable

2542
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
and regulated

2543
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
making it illegal had no upsides

2544
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
it was bad for

2545
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
citizens and it was bad for

2546
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
the government

2547
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
and I feel like banning bitcoin would be the same

2548
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
there's really no practical upside

2549
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
to trying to ban it

2550
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
yeah I wouldn't want them to ban bitcoin

2551
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
but

2552
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I just feel like they might

2553
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
if it threatens

2554
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
them in any way

2555
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
didn't China make it illegal

2556
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
or something

2557
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
China is cracking down on bitcoin

2558
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
farming

2559
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
yeah I think they banned bitcoin mining

2560
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
maybe

2561
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
because of the environmental impacts

2562
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
oh no god knows

2563
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
because they can't control it

2564
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
they don't like that

2565
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
you know China doesn't care about the

2566
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
environment so it has to be

2567
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
a different reason

2568
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
sure well

2569
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
yeah

2570
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I guess it's true

2571
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
okay

2572
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
that can't regulate it

2573
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
okay I mean that makes sense

2574
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
that tracks

2575
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
damn I was looking at

2576
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
covid case numbers in China

2577
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
have you seen this shit

2578
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
no

2579
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
no

2580
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
it's

2581
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
covid case numbers

2582
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
come on

2583
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
come on please load

2584
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
you fucking

2585
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
hold on I'm finding the graph

2586
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
it's

2587
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
it's unreal

2588
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
you're putting out graphs for this

2589
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
it's gonna be pretty serious

2590
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
it is serious

2591
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
well it's seriously awesome

2592
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
it isn't what it is

2593
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
look at this

2594
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
new cases 26

2595
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
look at it

2596
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
that's not much

2597
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
what is the time

2598
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
April

2599
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
well this is from

2600
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
is this the whole of covid or is this

2601
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
this is since early

2602
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
2020 when it started

2603
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
so it started out

2604
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
pretty bad in China

2605
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
and then they were just like no

2606
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
there's no covid

2607
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
yeah but how do you know they aren't

2608
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
lying and manipulating the data

2609
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
yeah I guess

2610
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
that's true

2611
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I guess I don't know

2612
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
because they have

2613
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
they have an incentive to lie

2614
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
okay

2615
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
well question

2616
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I guess it comes from official sources

2617
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
official Chinese sources

2618
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
there's a potential for them

2619
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
to like say whatever number they want

2620
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
do you think

2621
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
maybe this is naive

2622
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
do you think though that they could actually do

2623
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
if they could do that

2624
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
then why isn't every country doing that

2625
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
lying about their case numbers

2626
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
well I do think there's probably a lot of

2627
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
countries that lie about case numbers

2628
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
probably not just China

2629
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
but I think in China

2630
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
there's scrutiny for them since they

2631
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
censor a lot of stuff

2632
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
and you know they have a history of

2633
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
manipulating data

2634
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
other countries don't have the same kind of

2635
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
history or the same kind of reputation

2636
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
do you think

2637
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
this graph is

2638
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
is a

2639
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
is a big fat lie

2640
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
maybe it is

2641
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I don't know I mean there's no way for me to know

2642
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
if it's true or not

2643
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I can't

2644
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
to believe that it's been so

2645
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
perfect but they maybe

2646
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
have a lot of

2647
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
mandates and curfews

2648
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
easily enforceable

2649
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
yeah

2650
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
you will not go outside you will be shot

2651
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
people will obey those sorts of

2652
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
rules you can't say that in the UK

2653
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
because people will say you can't shoot us

2654
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
freedom

2655
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
we want to just go outside and get COVID

2656
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
we just want to get it

2657
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
it certainly seems

2658
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
plausible that

2659
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
their kind of government could

2660
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
you know perhaps achieve this

2661
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
it's just really their

2662
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
spotty track record when it comes to

2663
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
being honest about stuff

2664
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
that's the kind of

2665
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
that's the only reason I would doubt

2666
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Xi Jinping is

2667
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
very much like

2668
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I need to

2669
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
look the coolest

2670
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I can't be seen to be weak

2671
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
in any way we are the best

2672
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
at getting rid of COVID it's plausible

2673
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
that those lies going on

2674
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
but I don't know can't tell

2675
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
well

2676
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I just think it's a funny graph look at that shit

2677
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
look how flat

2678
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I mean it'd be nice if it were

2679
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
real you know I certainly

2680
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
hope it is

2681
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I certainly hope those numbers are real

2682
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
optimistically

2683
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
yeah

2684
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I'll choose to believe it

2685
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
oh Bitcoin

2686
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Bitcoin's under 60

2687
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
it's under 60 oh no

2688
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
it's not going up forever it doesn't

2689
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
it doesn't only go up

2690
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
gilf

2691
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000

2692
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000

2694
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
gold I'd like to

2695
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
fund

2696
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
finance

2697
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
yes

2698
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
good good

2699
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
nilf is

2700
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
wait

2701
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
nilfs are already a thing

2702
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
not nilf n

2703
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
like non

2704
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
I was trying to say non I'd like to fungible

2705
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
but like

2706
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
you know NFT

2707
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I was trying to turn it into an NFT

2708
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
but it doesn't work I know about NFTs

2709
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
oh yeah I'm getting in

2710
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
like to fungible token

2711
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
yeah I'm selling some non fungible tokens

2712
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
yeah I'm

2713
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
minting some NFTs

2714
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
you can buy them on my

2715
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
you can buy them on my website

2716
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
they're called road to radcon

2717
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
the book

2718
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
it's a book

2719
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
it's non fungible because it's physically

2720
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
a real thing

2721
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
atoms and molecules that make it up

2722
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
in the real world you can't funge it

2723
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
you can't do it

2724
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
exactly

2725
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
buy one and try to funge it

2726
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I have like 50 copies

2727
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I have about like 50 something

2728
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
copies that I might never

2729
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
sell

2730
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
probably just gonna sit in a box

2731
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
in my closet for the foreseeable

2732
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
future

2733
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
viewers please buy

2734
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
the book from me

2735
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I don't need 50 copies

2736
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
you need one copy or more

2737
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
thank you

2738
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
but the cover art

2739
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
on that thing is pretty nice

2740
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I know it's so good

2741
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Michi's so good

2742
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
shit rules man

2743
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
yeah

2744
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
shit rules

2745
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
that's why it's my twitter icon

2746
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I've had it for my twitter avatar for couple months now

2747
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I think

2748
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
no plans to get rid of it

2749
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
there's the interior illustration

2750
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
of me

2751
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
looks even cooler than the one on the cover

2752
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I had to put it in there

2753
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
along with a bunch of her other sketches

2754
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
she did a bunch of like sketches

2755
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
of the characters first and then she went back

2756
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
and she like made the actual

2757
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
piece arranged them all in you know

2758
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
we went back and forth

2759
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
on like what should Brad look like

2760
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
what kind of expression

2761
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
should he have

2762
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
what sort of face is he making

2763
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
etc

2764
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
it's a masterpiece

2765
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I put it in

2766
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
I put it in my pinned tweet

2767
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
is ordering instructions

2768
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I've got a few more

2769
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
people are buying it like one or two

2770
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
every day or so

2771
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
so it's not

2772
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
I'm surprised

2773
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
way more people want it

2774
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
I thought maybe like 20 people

2775
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
would want to buy a copy that didn't already

2776
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
get one from the radcon rewards

2777
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
but no it's probably been like 100

2778
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
no maybe not 100

2779
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
it's pretty good

2780
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
well hopefully

2781
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
you sent May here a copy right

2782
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I did

2783
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
send May here a copy I put it in the mail yesterday

2784
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
God forbid

2785
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
you would have forgotten that

2786
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
she said

2787
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
send it to my parents and said okay

2788
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I guess I will

2789
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
what else can I do

2790
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
you're a man of honor

2791
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I'm amazed she still wanted it

2792
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
honestly

2793
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
you're a man of honor and integrity

2794
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
so obviously you're gonna

2795
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
fulfill any obligations you have

2796
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
even to your mortal enemies

2797
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
even to my mortal enemies

2798
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
yes

2799
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
we're bound by something

2800
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
stronger than politics

2801
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
we're bound by money

2802
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
a monetary transaction took place

2803
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
and it must be honored

2804
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
at any cost

2805
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
unfortunately

2806
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
your honor is always stripped

2807
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
away to zero every time you keep

2808
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
stealing a scroll

2809
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
you just can't help it

2810
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
you have all this honor

2811
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
you could be such an honorable samurai

2812
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
but you keep stealing scrolls

2813
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I know I can't help myself

2814
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I'm a fiend

2815
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
by the way

2816
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
you guys probably already talked about

2817
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
the doid gazers album

2818
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
have you mentioned that here

2819
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
we mentioned it

2820
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
I think so

2821
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I haven't heard of an album

2822
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
the doid gazers album

2823
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
that was released by

2824
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
doid gazer himself

2825
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
was it

2826
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
yeah that was um

2827
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
that was uh

2828
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
that was a while ago right

2829
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
yeah I think that was quite a while ago

2830
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I remember

2831
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
I remember yeah he made a voicemail

2832
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
he gave us a voicemail about it I think

2833
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
he has a twitter account

2834
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
he made a doid gazers twitter account

2835
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I think he has the album

2836
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
hold on

2837
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
let me see if I can find it

2838
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
oh no it's doid gazer

2839
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
I just posted the album

2840
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
you know I linked the album

2841
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
oh there

2842
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
what do you know

2843
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
it's uh it's pretty funny

2844
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I quite liked it it's already at

2845
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
over a thousand views which is not bad

2846
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
for some brand new channel

2847
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I just started

2848
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I don't see the

2849
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
the link on the

2850
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
on the twitter account

2851
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
uh

2852
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
wait

2853
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
oh it's on youtube okay

2854
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I thought it was a soundcloud album

2855
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
yes yes this is just

2856
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
this must be a collection of the

2857
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
are these the voicemails

2858
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
are these the voicemail songs or

2859
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
hmm

2860
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I think

2861
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I think these are unique

2862
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
but I'm not completely sure

2863
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Riley commented

2864
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
did he

2865
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
he says when you put it all this way

2866
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
you make some good points

2867
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
that's so funny

2868
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
that comment doesn't really make a lot of sense

2869
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I don't know what he means

2870
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
okay I guess

2871
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
yeah

2872
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I quite liked it

2873
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
and for some reason I was mentioned

2874
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
in some of the lyrics

2875
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
really

2876
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I guess I'm part of the

2877
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
doid gazer

2878
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
why is a stereos here

2879
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
a stereos in the comments

2880
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I don't know what

2881
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
two days ago

2882
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
two days ago a stereos

2883
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
commented

2884
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
a stereos says avoid the doid

2885
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
he steals pizzas

2886
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
I didn't see that

2887
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
doid gazer responds

2888
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
and the rumor also my fiance

2889
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
better than your fiance

2890
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
oh my god

2891
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
this guy is sick

2892
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
this guy is twisted

2893
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I assumed these were the same songs

2894
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
from the voicemails

2895
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
but if they're new ones

2896
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
then I guess I gotta listen to them again

2897
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
oops

2898
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I think it might be all new material

2899
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
because

2900
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I don't recognize the voicemails

2901
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I heard in any of the songs

2902
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
and

2903
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
personally I feel like

2904
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
they should have included some of the voicemails

2905
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
in this album

2906
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
because some of the voicemails

2907
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
were really good

2908
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
I really like them

2909
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
he says special thanks to Tom Oliver

2910
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I'm not sure why

2911
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I'm not sure what Tom did

2912
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
something

2913
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
helpful I guess

2914
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
he made a 3D avatar

2915
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
for them

2916
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
probably

2917
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
hey

2918
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
we've been going for about two hours now

2919
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
speaking of voicemails

2920
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
what do you think about if we start voicemails

2921
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
do you think it's about that time

2922
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
pretty good with that

2923
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
well let's

2924
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
let's fucking do it then

2925
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
let me grab the first one here

2926
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
the first one

2927
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
let's go through this

2928
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
three hours of voicemails

2929
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
there's not

2930
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
there's less than one page of voicemails this week

2931
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
so it should be a pretty normal amount

2932
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
okay

2933
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
here's the voicemail and also there's a link

2934
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
okay

2935
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
whatever

2936
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
the voicemail is called read die dark

2937
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
3, 2, 1, go

2938
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
yo if you guys haven't already

2939
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
totally check out the manga die dark

2940
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
by Q Hayashida

2941
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
she's most known for like Dora Hedoro

2942
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
which is had an anime adaptation somewhat recently

2943
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
but this is her new series

2944
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
it's fucking cool

2945
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
everyone in it is like a fucking weirdo

2946
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
irreverent

2947
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
sociopath or something

2948
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
but they're all just kind of

2949
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
going around space

2950
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
and there's a funny skeleton robot man

2951
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
so Gib would probably fucking love that shit

2952
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
and the artwork's great so check that shit out

2953
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
okay

2954
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
does the link show the thing?

2955
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
here's the link

2956
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
oh

2957
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
whoa

2958
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
that looks pretty cool

2959
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
that's pretty neat

2960
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
that's a skeleton astronaut

2961
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
with a pillar of skeletons

2962
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
I'm sold

2963
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
this guy looks like he's

2964
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
boned

2965
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
true? true?

2966
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
boned as in like unfortunate

2967
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
circumstances that led to

2968
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
bad things to happen to this character

2969
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
boned?

2970
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
possibly

2971
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
the next voicemail

2972
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
dude we're boned we're gonna die

2973
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
that's what I think that means

2974
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
maybe he already did

2975
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
next voicemail is an image

2976
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
there it is

2977
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
so the next voicemail isn't a voicemail

2978
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
it's a voicemail

2979
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
okay

2980
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
it's a visual mail

2981
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
it's the f

2982
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
the f show

2983
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I think it's a p maybe it's the

2984
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
procrastinator show okay so I think this is me and you

2985
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
we're being showered with money

2986
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
and then okay

2987
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
I've wasted my life on studying

2988
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
could have been a youtuber

2989
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
good work kid

2990
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
the government will pay you

2991
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
I'm gonna study some more

2992
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
forget youtube

2993
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I'll be a scientist

2994
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
true story compliments please

2995
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
wait

2996
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
alright so this character

2997
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
this orange character

2998
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
is the voicemailer

2999
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
true story

3000
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
he's got fly honey

3001
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
he's got fly honey sciences bitches now

3002
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I'm jealous

3003
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
if he becomes a scientist

3004
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
then he can cure covid

3005
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
that's just that easy

3006
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
it's just that easy

3007
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I don't understand so this purple

3008
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
character is like ben sain

3009
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
but specifically from rck or is it actually the

3010
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
youtuber

3011
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
ben sain

3012
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
no I think it's just me

3013
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
wait you mean the guy giving him the

3014
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
you pass good work kid

3015
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
I don't think that's me

3016
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I think that's just some government man

3017
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
it's a shadowy man

3018
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
in black

3019
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
it's a government agent

3020
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
okay so this guy

3021
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
this guy is working through

3022
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
he's listening to the procrastinators

3023
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
podcast and he's just

3024
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
teaming with jealousy

3025
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
about all our success

3026
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
as everyone does all the time

3027
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
but then

3028
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
he copes

3029
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
he's seething but then he copes

3030
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
the government is paying me

3031
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
to study

3032
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
to get a STEM degree

3033
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
so actually I made the right decision

3034
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
the thing I don't get about this image

3035
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
whatever you need to tell yourself

3036
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
whatever you need to tell yourself kiddo

3037
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
the thing I don't get about

3038
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
this image is how could you

3039
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
watch the procrastinators

3040
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
podcast in its current state

3041
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000

called the game

3075
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000

3084
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I felt like the

3085
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
the games were not actually heartfelt

3086
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
they sounded sarcastic they sounded like

3087
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
they were doing a bit and not really

3088
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
believing what they were saying it

3089
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
they were doing an

3090
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
8 bit

3091
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000

3105
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
for my tastes

3106
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I could have done it with one verse

3107
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
but it's okay

3108
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000

the council of bends

3133
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
they call themselves the avengers

3134
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
they sent a link to the merch store

3135
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
if you are interested

3136
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
oh yeah

3137
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
there's just a whole bunch of Ben merch

3138
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
now you know uh what your new wardrobe

3139
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
is going to be like

3140
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
just just just um

3141
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
it's just a lot of stuff

3142
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
like this

3143
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
this doesn't even look good

3144
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
these logos suck

3145
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
it's not super great

3146
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I don't get it

3147
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
there's more interesting ways you could do

3148
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
you could turn Ben into a logo

3149
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
or put it on merch

3150
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
it's just like

3151
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
we designed one thing in illustrator

3152
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
and that's it

3153
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
just put it on white t-shirts

3154
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
did you know that Ben is also the name

3155
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000

3156
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000

um yeah please

3206
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
what you should do

3207
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
is you should start every um

3208
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
you should start every episode with a different pun

3209
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
you know nobody has ever done that before

3210
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000

3216
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
for this uh

3217
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000

02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I guess seasons is strange

3233
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
I don't even know when it started

3234
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I guess they've been going longer than the Simpsons

3235
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
no wait

3236
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
maybe

3237
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
51 seasons oh my god

3238
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
51?

3239
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
69 started

3240
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
it definitely started before the Simpsons

3241
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
the Simpsons started in like

3242
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
1988 I think

3243
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
yeah

3244
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
maybe um yeah

3245
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
close to the 90s

3246
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
cool well

3247
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
good good good job

3248
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
next one is uh

3249
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
we should marathon Sesame Street and talk about it

3250
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
we do a

3251
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
let's watch Sesame Street

3252
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
a live reaction to every episode

3253
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
how many

3254
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I want to figure out how many

3255
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
hours that would be

3256
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
okay next next one is

3257
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
uh another fucking

3258
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
thing

3259
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
another image

3260
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
okay third world or brain

3261
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
surgery agriculture

3262
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
chemistry romance warfare philosophy

3263
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
seafaring art

3264
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
first world or brains Pokemon

3265
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
weed Chris Chan

3266
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I

3267
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
I don't know if this is accurate

3268
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
so is that supposed to be

3269
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
me, Trixie and Ben

3270
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I

3271
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
I think it's mage, you, Trixie, me

3272
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I don't think about Pokemon

3273
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I don't even like it

3274
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
they got it wrong

3275
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
wait uh mage is a third worlder

3276
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I mean not

3277
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
I mean the Lithuania is not

3278
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Lithuania is not third world

3279
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
it's it's it's not

3280
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
like a powerhouse of

3281
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
of Europe but it's like

3282
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
she had she had shitty she had

3283
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
shitty dubs she had shitty anime

3284
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
dubs

3285
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
that definitely sounds like

3286
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
a third world to me I guess

3287
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
nightmare that's second world

3288
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
second life

3289
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
okay yeah true

3290
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
I don't know

3291
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I don't know if this is like supposed to be a serious

3292
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
point that I feel like I

3293
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
don't know if I can even

3294
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I want to I feel this makes me mad

3295
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
this makes me want to argue but I don't

3296
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
even know where to begin

3297
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
so I think

3298
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
it's a mage head

3299
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
mage is always

3300
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
always going on about

3301
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
the nuances of chemistry

3302
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
things on our streams

3303
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
on our vtuber streams

3304
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
we probably executed her and that's why

3305
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
she's no longer on the show anymore

3306
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
that was a big mistake

3307
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
if you don't

3308
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
know anything about Christian

3309
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
then you can't be part of the

3310
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
procrastinator's podcast

3311
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
mmm that's

3312
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
that's me I'm just always I'm just always

3313
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
thinking about thinking about Chris

3314
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Christian

3315
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
is the glue that holds this

3316
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
whole thing together

3317
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
my fucking

3318
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000

our taxi

3333
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
versus squig game

3334
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
huh

3335
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
they put the mic so hard

3336
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I couldn't hear what they were saying

3337
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
as she said I have an idea

3338
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
for a bonus episode odd taxi

3339
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
versus squid game

3340
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
well I haven't seen

3341
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
no I haven't seen either one

3342
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
I may I may

3343
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
watch some squid game at some point

3344
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
it looks mildly interesting

3345
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I might give it a chance

3346
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I've heard a lot

3347
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
about squid game

3348
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
but haven't watched it either

3349
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
nah here's what you do

3350
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
here's fucking sesame street

3351
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
versus squid game

3352
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
I think sesame street versus squid

3353
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
I have been

3354
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
a lot of people have been telling me

3355
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
to watch odd taxi and I have dug my heels

3356
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
in and made it a

3357
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
point of pride no I will never

3358
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I will never watch odd

3359
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
taxi it's a part

3360
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
of my identity now

3361
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Ben is not much of a movie watcher

3362
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
he doesn't watch movies ever

3363
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
not really

3364
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
not really

3365
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
okay

3366
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
next one

3367
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
although I mean we don't know what our next bonus episode

3368
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
is going to be so we'll have to

3369
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
think about it

3370
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
it should probably be more trick

3371
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
scene and yug stuff right

3372
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
oh no

3373
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
those are always the best ones

3374
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
there's nothing else to say about that

3375
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
ooh she said I'm transphobic

3376
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
she said it's transphobia that I don't like her

3377
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
it's the only reason she can think of

3378
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
okay that's it

3379
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
that's all I have to say that's the bonus episode

3380
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
that's the goss

3381
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000

3382
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000

3420
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
44,000 hours

3421
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
of sesame street content

3422
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I don't know

3423
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
how they can do it that sounds

3424
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
uh

3425
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
quite frankly it sounds like torture to me

3426
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
I think if you want to

3427
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
terrorize if you want to torture a terrorist

3428
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
to find out the location of their

3429
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
secret lair just just play

3430
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
sesame street for 44,000 hours

3431
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
so it's something we should

3432
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
be doing more of is torture

3433
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
yeah we should do that in one ton

3434
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
500

3435
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
mm-hmm

3436
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
it'll take me a second to figure out

3437
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
how many episodes were

3438
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000

the fucking I don't even know where she

3492
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
is right now it's unclear like where

3493
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
they live

3494
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
they're being cagey about it well clearly

3495
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
clearly she's in

3496
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
I assume I assume they're crashing

3497
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
on someone's couch or something but I don't know

3498
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
clearly she's in she's in your head

3499
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
then

3500
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
yes rent free rent free

3501
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
she gets the rent free

3502
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
housing there so what do I know maybe she's

3503
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
a financial genius after all

3504
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
this is so funny

3505
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
scrolling through the fucking muppet

3506
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
wickier

3507
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
lister stress me street episodes

3508
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
mm-hmm it's just it just keeps

3509
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
going season one season two

3510
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
three four five six seven eight nine

3511
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
what 40

3512
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
41 season 43

3513
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
they've got to all be basically the same right

3514
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
like how many how many

3515
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
they write so many fucking

3516
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I would imagine how many different

3517
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
they probably even do

3518
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
yeah yeah

3519
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
they probably repeated themselves several

3520
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
thousand times well they

3521
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
they do they do reuse

3522
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
like animation animated bits

3523
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
and skits right like

3524
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
like an episode of sesame street will have

3525
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
like recycled content from older episodes

3526
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
in it I think

3527
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
so it's I don't think it's all like completely

3528
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
original content

3529
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
every episode I don't know I couldn't tell you

3530
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I haven't watched it

3531
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
I've never seen it so I have no idea you never

3532
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
watched it even as a kid I did watch it

3533
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
um it

3534
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
yeah I I've never saw it

3535
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I think I must have seen

3536
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
like a couple episodes when I was

3537
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
really young because I remember big bird

3538
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
and grow and Oscar the Grouch

3539
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
sure but I wasn't like it wasn't like a normal

3540
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
thing

3541
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
the normal thing was telly tubbies

3542
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
and then did they

3543
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
have a like I was too old

3544
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
for telly tubbies when it came out so

3545
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
did they have a weird baby

3546
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
thing did they have a UK version

3547
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
of the sesame street over there

3548
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
no no

3549
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
they just aired the thing as far as I

3550
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
understand yeah it's the same show

3551
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I'm surprised they didn't just have

3552
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
the sesame street with like

3553
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
British accents

3554
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
no

3555
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
no that would be

3556
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
like imagine if they

3557
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
British Muppets

3558
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
imagine if they just use the same footage

3559
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
but they dubbed over it

3560
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
with British accents

3561
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
same word the exact same words

3562
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
is someone with a British accent

3563
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
same language just

3564
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
big birds like

3565
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
grover

3566
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
me chimney me chimneys on fire

3567
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
grover

3568
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I don't know what a British people say

3569
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
fish and chips shrimp on the barbie

3570
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
yeah they like

3571
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
over like put like acid

3572
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
wash and air PNG

3573
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
fucking fish and chips over whatever

3574
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
they were actually eating in the footage

3575
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
they just dubbed the names of the food

3576
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
you know sometimes

3577
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
with video games

3578
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
they actually released a different English

3579
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
version for the UK audience

3580
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
just to have the different spellings

3581
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
and stuff they did it with

3582
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
them with apescape

3583
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
I know I know they did I know they

3584
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
did that with apescape they just gave it a different

3585
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
dub in America and the UK

3586
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
for some reason yeah did they

3587
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
I thought I thought the

3588
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
you know they did the dub of

3589
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
apescape 2 oh no yeah in apescape 1

3590
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
I was thinking of apescape 2

3591
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
because in apescape 2 for some reason

3592
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
both all of the English

3593
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
dub is the

3594
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
the European English British version

3595
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I learned I learned that

3596
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
I learned that fact from you

3597
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
from your apescape yeah I did I wasn't thinking

3598
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
of the first game yeah yeah

3599
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000

3600
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
pretty interesting video

3601
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000

kill that civilian in GTA 5

3632
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Nate is a type of guy to never be

3633
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
on the procrastinator's podcast

3634
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
that's that's for sure

3635
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
true though

3636
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
true next

3637
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
voicemail is called cheese

3638
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
three two one

3639
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
go

3640
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
okay Ben

3641
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
I bought me some cheese

3642
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
and I bought a block of Swiss cheese

3643
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
from the store

3644
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
I just kind of suckled on it

3645
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
it slowly fell apart in my mouth it was

3646
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
wonderful

3647
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
what?

3648
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
that's not how you're supposed to do it

3649
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
it's kind of gross

3650
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
yeah

3651
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
it's almost as gross as putting olive oil

3652
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
in your ear and then letting all the goo

3653
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
liquify out and it's

3654
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
blew just out of your mouth

3655
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
it's almost as gross as that

3656
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
medicine is not always

3657
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
medicine just sometimes is weird

3658
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
feels good when it's over

3659
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
what if you poured

3660
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
I would never do that recreationally

3661
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
do it for fun

3662
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
I would deliberately get some ear wax

3663
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
so I can drip some olive oil in there

3664
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
satisfying

3665
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
what if you poured hot cheese down your ear

3666
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
that would be a

3667
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
problem

3668
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I feel like it would leave your

3669
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
doesn't it leave the inside of your ear

3670
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
feeling oily like does it eventually

3671
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
go away get absorbed by your skin or whatever

3672
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
nah it just slips out

3673
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I mean your skin is oily

3674
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
yeah I guess so

3675
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
gross

3676
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
wait

3677
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
wait oh the baby bell

3678
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
I've actually

3679
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I bought like so many baby bells

3680
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
from Costco

3681
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
I've like mostly eaten them I have a few left

3682
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
but I've started to kind of hate them

3683
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
I find them a little bit disgusting now

3684
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
I've had too many of them and I'm like

3685
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
I'll try to eat one and I'm like

3686
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
it's

3687
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
cheesy gross

3688
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
I've lost my appetite for them

3689
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
you're being kind of cheesy right now

3690
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
I'm being a little ant

3691
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I'm being a little anti cheese

3692
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
and I mean

3693
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
it's just how it is

3694
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
I'm spoiled

3695
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
on it I guess

3696
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
I'm gonna have to

3697
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
I'm gonna have to wait

3698
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
I'm gonna have to wait a while before I get another one

3699
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000

3730
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
geese are heartless creatures

3731

there it is three two one

3732
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
go

3733
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
you ever look at a goose and think

3734
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
what a vile creature

3735
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
hmm

3736
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
you know they're constantly hissing

3737
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
and honking and those sounds

3738
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
aren't so pleasant and

3739
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
you know they got scary teeth

3740
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
and

3741
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
evil looking eyes you know

3742
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
one of them once looked me dead in the

3743
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
eyes and said

3744
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
mister you have

3745
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
you have waving hair

3746
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
waving goodbye on account

3747
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
of you going bald

3748
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
and I felt

3749
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
that made me very upset

3750
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
why did it

3751
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
why did they do this

3752
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
why did they say that to me I don't

3753
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
like them they're very rude

3754
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
why are they so rude

3755
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
why are geese so rude

3756
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
I'm sorry that happened

3757
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
why do we allow

3758
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
these geese to exist

3759
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
why don't we just ring them

3760
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
by the neck and toss them about

3761
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
you know

3762
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
rough them up a bit

3763
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
I don't like geese

3764
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
what do you think about geese

3765
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
it sounds like they need to be cancelled

3766
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
if you ask me

3767
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
I think

3768
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I don't know

3769
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
I've never had a bad experience

3770
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
with a goose so

3771
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
I don't know I'm sorry

3772
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I had one long time ago

3773
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
when I was small enough that they could

3774
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
be taller than me if they

3775
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
stretched their neck up

3776
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
and they charged at me

3777
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
and I ran

3778
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
what do you mean they how many

3779
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
where why

3780
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
it was a school trip

3781
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
actually

3782
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
at some like Roman

3783
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
thing

3784
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
there's roman ruins

3785
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
it's like look at that

3786
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
you went to Rome

3787
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
no in England the romes

3788
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
they came and they conquered

3789
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
England they put all this roman shit everywhere

3790
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
so there's like a few roman stuff

3791
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
like museums and things

3792
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
sure sure

3793
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I remember the trip vividly for some reason

3794
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
but then at the end

3795
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
we were getting on the bus to go back

3796
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
to school and I was just sort of

3797
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
wandering around

3798
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
and the geese said how are you gonna be late

3799
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
you gotta go back to school and they started honking me

3800
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
and I was like no I don't want to go there

3801
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
and they nipped

3802
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
at my heels

3803
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
fascinating

3804
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
I've never really had a goose experience

3805
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
beyond that point

3806
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
I hear geese can be dangerous at times

3807
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
sometimes they get violent and they attack you

3808
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
they sometimes can get aggressive

3809
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
they can be

3810
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I've never heard of anyone being killed by a geese

3811
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
but it's probably happened

3812
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
you get your eye bit out if you're an idiot

3813
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
probably a kid

3814
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
a kid has been killed by multiple geese

3815
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
like attacking them at some point

3816
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
I could totally see that

3817
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
I remember

3818
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
there was an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm

3819
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
where Larry kills a goose

3820
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
it was like a pet goose

3821
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
of the guy who owns a lodge

3822
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
and the goose

3823
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
just went up to him while he was playing golf

3824
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
and started attacking him

3825
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
so

3826
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Larry had a golf club

3827
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
and he just took a swung at the goose

3828
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
and the goose died

3829
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
he took a swing

3830
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
they got long necks

3831
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
you know what to aim for

3832
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
you gotta do

3833
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
then he had to hatch a plan

3834
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
to find a way to bury

3835
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
the body of the goose without

3836
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
the guy finding out

3837
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
of course

3838
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
because if the guy finds out

3839
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
he'll be banned from the lodge

3840
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
or whatever he was in

3841
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
yeah sure

3842
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
you gotta do

3843
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
you gotta do Robert Pattinson

3844
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
in the lighthouse

3845
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
you see that movie

3846
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
the lighthouse

3847
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
he grabs

3848
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
a seagull

3849
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
by the neck and he starts swinging it

3850
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
and just like bashes it against

3851
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
like a well or something

3852
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
he just smashes the fuck

3853
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
out of that seagull

3854
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I guess geese are kind of big

3855
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
it might be kind of hard to do it to a goose

3856
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
but birds are light

3857
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
they have little brittle hollow bones

3858
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
so maybe you could

3859
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
I could probably lift a goose

3860
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
you can probably kill one pretty easily

3861
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
with a golf club

3862
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
sure

3863
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
how heavy is a goose

3864
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
how

3865
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
how heavy is a goose

3866
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I finished the

3867
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Sesame Street calculations

3868
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
yes

3869
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
after this goose thing

3870
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
geese are apparently

3871
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Canadian geese can be up to like 14 pounds

3872
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
which is

3873
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
I mean it's not that

3874
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
that's quite expensive

3875
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
it seems like most kind of goose

3876
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
are about

3877
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
4 to 6 pounds

3878
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
up to like 7

3879
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
but I guess maybe Canadian geese are bigger

3880
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
that's the most

3881
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
common kind that I usually see

3882
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
there should be no problem for you

3883
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
since you can lift like what

3884
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
150 pounds now

3885
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
my bench press

3886
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
my bench press is coming along

3887
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
my bench press is 150 now

3888
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
if I can get it over 155

3889
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
that was my old

3890
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
not my old record

3891
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
but before Covid

3892
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I was benching like 155

3893
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
so if I can get over that

3894
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
yes I'm strong now

3895
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
so pretty soon you'll be able to take on geese

3896
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
and also are

3897
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
you know Riley in a boxing match

3898
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
finally

3899
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
yeah

3900
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
I think feel like me and Riley

3901
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
would be

3902
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
I don't know who would win

3903
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
I feel like we would both do very badly

3904
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
in a boxing match

3905
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
I don't know who would be worse

3906
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
you need to get strong enough to be able

3907
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
to penetrate the defensive barrier

3908
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
of his gun

3909
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
right

3910
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
the gun fight

3911
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
okay funny

3912
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
May messaged me

3913
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
after you know Riley said the thing about

3914
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
the break in never happened

3915
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
I didn't respond because I don't

3916
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
want to talk to her

3917
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
but she DM'd me on Twitter being like

3918
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Riley is just trying to start another

3919
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
gun fight it was the only time

3920
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
that like you know them

3921
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
the yig crew has been relevant

3922
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
and I just think it's really funny

3923
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
that she group first to her husband

3924
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
as the gun

3925
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
it's his gun

3926
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
that's the gun the titular gun

3927
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
is your husband why are you calling it that

3928
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I guess they're not married but you know what I mean

3929
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
very funny

3930
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I don't know

3931
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
okay so

3932
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Sesame Street yes

3933
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
there are Sesame Street facts

3934
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
there is a bunch

3935
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
I calculated

3936
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
2017 when they

3937
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
change to 30 minutes

3938
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
I mean it was

3939
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
I did all the mathematics

3940
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
we have 4,917

3941
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
hours approximately

3942
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
of Sesame Street

3943
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
now dividing that by

3944
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
24

3945
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
if you were to watch it 24 hours straight

3946
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
204.8 days

3947
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
straight of watching Sesame Street

3948
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
which is unrealistic because you can't

3949
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
stay awake and watch the entire thing

3950
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
so

3951
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
let's say the average time to be

3952
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
awake is like 14 hours per day

3953
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
you take that

3954
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
you watch Sesame Street for those entire 14 hours

3955
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
and you will be done

3956
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
watching Sesame Street

3957
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
after 351.2 days

3958
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
almost an entire

3959
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
full year

3960
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
you could do it as your full time

3961
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
job for a year

3962
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
and maybe you'd get done watching Sesame Street

3963
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
14 hours a day yes

3964
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
I mean that's more than a full time job

3965
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
that's

3966
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
double basically because full time is like 8 hours

3967
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
a day right

3968
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
yeah and no weekends

3969
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
so

3970
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
slave labor conditions

3971
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
make like I don't know

3972
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Quinton Reviews style

3973
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Sesame Street review

3974
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
like the sort of videos

3975
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
you see like

3976
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Jenny Nicholson I watched all of something

3977
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
yes yes

3978
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
if you wanted to do that it would take an entire year

3979
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
at best

3980
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
think of the views though

3981
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
think of the views think of the amount of times

3982
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
you could say I watched all of Sesame Street

3983
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
so you don't have to

3984
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
I'm a nostalgia critic

3985
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
I was gonna say you'd probably be like the only person

3986
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
ever but that's probably not true

3987
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
probably someone somewhere

3988
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
honest

3989
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
I don't know I mean it's been on since the 60's

3990
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
all of the kids

3991
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
wouldn't have kept watching it

3992
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
all of the kids are dead now

3993
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
that used to watch it back then

3994
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
I'm sure there's one

3995
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
there's at least one kid who is autistic

3996
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
enough to watch the entire thing

3997
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
that's what I was gonna say yeah I could believe

3998
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
that there was maybe some kid who was like

3999
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
who was profoundly autistic or something

4000
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
he liked Sesame Street a lot

4001
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
and he just never stopped watching it

4002
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
even now

4003
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
I could believe

4004
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
I need psychopedic knowledge

4005
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
they should make a youtube video about it

4006
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
he even goes out of his way to watch all the episodes

4007
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
he missed

4008
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
finding them wherever he can online

4009
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
he DVRs them

4010
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
yeah

4011
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
next voicemail

4012
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
we've only got a few more

4013
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
I think

4014
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
oh yeah there's only two more

4015
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
the next one is called

4016
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
my

4017
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
computer

4018
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
why does it do this

4019
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
it's when I click a file until I click and drag it

4020
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
sometimes it just stops

4021
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
understanding what I'm trying to do and then I have to click a different window

4022
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I don't know what's going on with my UI

4023
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
lately

4024
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
right

4025
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
it's called my revenge

4026
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
three two one go

4027
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
hey man

4028
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
last week you called me a fucking idiot

4029
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
because my voicemails are too quiet

4030
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
well

4031
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
what I have to say to that

4032
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
in response is

4033
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
am I loud enough for you now

4034
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
is this what you wanted

4035
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
yeah thank you

4036
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
yes thank you

4037
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
that was a good say

4038
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
towards the end there kind of sounded

4039
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
like an ego raptor impression

4040
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
hmm

4041
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
maybe

4042
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
maybe a little bit

4043
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
oh

4044
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
this is um

4045
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
this is not really relevant to anything

4046
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
but I guess it's funny enough that I could mention it

4047
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
I had to explain

4048
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
the PCP

4049
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
to two of my roommates yesterday

4050
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
they know

4051
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
they now know that I am a

4052
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
YouTube podcaster

4053
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
so that's cringe

4054
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
that's horrible

4055
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
I know

4056
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
I know please give me condolences

4057
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
I was walking home

4058
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
from the printer

4059
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
I had just gone to the printer to get the second batch

4060
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
of road to rad cons

4061
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
printed and I had the box

4062
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
and I was walking and one of the guys

4063
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
he was sitting outside

4064
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
like sketching something in a sketchbook

4065
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
and I asked him hey

4066
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
what's your sketch and he showed me

4067
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
and he was like what you got there

4068
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
and I was like well

4069
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I had to explain

4070
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
what road to radcon is

4071
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
which entailed

4072
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
talking about the PCP

4073
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
and stuff and then I came inside

4074
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
and another guy was inside and he also was like

4075
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
hey what you got there and I was like

4076
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
well gotta tell you about it

4077
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
he asked me like what's the podcast

4078
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
you don't have to explain everything

4079
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
well yeah he asked me about it

4080
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
he asked me to explain so what am I gonna say

4081
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
no if you want to know all this

4082
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
I'll tell you

4083
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
he's a P on YouTube he saw my little icon

4084
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
he said congratulations

4085
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
for me because he saw that I'm almost at

4086
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
20k subscribers

4087
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
which is pretty cool I guess

4088
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
he thought that was neat and I said no

4089
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
it's embarrassing no it's a stupid no

4090
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
I hate myself no please kill me

4091
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
and this charade please

4092
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
and then he was like

4093
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
gladly

4094
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
yeah

4095
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
and he cut out his glock and he shot

4096
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
ok alright

4097
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
so that was

4098
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
that was funny

4099
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
alright last

4100
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
last voicemail

4101
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
it is called

4102
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
it is called ideas 5 months

4103
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
late

4104
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
3 2 1 go

4105
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
back in episode 261

4106
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Ben said why schedule protests

4107
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
what do protests do if they don't disrupt anything

4108
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
and for a bit of a nitpick schedule protests

4109
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
still close down roads and make people take

4110
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
alternate ways around town

4111
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
for some people

4112
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
you're probably not being put in a protest cage

4113
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
in the middle of nowhere but the broader idea

4114
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
I'd like to discuss is how should protests

4115
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
be tackled in an ideal world

4116
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
not all protests are for good movements like

4117
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
civil rights, trans rights, BLM pro-units etc

4118
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
there's anti-abortion, anti-lockdown

4119
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
and anti-democratic stuff too

4120
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
should the rest of society allow these to be

4121
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
unrestricted disrupting large parts

4122
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
of society because 1% of the population

4123
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
thinks vaccines will make them sterile

4124
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
hmm

4125
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
well it's simple

4126
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
the stupid protests

4127
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
should be destroyed

4128
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
ban them, ban the ones that are bad

4129
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
and

4130
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
fund the ones that are good

4131
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
cops are good when they're

4132
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
when they're cracking down on

4133
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
people that I don't like

4134
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
um

4135
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
I think

4136
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
well I mean uh jeez

4137
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
I guess people should be

4138
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
I guess people should be

4139
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
allowed to protest

4140
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
even things that are bad

4141
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
I guess I wouldn't say no they can't do that

4142
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
uh

4143
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
yeah you just count a protest

4144
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
with another

4145
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
bunch of people

4146
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
the same argument people use about

4147
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
freedom of speech and stuff like that

4148
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
well freedom of speech is good

4149
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
actually

4150
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
uh

4151
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
you know I meant

4152
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
there's like the mayoral race

4153
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
going on in Boston right now

4154
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
and um

4155
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
one of the contenders

4156
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
who I think just got endorsed by

4157
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
the Boston Globe

4158
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
which I think is kind of a big deal

4159
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
uh

4160
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Michelle Wu is uh

4161
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
I don't know if she's the frontrunner or what

4162
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
but I met her

4163
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
I literally met her outside of the

4164
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Boba Tea place

4165
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
no it was the Waffle Pop

4166
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
place that I went with

4167
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
munchie and kazi a couple times

4168
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
and

4169
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
she was just standing out there with like a little entourage

4170
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
handing out cards

4171
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
and she asked me like hey

4172
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
what would you like me to do

4173
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
as mayor and I was like

4174
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
uh hey remember that

4175
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
straight pride protest that they approved

4176
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
uh don't do that anymore

4177
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
and she was like

4178
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
yeah okay that was dumb

4179
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
uh

4180
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
so if she becomes mayor

4181
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
and then and banned

4182
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
straight pride parades it was my fault

4183
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
I did it

4184
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
uh

4185
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
yeah so what was I

4186
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
what was I even talking about

4187
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
um

4188
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
you were just saying before that

4189
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
you would allow all parades now you're saying

4190
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
you want certain ones not to be allowed

4191
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
it's not okay the thing

4192
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
about the straight pride parade is that it was not

4193
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
merely allowed that it was like

4194
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
official like it was like

4195
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
the cops showed up to like

4196
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
they cordoned off a parade route for it

4197
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
and the cops were there

4198
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
to escort

4199
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
it and keep

4200
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
people from

4201
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
fucking them up

4202
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
yeah it's

4203
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
a movement that doesn't

4204
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
really warrant a parade because

4205
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
it's only

4206
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
a backlash against gay pride

4207
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
like you wouldn't do a parade

4208
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
unless you were trying to

4209
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
make a statement

4210
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
yes true but

4211
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
I guess a parade is not the same thing as a protest

4212
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
I would I mean

4213
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
if like I wouldn't say like they're not

4214
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
allowed to like drive their float

4215
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
down the street or whatever like they have the same right

4216
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
to drive a truck down the road

4217
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
as anyone else but like it's different when it's like

4218
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
okay this is an official thing

4219
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
like the city is like announcing that it's an event

4220
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
we've given you like an official police

4221
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
escort like that's not

4222
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
that's not freedom of speech

4223
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
that's not freedom of speech

4224
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
that's like

4225
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
you know that's

4226
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
the government endorsing it

4227
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
basically the local government

4228
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
is getting involved it's like

4229
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
state sanctioned stuff

4230
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
like imagine like an

4231
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
lgb parade

4232
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
right without the t

4233
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
deliberately and that's the

4234
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
it's like oh it's like this is

4235
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
the face of the

4236
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
you know the city or the mayor or whatever

4237
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
it's like this is what they're allowing

4238
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
pretty much pretty much

4239
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
without the t that sounds like

4240
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
then saint to me

4241
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
what

4242
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
you're saying that I'm lesbian gay bisexual

4243
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
I'm saying you're you're you're saying

4244
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
you're on t

4245
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
got it

4246
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
somebody else

4247
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
spider if you're

4248
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
you call spider on twitter called me low t

4249
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
because

4250
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
because I told him my lifts

4251
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
I told him my lift numbers and he wasn't

4252
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
super he wasn't impressed

4253
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
okay it's true though

4254
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
I am it's you're also

4255
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
you're also anti-t though

4256
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
you know as far as trans

4257
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
is concerned because

4258
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
remember Trixie

4259
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
what you said yeah

4260
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
I remember I remember

4261
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
I remember it like it was only yesterday

4262
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
when she said I'm a girl now and I said well

4263
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
I hate you for that reason and that was

4264
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
that was what happened

4265
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
that's how I remember it

4266
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
you're both low t and anti-t

4267
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
yes true

4268
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
my two favorite things about me

4269
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
anyway

4270
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
protest I mean

4271
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
fucking

4272
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
well shit I think

4273
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
I think people's

4274
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
to be effective a protest needs to be disruptive

4275
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
and yeah I think that even that

4276
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
goes for things I don't like

4277
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
like if fucking anti-vaxxers want to have a protest

4278
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
and they want to block roads to make a statement

4279
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
like

4280
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
I mean I guess they should have the same

4281
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
protection the same legal

4282
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
protection to do that as anyone else

4283
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
I mean you know

4284
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
yeah I would

4285
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
yeah they have the right to do it

4286
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
because it's like it only

4287
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
takes a change of government to make it

4288
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
so that now you can't protest

4289
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
you know if you couldn't protest one thing

4290
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
before yeah then it'll be

4291
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
it'll come back

4292
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
and then I mean

4293
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
I mean you might the reverse

4294
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
you can't protest leftist things that would be bad

4295
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
so like

4296
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
just blanket allow

4297
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
I think so you might get arrested

4298
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
like sometimes in the

4299
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
course of protest like if you block traffic on a road

4300
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
like that's illegal you know you might get arrested

4301
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
or something if you

4302
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
you know

4303
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
and that's okay

4304
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
it's fine

4305
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
people know that that's going to happen and they do it

4306
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
they can cause a scene and they're taking

4307
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
the being in prison

4308
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
for a little bit it's part of

4309
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
the jail if the argument is

4310
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
should we allow protests then obviously

4311
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
yeah we should

4312
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
right

4313
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
was there anything else to this question I feel like

4314
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
well he was asking how should they be handled ideally

4315
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
I don't really know

4316
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
what else to say about it though

4317
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
you know I remember years ago I got into

4318
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
kind of a small argument

4319
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
on AOL

4320
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
instant messenger

4321
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
with someone about protests

4322
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
this was back in

4323
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
2003 when Wind Waker

4324
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
had come out

4325
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
and I was arguing

4326
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
with someone from the UK

4327
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
and

4328
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
I wasn't really arguing

4329
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
he got real mad I wasn't

4330
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
and I think I told him

4331
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
he wanted to protest the wars

4332
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
that were going on

4333
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
so he was attending local protests

4334
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
and

4335
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
I said I agree with this position

4336
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
I was also against these wars

4337
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
but I kind of told him

4338
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
I don't think the protest you're going to

4339
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
is going to do much good because

4340
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
in general when

4341
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
governments invade countries they don't

4342
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
really pay a whole lot of attention to protesting

4343
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
and he got really

4344
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
he got really offended by that

4345
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
and I wasn't trying to

4346
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
offend him or anything

4347
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
but he got so offended by that

4348
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
he basically blocked me for like

4349
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
10 years after that

4350
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
oh jeez

4351
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
I mean

4352
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
I guess you're right

4353
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
individual actions are weak

4354
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
and like a single protest

4355
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
isn't going to stop the war

4356
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
I mean

4357
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
I don't know much about

4358
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
the actual validity of those things

4359
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
I know there was a lot of war protests

4360
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
and

4361
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
with every war

4362
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
there's been a bunch of people saying

4363
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
stop it

4364
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
a bunch of damn beatnik hippies going

4365
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
don't stop killing people

4366
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
how dare they tell the United States

4367
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
government to stop killing people

4368
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
don't they know the United States government

4369
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
is literally neurodivergent and a minor

4370
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
yeah exactly

4371
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
I mean it's

4372
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
it's a new country

4373
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
but I think there was a lot more

4374
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
opposition to these wars than

4375
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
maybe some wars in the past

4376
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
they were not very popular

4377
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
they were not very popular wars

4378
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
that's

4379
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
I don't okay

4380
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
they were

4381
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
they were kind of popular

4382
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
people were

4383
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
largely pretty okay

4384
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
well I mean obviously not everybody

4385
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
but there was a lot of

4386
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
people who were like yeah

4387
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
we're mad about 9-11

4388
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
we gotta do some war

4389
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
but there's always

4390
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
people who are into it and not into it

4391
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
but I think in general these wars

4392
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
they kind of got compared to like

4393
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Vietnam

4394
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
Vietnam was not a very popular war

4395
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
a lot of people hated it

4396
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
a lot of people were against it

4397
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
so I kind of think this is

4398
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
similar situation

4399
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
but

4400
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
I just thought that

4401
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
in general protests don't

4402
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
have much effect on

4403
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
stuff like war

4404
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
they tend to have bigger effects on

4405
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
other smaller issues

4406
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
but when it comes to like

4407
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
big issues like war

4408
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
they unfortunately don't seem to have

4409
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
almost any effect

4410
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
which sucks

4411
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
I don't know I mean

4412
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
I think you're kind of correct

4413
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
but it's just sort of like

4414
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
it doesn't really matter

4415
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
that they're not effective

4416
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
because in aggregate

4417
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
like many people protesting about the war

4418
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
will

4419
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
at the very least

4420
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
influence the politicians

4421
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
in a way that they're like

4422
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
oh if I want to get votes

4423
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
I can't be pro-war

4424
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
and then they'll try not to do

4425
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
war stuff so much

4426
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
Vietnam was not popular

4427
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
everybody was like stop

4428
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
Vietnam

4429
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
and we eventually just kind of did

4430
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
we just kind of gave up on Vietnam

4431
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
because we weren't

4432
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
and like

4433
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
so many Americans

4434
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
it was unpopular and people were

4435
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
protesting it and everyone

4436
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
popular opinion was just like this war is bad

4437
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
and we shouldn't be doing it

4438
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
and eventually we did stop

4439
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
right?

4440
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
the fact that it was publicly unpopular

4441
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
I think might have been part of

4442
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
why it stopped

4443
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
it might have just kept going

4444
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
that's basically what happened with Afghanistan

4445
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
I guess

4446
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
unfortunately with Afghanistan it took like 20 years

4447
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
it took so fucking long

4448
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
oh my god

4449
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
it took so long because they had a lot

4450
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
of money

4451
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
from the oil they were getting

4452
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
at some point

4453
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
no no the US

4454
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
and the UK

4455
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
there was money in it to stay in it

4456
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
but I think

4457
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
protesting

4458
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
and they seem to have convinced

4459
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
people

4460
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
in a large enough amount that it's

4461
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
okay and good

4462
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
that we're over there still

4463
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
people grumbled about it but they didn't really change

4464
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
their vote too much

4465
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
yep

4466
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
it was just

4467
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
it was like

4468
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
people didn't even really talk about it like it was

4469
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
a war

4470
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
it was just kind of like we're there

4471
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
and that's just how it is

4472
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
and like it was

4473
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
it was called the war in Afghanistan

4474
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
and people

4475
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
but people didn't really talk about it like it was a war

4476
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
it's just

4477
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
kind of like a thing

4478
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
they did call it the war on terror

4479
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
for a while I guess

4480
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
for a while

4481
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
do you like terror

4482
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
what are you pro terror

4483
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
you crazy

4484
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
that's a halloween

4485
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
neurodivergent and a minor

4486
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
protesting is cool

4487
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
I used to support protesting

4488
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
it doesn't change anything

4489
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
but I guess I'm just really cynical

4490
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
about it sometimes

4491
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
people do those

4492
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
petitions on change.org

4493
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
whatever they collect signatures

4494
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
and sometimes

4495
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
it doesn't change anything

4496
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
yeah I mean

4497
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
true

4498
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
I think that even though

4499
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
it seems

4500
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
fruitless

4501
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
a good argument for not doing it

4502
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
that's true

4503
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
except for maybe a waste of time

4504
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
it doesn't make

4505
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
the war last longer to go protest about it

4506
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
I don't know

4507
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
I don't know if you want

4508
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
I don't fucking know

4509
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
whatever

4510
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
good for him for wanting to

4511
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
make a statement

4512
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
like I said I supported

4513
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
his stance on it

4514
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
cause he was basically trying

4515
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
to get me to go to

4516
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
protests and stuff

4517
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
you should look up local protests in your area

4518
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
and I was like

4519
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
I'm not gonna do that

4520
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
I just said

4521
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
I'm just gonna play wind waker

4522
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
it just came out

4523
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
bro wind waker just came out

4524
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
I'm a wall

4525
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
I'm not

4526
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
emotionally available for that

4527
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
exactly so

4528
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
they didn't sit well with him

4529
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
so he blocked me

4530
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
he just didn't like wind waker

4531
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
he was like fuck no

4532
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
he looks so cartoony

4533
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
they copied it from the little prince

4534
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
in the seven headed dragon

4535
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
the eight headed dragon

4536
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
he looks like the same guy

4537
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
but they made him

4538
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
you can go out there

4539
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
you can go out there and protest

4540
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
and I'll provide you moral support

4541
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
while I play wind waker

4542
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
I'll send you my thoughts

4543
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
and prayers

4544
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
okay that was the last voicemail

4545
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
I'm reloading to see

4546
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
what

4547
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
there's a new

4548
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
nope we got one

4549
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
we got a last minute voicemail

4550
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
why would you reload

4551
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
I don't know

4552
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
but I did

4553
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
it's called

4554
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
the blue glow skull monkeys

4555
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
one hour 17 minutes 23 seconds

4556
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
okay

4557
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
three two one go

4558
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
I just realized

4559
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
that there is a lecture I could give

4560
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
and I would be able to go into a lot of detail

4561
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
and present a lot of interesting information

4562
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
but nobody would want it

4563
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
at all

4564
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
it would be the least wanted lecture

4565
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
of all time

4566
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
and it would be the brony community

4567
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
well I'll tell you what

4568
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
I wouldn't fucking watch that lecture

4569
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
I know

4570
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
why did I say that

4571
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
why did I say I wouldn't watch it

4572
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
I had to be joking

4573
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
because I definitely would

4574
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
I could not

4575
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
what was I thinking

4576
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
when the whole brony

4577
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
lecture thing first happened

4578
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
and Trixie decided not to release it

4579
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
at first

4580
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
on a personal level I didn't care that much

4581
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
because I was never really into the brony

4582
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
stuff

4583
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
but then I saw you

4584
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
talk to someone on twitter about it

4585
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
and someone said

4586
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
why don't you do a lecture on the pcp

4587
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
history

4588
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
and then you responded well that's basically what the brony

4589
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
lecture was

4590
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
a lot of it was

4591
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
so when I saw that

4592
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
then I thought well darn

4593
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
now I actually want to watch

4594
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
the brony lecture

4595
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
it was like

4596
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
a lecture about the brony culture

4597
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
from the lens

4598
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
of the horseshoe crew

4599
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
and how we all met in all of our history together

4600
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
a lot of it was focused on

4601
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
on us

4602
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
as a part of the

4603
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
brony

4604
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
I am actually pretty bummed out

4605
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
that I can't watch that lecture

4606
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
I know

4607
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
man I know

4608
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
for the record I'll say it again

4609
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
I don't agree

4610
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
with the decision not to release it

4611
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
but that's not like

4612
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
I think some people

4613
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
think that's like the one thing

4614
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
that's the straw that broke the camel's back

4615
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
that made me like

4616
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
I hate Trixie now

4617
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
that was just one

4618
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
little thing that was like bad

4619
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
but it wasn't like

4620
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
it's not the main thing

4621
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
it's

4622
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
the attitude

4623
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
towards the people who

4624
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
paid for

4625
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
Radcom and other things

4626
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
it's literally just because

4627
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
she's trans

4628
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
it's literally

4629
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
the hot clipped

4630
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
it's the thing

4631
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
when I think about

4632
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
what made me

4633
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
not like Trixie anymore

4634
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
it's things that she said to me

4635
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
I can't believe you would treat me this way

4636
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
I can't believe you would say that to me

4637
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
and mean it

4638
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
terrible

4639
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
I remember those big money connections

4640
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
the big money connections

4641
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
and like oh Ben

4642
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
you don't get to use my big money connections anymore

4643
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
fuck you

4644
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
and the time that I got mad at May

4645
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
for being a Nazi

4646
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
message me to be like you're just jealous that I get laid

4647
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Ben

4648
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
you're just jealous that I get to have sex with my Nazi year old friend

4649
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
and you don't

4650
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
those are the two big ones

4651
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
very funny

4652
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
I don't

4653
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
agree with a lot of

4654
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
stuff that she's done

4655
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
but

4656
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
I kind of feel like a cyber shell

4657
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
on this kind of thing where I personally

4658
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
don't like hate her

4659
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
or dislike her

4660
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
well you know

4661
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
my issues with her are completely personal

4662
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
so it's not like I expect everybody else

4663
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
yeah I think you're completely justified

4664
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
in hating her

4665
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
but

4666
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
she's never done anything against me

4667
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
so I don't have

4668
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
any personal justification

4669
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
first they came for the Ben Saints

4670
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
yeah first they came for Ben St

4671
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
and I said nothing because I was not

4672
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
Ben St and then I looked

4673
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
and Ben St was gone

4674
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
no

4675
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
I miss him I loved him so much

4676
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
why didn't I save him

4677
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
the only slight thing

4678
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
she kind of did is that

4679
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
for me anyways

4680
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
she didn't give me the ransom I paid for

4681
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
but I don't really care about that

4682
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
that's pretty irritating

4683
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
that's pretty annoying

4684
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
that would be enough for me

4685
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
I don't think that was like

4686
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
her intention I don't think she maliciously

4687
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
did that I think she just forgot

4688
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
that's

4689
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
I mean

4690
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
forgetting is still bad

4691
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
that's just

4692
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
people pay you

4693
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
to do some things

4694
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
I didn't mean to rip people off

4695
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
I just didn't mean to take the money and run

4696
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
I just did it though

4697
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
I do think it's irresponsible

4698
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
but I just don't care enough

4699
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
to make a big deal about it

4700
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
I understand not caring to follow her up

4701
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
but it's not okay

4702
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
that she was irresponsible

4703
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
yeah I'm not saying it's okay

4704
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
I'm just saying that I'm not upset about it

4705
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
even though I could be

4706
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
maybe I should be but

4707
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
yeah

4708
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
that's fine I get it

4709
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
I mean what is it like 15 bucks or something

4710
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
it's not much

4711
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
in question here

4712
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
so fucking much

4713
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
I could do anything for $15

4714
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
I imagine

4715
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
I mean for the

4716
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
for the product

4717
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
of a short little rant about whatever

4718
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
even if you don't know what it is

4719
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
yeah this thing

4720
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
whatever it sucks and it's like 15 bucks

4721
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
for that

4722
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
I didn't actually watch it lol

4723
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
she was making quite a lot of money

4724
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
from those rants

4725
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
honestly she shouldn't have stopped doing that

4726
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
she should have continued

4727
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
because

4728
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
it seemed like it was working

4729
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
it seemed like it was working pretty well

4730
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
for a while there

4731
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
I think she stopped because she was getting too many of them

4732
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
and she couldn't like do all of them

4733
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
or was taking too much of her

4734
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
time from other stuff

4735
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
but I feel like there would have been

4736
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
a fairly simple way to solve that

4737
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
problem which is

4738
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
you just limit the amount of people

4739
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
who can be at that tier

4740
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
well you could do that or you could increase the amount

4741
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
of money that it costs

4742
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
and that way less people would

4743
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
buy rants

4744
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
and that would make more money per rant

4745
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
yeah

4746
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
if the demand

4747
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
is exceeding the supply

4748
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
you raise the price

4749
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
and then you're going to lower the demand automatically

4750
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
you would still make money

4751
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
but you wouldn't have to do as many rants

4752
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
so I don't know why she just stopped entirely

4753
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
that seems like a really stupid business decision

4754
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
but

4755
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
yeah

4756
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
I mean

4757
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
it only takes a few minutes

4758
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
and she's making you know

4759
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
yeah you just got to price it so that like

4760
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
if the amount you're charging

4761
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
is like a worthwhile amount

4762
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
for the time that it takes you to do it

4763
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
and I don't see why

4764
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
yeah like then more is just good

4765
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
like more is just good as long as it's worth

4766
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
as long as the return on what you're doing

4767
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
is positive

4768
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
I mean if I could

4769
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
make money that way

4770
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
I would never stop

4771
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,000
that's for sure

4772
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
just so

4773
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
I guess bizarre to think

4774
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
the people in large enough quantities

4775
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
that she couldn't keep up

4776
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
would be willing to pay

4777
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
$15

4778
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
every month

4779
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
to support her but also for rants

4780
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
that was so

4781
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
like the amount of like

4782
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:45,000
goodwill and like

4783
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
fandom that she had at her disposal

4784
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
is unfathomable

4785
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
compared to where we are right now

4786
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
it's pretty

4787
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
it's pretty starting

4788
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
it sucks that she was so like

4789
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
disrespectful towards her fans

4790
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
and kind of like

4791
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
didn't treat them very well because they were

4792
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
real nice to her and they supported her a lot

4793
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
you know

4794
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
much too nice

4795
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000
I don't respect it

4796
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
I don't respect Trixie fandom

4797
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
or Digi Bro fandom in 2021

4798
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
I don't respect it anymore

4799
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:19,000
I don't know if there's much left

4800
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
of it has vanished

4801
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,000
yeah

4802
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
what are we talking about

4803
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
why are we talking about this

4804
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,000
we've been over this

4805
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
we've

4806
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:33,000
this is all well trodden

4807
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
this is what the people want

4808
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
this is what the people want

4809
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,000
you know most people

4810
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
there were a few people that

4811
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,000
pledged for the one month

4812
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
and then unpledged

4813
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
from the bonus episodes

4814
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
pledged stuck around

4815
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
are still patrons

4816
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,000
as of this month

4817
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
so I mean I'm very happy

4818
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
about that

4819
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
mean the pcp patreon

4820
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
yes that's what I'm talking about

4821
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
because we got the big bump

4822
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
when I released those last three episodes

4823
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
including the cyber shell

4824
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
goss one

4825
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
yes thank you

4826
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
I hope you enjoyed the fun

4827
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:15,000
patrons I hope you

4828
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,000
enjoyed the fun fact challenge

4829
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
post your fun facts down below

4830
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
if you got them

4831
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,000
next time you should do

4832
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
unfun facts

4833
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000
unfun facts

4834
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:29,000
depressing facts

4835
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,000
no I don't know

4836
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:33,000
did you know the ear

4837
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:35,000
you put oil in it

4838
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:37,000
this is what happens with the ear

4839
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
some day you're going to get

4840
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,000
crippling arthritis and all your bones were hurt

4841
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
yeah

4842
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,000
I drink my milk

4843
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
I'm there man I'm there

4844
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
I'm in

4845
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,000
sign me up

4846
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,000
a couple weeks ago I had the episode about

4847
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
broken back so my back was bothering me

4848
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
pleased to report that my back is pretty much

4849
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:59,000
fine it doesn't really bother me

4850
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:01,000
anymore hardly at all so I think

4851
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:03,000
I think I just had to

4852
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:05,000
I think I was aggravating it by like

4853
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
twisting my back I was trying to crack

4854
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:09,000
my back because it gave me like a

4855
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:11,000
temporary feeling of relief

4856
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
I was like twisting myself so far

4857
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,000
that I was like pulling the muscle and like

4858
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
causing it

4859
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
injury so we just like stopped doing

4860
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:21,000
that even though I wanted to

4861
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,000
and it kind of just

4862
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:25,000
it kind of went away so I think that was

4863
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
the problem I was

4864
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,000
I think if you

4865
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:31,000
you work out and strengthen your muscles

4866
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,000
properly you can kind of reduce the likelihood

4867
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:35,000
of back pain and stuff

4868
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
but if you work out

4869
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:39,000
you can cause back pain so you gotta

4870
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:41,000
be careful

4871
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:43,000
people say oh

4872
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
deadlifts are dangerous you'll hurt your back

4873
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
and like well it's possible

4874
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
but also if you don't

4875
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:51,000
lift and you don't exercise

4876
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
and you don't keep your back muscles

4877
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
strong then you

4878
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,000
that is

4879
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,000
then you are much more likely to have back

4880
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
problems because you are weak

4881
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
and your body is

4882
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
decrepit

4883
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
so it's really damned if you do damned

4884
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
if you don't

4885
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000

well it could be a cow girl sona

4903
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000

03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
cow person sona

4905

4906
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:59,000

4907
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000

just because I'm

4915
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
I think it's weird

4916
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
I think it's really weird that they made that game

4917
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:21,000
go to youtube.com

4918
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
gamers tavern show to watch

4919
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
videos with puns in them

4920
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
all the videos contain puns usually

4921
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:29,000
true

4922
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:33,000
you can follow me on twitter

4923
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:35,000
at gamer tavern

4924
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:37,000
without the s in the middle

4925
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:39,000
mmm

4926
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
speakpipe.com

4927
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
if you want to leave

4928
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:45,000
a voicemail

4929
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
you know who else takes voicemails now

4930
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:49,000
anamorphentime

4931
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
the anamorphentime podcast

4932
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
I believe they also have a speakpipe

4933
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
where you can send them voicemails

4934
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
speakpipe will like fill up

4935
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
I told Tyler

4936
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
he asked me how to set up a speakpipe

4937
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,000
or he asked me how we did voicemails

4938
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:05,000
and I told him about speakpipe and I said

4939
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
it says there's a 100 megabyte limit

4940
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:11,000
but there's not

4941
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:13,000
you can just go over it and

4942
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:15,000
they won't stop you

4943
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,000
and he was like cool

4944
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:19,000
how they're gonna stop you

4945
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:21,000
they're gonna send cops to bust down your door

4946
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,000
you need to get a warrant first

4947
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:25,000
I think they would

4948
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,000
you would

4949
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:29,000
all that happens when you exceed it

4950
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:31,000
is they add a button that says

4951
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:33,000
action required add more storage

4952
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,000
and it's like you're gonna need to add more storage

4953
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:37,000
if you're gonna want to keep getting voicemails

4954
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,000
do you want to pay us money

4955
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:41,000
to upgrade your account

4956
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
but if you don't press the button

4957
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,000
they don't actually stop you

4958
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
they don't actually stop you

4959
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:49,000
they're gonna figure that out

4960
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:51,000
you would think they would have figured it out

4961
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:53,000
I think they must know

4962
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:55,000
this is a very obvious loophole

4963
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
in their system

4964
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
this can't be an accident

4965
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:01,000
is this like the windrower thing

4966
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,000
where the creator knows

4967
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,000
how easy it is to crack the software

4968
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:09,000
I don't know

4969
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
you can just use it

4970
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
without needing to buy it

4971
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:15,000
if you want to get past the warning

4972
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
maybe

4973
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:19,000
I have no idea why it's like this

4974
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:21,000
but it is

4975
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000
and it seems like they must know

4976
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:25,000
there's no way that they aren't aware

4977
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
of this

4978
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:29,000
I can't explain it

4979
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:31,000
patreon.com

4980
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:33,000
become a patron give us money

4981
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:35,000
free fun fact challenge

4982
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:37,000
et cetera

4983
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:39,000
I guess that's it

4984
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:41,000
any final last words

4985
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:43,000
before we wrap up

4986
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:45,000
uh...

4987
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,000
that's what I'm doing

4988
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:49,000
the lord of ghosts

4989
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:51,000
lord of ghosts also

4990
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:53,000
someone pointed out

4991
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:55,000
that by accident

4992
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:57,000
I accidentally did something spooky

4993
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,000
for spooky month

4994
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:01,000
because I've spent much of october drawing

4995
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:03,000
the lord of ghosts

4996
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
it was

4997
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:07,000
sharker bob

4998
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,000

4999
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:11,000
is on theme for the month

5000
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
