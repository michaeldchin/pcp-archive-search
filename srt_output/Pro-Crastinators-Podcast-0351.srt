1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,140
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:20,140
Welcome to another episode of the The Pro Crastinators podcast.

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,840
I was going to say that.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Well I said it.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
It's me.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,840

Was the other one there was a why yes, I

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,000
Didn't watch the entire episode. I got a little bit into it and then I skip to live any kind I get the end

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,080
I think at the end there was like there's one other word that you'd like

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,280
Bit air you like break a word and in half

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,640
Like better like better

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,280
No, no, there's like when you when you said

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,160
When you remember remember how last week on the episode you said beans on toast, but you said it like be beans on toast

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,200
Beans on toast. Yeah, those are my favorite. That's my favorite. That's what I always say is beans on toast. Yeah, what's the oh, right?

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,440
Yeah, that's that's what they call it breakfast as well

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,240
That's what they call it. That's what they call it over there

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
and eggs

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,440
It goes

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,480
Saw I saw a picture of a full English breakfast going around Twitter yet yesterday. I

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,960
Am I am a fan? I am a fan of the full English breakfast. I have a mini

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
English breakfast

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,840
Most mornings I have like bacon egg and toast sometimes with beans

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,040
It's just really nice. It's funny

29
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,320
You you actually you actually eat beans

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, what's wrong with this? What is wrong with this? I think it I think in America. We just don't eat beans that we just don't eat

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
them any beans

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
Sure, you do. You got like

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,840
Mexican food with beans in it. Yeah, Mexicans do. Yeah, Mexican food

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,640
That's just have like a shitty bean from from Heinz

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,240
I'm talking about real Americans kib. You know what I'm saying. You know what I'm saying

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,880
Click my stopwatch we do I mean we do eat beans just not for breakfast. It's not a breakfast food

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,720
One day I'll try those like the British beans in the in like the tomato sauce

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,480
Because we don't we don't have those there. Do you have them in the like Malat? No, no, no, rarely

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,760
I guess if it's not a common thing you wouldn't see it sold

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,800
No, that that particular style of being I mean maybe you can get it somewhere but in the British aisle

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,320
We have them in the in the molasses that they have a British aisle

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,520
I remember when I was over probably there was like, oh, where's the British aisle? Where's the the the tea?

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
There was a little little section with British things I recognized

44
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
What what store?

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,400
I don't food line like where were we like just getting groceries

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Was it in Boston?

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,600
Because we don't have we don't have food line that would have been Virginia then I I don't remember but like

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
What are the racons?

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Wait, was right before Virginia?

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
No, that was

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,320
Those yeah, yeah, it was no it was it was it probably was that then that three was in Massachusetts. They had like um

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,400
Yorkshire tea, which is my favorite black tea

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,200
I like I like black. I like black

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Don't like Mexican. I like black

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Anyway, let's continue

56
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Uh speaking of rad con

57
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Yeah, we were saying, uh

58
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,320
The the ova is in

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
The channel

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,320
It is uploaded

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,800
We have not watched it yet. I dread looking at it. Yeah

62
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,000
Uh

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, me too

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,760
Yeah, it's gonna be bad and we're gonna do a upset a ben and gib reacts

65
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
The commentary track, I guess

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,960
I think yeah, that's a bonus for bonus episode patrons of the patreon

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
patrons of the patreon

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
Yeah, that

69
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Yeah, that is yeah, that is the plan. I expect that the the commentary to be mostly like, oh

70
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Oh

71
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,280
No, I like over and over do you think we'll like pause?

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
Well, do you think we'll have to pause it because like it's a it's a short video

73
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,040
It's only we'll post it to like be like, oh and here's some background on this shot

74
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Uh, something something

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,360
I think I think we should I think we should because I I remember it's it's only been

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,680
Two years. I remember three years actually actually, uh, no no joke. I think

77
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,920
Uh, Sean said in the pcp like discord

78
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,960
Or maybe it was in my discord or somewhere. It's been three years. It was my I think I think yeah

79
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,480
I think the the anniversary is like this monday like night. I think maybe I think it's

80
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Tomorrow as of the day we recording it or like

81
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,840
Yeah, like this week that this this this episode comes out is like the radcon anniversary

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
The third anniversary

83
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,080
Remember life before coronavirus

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,160
You know, what's really funny is how like the um

85
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:51,600
The pcpe and the radcon 4 lore like incorporates coronavirus into it because it was like a new funny thing at the time

86
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
and then

87
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,040
It continued to be a thing and then it continued to be a thing

88
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,160
Now it's now it's still funny because it's been so long that it's still a thing

89
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
And it's funny that despite being so out of date that it's still irrelevant

90
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
honestly

91
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,360
here

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Yeah, that's a funny way to say it because it wasn't it was never relevant

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,160
Uh, is coronavirus in the ova probably right?

94
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Yeah, that was the story

95
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Spoilers

96
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:31,040
Spoilers for those who have not clicked on it yet spoilers spoilers for road to radcon the novella written by

97
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Trixie and myself

98
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,720
Uh, coronavirus is in that as well

99
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,120
if I mentioned how

100
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,040
How I was I reread it a little bit the other day. It's I think it's really funny

101
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,800
I think the final chapter is funny. I'm proud of my myself. Yeah, I remember enjoying it. It was good

102
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,520
It was good. It didn't feel like it was completely different from what came before

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,400
I tried I tried to match the style as best I could and I think I did a these job because

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,000
I like deliberately sort of took the the way that

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
I don't know if Trixie was doing it for humor or if it's just the way she writes dialogue

106
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
but she had a particular way of

107
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
being like

108
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
You know quote quote

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,560
so and so like

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,640
So and so verbed and I don't know it just it she would use weird verbs for and I think it was deliberate that there would be like

111
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,760
Just matter of factly stating that someone

112
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,960
Did a speech verb that is very like weird and idiosyncratic or would use like a whole phrase for the speech verb

113
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,120
or something like that and so I tried to match that and I

114
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,120
There were other it quirks to it too and

115
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,520
I don't know whatever. I'm bright. I'm just I'm just so smart. I'm just so good

116
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,280
um

117
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
when

118
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
I don't I don't

119
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,200
I do you think well, do you think we'll have it like up?

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,880
I don't know if we're gonna have it up to watch this week. Um, maybe probably I mean

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,920
Maybe it's it's there. So the only thing left is for it to go live, right?

122
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
There's no other things we need

123
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Well, we have to get we have to put it live

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,680
And I'm it's well, it's waiting for a um, it is waiting for like a content

125
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,760
Id like like advertiser check for some reason it was flagged as like inappropriate for advertisers

126
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,840
Sure. Yeah

127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,800
and

128
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Okay, I I forgot about this

129
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,600
But there was also the uncensored version

130
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,720
Yeah, remember that

131
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,240
I forgot that that was kind of the joke was that there was going to be the regular version that has like beams of light and like

132
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,240
Sensor bars and then there was going to be the uncensored version that you can only get by being a patron that doesn't have that

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
and then

134
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
Yeah, so

135
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,360
Nate Nate put

136
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,720
The ova's he put both versions on the youtube channel

137
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,840
And they're unlisted and he like requested

138
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,600
Review for both of them and I unrequested the review for the uncensored version because like I don't care that one doesn't need to be monetized

139
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,320
That's one's patrons only it's it's it's doesn't need ads on it. It's not gonna it's not gonna get more than like maybe a couple hundred views

140
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,040
Uh, god willing neither of them will get any views at all. Yes

141
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,800
So I don't even want them to review that one because it was like it had the word naked in the description

142
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,040
And it's like uncensored and it looked like it's sort of designed to look like pornography

143
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,280
And I don't even want them to look at it. I don't want them to be asked to check. Is this appropriate for youtube?

144
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,320
Because what if they're like they're uploading pornography to youtube and then channel strike. Yeah

145
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Yeah, so I was just forget it forget that one

146
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Never mind. Don't even add. Yeah

147
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
The other one is waiting for review

148
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
and um

149
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Uh

150
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:01,360
And then it'll be out and then that'll be it. I think you said you're gonna release the dojin in conjunction with the

151
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
OVA

152
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
Yes

153
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
They are we up on the website

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,760
And I believe I haven't actually done it yet, but I believe I now have the the power to put the website online

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,800
And so that will be uh, I'll try and put that up. Yeah, okay. So on the website the procrastinators.com

156
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,680
Or perfect party podcast. No perfect party perfect comic dot no perfect party

157
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,320
Oh my god, perfect comic party dot com. Is that it comic? Yes, perfect comic party dot com

158
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,560
There'll be like a link at the top for like pcp stuff and then on the pcp stuff page. There will be

159
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,520
A downloadable. There's a road to radcon and there's the dojin

160
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Those will be downloadable

161
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,000
As well, there's also a link to uh the the dating sim

162
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,880
Uh, if you haven't played that I don't think I've read the entire dojin. So that that'll be interesting

163
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm looking forward to that because that looks the what I've seen looks very good

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,280
I have

165
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,640
I mean, I have read the entire dojin because I I you know

166
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Largely put it together

167
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,160
The the dojin uh, is very

168
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,680
Funny, I think it's really it's funny because

169
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,280
It was written. I commissioned who is it? It was chip wiseman never paint and aura barista

170
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,000
They wrote like skits for it and I and I commissioned them to write skits for it

171
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,760
When radcon was already like a year or more over

172
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,640
It was already like freaking uh radcon four is already a distant memory and everything's changed

173
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,440
And uh lemau I can't believe we're still doing this and that was like a year and a half ago and now

174
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,400
Even that feels like a distant memory irrelevant. Why are we still why did we still do this?

175
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,120
uh

176
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,640
And yet and yet since a lot of the jokes are sort of at the expense of like ha ha remember how

177
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,760
The pcp was gonna start pcp hq ha ha remember how they work

178
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,680
So how how they thought content was gonna was gonna cantant was gonna go somewhere ha ha remember how uh

179
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,800
What else what else they didn't used to be corona

180
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,800
Whatever a lot of it is jokes about that and and I feel like that stuff has aged pretty well possibly even even better

181
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,080
So then I really think that it was it's written by old head pcp listeners those three

182
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,360
And so I think if you are an old head pcp listener

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,520
You are gonna get a kick out of the gags and the stuff in there that is very very deep cut like ha ha I get this reference

184
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
kind of stuff I think I I think I

185
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,600
am a genius for going with for picking those those three and also

186
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,680
Um drinking moth who has done some sent in some some art to the voicemails

187
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,440
She did uh not all but a lot of the art on it and I just want to shout her out in particular

188
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,480
Because of how good she is and how fast she was like I appreciate so much

189
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
that I would

190
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,000
Tell her like hey, can you draw this page and she'd be like

191
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,840
Yeah, yeah, I'll do that and then she'd have it in like three days or something. She'd be like yeah, here you go

192
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,800
And and and in that and in life. It's not it's it's rare

193
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,920
It's rare to find someone who doesn't ruin your fucking life when you work with them

194
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,960
So I appreciate her a lot

195
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
um

196
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,040

Things didn't go so well with ed

It's a couple by

207
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,680
Kaiju who did not want to be credited as Kaiju

208
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
So it's credited as k instead

209
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm not sure why but that's that's how it that's what he wanted

210
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,800
And then there's uh, am I forgetting someone?

211
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Am I forgetting something?

212
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,320
What?

213
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,000
Uh

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,120
There was the one that simsie drew but only simsie. Uh, yeah simsie sketched one and then Kaiju finished it. Yeah

232
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
That one's really good and I think

233
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
You would like it a lot

There you go. There's the full is the full chapter list and that'll be out very soon

241
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
And that's exciting

242
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,040
That would be the last

243
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,240
piece of radcon for content ever

244
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Yeah, the ova and this

245
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,400
and tech technically wrote to radcon never

246
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,240

247
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,560
I I I I gave backers their copies their physical copies

248
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,000
But I didn't I didn't like publicly digitally release it yet

249
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,400
So I think that'll also be available on the same

250
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
website at the same time

251
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
You can read that as well. Nice

252
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
And then the rad content is done, baby

253
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,520
And then the rad content is all done

254
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,520
And then we can start the preparation for radcon

255
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,320

256
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,480

Uh, we're but speaking of websites

285
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,160
Uh, i'm redoing i'm getting some help to get my give and take dot site

286
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,120
Into a state that is nice and not bad and it is good actually

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,240
Yeah, the moment it's just a little sad

288
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
And there's gonna be uh, oh

289
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,320
Uh, it's gonna have all the comics already have but it's also gonna have a new thing for red man comics

290
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I'm gonna put those on there

291
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,560
And it's gonna have buttons and it's gonna be nice and smooth and works

292
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
And it's not gonna be hosted by wordpress

293
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,360
And it's gonna be and i'm learning all about the code all about the little

294
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
the json and the

295
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Files and the things

296
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,800
Oh very nice very nice. So it's all gonna be easy to upload. I'm gonna be able to like

297
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,400
Just add a bunch of images into a folder

298
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,320
On my computer and then do a little update or thing in a jig and it'll just put them on on the website

299
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Oh, that's really

300
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,280
That's really interesting. That's really good. I actually don't know how to do that. You know, I was

301
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,120
I was I made the website as simple as possible just because

302
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
Like I didn't

303
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,840
If I if I knew how to do that I I I kind of was gonna set it up so that like

304
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,200
There would be the home page and then on the home page

305
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
There would be like a link that you could click for like

306
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,560
The latest episode and it would bring you to the latest episode and then there'd be another link for like

307
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,880
Here's all the episodes

308
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,400
but um

309
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
Yeah, I didn't really know

310
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
How to like set it up

311
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,760
You I would probably I think I would probably need like json or

312
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
um

313
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:15,520
Java or something to have it dynamically have that link like dynamically altered to be like it points to whatever the newest

314
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,160
Like episode is

315
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,360
Because otherwise I would have to like upload all the every little pages individually

316
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,640
And I would rather just upload just just put it in the one

317
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,680
Yeah, it's it's really clever because it's like in the json file is like

318
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,440
there's

319
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,040
you know a

320
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,320
Comic name and then it's got like information about it and then pages and then it says link to this image show this image

321
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,880
And as long as I give it the right file name the same as I give the images

322
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,240
I can just put the images in a folder and then the data file will read it and just put it on the website without me having to do anything

323
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,680
That's really interesting. I mean if you if you once you know how to do that

324
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,280
Do you think you might like be able to like I don't know

325
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,560
Make our website do that with like our homepage just point like have a like well get the new get the newest episode

326
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,840
It's being built by someone else and they're teaching me how to add to it. So I don't know how to make it

327
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
From scratch. I know how to

328
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,480
Yeah to use the things that are already there to like add new pages and update it and stuff

329
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,120
I see because I am my brain shuts down when I look at code most of the time

330
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Really really kicks out of me

331
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,160
Lamal

332
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,280
Lamal

333
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Listen, listen, buddy

334
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
I made endless war

335
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,360
personally

336
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah, you know, that's very good. I created him and I could destroy him

337
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:52,240
But I don't know how to use javascript to make my text link link to a different file

338
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
help

339
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,600
There's just a hundreds of thousands of hours of free tutorials

340
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,560
You just have to look through all of them and find out which one is actually going to tell you the right thing

341
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,680
I just have to freaking comb through thousands and thousands of advice threads on file stack or whatever

342
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,720
people asking how do I do this with my

343
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,960
You know what? I'm just probably gonna not do it

344
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,000
And I'm probably just gonna make the website simple

345
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,280
So you just click the archive and you can just see the list you can just see the list of episodes

346
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,760
Because it's easy um and um, um, what was I gonna say?

347
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
I I don't know

348
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,560
But yeah, that's that's I don't know when that's coming out from my give and take dot site relaunch

349
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,600
Uh when that comes out, I guess I'll be putting

350
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,880
Uh, my new Clarissa gunsmoke chapter on that

351
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,160
Hopefully before that that would be

352
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,160
With bscapades in the first perfect comic party

353
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,160
Uh

354
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,920
Zine

355
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,880
Zine

356
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,840
I I I just threw it. I just I just had to commit to something. I I couldn't think

357
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,320
Zine

358
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,480
You're a you're a I you're a I mean I mean you last week you said

359
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,400
Last week you said Zine. Well, that's how you know it's a fucking computer. That's how you know it's fucking fake

360
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,720
Is that it says things correctly? It's no

361
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
But oh, um the the guy who's building your website

362
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,280
I think we talked about I think I mentioned that like maybe he could build the pcp website and then I ended up just doing it myself

363
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,200
I think he was disappointed that I that I made the pcp website

364
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
myself because like

365
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,840
I I know I listen. I know he could have built a fancier website

366
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,480
I know he could have built a fancier website than I can

367
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
I'm sure he I'm sure of that

368
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,640
I just didn't want to

369
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
I just didn't want a fancy website

370
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,320
I just wanted some bullshit. That's what the pcp deserves

371
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Uh

372
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,200
Just it's just a list of links if you go once then if you go to the new website

373
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,120
It's just a list of links that have the podcast

374
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,320
Yeah

375
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,920
It's just the the pcp website the new pcp website is just an answer to the question. Where's the podcast?

376
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,040
It's right there. It's all right there and that's all it is

377
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
And it's also some extra stuff

378
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,480
But uh, yeah, but yeah, the the perfect comic parties

379
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,720
magazine the magazine the perfect comic party zine is

380
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,880
um

381
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,600
In the works, I guess I'm waiting mostly on you to do some Biscopades

382
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,160
And then once that's done, we'll have our first issue

383
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,400
I mean

384
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,720
Wait a minute. Are you serious that like I just need to give you some pages and then it's like ready to go

385
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, no, but like I'm assuming the the amount of time it'll take for me to make the logo

386
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:09,120
Um and do other stuff will be uh equal or less than the time it'll take for you to do the Biscopades

387
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,080
Okay, I mean that's fair. Yeah, um, I don't know. I think I told you I told you before the show that I have not

388
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,120
I don't know. We thought we talked about scheduling. I know I have not been able to keep up with that schedule

389
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,520
I mean, there's a lot of stuff. I'm falling behind. That's fine. There's a lot of stuff happening right now, especially since the OVA is finished

390
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,000
Um, Radcom is taking like precedent in our minds to get that finally sorted out

391
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Yeah, um perfect comic party

392
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,800
is

393
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,320
Cool, I like it. I like the idea. Yeah

394
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,480
and

395
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Yeah, next week. I'm mostly going to be working on

396
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,960
Uh, the the logo for that the pdf and once I'm done with that, I guess I'll be working on chapter five of Clarissa

397
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,280
But then we're gonna we're gonna put it together. We're gonna make a little thing

398
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,240
And then you will be able to read it on the new website. Hopefully it will

399
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,760
It will be on the new website. Yeah, it will be on the new website. I I've made it so that it is like equally

400
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Equally prominent

401
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,320
On the new website to the podcast. It has its own

402
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,680
It basically the the left side of is the podcast on the right side of the home page is the

403
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,880
It will be the perfect perfect comic party. Um, yeah, I have um

404
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
Um

405
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,680
What are we gonna do it needs like it's probably gonna need like a cover page

406
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,760
And it's probably a page of like

407
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,320
Thanks for reading. Here's some links to support us. Here's our patreon. Here's our ko-fi

408
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,200
Sure, sure. Yeah, and then and then a thank you page for patrons, right?

409
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so

410
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
um, oh, yeah, we haven't

411
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,400
I've I yeah the the idea of like a thank you like

412
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,080
Little you put names on the thing you put names on the content if you're a patron

413
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,720
Yeah, should we put every patron? I I think we should put like every five dollar patron. Okay

414
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,720
Yeah, so that's a five dollar reward tier on the patreon now

415
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,760
which we need to

416
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,880
We need to revamp that patron patron. There's lots of things like in the works to be like

417
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,920
Got done. So I'm not going to be like too worried if certain things get

418
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
Pushed back a bit

419
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,840
Yeah, I just want them to be done one after the other bit by bit things will be uploaded

420
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,480
Completed

421
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480

Like I don't know a little while

423
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
There'll be less bullshit

424
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
If we could just live

425
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,360
Live our stupid lives finally finally we can just live our stupid lives like we always wanted to

426

Is a big thing that like I'm trying to get done and we're trying to do right now the new website

432
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000

433
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Radcon stuff is finishing in the ova

434
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
also coincidentally

00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,400
You know, well not coincidentally, but also the the dojin

436

Um, did I talk about those? Did I show those? No, I think it was just this week that I got the the images

443
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,200

444
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,920

455
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840

Um, hang on I'll I'll check my discord because I posted

457
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,960

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,160
No, it was on the first yeah on march 1st. I got the first the pictures

459
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Of slime and punishment

460
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,240
and

461
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,000
Should I

462
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Should I post them?

463
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
I don't know I could I could repost them here

464
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
I don't know

465
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,640
Maybe it's too hard. Maybe it's too hard to copy paste a set of images. Yeah, you know what you know what I mean

466
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,320
Yeah

467
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
It's it's just so difficult

468
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,080
uh

469
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
Wait, I'll I'll do like two

470
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
There there's one

471
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Nice thumb Ben

472
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,120
What nice thumb Ben. That's your thumb. That's my thumb

473
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,560
I think this is the lady. I think this is the lady that ghosted me and that I had the catfish

474
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,880
I mean, it could be someone else that works at the the company

475
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,240
Hey, look look look carefully at these two covers

476
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Uh, you just you might be able to tell that they're slightly different like color

477
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Oh, yeah, one of them is more vibrant

478
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,720
I the one on the left is like

479
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,680
Yellower and the one on the right is like

480
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,920
paler

481
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,240
The guru the greens you can if you look at the green of the text you can see the difference

482
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:18,880
Uh, yeah

483
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,640
If you look at the text you can see the different greens and if you look at endless war you can see on the left

484
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,480
His like shadowed side is like darker and on the right side. It's like brighter

485
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,360
So these are like the two different like filters that I use to adjust for the greens because I mean, you know from printing the red man comics

486
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,880
That when you try to print print print when you try to print

487
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,840
Like uh, like fully vibrant green. It turns to like mud, right? Yeah

488
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
So these are the two I don't have green and

489
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,560
in ink

490
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,120
And I think these came out pretty good. I'm not sure which I prefer but maybe when I when I have them in person

491
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
I will look at them and be like

492
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,080
Also also

493
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,440
This is really annoying

494
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,720
But the way that like the just the corner of endless war sticks over that like the like crease line at the spine

495
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:12,400
Uh, yeah, I see it really annoys me and I'll probably like nudge him over a little bit and like maybe try again

496
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,120
Just nudge him over a few millimeters just to just to have him not be creased like that because I don't like it

497
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,760
But yeah

498
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,920
There it there it is. That's what it's gonna look like

499
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,360
It's gonna get it real soon and then I'll do a

500
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,200
Freaking do want to do a freaking Kickstarter about it. Why don't you?

501
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,440
um

502
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,640
that'll

503
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,120
That'll have to come after probably after the the

504
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:45,360
Not I can't really even think about that until perfect comic party and um the website and the ova and stuff is all

505
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
taken care of

506
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
So many things on my plate

507
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
So many irons in that fire

508
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
I do have irons in the fire

509
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,920
I do

510
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,200
um

511
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,400
I've got so many as well. I've got like a big long list of things

512
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,560
Really more?

513
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,840
um

514
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,120
well, the the mostly like additional

515
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,320
Inc to like oh, I I need to think about I need to talk to that one guy about

516
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
like uh

517
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,360
if I can

518
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:26,480
Getting in a room with a fucking producer or something to talk about chlorissa potentially being something other than a comic

519
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Like he's he was gonna talk to me about like

520
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
um, you've got a really good thing here

521
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:38,160
Talk to me. We'll we'll hash out like a pitch and you can we we can pitch it. I'm like, uh, okay

522
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Uh, I don't know how to do that

523
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,680
And so that I got to look into that I got to ask him about that and then there's also

524
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,600
I should probably try to get some money for chlorissa because like I'm not getting money for it at the moment

525
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
So I was like what if I sell them?

526
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,720
On amazon, what if I have an amazon account? What if I go through all that?

527
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,440
And there's just like all these little things that will not take up that much time

528
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,840
by themselves

529
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,600
And just like yeah, yeah

530
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
My weeks are always packed with stuff

531
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,520
And I just kind of want to draw it kind of want to draw new chapters, but there's always all this marketing stuff

532
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
I got to do as well

533
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
I I feel like

534
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,920
You know

535
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,200
It's funny you say that because I really feel like

536
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,800
This this week especially but in in in

537
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
many recent weeks

538
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah, it's in spite of the fact that I have resolved to draw biscapades. I I feel like I have just had this never-ending

539
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,280
list of like the tasks that I that I have to do before I can actually get down

540
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,680
to do that

541
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,160
Uh, and I haven't done it yet and I just

542
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
It feels like the it feels like the

543
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,080
The things the things that I have to do around

544
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
that are just so

545
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
daunting and and numerous

546
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,720
Uh, that it has kept me from actually doing it

547
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Uh, even though I guess it should be the point

548
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
The content should be the point

549
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
But it's not

550
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,400
Yeah, I don't know the best way to do like the balancing of stuff like that because

551
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
There's that thing they say

552
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
about like oh

553
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,000
You got to do the most important things in your life first because if you fill your life with

554
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
the the minutiae

555
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,040
Of everyday bullshit, you'll never like if you if you spend

556
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,120
If you if you answer all of your stupid emails first instead of following your passions

557
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,080
You'll never run out spend your whole you'll spend your whole life

558
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah, yeah, so like that's that's like a priorities thing. So like even though all these stupid emails will never stop piling up

559
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,720
That's that means you should let them sit let them

560
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,400
Let them rot I guess and focus instead on the more important stuff because the emails will still be there when you come back

561
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,240
and like

562
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,520
That's true of most of the time, which is why I'm trying to focus on the drawing but at the same time

563
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,000
Uh

564
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It'll be good if though if people can buy Clarissa. I should really just get on that. I think I think that's just a good thing

565
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
uh, I think

566
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,360
You definitely have to answer some stupid emails. Yeah

567
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Damn, you know, that's that's a

568
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,040
I've heard that's a good quote and uh now i'm wondering

569
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,120
If maybe I've been doing too much stupid email answering lately

570
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,720
Uh, might maybe probably because I haven't done any any drawing

571
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,960
ha ha

572
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
well, I mean

573
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,600
It sort of consumes you because it's always like yeah

574
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,640
It you you want this this a magical sort of there's nothing going on

575
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
sort of situation

576
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,880
um

577
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,840
And it never acts there's never there's never nothing going on it never. Yeah, there's never nothing going on

578
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,400
That's only when you're like three that that's the case

579
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,400
Yeah

580
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,680
Can't get it back. You can't play video games. I mean you can no, but like it's never gonna be. No, you're right

581
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
I can't I know more video games

582
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,440
I mean I have time for video games because I allocate time for no work

583
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,880
So I'm able to enjoy myself in the evenings

584
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,080
Right, I think is doing a lot good for me because it allows me to like

585
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Constantly be making progress every week

586
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:45,280
Um with like a plan of action that I write on Friday after I finished work like okay next week

587
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
this coming week, I'm like

588
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,000
Do the fucking logo then do the pdf get all that ready

589
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
for a perfect comic party and then

590
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,080
Only once those things are done. I can start drawing Clarissa Gunsmoke during the remaining workouts of the week

591
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,320
And then I know what I'll be doing on Monday. So it's like

592
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,160
and then I have time to enjoy fucking around

593
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
On every day as well. So it's like

594
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,560
It's time

595
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Management it's good

596
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,240
That's nice. That's nice. I mean, I guess it's working for you. Yeah, you're getting

597
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
You're getting work done, which is really nice

598
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
uh

599
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,200
I mean I get to play video games. I do get to play video games on twitch.tv slash st comics

600
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,760
battle network

601
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,800
So

602
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,120
Yes, I do have play some video games. You know what?

603
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
I'm actually really liking

604
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,840
battle network two

605
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,440
a lot

606
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Battle network one was kind of frustrating

607
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
battle network two is like a much they like

608
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
It's basically the same game

609
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:56,720
But they just like were a lot more like deliberate in how they like balanced it and executed it in a way that is just like a lot more

610
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
fun

611
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
If what I mean

612
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,800
Okay, do they still have random battles?

613
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,520
There are random battles, but they're I feel like they're less frequent

614
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
And the battles are more

615
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,280
Well, I what I mean the battles are mostly the same

616
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,240
I feel I feel like there's less of them per like time spent walking

617
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,640
and

618
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,680
uh

619
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,080
Here's the one of the most important things is like

620
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,560
in battle network

621
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,280
One like the core conceded the core concept of the bat the combat is that you have

622
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,000
This like deck of chips that you can use a certain amount of and if you have chips that are the same like

623
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,280
They can either be the same type or they can have like the same like code letter on them

624
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,640
And if either one of those you can match and you can use multiple at the same time sort of like uno or whatever

625
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
So

626
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,040
And if you have certain very specific combinations of them you can you can use like a super attack, right?

627
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,720
In the playing through the entirety of the first game. I use

628
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,280
One super attack ever it only ever happened one time

629
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,400
Uh, I've already had it happen once

630
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,280
Uh, and I'm not even I'm not I'm like only like a third or the way through two

631
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,760
And also

632
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:27,040
It just feels like I'm actually using the combos more like there were I never used like combos in the first game

633
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,160
I just

634
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,520
if

635
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,600
Playing through the second game. I'm finding cards and I'm actually having like oh

636
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,200
This card would go with those two like this card has a letter matching these two. I can use that that makes it useful

637
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,240
They also introduce a thing and two where certain cards are like no letter and no letter cards can be basically matched with

638
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,720
As long as you have only one other letter in your in your stack you can match a no letter card with them

639
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,160
It's like a wild card

640
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,560
So even if you have no matches if you have an asterisk you can use one plus an asterisk

641
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,240
So you it's just more it's just more possible to to think about like which cards do I want to use?

642
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,480
together

643
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,000
And there are now cards that modify other cards and stuff

644
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
and it's like they really

645
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,440
Took the first game, but they did it good

646
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
the second time

647
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,840
Uh, and it's fun. It's cool. I'm liking it more than I expected to

648
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,400
That's good. How long did the first game take then to complete?

649
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,800
I think it took me roughly like 20 hours total. Okay

650
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
And I think the second one's probably gonna be similar

651
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,040
I can't remember how many

652
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,920
How many hours I've played like the fire emblem first game

653
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,520
It's like I missed I missed your stream yesterday. It was in the morning and I was asleep. I I think I should stream

654
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
Later because I I enjoy

655
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,600
Streaming during the day because it's like, I don't know

656
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,480
Nothing really going on. It's just a lazy weekend. Whatever. Yeah, but um

657
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,000
Nobody's around so I should probably stream later

658
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
on Saturday. I think that on

659
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,440
Friday I should stream earlier because the stream my my

660
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,000
On this Friday. I had like a pretty good stream. My my my stream was kind of I mean, you know

661
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,680
Wasn't I wouldn't pop it popping off would be an exaggeration, but it felt like it was popping off

662
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
It had it had more people in there

663
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,440
For me and I I was really high energy

664
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,720
I was people in the in the chat were saying like

665
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,800
What is that? What is this like energetic been like? What is this like hyperben?

666
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,000
I was I was uh, I was going off

667
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,840
and

668
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,440
But like a viewership really started to tank at the end and I think it's just because it got really late

669
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,480
And you know, especially like especially people in europe were like, well, I gotta go to bed, you know

670
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
It's freaking like one in the morning here

671
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,000
So, uh, I'm probably I'm gonna try to try and start streaming maybe around like I've been starting maybe around like six

672
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
Maybe I'll try and start around like four

673
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,080
Or something

674
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,080
Uh, yeah

675
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
I was I was I was

676
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,760
I don't think

677
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,640
I don't know if you I don't know if I should say why I was so energized

678
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,440
In the chat on Friday

679
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
There was there was drama happening

680
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,360
There was there was there was there was there was fighting occurring and I won't I won't go into the details about it

681
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,760
uh

682
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,600
But I was mad

683
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,360
and I was uh

684
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,400
And I was going off about it on my stream

685
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,520
Uh, because I love gossip

686
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Uh

687
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,800
What else are we talking about that's twitch.tv slash st comics twitch.tv slash

688
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:56,480
Hippocrite or the give and take give and take dammit. Ha ha. I never had a hippocrite twitch

689
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,960
Uh

690
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Right, right

691
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,640
Actually, I don't remember when or why I made a twitch account

692
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,000
Well, obviously the stream but like I don't remember for what game. I don't really remember

693
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,240
I don't really remember making tea bath. Didn't you on twitch?

694
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
Right

695
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,480
Maybe but I don't think we ever used it

696
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,680
I think we probably we probably did have an account

697
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,360
I remember because you you have an account that like I followed

698
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,960
Or something

699
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,360
twitch.tv let me let me look twitch.tv slash

700
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
tbbb ap

701
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
There is a tbap

702
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,360
Do we have any videos? No, there are no videos on the tbap twitch account

703
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,720
Maybe just like a parking on that space in case there was another tbbb ap it was trying to muscle in

704
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,920
Oh, the the description on it is tbap who's ready for some shit art

705
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,880
I guess I was intending to to do draw streams

706
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Oh, that probably would be it

707
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,680
I think I was probably

708
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,920
That's really funny. I must have been intending to like draw like phantom horn comics

709
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,560
And then I did draw phantom horn comics and it's called slime and punishment coming soon

710
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,800
But I didn't stream it

711
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,640
Uh, I was struggling

712
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,880
I was really struggling because I wanted to raid somebody

713
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,720
And while I while I was while I was streaming

714
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,240
Uh hazel was live and I wanted to stream her but then she quit right before I was done

715
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,440
Action button was live. I wanted to raid him. He quit right before I was done. I think I ended up raiding. I ended up raiding, um

716
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,800
jonan vasquez

717
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,720
Who is not huge on twitch. I think maybe like 70 people were watching him

718
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,480
so

719
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,240
I got a shout out from

720
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,240
from xanen v

721
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
On twitch was was kind of fun

722
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,280
Uh, I keep forgetting the raid function exists by the time I'm finished with the stream. I'm like, uh, I'm tired. All right. See you

723
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,960
Yeah, I mean me too. And that's why I was like, well, I gotta raid someone

724
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,520
I gotta raid someone because like you literally there's no reason not to freaking raid someone

725
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,080
at the end of your stream

726
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,080
That's just the habit I want to get into

727
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,760
Who is it who the uh, sometimes I see cyber shell streaming

728
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,120
Sometimes cyber shell streaming see hazel streaming. I was surprised to see action button streaming

729
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,600
Uh, and those are all people that I think it would be funny to raid

730
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,840
uh, but

731
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,760
I'm all I all my streams go too long and they always end before I do

732
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
Because I usually stream for like five hours

733
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,480
I think I'm going to try to keep them shorter because it was pointed out in my chat and I looked at the analytics and it's mostly true

734
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,960
I think my stream viewership tends to usually go for about like three hours and then it like tapers off

735
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,720
and I'm not sure if that's

736
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,720
Just like the natural lifespan of a stream or if maybe like I start to lose my

737
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,840
My focus or my enthusiasm my energy around that time and people start dropping off

738
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,080
Because I was really energized for a while and then I eventually I was like, all right. Let's all right

739
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,560
Let's just talk about the game and then I kind of

740
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,040
Yeah, and then you know that was around three hours in and then uh, I guess less

741
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,720
Viewers started to drop off. It depends on

742
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,320
Like international appeal, I suppose but also the time you start

743
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,880
Because like germa

744
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,920
Is my favorite streamer. He sometimes will get obsessed with a game and go for 11 hours

745
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,920
Only are very occasionally. I mean like hit this stream is still buzzing. I don't think it drops off

746
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,560
That significantly

747
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,920
Maybe it does maybe it doesn't it's just always people there. So it doesn't feel like it's like dead

748
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,680
Wouldn't wouldn't know

749
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:59,520
Yeah, I think probably when a when a stream is popular and a lot of people are watching and the chat is going like mile a minute

750
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
probably less people

751
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,680
Probably that means this makes a smaller percentage of the viewership actually be typing

752
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,560
Because more of them are like well my message wouldn't even get seen because the chat's moving so fast

753
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
Uh

754
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,840
Well, uh

755
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,080
All right

756
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:29,200
Ben have you seen the anime revolutionary girl utena?

757
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,920
No, I've never watched it

758
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,520
I've begun watching revolutionary girl utena in my off time and it is very good show

759
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
Oh

760
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:46,000
I remember it being the one I would watch I've heard a lot about it. Yeah, it's like swords and dueling

761
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,920
and

762
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,920
Utena is this pink haired

763
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,800
Girl who dresses like a prince

764
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,000
She she was saved by a prince or like she

765
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,320
Prince found her when she was very young gave her a ring

766
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,320
And he said oh don't cry uh, whatever and then he left and she was like, ah

767
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,440
This guy's so cool. I'm gonna be a prince when I grow up and then she has a sword and it's cool

768
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,680
Oh

769
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,680
gender

770
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
Gender ha ha lesbianism

771
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,440
That's wait wait that reminds me of

772
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,640
What does that remind me of

773
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,280
What did you say gender?

774
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,600
No, I mean that was h bomber guy

775
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,400
Um, no brand brand of tarth. I think I'm thinking of brand of tarth

776
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,280
From game of thrones, you know, yes. Yes. Oh, yeah, you see you're you're a

777
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,480
I'm a throner. You're a throne a throner

778
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,000
Um, I'm a throne head. You're a throne like the the angel with the eyes

779
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
You know about thrones

780
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,640
Uh, you ever you ever see you ever see that biblically accurate angel. That's like a big wheel of eyes

781
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,640
Yes, well, I haven't I haven't seen it in real life. You ever seen it in real life. That's that's a throne

782
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,080
aka a throne rug aka an ophanim

783
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,280
Because uh, it's called that because in like the book of ezekiel or inok or something

784
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:20,560
There's like someone sees the throne of god and like it's like four of these like these four like eye wheels are like wheels

785
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,960
Are like carrying him around or something

786
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,760
They're looking in every direction

787
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,520
Literally true

788
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,120
literally true

789
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,880
Although nowadays there'd be like 360 cameras nowadays

790
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,400
Nowadays those things have a million eyes and 900,000 of them would be woke

791
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,520
Open your eyes. I can't believe

792
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,480
Wokeness has gone so far that even the even the very throne of god himself has been

793
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,880
wokified

794
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,560
gotta

795
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,560
You've got to stop teaching this in schools, man

796
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,560
Um, like like like a conservative like filming on their phone like looking at god

797
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,360
Yeah, like feeling god like I can't believe god is woke. You could believe what has happened

798
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:15,840
God yeah, good god appears before them on his on his throne and like the freaking seraphim spread their like giant like

799
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,840
There's six like rainbow colored wings and they're just like, oh, I can you believe this?

800
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,000
Can you see the grooming they're grooming our they're grooming the spirits of our dead

801
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,360
They're grooming the spirits of our hallowed dead and the saints

802
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,560
That's in the saints that sing god's praises. They're being there's teaching crt

803
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,520
The holy ghost is teaching it

804
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,480
What are we gonna do to vote against this? Yeah

805
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
anyway, utena is great

806
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,440
and uh, I

807
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,800
remember

808
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,160
The one of the one of the first pcp arguments. This is a nostalgia bombshell. I remember this one

809
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:58,080
Do you remember when exactly we were talking about the steven universe clip of pearl doing that famous

810
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,720
Lunge into the camera

811
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,440
Action shot. Yes, and it being like, ah, you know what's so cool about that

812
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,080
It's a reference to a revolutionary girl utena and I watched the show and I got to that part and I was like, oh

813
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,080
It's just like steven universe. It's just like steven

814
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,760
Yeah, yeah, and I think didn't me and jeff poo argue

815
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,720
That was an epic jeff was on that episode

816
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,240
Wow, and someone was arguing with me and I said

817
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,520
homage is always inferior to the original

818
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:33,120
And someone was like, no, it's not and I don't remember if jeff was on my side

819
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,880
Or not. I think I think uh, trixie and jesse were there and I do remember

820
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,320
I do remember it being a big argument that we never remember being there

821
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,360
I don't think I said much on that specifically

822
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,120
Yeah, yeah, it was it was an interesting idea like

823
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
Like a reference

824
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,600
I kind of remember like references are always lesser than the original even if the original

825
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,400
Sometimes is bad just by itself

826
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,040
Yeah, I think that was my position

827
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,680
But it turns out the utena usage of it is better. I like it much more

828
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
Because utena it looks so fucking cool

829
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,080
Her her like princely she she wears like a boy's school uniform, but it's not like the other boys of the school

830
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,200
Um, it's like black. Oh, she's like will smith

831
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:28,240
She's like will smith who wears her who wears the his uh, his his school uniform jacket inside out to show the floral pattern

832
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,560
Yeah

833
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,560
Yeah, it's just like that

834
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,760
um

835
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,600
and uh

836
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,040
Yeah, the

837
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,440
It's like a really cool outfit and then when she goes to do a duel with swords

838
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,240
She walks up this long spiral staircase and there's like metal music playing

839
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,880
like like

840
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,240
It's metal, but there's like anime high-pitched ladies singing like absolute

841
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,640
devastation

842
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,720
Uh abyss and stuff and it's like

843
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,760
It's so like

844
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,080
So metal it's so cool

845
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,200
And they they go to this big huge area looks like a kingdom hearts level boss area

846
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,200
And she does a sword duel and she does that that lunge attack a couple times. There's a bits of

847
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,920
recycled animation, but the animation

848
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,440
Like generally across all of the battles is like really solid

849
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,240
Every time there's a new duel there's a new like set of like really cool cuts

850
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,600
Who is she dueling like other students?

851
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,360
Other students members of like the student council

852
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,120
Of the high school, you know, it's a classic like ha ha anime, but like what if it's school and

853
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,320
Things that are not associated with school for real

854
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,640
Um, is it like a mystic mysticism and like weird magic that is a little bit like the clubs

855
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,800
Is it a little bit like the clubs in kill a kill?

856
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,880
Not I don't think there's like underlings or anything. It's just like these individuals

857
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,200
Who are part of the student student council?

858
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,600
And then there's all of the rest of the students who are like oblivious to all the sword dueling

859
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,400
That's doing their thing

860
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,040
Uh, but like

861
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,000
It's great. I really like the show. I would recommend that you watch that one

862
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,480
Okay, it sounds pretty cool actually

863
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,960
It sounds it sounds like it might be good. Maybe I would watch it

864
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:33,280
Maybe how many episodes is it long? Uh, it's like 30 episodes 31. Oh, that's nothing. So like a couple seasons

865
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,000
And i'm already on episode like 15

866
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:46,640
No, wait, maybe it's more than 30. Maybe it's like 38 I can't remember but uh, it's nice

867
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,360
It's nice and it's not

868
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,680
It's not like um

869
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,600
It's it's odd because it's such a serious

870
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,160
feeling show with like the imagery of the roses and the

871
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:07,600
The gothic sort of architecture and the sword fighting and the princely princes and princesses and the sort of mystical

872
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,240
weird stuff

873
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,640
But then occasionally there's an episode that's like a complete farce a complete joke

874
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,480
Uh, where nanami who is my favorite character?

875
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,440
Who is like the bitchy horrible

876
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,560
Uh, you know high school girl mean girl

877
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:31,680
But she's also like the the pret full comic relief character who constantly is a complete idiot and gets beat up a lot

878
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,440
And there's just like an episode centered around her will be like

879
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:43,760
Like her treating someone like shit and then getting comeuppance in the form of a kangaroo with boxing gloves coming to beat everyone up

880
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,200
It's just a kangaroo. There's no explanation of the kangaroo, but it's there for like

881
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,440
like

882
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,400
I don't know

883
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,840
It's it's such a weird vibe that it strikes where it's so silly

884
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,200
And so serious, you know, I I feel like

885
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,520
I said I've never seen it and I've only heard it talked about and yeah, I couldn't really have told you what john

886
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,760
I mean, I guess I thought that it was a

887
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
romance with like

888
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,200
action

889
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,440
There's romantic stuff and there is that action, but it's not like a it's not

890
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,200
Serious, which is nice. I didn't want it to be like

891
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,920
Like super emotional and serious the whole time. Yeah, I like that. It's goofy sometimes

892
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,880
There's like a little mascot character. That's like a little chubby

893
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:35,040
A little chibi chubby, uh, monkey. That's the size of like a chibi chubby monkey minky

894
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,520
Yeah, a little chubby chubby monkey minky is like the size of like a a grapefruit and he's always doing something silly

895
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,160
and uh

896
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,440
him a

897
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,880
aunty aunty

898
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,880
the princess looking

899
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
to to utena's prince

900
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,640
is uh

901
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,080
she's

902
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,080
She's kind of a fucking weirdo

903
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:03,680
She's like a nice girl, but she's kind of like really autistic and laughs at stupid shit and nobody knows what the hell she's doing

904
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:09,200
It's kind of it's it's endearing in a weird way. There was this part where

905
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:14,160
She was like there was a serious conversation going on between utena and someone else

906
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
and uh aunty was

907
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:22,080
Um, you know, she was there, but she wasn't really listening and then she was making a flip book

908
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,560
Uh using the pages of our math textbook and then she was flipping through it

909
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:31,680
And the scene ends when she just bursts out laughing flipping through the pages and they look at her and like what?

910
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,840
What are you laughing at and she just kind of stopped laughing and they cut to the next scene

911
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,880
She's just kind of a freak

912
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,080
Yeah, I love it. Hmm. I like freaks

913
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,480
Uh, man original. Yeah 39 episodes original run 1997

914
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,520
man

915
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,600
I would have been a tiny person

916
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,080
I wouldn't have been that tiny. I guess I would have been nine

917
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,640
I'm just shit. I mean

918
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,320
I feel old now. No that a that the anime is ancient, but I'm even more so

919
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,600
I guess I'm gonna come years ago is 97

920
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,560
the

921
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,760
20

922
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,760
26

923
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,920
Yes

924
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,320
Wow

925
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,600
I'm a relic and I'm a relic it's over

926
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,080
So it's so over. It's never been more over than it is right now

927
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,920
You know, if you're an age of empires too, you would generate gold

928
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,160
If you're a relic

929
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:46,560
Damn, I guess I'm not a relic then because if you were placed in a monastery, you would generate gold because I'm definitely not generating the gold right now

930
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,920
And I'm definitely not at a monastery

931
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,320
Um

932
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,320
Radcon five at a monastery

933
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,280
We'll generate gold rad cut live

934
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,640
To rad we'll go to the priory

935
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,920
We'll go to the priory in real life radcon five

936
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,520
Yeah, vote should we go and protect democracy in the ukraine?

937
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,360
Or should we take a vow of monasticism and become monks in the in the real life priory?

938
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,600
and uh

939
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,600
And generate and generate gold

940
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,560
Generate gold for our team

941
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,920
Radcon five just generate just be just taking a vow of poverty taking a vow of silence

942
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,720
And getting on stream get and generating gold

943
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:39,760
Yo, yo, hit the dono link to generate some gold and then we have like we have the the twitch the twitch cup

944
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,840
It's just like full of gold coins

945
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,760
I don't think of like a bunch of monks at a monastery, but they all have their own like

946
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,080
streamer rig

947
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,040
So they can like live stream them praying or something. I

948
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,560
I know that like, uh, I know people live stream like church masses

949
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,520
Uh, I wonder if there's any like

950
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,000
I

951
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,600
I bet there are probably monks that stream on twitch

952
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,200
I bet there I bet there probably is at least one. Hang on

953
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,720
I mean the only monks that are really relevant

954
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,680
In terms of like having existence is like

955
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,080
Tibetan monks or like buddhist monks and they don't do technology

956
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,720
as much as they can

957
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,800
the like christian monks

958
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,600
Exist in the same way that we think of them

959
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,720
Well, I mean those are both

960
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,800
I was talking about like like western christian monks

961
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:49,520
Sure, but like I thought you're at your I guess I don't know what the the the the monk like title is about

962
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,000
Because I don't think I've ever met a person who was a monk or even known of a person who was a monk

963
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,960
I've known people who are priests

964
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,760
or vicars

965
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,760
Vickers are more common. Okay, they're

966
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,200
Okay, I think I've heard of this guy dr. K

967
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,080
That does it ring a bell?

968
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,320
Yeah, health health. Yeah. Yeah, it's the healthy gamer healthy gamer gg

969
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:18,400
That guy healthy. I mean, I think he's an x-munk. I think he's a former monk who became like a psychiatrist

970
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,320
So I don't know if that really counts. I'm just trying to go like active monks

971
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,760
Go to twitch.tv slash for active monks active monk

972
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,840
Uh, well, I mean this youtube channel calls how a game addicted monk became twitch's go-to therapist

973
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,640
But no, I'm talking about like someone like streaming live from the monastery

974
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,160
I mean, it's hard because when you search monk you find like

975
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,600
Video game monks like like d&d. Yeah

976
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,640
Fucking runescape monk

977
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:56,320
Well, you know, I bet I bet it's a thing. I bet it is a real thing, but it's probably they're probably not gaming

978
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:02,320
They're probably not generating gold. They're probably well, I mean, it's maybe if there's a really popular one

979
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,200
um

980
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,400
I wonder if maybe some do it and like give like

981
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,480
religious advice or something. Maybe they have like just a just chatting like

982
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,360
Yeah, you know talk to this really popular monk and he'll tell you about

983
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,960
What god wants you to do in your marriage or whatever. I guess that's probably more of a priest thing than a monk thing

984
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,760
Yeah, I think monk is like a lower level

985
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,680
What is a monk is basically just a freaking like a priest in training

986
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:36,960
I always thought of it as like like if they are historically like medieval or whatever

987
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:43,840
The monks would go to practice praying and discipline in the churches and the monasteries and the priories

988
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,560
um, and then rise the ranks

989
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,600
But they would mostly be there as like servants for the older

990
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:55,440
members of the church who didn't want to clean the floors and and the toilets and make all the food

991
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,440
A monastery is not is not a church

992
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:06,640
I think that a monastery. I mean it might have a church in it, but I think a monastery is basically just like a dormitory

993
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,960
where monks

994
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,360
Just live and and do I think it's like a freaking

995
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,240
Work camp basically

996
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,640
It's a little town religiously themed. It's a place where you

997
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,720
Go or are sent to just live there

998
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,760
And when you live there as a monk, you know you abide by these monkish rules

999
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,320
And and probably a lot of them do eventually become

1000
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,960
priests or take on other like

1001
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,360
roles in the church, but like not I don't think necessarily you're like

1002
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:45,040
Oh, I'm putting in my my obligatory service hours as a monk before I

1003
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,240
graduate I mean think some of them do probably do that

1004
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,440
But probably not all

1005
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,160
damn

1006
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,400
That's just I just had a thought that like what if I was a monk

1007
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,400
But I was just like a kind of a shitty one and I just like never

1008
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,040
I just stayed a monk my whole life

1009
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,720
probably would too

1010
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,120
I probably would have no outstanding qualities and I would just I would just never graduate from monkhood. I would probably just uh

1011
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,120
I would probably just be making cheese wheels my whole life

1012
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,640
Maybe maybe they would put me on duty illuminating some manuscripts if I was lucky

1013
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,840
But I wouldn't be like the the guy who illuminates manuscripts. I would just be like an apprentice

1014
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,520
Someone else would probably be better at illuminating those manuscripts than me

1015
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,720
I don't know. I don't think I don't think I would have cut it

1016
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,120
I don't think I would have cut it as a monk

1017
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,160
Just imagine that being like you say that as you're like

1018
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,200
Like hunched over and just kicking a rock

1019
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,560
You know in the monastery courtyard like yeah, I'll never be the guy who illuminates the manuscripts

1020
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,280
I mean I've practiced some illuminations on my own parchment, but uh, it's just not

1021
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,480
It's just not that impressive. I just don't know what it takes

1022
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:06,080
Well, these other guys they thank god comes to them all the time. It's just like he doesn't come to me that much

1023
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,760
You know what I mean by illuminating manuscripts, right?

1024
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:19,680
Uh, like illumination entertainment the minion animation studio. That's that's it. It literally means illustrating

1025
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:27,840
That's what you call it when like a big fancy old medieval text has like freaking like a big fancy letter and like like little drawings in the margins and stuff

1026
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:34,880
Like that's an illuminated manuscript. It's illuminated in the sense that yeah, you've drawn little pictures on it

1027
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:42,640
So, okay, what is ilu then like there's illusion there's

1028
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,480
There's illuminate and there's illustration

1029
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:51,200
What's ilu? It's like a fucking Latin word. It probably means to show or to reveal

1030
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,120
Or maybe to see

1031
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:02,080
Yeah, illuminated manuscript is formally prepared document where the text is supplemented with flourishes such as borders and miniature illustrations

1032
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,680
Uh

1033
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,920
Illusion etymology

1034
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
illustrary illustrary

1035
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,080
late middle english

1036
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,520
Illumination spiritual or intellectual enlightenment

1037
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,640
What do you mean? What does it mean?

1038
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,400
Where's the first one? It means light. Okay

1039
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,560
Illuminates from the verb illuminari from in upon and lumen

1040
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,120
Lumen or lumen means light and in so so

1041
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,160
In light so light

1042
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,560
in

1043
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,120
You light upon you put you shed light upon it

1044
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,240
That's why like reading something can be illuminating for your mind, I guess

1045
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,440
Yeah, it's it's illuminating and that it lights it up

1046
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,280
So light being

1047
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,280
Not physical light necessarily

1048
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,040
Yeah, I guess light has a lot of of connotations of

1049
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,680
like

1050
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,680
spiritual and

1051
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,280
intellectual like

1052
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,920
I see the light. I get it light bulb goes off my head and I understand

1053
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,800
My brain is on fire right now

1054
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,240
Um, I think I think that in old in middle english and latin

1055
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,680
As today. Yeah to illuminate something

1056
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,520
To give put light on something had had metaphorical

1057
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,160
meaning in the sense that it also

1058
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,680
It all to reveals something or um

1059
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,280
Maybe just uh

1060
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,960
It what's the enhances or uh

1061
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,960
uh

1062
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,120
I mean when you're illustrating something you're illuminating in the sense and that you're like brightening it up

1063
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,320
It could mean that it's like brightening it up like making it nicer and illuminating it in that sense

1064
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,480
Or it could mean and because it's in like this monastic context

1065
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,000
It could mean

1066
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,720
Something like yeah, you're shedding the light of god upon it because the what you're the decorations and the illustrations are divinely

1067
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,680
Inspired maybe

1068
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,880
Light has a lot of fucking history around it light does

1069
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,600
the word

1070
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,520
It's as old as the universe actually I guess I suppose so

1071
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,240
it's just funny how like

1072
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,000
I think of light mostly is like. Oh, yes photons

1073
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,240
You know

1074
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,240
Or like something isn't heavy right

1075
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,200
But then of all these all these things that it

1076
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:46,400
Historically refers to a little different. I was talking um

1077
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,600
Long time ago probably maybe months ago in my discord about like

1078
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,120
Uh, how you would go about

1079
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:06,240
Acquiring how would you how would you go about uh, basically doing dyson sphere stuff to like acquire solar energy more efficiently?

1080
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,400
And uh, we were just we were talking about like

1081
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,040
Uh, okay. You mean you know what a Dyson spirit?

1082
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Uh, it's a star trek idea

1083
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,840
More or less. Yeah, where you use

1084
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:32,320
You build a structure around a sun to harvest its energy. Yeah, uh to I don't know shoot lasers or whatever or whatever

1085
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,960
yeah, uh, so like

1086
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,440
The building like a solid sphere would be really hard

1087
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:43,120
But what you could almost just what you could also do

1088
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:49,520
Is you could build just a ring around it and like then the the ring would also catch the light

1089
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:56,720
You know not as much as the sphere, but you know, it's a start or you could instead of putting building a solid object around it

1090
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:03,600
You could just put like a like a swarm of like small orbiting bodies and like a big cloud around it

1091
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,440
That would orbit it and like little little solar panels that would also

1092
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,880
absorb the light and the idea then

1093
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:15,200
Would be well if we want to use that energy on earth, it would have to

1094
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,640
somehow transmit that energy back to earth

1095
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,760
So you would have a huge swarm maybe in a ring shape around the sun of these

1096
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:29,200
Uh panels and they would be catching the solar energy and then they would have to somehow

1097
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,320
Transmit the energy back to earth and I feel like the easiest way to do that would be like

1098
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,120
A laser they would have to fire a laser

1099
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,440
at earth

1100
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,560
Towards maybe like a satellite that was in space over the earth that would have some sort of receiving

1101
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,200
a photoreceptor that could absorb the energy from

1102
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,760
The lasers that the these photo or these solar

1103
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,560
receptacles would be firing at it

1104
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,040
And I was thinking okay

1105
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,200
Well, is it feasible?

1106
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:08,480
To is it feasible to have a laser that travels that far like basically from the sun to the earth?

1107
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,120
uh and like

1108
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,040
stays

1109
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,040
As a coherent beam

1110
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:20,240
You know because lasers are not like perfectly parallel like they do sort of widen as they travel

1111
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,360
And I don't know I I crunched some numbers really quick and I like I looked up some

1112
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:30,880
There because okay, there's a thing where like the the the beam is a parallel beam

1113
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,200
But it's also a wave and so like there's no

1114
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,880
There's no way to construct a laser where the lines go perfectly parallel and they stay perfectly parallel forever

1115
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,200
And the rate at which the like the widening of the wave sort of happens

1116
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,080
It depends on a bunch of things it depends on like the original aperture that it's fired from

1117
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,720
And it depends on the the the the wavelength of the laser

1118
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,040
photon

1119
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,920
And I did some and I did some crunch some numbers around and I ended up coming up with the result that yeah

1120
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,880
If you use like a very high like ultraviolet

1121
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,200
wavelength laser

1122
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:09,840
Yeah, you could fire a beam from the sun to the earth and you could

1123
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,240
You could keep a beam diffusion down

1124
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,080
And I think the result that I came up with was that you could probably do it

1125
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,600
And it wouldn't you you could without the beam spreading over more than maybe like a couple meters wide

1126
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,160
So you could in theory have

1127
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,520
A beam and you could have a satellite in the in the sky

1128
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,160
Up in space that would have a big photo receiver

1129
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:37,600
And I feel like the receiver could maybe just be a few meters wide and that would be enough to like okay

1130
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
The the beams are still getting into it and I was like hmm. That's kind of sounds

1131
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,480
Pretty feasible. I don't know that that doesn't sound that crazy actually

1132
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:54,160
And then the satellite will take the laser and convert it into battery energy and then shoot batteries down at earth

1133
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,920
It's like it's like pooping a stream of batteries down

1134
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,640
Yeah, little tiny little AA batteries and then like and then like poor disenfranchised children from third world countries

1135
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:10,160
Will go and like stand with like woven baskets around where they know like oh here every day at 3 p.m

1136
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:17,840
Like the the battery like the the AA battery boy come just come careening down from space

1137
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,600
Shattering bones

1138
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,840
Yep, that's right. That's right

1139
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,600
I mean, I think that I think that then probably uh, you would probably have it would fire another laser

1140
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:38,000
Through the atmosphere that would probably have to be received on the ground somewhere

1141
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:45,840
Yeah, and you would lose some energy there to like atmospheric diffusion or whatever dispersal, but like, you know

1142
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,480
How much of the sun's energy are you blocking from reaching earth normally?

1143
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,600
I mean not not most of it

1144
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,240
the sum

1145
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,360
The sum

1146
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:02,080
But that's okay. I mean, it's got to get here somehow. You got it. You got to deal with area. I mean we could build it

1147
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,080
We could build a cord

1148
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:09,280
Could we run a cord like an electrical cable from like a satellite in space

1149
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,400
To earth to transmit like electrical energy

1150
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:20,080
Where would you plug it in it would be constantly spinning around the earth? No, no not necessarily because you you can um

1151
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:28,160
You can set up a satellite to orbit in lockstep with the earth's rotation so that the satellite stays directly above

1152
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,040
a specific spot

1153
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:39,200
I would say then that it's likely that a cord of that length would be so heavy that it would pull the satellite to the ground

1154
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,480
Like it would be it would need to be

1155
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,320
so far away

1156
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:51,920
That enough of the cord is in the vacuum of space so that it's not being pulled to earth

1157
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,720
I think you could probably account

1158
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:02,080
For like, yeah the gravity of the cord. I think you could probably account for that in in like the the satellites

1159
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,520
orbital momentum or something

1160
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,400
I think you

1161
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,720
I don't know

1162
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,120
I think you could do it but I sort of thing that

1163
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,920
Like a kid would think oh, why don't you just have

1164
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:22,240
You know a really really tall thing. Why really really long wire. Just want you to make a really long wire

1165
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,240
Why can't you build a tower that just keeps going up and up and up? It's because the weight of the thing

1166
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,960
It's it's not really that intuitive

1167
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:34,480
But like the weight of the thing as it gets taller is so much that it would crumple it would pull itself back to earth

1168
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,400
You would need so much support or it would need to be

1169
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,960
so tightly

1170
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,920
Like it would be you need to be so I don't know

1171
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,000
There's no drag in space. So it's not like air resistance is going to be a factor

1172
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:52,160
No, no, because the court's not moving if you have a if you have a synchronous

1173
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,680
Satellite in a satellite in synchronous orbit with the earth's rotation. The the cord wouldn't really be moving

1174
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,680
So once it's up there, it wouldn't have to deal with drag

1175
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,280
There would be a lot of cord that was like

1176
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,920
Yeah, it would be going up for miles and miles and miles and yeah, it would be heavy

1177
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,720
Maybe you'd have to like start the cord at the satellite and then lower it down

1178
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,440
Yeah, you could do it that way

1179
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,480
I

1180
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,840
You know, it might be one of those things that like

1181
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:31,600
Theoretically you could do it but like in practice. Yeah, like like the the pull of the cord would just be like the satellite

1182
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,800
It's unreasonable to think that the satellite would be unaffected by

1183
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,520
Yeah wind forces

1184
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,160
And whatever else

1185
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,480
That might affect

1186
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,920
That might just be too disruptive to like a stable orbit

1187
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:51,040
It would be funny though. What if a little little space mouse and short chews through the cord

1188
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,760
Space mouse

1189
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,120
Little space mouse is like right at the edge of the the atmosphere and he goes no

1190
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,480
Yeah, yeah, they would have to watch out for that. They would definitely have to watch out for that. Oh

1191
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,240
um

1192
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:11,840
Shit wait, I want to take a picture of something. Give me give me one second. I'll be right back

1193
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,480
Oh, no, no another dick pics

1194
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,880
He didn't hear that a few moments later

1195
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,480
Oh

1196
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,720
My homey. Oh homey. It's me March

1197
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,920
March, it's me

1198
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,600
Oh, it's me March and this is what I say

1199
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,400
Oh homey. Why did you have to kill Bart?

1200
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,320
I was working on making him

1201
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:30,880
The bestest son there ever was you just killed him. What are we gonna do homey?

1202
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,240
What are we gonna do? All right, shut up March?

1203
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,160
Dad's back from the plant

1204
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,640
and uh

1205
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,000
All right, so here's my here's my setup right now

1206
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,520
Uh, this is like

1207
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,920
This is this is how it's progressed

1208
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,240
So basically uh on the left you have

1209
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,040
the the original

1210
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,080
tonic

1211
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,080
that I boiled down

1212
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,880
The the the diet tonic that I boiled down

1213
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:09,200
Uh really really far and I let it sit and it eventually sort of congealed into a puck

1214
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:15,440
So what I did to all these is I added alcohol to them. I just added like pure like isopropyl alcohol

1215
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,720
And then in the middle

1216
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:26,400
Is the one that I added baking soda to to neutralize the acid and it turned it green and it like made it all clumpy

1217
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,720
And you can see in the original one

1218
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:34,880
There's some kind of like chunky like salt or some kind of like powder or like crusty stuff at the bottom

1219
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:40,880
And I think that might be like a salt that the quinine is incorporated in because the salt is like glowing really

1220
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,640
bright blue

1221
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:46,800
And then in the middle is the stuff that I added the baking soda to and you know

1222
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,800
It's got this chunky stuff at the bottom white kind of like like goopy stuff

1223
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,480
And then in the right is I sort of like siphoned. I used a

1224
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,280
syringe

1225
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,280
to to suck up

1226
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,280
Basically the glowing green

1227
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,280
Liquid sort of rose to the top

1228
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,360
So I like sucked that off the top

1229
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:09,520
And then I put it in that that cup on the right and I used a coffee filter to filter like the bits out

1230
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,520
So it's like just the liquid

1231
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,400
so um

1232
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,440
Yeah, this is what this is for this is for the the the face paint

1233
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,000
Not anymore

1234
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,400
It's just for real life. It's just to have it

1235
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,400
Just to see what happens to smear on the wall. I don't know

1236
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,040
uh, I just

1237
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,200
At this point. I'm just seeing what happens

1238
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:40,160
Uh, I just think I think that eventually the alcohol in the one on the right will just sort of boil off

1239
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,040
and I'll be left with um

1240
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,840
possibly pure quinine

1241
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,160
or maybe some combination of

1242
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,480
Uh sodium citrate and quinine or maybe

1243
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,880
Maybe maybe just aspartame and quinine

1244
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,040
Um

1245
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:04,800
Yeah, I mean uh and then on the left I'm definitely I'm definitely not putting this stuff on my teeth

1246
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,320
Sure

1247
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,480
Uh

1248
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,760
Slime it it's just it's yeah, I just got some glowing goo

1249
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,880
In my room. You're a slime man, sir. I'm a slime. I'm a lean. I'm a limo man, sir

1250
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,800
We were I was gonna add because you know, I I had plans at one point in in endless war to add um

1251
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,760
A method of you could

1252
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:35,840
It was basically be like a sort of a progression outside of the regular leveling system. It would be a form of like

1253
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:41,440
Something of a way that you can progress your character that persists between

1254
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,080
Uh

1255
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,400
Lives and it would basically it was limo mancy and it was basically like

1256
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,360
An ability to fight

1257
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,960
without a weapon

1258
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,400
basically by like slime based telekinesis that

1259
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:01,360
I mean on a particular given run you probably could do more damage with a weapon

1260
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:07,120
But like if you knew limo mancy, you would basically have like a certain baseline combat ability

1261
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,520
That you would always have when you respawned even even weaponless

1262
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,600
And it was going to be something that you had to take classes on

1263
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,320
at um

1264
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,800
nlacu

1265
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:28,720
Not not the shitty not the shitty uh, what what's what's the shitty like community college called? Um

1266
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:36,880
What an endless war I had no idea. Yeah, yeah in endless war there's there's new los angeles city university nlacu

1267
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,320
and that's like the fancy one, but then there's like there's also, uh

1268
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,560
Neo milwauke neo milwauke state or like neo milwauke community college

1269
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,120
and uh

1270
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,040
Basically to become a limo mancer you would have to pay exorbitant tuition fees

1271
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:59,120
It was it was basically going to be like like a money sink like like if there's nothing if you have too much money

1272
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:05,600
And there's nothing else to spend your money on you just you sink it into limo mancy to become a powerful limo mancer

1273
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,600
And that's just like a thing that persists

1274
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,840
It's a small thing that doesn't really make you more powerful in like the overall metagame

1275
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,680
But it gives you like a certain benefit that carries over in between

1276
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,240
runs basically

1277
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,240
And I don't think it was ever implemented

1278
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,640
uh, but that's

1279
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,800
Exactly what i'm doing slime congeals right is right you study slime

1280
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and slime accessories

1281
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,640
Um

1282
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,320
But I think I mentioned yeah, I put the glowing powder in the tooth makeup

1283
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,880
and the effect

1284
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,200
You know what I'll show the picture that I posted

1285
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:53,920
This I've given I gave up on the quinine. I gave up on the tonic. It was too complicated and stupid and probably dangerous

1286
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,640
to my tooth health

1287
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,960
But I mean when would that stop a slime boy?

1288
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,720
uh, but uh

1289
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,200
So I tried the

1290
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
I tried the um

1291
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,200
No, not copy link copy image

1292
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:15,760
I tried putting the glowing stuff in the tooth makeup and uh, here are the results

1293
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,400
and uh, you can't

1294
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,480
Couldn't could not be more pleased with the

1295
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,000
Yeah, it's so good. It's so good

1296
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:29,200
Um, so I hope to do a little bit. I hope to do a little skit with that

1297
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,880
Not exactly sure what the trailer will hat will be

1298
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,920
Probably probably just a little thing where like I'm thinking maybe it's like oh

1299
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,880
The framing of it is like

1300
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,720
Oh, the the cop killer is addressing you like uh, you want to join my oh, you're new in town, huh?

1301
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:53,840
You want to join a gang? Well here read this read this graphic novel by ben sain

1302
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,600
It will tell you everything you need to know about life here in new los angeles city

1303
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,320
Something like that

1304
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,120
If you hold up the book in the video will it be

1305
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Let's well enough to see what it is

1306
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:10,880
Uh, yeah, I think I'll probably have to do a cut

1307
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,200
I'll probably have to like cut to me

1308
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,400
Yeah, because if I hold the book up in this light, it will not

1309
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,440
You might not be able to see what it is and it'll look weird. So yeah, that is a concern

1310
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,360
I could but I could probably do a little a little

1311
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,880
I mean, you got a great screen. You could do a funny like floating book thing

1312
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:35,280
Oh, that's true. Yeah, but oh, I could just limo man see it in the cop killer is a master limo man sir

1313
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:40,640
And he just whoo an intelligent he's so powerful

1314
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,040
Yeah, yeah, I could wear

1315
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,880
um

1316
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,880
Yeah, this is all

1317
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:54,320
I'm just gonna film something and then I'll just kind of try and fuck around with it in vegas to like see

1318
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:02,240
What can I do with this? How can I make this look kind of funny or presentable or reasonable?

1319
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,360
Uh, yeah

1320
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,600
Don't don't exactly know what he's gonna look like

1321
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,760
But anyway, I love I love that like

1322
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,240
You can just see the glow like bouncing off of the ridge of your nose a little bit

1323
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,520
Yeah, so it's like oh it is there, you know, it's like it doesn't look like it's just a cut out thing

1324
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,320
It looks like your face is glowing

1325
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,880
And it because it is because it is

1326
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,920
It's a tactile practice. So I was practical effects practical effects

1327
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,600
I

1328
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,360
oh

1329
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,960
I don't like how my face looks not in this picture. I mean just generally

1330
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,680
But that's okay

1331
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,720
You know, they'll be distracted by the glowing teeth true

1332
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,880
You know what would have been cool and probably some people could do this is if I could print

1333
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,280
with like fluorescent ink

1334
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I'm sure that some printers do that

1335
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:02,080
But I do think it's kind of like a sort of weird and unusual like boutique

1336
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,520
printing

1337
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,840
Yeah, that would cost like a huge amount

1338
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:12,880
First of all most printers probably couldn't do it and even the ones that could are probably more expensive baseline

1339
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,520
And I'm sure they would charge

1340
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:20,240
Yeah, out the ass to print in specialty ink, although maybe if it was just the cover it wouldn't be that bad

1341
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:25,200
But whatever this printer doesn't offer the service and it's the one I'm going with so

1342
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,240
I don't know. Maybe if I maybe if it sells like gangbusters and I have to print a special edition

1343
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,880
10 years from now, we'll do the 10th anniversary special edition with glow in the dark

1344
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,760
cover

1345
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,400
Yeah

1346
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,160
Now that now that would be how you achieved like a real like

1347
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,720
neon green

1348
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,440
Print I think is if you use like fluorescent yellow ink

1349
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,960
The highlighter ink

1350
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,600
Never never paint seems unnerved by the

1351
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,920
As usually that's the point

1352
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,920
It's meant to be

1353
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,920
Highly it's meant to scare

1354
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,760
People away

1355
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,600
It's not they don't pledge. It's meant to

1356
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:15,040
Exactly right. It's meant to scare away those low rolling

1357
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,600
Poor juvies without two slime coin to clink together. Sorry

1358
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:27,600
Captains of industry and high level gangsters only only the real slime heads are going to stick around through this pitch

1359
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,160
To buy my freaking book

1360
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,120
You know what I'm saying

1361
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,240
Still waiting on my orange green screen to come in the mail

1362
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:40,720
I just remembered. Yeah that I have a single slime coin, but not two

1363
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,720
I'm currently looking at it. I wonder um

1364
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,760
You know, I haven't tried putting the slime coin under a black light

1365
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,840
Some of the some of the enamel pins that I got actually do

1366
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,400
Look really good under a black light

1367
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,880
But I don't know if the coins do

1368
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,400
Red band would probably be like completely black

1369
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,200
Yeah, I don't think aside from his eyes. I guess wait

1370
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:11,600
Give me go back to being marge. This will this will only take this will take less time than the first time

1371
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,680
I know exactly where it is. I don't

1372
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:20,720
My marge bit was was it was it was a spur of the moment. What else can marge do other than say help me?

1373
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:28,800
Help me I'm marge simpson like that's it. That's the whole bit

1374
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,400
Um

1375
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,400
Yo, oh, holy shit

1376
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,640
Alpen's

1377
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,640
ecstatic

1378
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,640
I heard him exclaim

1379
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,880
Hey gamers

1380
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,840
Oh

1381
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,800
Oh

1382
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,800
Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm I'm thinking we're glowing

1383
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,040
Yeah, that's glowing. Yeah, I'm thinking we're glowing under that black light

1384
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,520
That looks really good. That looks super good that rules

1385
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:02,880
I was afraid it wasn't yeah, I guess I got to get a black light or like an ultraviolet light. Is that

1386
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,560
similar enough?

1387
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,920
Uh, I mean, I think I think I kind of have like an ultraviolet light like a tiny little light bulb and like a

1388
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,680
Toy thing. I think I think that's what a black light is basically

1389
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,200
Well, how would you do?

1390
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,960
Uh, I have like

1391
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,560
I have like a big one. I have two like big like standing ones now

1392
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,520
I also have a little tiny like little little mini flashlight of one

1393
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,960
That's what I used to use. Uh, but now I have these the big ones. So

1394
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,240
That's really cool. It looks super good

1395
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,920
Uh, what was it? What were you talking about?

1396
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,600
Enough enough of me showing off my funny my funny goo

1397
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,400
Um, I guess nothing

1398
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,520
Hmm. I said go watch Utena

1399
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,200
I can't wait to get back to that

1400
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,200
Uh

1401
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,000
Fucking Clarissa fucking this and that whatever

1402
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,960
This and that

1403
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:06,080
I don't know. I guess my my week has been mostly about redoing the give and take website

1404
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,360
and thinking about Clarissa stuff

1405
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:14,480
And playing runescape and watching Utena and that's it

1406
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:19,600
My weeks are very regimented and simple and they just just keep going

1407
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,800
But cool cool

1408
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,440
I do feel sometimes that I'm like

1409
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,520
It's too

1410
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:34,400
Similar like the days are too similar. I'm getting amount of I've got I'm getting an amount of work done and it's all positive

1411
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,440
But I like I wake up. I do the work and I

1412
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,680
I relax with the things that I want to relax with which are the same things

1413
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:47,200
I'm like, maybe I need to switch it up a little bit. I don't really know what to do

1414
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:52,160
It's it's still too annoying and cold outside for me to feel like I can go

1415
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,920
For a nice walk, but I think I should do that. I think I should do some more walks

1416
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,680
Mmm. Yeah, I yeah, the cold is um cold makes me want to stay inside

1417
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,720
It's been the cold everything sucks when it's cold

1418
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,280
it's been colder like

1419
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,360
now in like early march

1420
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,880
then it was

1421
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,080
Like it was really it was very mild like most of winter and now

1422
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,600
end of february it's finally like like

1423
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,040
below freezing like snowing temperatures a little bit

1424
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,640
It was like it was like felt like it was like 40 degrees

1425
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:31,520
Uh, most of the through most of winter just kind of nice. I mean I like that

1426
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,520
Um

1427
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:46,240
Uh, I guess shall we go to voicemails? How long how long we've been going an hour an hour 30? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Um, you know what?

1428
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,400
there actually was

1429
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,280
Oh on my stream

1430
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,280
The guy that sent a voicemail

1431
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,320
From last week said that I didn't read

1432
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,120
his voicemail

1433
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,920
Because I was too distracted by the image

1434
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,440
Uh

1435
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,440
That he sent so

1436
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,200
It was it was the one um

1437
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:16,400
It was the one that was I think it was called like why and it was like a picture of phantom horns, but

1438
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,840
Do you remember?

1439
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,800
Uh, I don't if it was the last episode. I don't

1440
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,720
Oh, that's right. You were I mean, right never mind

1441
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,840
Uh

1442
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,480
Shit, okay. Well, let me um, there's one saying why doe?

1443
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:37,040
Oh, where? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, why doe?

1444
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:42,160
Yeah, okay. Well, let me let me revisit this one because I told that guy I would go back

1445
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:48,160
Yeah, I'm looking at the image, but let's listen. Here's the image. All right. Three two one go

1446
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:53,280
I'm probably one of the three people who recently got into the pgp and ben verse

1447
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:59,440
And I gotta ask is was phantom horn meant to be a parody of trans people has he been reclaimed?

1448
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,640
Is he problematic? Oh, so why he think that's so

1449
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,480
That's so devastating. Uh, I mean

1450
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:12,560
The the the honest answer is yeah, he kind of was and now I feel bad about it

1451
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,600
And I kind of uh

1452
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,880
Yeah

1453
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,880
I mean, he wasn't okay

1454
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:25,280
I think I've talked I've talked about this before. Yeah, he he kind of was sort of a like ha ha

1455
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:32,320
The sjw's have gone so far now an earth pony is identifying as a unicorn

1456
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,960
Ha ha it's so wacky

1457
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:37,760
What the left has the left has gone too far

1458
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:42,800
Uh, and then I eventually was like, hey, that's kind of stupid

1459
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
uh, and I and I

1460
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,040
Made him cool by sending him to slime city and he became

1461
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:56,320
A base dialectical materialist marxist and now he's good. He's been reclaimed. He's good now

1462
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:01,680
Don't he does look pretty thick in that picture. He does look pretty he's looking. Yeah, he's looking like a short stack

1463
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,360
He's short stack

1464
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,360
He's literally stubby little way

1465
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,680
I don't know why he drew him that way

1466
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,520
He's chibi. I think I've said last week. He's just this is chibi phantom

1467
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,880
um

1468
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,160
Next

1469
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:20,960
So is phantom just in and the swore now is he in that yeah that land?

1470
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,560
Oh, just hanging out. Well, I don't know if you oh, this is this is a

1471
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:29,920
One angle that I like kind of forgot. I was trying to type up like the Kickstarter page and I kind of forgot

1472
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,240
And then I remembered is um, yeah, the ending of slime and punishment is like secret

1473
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:42,480
And like the only way you could find it was by beating phantom's revenge and phantom's revenge is like way too hard

1474
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,040
for the for the casual gamer

1475
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,600
And not me though. I did it. That's right. But I think most people

1476
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:54,000
Probably didn't I think like a pretty small number of people actually

1477
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,200
did it so

1478
01:37:57,200 --> 01:38:03,200
Even the people that have read phantom's or slime and punishment most of them have not seen the end and that's a big reason

1479
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:08,080
Why so if that's you and you're too casual you can buy my book and that has the ending in it lamau

1480
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,800
Uh

1481
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:14,240
But yeah, yeah, he um

1482
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:19,680
Well, I guess is he does yeah, he posts slime and punishment. He just continues to live in uh

1483
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:23,520
In new los angeles city. He he canonically lives there now

1484
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,280
yep

1485
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,280
Although he can he can go back to

1486
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,600
equestria through

1487
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,880
The night star portal which is now a permanent fixture in the uh

1488
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,840
sky and someone devs

1489
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,160
I hope an endless war dev is listening right now

1490
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:43,040
If we can please add some functionality where you can travel to equestria

1491
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,600
when you're on the blimp

1492
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,920
When you jump through the portal

1493
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,440
I would appreciate it just like twilight sparkle just like twilight sparkle

1494
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,040
In that's the plot of equestria girls, right?

1495
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,800
Uh, yeah

1496
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,200
Yeah

1497
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:07,680
Okay, I think the first voicemail this week is from it's called 6 30 38 from prince isolation

1498
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,480
three two one

1499
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,840
Go welcome back to the ben saint appreciation hour

1500
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:17,760
Where on this episode a quote by ben saint

1501
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,360
I already streamed for like two hours

1502
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,120
And I started streaming kind of late today

1503
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:30,800
So I think that I won't really go that long. I won't go like

1504
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,840
Five hours or anything like that

1505
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,080
Right

1506
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,280
Let's listen to the whole song it's loud

1507
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,960
I went really long it was a long stream

1508
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,080
Uh, I think this is probably

1509
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:08,000
Jesus the whole I really like the low quality of that really really bad

1510
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:14,720
Uh, this is probably like I mean that might it was at the time when I beat the game because like I think I was just like

1511
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,400
Like yeah, I'm gonna beat the game like I gotta beat the freaking game now

1512
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,240
No, no that was the first stream

1513
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,960
Of battle network

1514
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,080
one

1515
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,560
So I had just I was enjoying the game. I was really enjoying the game

1516
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,080
um

1517
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,360
the

1518
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,360
Yeah, and I think

1519
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,360
The one after that that I went for four hours

1520
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:40,080
And yeah, I think I'm gonna try and keep my streams like four hours or shorter going forward

1521
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,720
because viewership does not

1522
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,200
Hold up

1523
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:51,600
The whole I'm usually at like by by four hours in I'm at like half the viewership that the stream usually starts with it starts

1524
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,600
Dip off around the three that's a historically been the case

1525
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,000
I just want to increase the amount of time I play

1526
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,680
I did that like last time it was a seven hours. You know, yeah

1527
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,320
I only go through like four five

1528
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:09,040
Maps in fire emblem. They take quite a lot. Oh quite a while. That's kind of

1529
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,560
Yeah, when I do when I go six hours in a stream

1530
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,120
partially, I'm just kind of like

1531
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:19,360
Even if there's only you know, either there's only a few people actually in the chat

1532
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,680
I'm kind of just playing it to play it because like

1533
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,040
You know, but my goal is to play these games. So

1534
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,520
Yeah

1535
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:32,080
I don't feel like oh, nobody's watching. I gotta I gotta cut the stream. I'll come back later. I'm like

1536
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:37,360
Well, even even if no one's watching I'm still getting I'm still accomplishing my goal

1537
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:43,520
Uh while I'm streaming. So that's why I stream for a really long time. Sometimes this part of the reason why

1538
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,200
Yeah

1539
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,200
Thanks for making fun of me

1540
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,680
Uh next one is called real

1541
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:55,120
Oh, is it a a broken uh

1542
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,400
Damn

1543
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,240
Yeah, that's what also is says real. Maybe it was a fixed

1544
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:06,160
Maybe they fixed it. Yeah, that first link didn't work for me

1545
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,320
And then this is real question mark dot dot dot

1546
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,480
It's got a voice attached

1547
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:19,760
Yeah, okay, uh, let's um

1548
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:26,480
Uh, okay, let's listen, uh, three two one go

1549
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,480
I'm so very sorry to do this to you all. However

1550
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,800
Uh

1551
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,360
Let me just read it for you. This is

1552
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:42,480
Yay, Ayano Koji bloated by not whole nuts on deviant art

1553
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,840
Enjoy

1554
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:48,240
Uh

1555
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,280
Then

1556
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:57,840
I thought this might be like veruca salt willy wonka, but I I mean it seems

1557
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,360
Very similar. Um

1558
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,440
Wait, okay, the the next one is an image

1559
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,960
I'm sorry

1560
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,960
glide yaito

1561
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,760
Okay, yeah, so in mega man legends

1562
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:22,000
Uh, there's this guy. There's a guy called glide and this girl yaito. I don't even know who that is

1563
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It must be like a really minor npc

1564
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,520
And then I guess she kind of looks like

1565
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:31,520
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yai yaito and they kind of

1566
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,400
I guess it's supposed to be the same

1567
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:38,880
I yeah, I mean the girls definitely look similar

1568
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,280
I don't even who is okay yaito mega man

1569
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,720
Uh

1570
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,280
Yo, there's a there's a trio called yokan. Oh

1571
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,480
Okay

1572
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:03,440
Yeah, it's one of the three women or girls that are sitting in the like village

1573
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:08,240
Hut that asks you like a hundred trivia questions

1574
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,400
To give you a freaking bonus item

1575
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,920
That's like a fun job

1576
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,840
Yeah, they're just at school cushion

1577
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:24,640
She I think she asks you the like easy questions and then the one on the right asks you the middle questions

1578
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:27,120
And then the one in the middle the sexy one

1579
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,800
Asks you uh, the hard like the hundred hard questions

1580
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,360
And all right, let's listen to the voicemail three two one go

1581
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:41,440
I just realized I probably fucked up because I removed the image from my imgur

1582
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:45,600
From the first link that I just sent so it probably didn't work

1583
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:51,920
So you probably the first thing that you saw me send you related to this subject was just bloated. Yeah

1584
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:59,200
I am very sorry about that. Here is the the actual reason that I sent you anything at all

1585
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,760
the actual

1586
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,760
interesting image post

1587
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,320
I'm sorry

1588
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,480
Uh, yeah

1589
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,400
it does

1590
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,400
kind of look

1591
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:19,360
Yeah, yai is I I'm not sure if she's supposed to be like a tron bond. She's sort of like it looks like this girl yaito, but she's

1592
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:25,760
She's like a rich girl like like tron bond and she kind of has tron bonds hairline

1593
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:28,640
So I guess it's like they mash these

1594
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:33,760
Two together and I don't know why this little girl from the school is even

1595
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,400
Irrelevant, but yeah

1596
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:41,120
Probably just like the design wanted to use it again. Yeah, we just like the design. Yeah

1597
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,080
Um, they put her in a dress

1598
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:46,240
That's interesting. I I told her

1599
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,960
And then they put a hose upper

1600
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,360
body and

1601
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,360
pumped her full

1602
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,440

1603
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,440

The the colon d is funnier than the actual face

1613
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,400
Just the

1614
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,880

Next one

1626
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,880
is

1627
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:12,880
It much

1628
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,880
You look like

1629
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,320
One of the blessed land

1630
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:20,640
You look like one of the blessed land

1631
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,360

Why is she ukraine? Is that gib? Is that you? Is that me? I

1634
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,920

1635
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,880
Why am I I mean, I guess I'm ukraine

1636
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:42,560
Aligned, I guess if you ask me, but like it's not a big part of my personality one thing when people ask who is gib

1637
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:45,600
I'm like, well, she loves the ukraine

01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,120
She hates poot

1639
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:52,000
um

1640
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,720
I like your your stance in this one. Hmm

1641
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,000
okay

1642
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Is the blessed I feel like we at some point maybe a long time ago somebody made a joke about the blessed land

1643
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,040
About the jewish people. Is that like a term?

1644
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,760
for them

1645
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:15,840
This line you look like one of the blessed land that's from something or somebody said that and I don't remember

1646
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,240
who

1647
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:20,240
or why but

1648
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:25,040
Commenters if you remember what this is a reference to it's it's something

1649
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,600
Hang on jews

1650
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,400
blessed

1651
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,400
land

1652
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:36,640
jew.com. Okay the term holy land usually refers to the

1653
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:42,960
Territory roughly corresponding to the modern state of israel and the palestinian territories. Okay, they're all right

1654
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:49,520
It is so maybe it's some why would they say blessed land? Why not the holy land?

1655
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:54,720
No, I don't know this is this is a reference that I'm like blanking on

1656
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,560
um

1657
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:02,080
Next one is uh, but I do look cool in my zutsu there next one is

1658
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:05,760
I dropped one piece

1659
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:17,920
Oh, no, I forgot to read one piece this week. No you reminded me you reminded me and I said and I said okay

1660
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And then I didn't do it

1661
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,040
Oh, no

1662
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:31,040
Think of all the trash that you could say I could have read up. I could have been that this is literally me right now

1663
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:39,280
What are you saying one piece is good actually

1664
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,080
I

1665
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,480
Just I really like

1666
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:54,800
The complete like inversion of the reason for this mean this mean image

1667
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,840
Oh, what a sad person who missed out on all that

1668
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,440
Is

1669
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,560
Is the implication that like the first 10 episodes are good

1670
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:22,640
Or is it just that like all of one piece is trash and like yeah, it's a good thing you stop

1671
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:28,240
I think they mean like the longer you go the worse it gets so just like if you

1672
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,200
If you drop one piece it's good

1673
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:38,640
I don't know. I just like it. I like this image how brazen how brazen to just like

1674
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,760
One piece trash. It's all trash

1675
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:49,920
Who says that true true, but also who but also true, but also how fucking dare you?

1676
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,960
Okay

1677
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,680
Oh good stuff. Oh boy

1678
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,400
Let me calm down after that one

1679
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,480

Kong a luya

1687
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,960
Kong a luya

1688
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:59,620
Kong a luya

1689
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:02,180
Oh

1690
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:16,180
Hmm

1691
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,900
Kong a luya

1692
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:24,180
Um, um, um delightful another another another banger we got a

1693
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:27,140
Are we gonna get like a compilation

1694
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:32,340
When when all the verses have been performed are we gonna get the full the full song?

1695
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:41,140
Maybe I would I would lull. I think I would probably laugh. I would I would sing kong a luya if we got a compilation

1696
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:44,820
I would sing if we got a kong a palation kong palation. There we go

1697
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:47,380
Now we're talking

1698
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:49,380
Okay, uh

1699
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:51,620
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go

1700
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:52,740
uh

1701
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:54,740
Next one is

1702
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:56,660
An image

1703
01:52:56,660 --> 01:53:01,780
Oh, come on. Fluttershy. I got plenty common with you and viral mentalists both

1704
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:05,060
Such as such as

1705
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:08,180
Hmm. Well, we both hate coal burners, don't we?

1706
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:15,620
What what does that smirk for applejack? What do you mean both hate coal burners? Is that a racist?

1707
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:21,540
Thing I mean because it's applejack, of course everything she says is to raise it

1708
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:25,540
I would imagine is that a joke, but I don't actually know the reference

1709
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:29,620
I don't know what is being referred to oh

1710
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:39,060
A non-black person usually a woman who has sexual relations with black people usually men

1711
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:41,860
well

1712
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:44,180
Now I know applejack

1713
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:47,140
Applejack

1714
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:55,460
Uh, uh, she's just kidding. No, it's fine. Yeah, she's just having she didn't learn anything

1715
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:59,700
I didn't in woke school in crt. Yeah

1716
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:07,860
Uh, I just wanted for many just one of her many quirky quirky traits

1717
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:10,340
um

1718
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:15,540
Okay, the next one is called give this man justice three two one go

1719
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:20,260
So I just went back and skim through episode 132 of the pcp

1720
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:25,460
Just because it was the deltarune one and I liked seeing everyone as the deltarune characters that gib true back

1721
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:26,260
Oh, yeah

1722
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,220
It was nice and fun

1723
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:29,220
But someone left a voicemail on that episode

1724
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:33,140
Calling in to make fun of Nate for using an electric skateboard

1725
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:37,780
And then he did a grind on his real skateboard during the voicemail and recorded the like

1726
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:43,300
Sound I remember that and uh, I forget by calling him a pussy or whatever

1727
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:46,980
There's the best voicemail ever and I think it was before voice grail

1728
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:50,420
So I want to let you know that you should retroactively give that guy

1729
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:52,980
From four years ago voice grail

1730
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:58,740
Also, uh, does Nate still use his electric skateboard? I feel like I haven't heard about that in a million years. Um

1731
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:02,340
I don't know

1732
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:05,460
Sorry your voicemail was just so boring

1733
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:08,420
I I agree about the voice grail though

1734
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:09,300
I remember that one

1735
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:13,780
I remember we all cracked up because it was just sort of like just a typical voicemail

1736
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:16,500
But then he did the the skateboard trick with the audio

1737
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:20,980
I and it's and then it was like, yeah, fuck you. It's great

1738
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:24,020
I actually don't

1739
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:26,020
remember that

1740
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:32,580
Almost at all. I don't think so. Maybe I I remember it was funny enough that everybody laughed including Nate. Hmm

1741
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:37,300
Oh, yeah, I'm drawn a blank but sounds pretty cool

1742
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:43,940
An electric vouch for that for that voice grail. All right. Okay. Let's do it. Let's freaking go

1743
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:48,100
Let's do it. He's in god's gift to grinds is in

1744
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:50,740
Yes, yeah

1745
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:53,140
Do you um

1746
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:55,220
Shit, uh

1747
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:58,660
Okay, the electric skateboard is like one with a motor on it, right that like

1748
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:05,300
Propels the Casey Neistat boards. Yes. Oh, yeah. I mean, I have no idea if he uses it. I haven't heard him mention it

1749
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:09,620
In forever. So probably not he probably just drives

1750
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:14,340
Yeah, it's a bit of a weird thing to go around using. Yeah

1751
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:21,380
Having a car is inconvenient as it is in new york city, which is why Casey Neistat uses that all the time. Hmm

1752
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:24,820
Yeah, I uh, I don't know. I don't know if he's it

1753
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:28,100
Um, he's probably not grinding on it too much

1754
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:31,780
Okay, next one is called thoughts about this

1755
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:34,980
Hey, you. Hmm. Well, it's kind of gross

1756
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:38,100
Reminds me of that that

1757
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:42,580
I don't know what artist did it but like something something a teaspoon made of fur

1758
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:50,180
Oh, and it's like a series of like what if an object was like made of a material that made its purpose

1759
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:52,260
pointless

1760
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:54,260
It was made it really bad at its

1761
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:57,620
As its purpose like something that you would heat up being made of

1762
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:00,420
I don't know bubbles or something

1763
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:05,140
Maybe being made of wood. Oh, I see merit Oppenheim

1764
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:10,500
Yeah, I see it's like a teap a cup and and a dish

1765
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:15,220
Here I got I got the image cup and a dish and a spoon

1766
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,900
Cup and a dish and a

1767
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,900
Hey, I'm eating a cup and a dish and a year

1768
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:23,780
Yeah, that's the one. Yeah

1769
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:30,020
It makes sort of it makes it sort of pointless that it exists

1770
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:34,180
Makes makes but I guess in this in this case you could cut

1771
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:39,940
The non-hairy part of the cheese away any bad if you really wanted to yeah, I think that's probably how I would

1772
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:42,980
Approach this this cheese problem

1773
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:45,940
Is AI generated?

1774
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:49,780
No, no, it's gay. I generated gay. Yo

1775
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:52,660
sick

1776
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:54,660
Was there

1777
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:58,100
Was there some AI news

1778
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:00,980
I mean I might have

1779
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:06,900
I might have talked about that one clip, you know that one like really fancy looking clip going around of like the high resolution like

1780
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:09,540
People playing rock paper scissors

1781
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:14,500
I haven't seen that but I don't the thing that's annoying me with AI is that

1782
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:20,100
Extremely unfunny people are going out in droves to make the same video over and over again

1783
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:23,700
Of donald trump and joe biden and whoever else

1784
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:27,620
Just like in about whatever and it's like ha ha. Isn't it funny?

1785
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:31,780
Isn't it funny that these famous people that you wouldn't expect to be playing a video game

1786
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:36,500
Are playing a video game and they're on headsets and that's it. I gotta admit

1787
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:41,460
Uh, I saw I saw like a couple of those and I did think a few of them were really funny

1788
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:45,540
It's funny once but like it's now it's now now that's so accessible

1789
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:50,340
It's just gonna continually be a thing. Yeah, that's god. That's a gag. That's a gag

1790
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:54,340
That's not gonna that's not gonna you got to be good at writing if you want to make something that that funny

1791
01:58:54,980 --> 01:58:57,220
I really think that the that tall barts

1792
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:04,100
Videos of uh, joe rogan and uh, ben Shapiro and jordan peterson

1793
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:11,140
Uh talking about their money troubles are really good. He's he's tall bars. Pretty good. I you guys really funny scripts

1794
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:13,220
I like them. I um

1795
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:17,700
I mean tall bar was making like youtube poops like sentence mixing without AI

1796
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:20,260
So they clearly

1797
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:21,780
they have

1798
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:23,860
uh

1799
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:29,620
They've they've shown that they can come up with some some funny things the AI stuff though. It feels a little

1800
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:32,740
I don't know less funny. I think

1801
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:38,580
Something you think you think it was funnier when he was mixing their actual words together. Yeah, because it sounds unnatural

1802
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:40,340
it's the sort of

1803
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:44,820
It's it's it's the it's the fact that it's it's obviously not really them

1804
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:46,660
that

1805
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:50,820
It something there's there's an extra element of like absurdism

1806
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:53,380
in there that makes it like

1807
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:55,780
I don't know. I'd prefer it. I guess

1808
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:57,940
Yeah, so somebody's saying like saying

1809
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:04,820
Like a like an AI generated voice of a person who you wouldn't expect to say I suck dick saying I suck dick is like

1810
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:10,580
Sure, they wouldn't say that but just sounds like them saying something sounds like a person talking

1811
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:12,820
But if you okay, but if you sentence mix it

1812
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:16,100
There's something else to it and I like that. I think

1813
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:23,060
I mean, I think I mean tall tall barts tall barts skits have a little more going on in them than just having

1814
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:25,380
Jordan Peterson say that he's gay or whatever

1815
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:28,340
Uh, that's a lot of it. But yeah

1816
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:29,860
it

1817
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,620
I don't know. I saw I saw

1818
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:34,980
They they've started to sort of they have sort of like a narrative to them

1819
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:39,460
They like they like sort of make jokes about themselves and like they have I don't know

1820
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:42,180
I saw one that was Jordan. It was it was

1821
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:46,740
Rogan and Ben, uh, they were they were AI generating like

1822
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:50,660
Like oh now make now. Let's make well this AI stuff is so funny

1823
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:54,900
Let's make Jordan Peterson say some gay stuff or whatever and then they do that for what?

1824
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:58,340
I don't know. Are they just I like I think he's good and they're

1825
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:05,540
I don't think they're bad. Fuck you. Fuck you. Just leave my man tall bart alone. I don't think I'm bad

1826
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:10,020
That's all they are they are competent and humorous

1827
02:01:10,580 --> 02:01:14,420
I just I guess I've just seen a lot of it recently and I'm like, yeah

1828
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:21,380
Well, where where's lamp oil roping bombs, huh? Where's my boy and dinner? Like I want more of that

1829
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:26,660
Where's where's my boy and dinner? Okay. I mean sure no

1830
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:29,780
I understand what you mean about like. Yeah the weird

1831
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:35,540
The weird and unnatural way that it sounds when they just like are obviously cutting like lines together

1832
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:38,500
To make them say some wacky shit. Yeah. Yeah, it has a different

1833
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:41,620
It's funny for in a totally different way. Yeah

1834
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:43,300
Um

1835
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:47,860
I thought it was I thought it was really funny to see tall bark. Yeah, I had been following tall barton. I've been seeing

1836
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:50,420
his uh

1837
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:53,460
His mixes his videos and then when AI came out

1838
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:56,740
He's he suddenly like jumped on the AI train and he started doing like

1839
02:01:57,620 --> 02:01:59,620
Some slight with some different ones

1840
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:01,700
using this AI voice tool

1841
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:07,940
And I thought that's great. I don't know. It's cool. He's like, oh a new thing I can make these videos out of well

1842
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:10,260
I'll do it

1843
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:12,260
And he did it and I think it's good

1844
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:15,780
I think it's good

1845
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:17,780
Uh next one is called

1846
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:22,820
Uh, how would you send? Yeah, how to send file without vocaru

1847
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:26,260
And then he sends it by vocaru

1848
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:30,420
So that's interesting three three two one go

1849
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:38,820
Bro, remember ram ram movers. He fucking died. He didn't make enough money. What the fuck

1850
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:42,260
Just like uh maple sorry too

1851
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:45,460
What the fuck life sucks

1852
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:50,420
Okay, you don't need to pretend you care

1853
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:53,620
Uh maple, okay. What was the Rambo verse?

1854
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:59,300
Rambo verse I don't remember Rambo verse

1855
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:02,660
Or whatever that could be

1856
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:06,500
I guess he's talking about like I think he's saying rumble verse

1857
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:09,940
I don't even know what that is. What is that?

1858
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:15,140
Rumble verse was a free to play brawler battle royale video game

1859
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:18,820
developed by iron galaxy and published by epic games publishing

1860
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:21,780
I heard about that

1861
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:24,420
It 91% liked this video game

1862
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:27,140
Did it die?

1863
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:30,180
It apparently yeah, I guess it I guess it got shut down

1864
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:35,780
Rumble versus shut down feels sudden, but the writing was on the wall. Yeah, I guess the game died

1865
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:38,420
I mean

1866
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:39,540
I

1867
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:45,140
Never thought about it even that was that while it existed. That was the dodge ball game, wasn't it?

1868
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:48,260
I don't

1869
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:54,100
I'm pretty sure I saw somebody watching it and react into it as like a trailer

1870
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:58,260
Maybe it's germa and he was like, oh it looks pretty good

1871
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:03,140
And it looked like a dodge ball game, but like battle royale dodge ball

1872
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:08,260
Maybe it was like really like announced it like e3 or something that I can don't know

1873
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:14,020
Do they do e3 does that exist anymore? I think they

1874
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:18,660
I think they don't I think e3 died everyone's dead

1875
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:22,740
Does that mean the packs became the new e3?

1876
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:25,700
I don't know. I think everyone does

1877
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:33,700
Nintendo events. Oh, yeah. Now they all now they all do Nintendo directs and stuff. There's no need for a freaking convention

1878
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:42,020
Coronavirus killed everything including video games coronavirus literally killed

1879
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:48,260
Someone who was working at at packs like two years ago or like a year or two ago

1880
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:55,700
They they they did they did one they did packs in spite of everything and somebody died

1881
02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:03,140
Not so good, not so good, not so good. I wonder

1882
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:07,300
Um, I wonder if they still

1883
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:10,020
Do them

1884
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:12,100
Packs let's let's look at packs on twitter

1885
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:14,100
um

1886
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:15,940
At packs twitter

1887
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:17,940
No, I mean they're still going

1888
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:23,300
March 3rd looking for something that packs east 2023. Okay, so they're doing packs east

1889
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:29,460
Um, okay, you all you know, I guess one little death isn't gonna

1890
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:33,300
Isn't gonna stop you

1891
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:36,660
I mean, you know

1892
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:39,140
It's kind of true a bit like

1893
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:43,460
It's not it's not it's not like oh packs literally killed someone

1894
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:48,980
You know somebody got somebody got covid and somebody died and I mean, I guess these things do happen

1895
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:52,980
But I was hearing about it and I can't it can't be good

1896
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:58,980
Can't be good publicity. It can't be good for like view. It can't be good for attendee enthusiasm

1897
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:05,940
Uh, I would always hear about gaming conventions and like all my favorite youtubers would go to whatever convention

1898
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:09,620
And I would see the things and they would have a little video. It's like well, I went to the thing

1899
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:12,420
But they it always seemed like such a fucking

1900
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:14,420
nightmare

1901
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:16,660
Even though it was fun in some ways

1902
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:19,140
I went to

1903
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:21,780
the last day of packs east like

1904
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:28,580
Maybe like four or five years ago. Maybe five or six years ago. Yeah, and then

1905
02:06:29,780 --> 02:06:32,420
Funny story, maybe I've told it before sheep over

1906
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,780
You know, you're a sheep over who used to be a

1907
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:38,500
Mumke's girlfriend at one point

1908
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:43,540
Said that she saw me and this was post tbap and I think maybe even post pcp

1909
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:47,940
She saw me and she recognized me, but she didn't say hi because she was uh

1910
02:06:48,740 --> 02:06:50,740
Chai or something

1911
02:06:51,940 --> 02:06:56,020
Then she told me later. Oh, yeah, I literally I saw you like at a food truck at packs east

1912
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:59,780
I was like, yep. Wow. I was there on sunday that one year

1913
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:02,580
Very funny

1914
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:05,300
Um

1915
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:09,780
What was the other one he said rumble verse and

1916
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:12,580
Uh maple story too, I guess

1917
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:15,380
I've heard of maple story

1918
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:19,060
Uh, I think I did know that there was a maple story too

1919
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:22,260
I didn't know that it died

1920
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:27,700
Oh maple story too lives on in our hearts through its creative expression and unique aesthetic

1921
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:29,780
We'd like to thank the wonderful maplers

1922
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:32,740
No

1923
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:35,300
We'd like to thank

1924
02:07:36,020 --> 02:07:42,260
We'd like to thank the wonderful maplers that inhabited its charming world by offering you the chance to keep some of what made the game special

1925
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:46,820
Here you'll find links to download all kind of designs illustrations concept art and more

1929
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:01,300
Oh my god

1930
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:05,540
Why is that hitting me so hard?

1931
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:08,740
It's it's it's a real big thing when it's like

1932
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:12,020
Like

1933
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:18,180
A lot of virtual worlds online like mmo's that they feel more than just like a video game

1934
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:23,700
Uh, especially when you're young you spend a lot of time on there. They're like a virtual like physical

1935
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:26,340
place

1936
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:28,340
And then they don't exist anymore

1937
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:32,260
People get real fucked up about that. So I know I do

1938
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:37,460
I'm still sad about world of warcraft changing everything in the cataclysm

1939
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:42,260
I thought you were gonna say club penguin. I mean club penguin is as well. I was gonna say that as well

1940
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:48,020
And then good and and and then like runescape before they released old school runescape

1941
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:54,580
Runescape had changed beyond recognition. It was just like this is not what I lived with. This is not my friend

1942
02:08:55,140 --> 02:08:57,140
I hate this place

1943
02:08:57,380 --> 02:09:01,140
That's what I say every time I look in the pcp server

1944
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:04,660
Uh, yeah

1945
02:09:05,460 --> 02:09:12,100
Oh, I'm I'm I'm that's just that's just so sad. I don't know. I don't know. I just thought

1946
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:14,340
I don't know

1947
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:16,180
I can't look at this anymore

1948
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:19,860
Maple story one still exists like maple story one didn't die

1949
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:22,660
but I guess two was just like

1950
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:27,540
I wonder why two died just the the player base didn't migrate

1951
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:32,500
I guess uh, maybe the business model was just not

1952
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:37,300
Damn

1953
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:39,940
Best the best laid plans

1954
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:41,300
um

1955
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,300
next one is um

1956
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:48,820
The philosophy nerd hour from prince isolation at twitter.com

1957
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:51,460
three two one go

1958
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:54,660
On episode 350 of the pro-crastinators

1959
02:09:55,940 --> 02:09:58,420
Men's saint does not seem to fully understand what

1960
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:04,020
Vinny Vitevichy means when he says that he appreciates give and take for simply being who she is

1961
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:09,220
But if he'd have read kirkegaard and specifically the sickness unto death

1962
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:12,180
He'd have known that according to kirkegaard

1963
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:20,580
We are constantly living in a state of despair because of the friction in our human condition between what we want out of life

1964
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:27,300
And out of ourselves. That's me and what we eventually get and what the limits of the material world are

1965
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:29,460
and

1966
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:31,460
because of this he claims that

1967
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:34,420
Everyone can live with despair in

1968
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:36,420
several ways

1969
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:41,780
One of these ways is despairing wishing to be oneself wherein someone

1970
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:44,420
Wants to be themselves

1971
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:51,700
But wants to basically change their condition of existence and continually improve and fight against their despair

1972
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:57,060
In the other case there is despairingly not willing to be oneself

1973
02:10:57,380 --> 02:11:02,660
In which case one despairs of existence so much that they don't even want to have their own

1974
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:10,020
Identity anymore. They want to basically reject themselves and their own lives. So I suppose the question is ben

1975
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:13,220
Do you want to be yourself?

1976
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:17,300
uh

1977
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:23,460
It's a big question

1978
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:26,500
um

1979
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:29,060
I feel like i'm not supposed to answer seriously

1980
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:31,460
uh

1981
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:36,180
I've a lot of I don't know. I think I think a lot of the time most of the time. Yeah

1982
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:40,580
A lot of the time, you know what a lot of the time I do fall into a state of like

1983
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:47,940
I wish I just didn't exist the I have those I have those times. I wish I could just disappear

1984
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:50,740
uh

1985
02:11:50,740 --> 02:11:52,260
But you know

1986
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:57,220
It's not all the time. So I guess I guess it's a little a column a and a little a column b for me

1987
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:58,660
I have both

1988
02:11:58,660 --> 02:12:02,260
I get you a guy who can do both kinds of despair. I guess

1989
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:04,900
Little column a a little a column bang

1990
02:12:05,220 --> 02:12:07,220
Um

1991
02:12:08,740 --> 02:12:10,740
Got him

1992
02:12:10,820 --> 02:12:12,820
Uh, well that was educational

1993
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:15,780
So next up

1994
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:17,780
Well, there's an image and

1995
02:12:17,860 --> 02:12:21,060
Another voicemail from the ben and give appreciation hour

1996
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:23,940
From prince isolation

1997
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:28,340
Steeped in malice and cruelty steeped in malice and cruelty

1998
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:30,660
Uh

1999
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:32,660
This is what

2000
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:38,580
Endless jess said my blue rays are steeped in malice and cruelty. That's the joke

2001
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:40,100
Uh

2002
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:45,620
Next one. Oh, no not the next one. There's a voicemail. There's a voicemail. Okay three two one go

2003
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:48,900
In honor of the jessie blood feud

2004
02:12:49,620 --> 02:12:50,740
also

2005
02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:55,620
Recently ben said that um in another iconic quote

2006
02:12:56,340 --> 02:12:57,540
that

2007
02:12:57,540 --> 02:13:02,100
He becomes stronger every time someone spurns him which

2008
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:08,580
Also goes hard and it reminded me of a song that I think is very ben core

2009
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:16,500
it's called I think see the light by ghost and uh the main the main

2010
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:23,540
Chorus of that song goes every day that you feed me with hate I grow stronger

2011
02:13:23,940 --> 02:13:30,820
And I think that is possibly the most ben core song ghost also has a big cathedral

2012
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:33,780
Like like christio

2013
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:37,060
Inspired religious

2014
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:42,900
But also satanic angle. Uh, I you know ben I think if you don't already listen to ghost try it

2015
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:49,300
I think you might like try that song try see the light. I feel like it's your vibe anyways, you know, bye

2016
02:13:50,180 --> 02:13:52,180
You know, I know

2017
02:13:53,620 --> 02:13:55,220
What am I

2018
02:13:55,220 --> 02:13:59,860
First of all, I appreciate this drawing. I love my little slime my little slime drool

2019
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:02,020
uh

2020
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:03,620
Although I don't wear

2021
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:06,900
khakis unless those are supposed to be jeans because I do wear jeans

2022
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:10,660
Um, I rarely tuck my shirt in. I'm not a nerd

2023
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:15,860
Uh, but thank you. Um, do you know ghost?

2024
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:19,140
Uh the lord of

2025
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:21,540
No the the band

2026
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:26,900
Uh, is that the one with the animator who did the little thing?

2027
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:29,860
Or was that the song called ghost?

2028
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:36,340
Oh, are you talking about I've been feeling like a ghost. Yeah, I guess that was the song

2029
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:38,660
I hate them. Oh

2030
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:40,660
uh

2031
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:46,340
Yeah, no that yeah, that's a song. Uh, no ghost. Okay. I don't I've never listened to ghost

2032
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:52,180
Uh, I guess they're kind of a big sort of I don't know. I don't

2033
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:59,780
What I gather from seeing their stuff is that they're sort of a big like kind of theatrical sort of yeah gothic

2034
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:02,180
metal

2035
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:03,700
question mark

2036
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:04,900
band

2037
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:09,620
And I think they do like really elaborate costume sort of stage

2038
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:15,380
Shows I think I think there's a lot of like theater in their

2039
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:18,100
work

2040
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:19,860
and uh

2041
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:21,860
I feel and I

2042
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:25,780
Sorry to be a hipster. I don't listen to them

2043
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:31,780
I kind of feel like I see them around enough. I'm gonna be an asshole. I'm seeming to contrarian asshole

2044
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:38,900
I feel like I see them around enough that they're unpopular enough that people sometimes think like, oh, yeah

2045
02:15:38,900 --> 02:15:43,700
I'm into this indie band ghost. I you ever heard of it, uh, but they're but they're not actually as like

2046
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:47,860
Underground as people think because I feel I feel like I have seen

2047
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:50,820
I've known people that like them

2048
02:15:51,220 --> 02:15:52,660
and uh

2049
02:15:52,660 --> 02:15:55,140
The fact of the matter and I know I'm being unreasonable here

2050
02:15:55,780 --> 02:16:00,740
Uh, I've known people that like them and I don't like those people who I have known who like them

2051
02:16:00,740 --> 02:16:03,700
Although maybe there's other people that I know that like them. They just never brought it up

2052
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:06,500
Maybe I'm just thinking of a few people who were vocal about their

2053
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:13,700
Appreciation of ghost who now I don't like and that does get and that does sour my opinion of this band that I've never heard

2054
02:16:13,940 --> 02:16:15,940
I don't listen to

2055
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:18,020
But maybe I should give them a try and I would change my mind

2056
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:20,180
And

2057
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:22,020
Thoughts give

2058
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:28,420
Uh, my thoughts is why is this the been and give appreciation hour? Yeah, I had nothing to do with give

2059
02:16:30,180 --> 02:16:32,180
I mean, I guess it's and

2060
02:16:32,180 --> 02:16:37,700
Yeah, this should be this should have been the been or give appreciation hour because at least one of us was appreciated

2061
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:42,180
You just say ben appreciation hour if you want if you want to talk about ben, I don't mind

2062
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:44,340
Or you yeah, you just

2063
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:48,580
Like sometimes people just send a voicemail and it's directed to one of us and that's okay

2064
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:53,060
There's nothing there's nothing wrong with a ben a good old ben appreciation hour

2065
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:59,940
I guess prince isolation wants to stick to the brand of like this is the been and give appreciation hour and it will contain appreciation of

2066
02:17:01,140 --> 02:17:03,300
One or both of us and that's the

2067
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:08,340
Uh, okay, that's what I think about ghosts

2068
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:11,620
Uh, I've probably heard one or two of their songs

2069
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:14,740
But like without realizing that it was them

2070
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:17,620
because I feel I feel like they are

2071
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:20,100
Known and popular enough that I

2072
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:22,660
I do hear people talk about ghost

2073
02:17:22,820 --> 02:17:23,940
um

2074
02:17:23,940 --> 02:17:28,260
Next one is called. I hope nate is on this podcast so he can apologize to ben

2075
02:17:28,980 --> 02:17:30,980
Uh, three two one go

2076
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:38,740
Okay, so nasa sent people that's what I

2077
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:41,540
And it was this massive technical feat

2078
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:45,700
And everyone thought it was impossible and they did it, right?

2079
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:50,260
So you believe that but then you turn around and you say that

2080
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:54,180
Well, no, there's no way they could have had a camera that could film that long like

2081
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:57,940
Like do you have no imagination? You just use a bigger

2082
02:17:58,820 --> 02:18:00,820
Like it's good. What okay

2083
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:07,460
First of all, does this have anything to do with nate? I don't think nate does moon landing denial

2084
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:13,540
But I know I thought maybe he was responding to something from last episode. I wasn't privy to

2085
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:17,220
Wasn't aware of I know I don't I don't think so

2086
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:19,860
What is he talking about with a camera?

2087
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:22,180
Okay, I I'm not sure

2088
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:24,500
I've heard that specific

2089
02:18:25,060 --> 02:18:31,540
Thing but like yeah, I guess maybe people that say the moon landing could not have happened say well, they recorded too much footage

2090
02:18:32,260 --> 02:18:34,100
Yeah, they couldn't have

2091
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:38,580
That much footage in a camera and that and I don't I don't know if I've ever heard people say that before

2092
02:18:38,580 --> 02:18:40,580
But that is the kind of thing people say

2093
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:44,900
Because they are like so limited and they're thinking that they're like well any camera

2094
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:50,340
That would go up on the space shuttle would be exactly like a commercial camera that I like I use

2095
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:57,300
In my real life and therefore like the the the memory limits that I am subject to in my normal life

2096
02:18:57,700 --> 02:19:03,780
Would apply there too, right when in fact, no, they could simply make a custom camera that has different capacities

2097
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:09,220
What is the argument here that they couldn't have faked the moon landing because they couldn't have enough film?

2098
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:14,660
No, I think wait because because this guy's saying you believe the moon landing happened

2099
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:17,300
But then you also believe this other thing

2100
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:24,420
That they couldn't be enough film I'm like who's having this who what's what argument

2101
02:19:24,980 --> 02:19:27,700
What person would make this argument? I miss under

2102
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:32,500
I'm listening to it again

2103
02:19:33,060 --> 02:19:39,140
I'm yeah, I am really confused are there can't be someone who is like. Oh, yeah. Yeah, the moon landing is real

2104
02:19:40,020 --> 02:19:41,460
but

2105
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:43,860
they couldn't have actually filmed it because

2106
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:50,180
Yeah, I don't I don't get it. Oh, is this like a weird like double like they believe the moon landing happened

2107
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:52,340
But they believe the footage of it was faked

2108
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:55,300
some for some reason

2109
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:59,540
What is this have I've never heard of that didn't they'd say this there's no way

2110
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:03,700
No, I don't think so. I think the title is completely unrelated

2111
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:06,420
Okay

2112
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:09,540
Maybe

2113
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:13,140
Yeah, there maybe there is someone who is like, yes, there was a moon landing

2114
02:20:13,460 --> 02:20:18,980
But the footage is fake because the footage what the footage was staged because they couldn't film the real thing

2115
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:24,100
Maybe somebody believes that lamau

2116
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:26,740
Uh, next one is called. That's a very funny

2117
02:20:27,380 --> 02:20:29,380
Like conclusion to draw

2118
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:32,100
from the whole thing

2119
02:20:32,100 --> 02:20:34,500
Like I would never have considered this idea

2120
02:20:35,460 --> 02:20:37,460
They probably just had funny cameras

2121
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:41,380
They could put a man they could they could get a rocket into space and put a man on the moon

2122
02:20:41,460 --> 02:20:45,380
But they couldn't make a camera with a real big enough to film it

2123
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:50,180
God could you know, it just could god

2124
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:55,780
Do a moon landing so impressive that even he couldn't film it on a camera

2125
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:59,380
I think perhaps

2126
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:02,340
Next one is called bend.exe 321 go

2127
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:06,500
Hey, Ben, congrats on beating bow network one

2128
02:21:07,220 --> 02:21:10,580
Did you ever have plans to play network transmission on gamecube?

2129
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:17,300
Pretty sure you already know, but it's basically classic mega man, but with the battleship mechanics

2130
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:21,140
Oh, in fact, it's actually got a lot of callbacks to the first game

2131
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:23,940
Which is pretty cool

2132
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:27,140
And more importantly, it's got zero dot exe

2133
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:35,220
Which I think is just the coolest version of zero throughout the entire franchise. That's so funny spoilers. I'm sorry. I guess technically

2134
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:38,980
His battle chips really fucking suck, but

2135
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:45,620
You know just being able to summon zero to fight is just really cool and I just do it anyway

2136
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:48,100
um

2137
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:49,860
But yeah

2138
02:21:49,860 --> 02:21:53,780
Good luck with the rest of your battle network series and thank you

2139
02:21:54,260 --> 02:21:56,900
To your next lecture or whatever the hell it may be

2140
02:21:58,020 --> 02:22:00,020
sweet, uh

2141
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:04,500
I will start working on the next lecture soon. I just as I

2142
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:09,540
Oh, that's another fucking thing that I got on my plate that I have not even been able to really

2143
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:12,260
Do so many irons

2144
02:22:12,660 --> 02:22:14,660
It's a little too many irons

2145
02:22:14,980 --> 02:22:21,380
Okay, that's really funny. First of all, I didn't know that that's what battle transmit or network transmission is

2146
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:26,580
Um, I have I was planning on playing it because I know that it's part of the series

2147
02:22:26,900 --> 02:22:30,100
I didn't know what it was though, but that actually sounds like it could be really fun

2148
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:35,300
Like it's like a side scroller, but with about that sounds awesome. Now. I now I really want to play it

2149
02:22:36,020 --> 02:22:36,980
um

2150
02:22:36,980 --> 02:22:38,980
And that's really funny that you say

2151
02:22:39,300 --> 02:22:45,620
That about zero because at least one person in my chat has told me that zero dot exe is like the worst

2152
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:48,660
Version of zero and they and they hate them

2153
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:52,660
So I'm interested to hear that opinions are divided on zero dot exe

2154
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:56,180
So I look forward. Maybe he's like super edgy

2155
02:22:57,940 --> 02:23:08,180
The proto man in in uh mega man dot exe is basically I mean he looks very much like he's a he's a mashup of proto man and zero

2156
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:11,140
So it's like they were trying to combine those two into one

2157
02:23:12,100 --> 02:23:16,260
Character and they just called him proto man. I know that there is a zero dot exe

2158
02:23:16,340 --> 02:23:18,580
I actually don't know what he looks like. I haven't looked him up

2159
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:22,260
But someone told me they hate his design and now this guy says he's really cool

2160
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:24,740
Even though his chips are bad. So

2161
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:29,620
That's exciting. Yeah, I definitely want to play um network transmission

2162
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:32,340
um

2163
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:36,660
Probably in in release order. I should look into like what exit which what were the release order was

2164
02:23:37,460 --> 02:23:39,140
next one

2165
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:44,020
It's a new comic. I think it yeah, it's a dropbox link. That's me

2166
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:48,100
Yes, I yes my the the sniffer

2167
02:23:48,820 --> 02:23:53,060
Sniffed the the the I forget what is the big nose

2168
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:56,100
Sniffed my boobies away

2169
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:57,220
No

2170
02:23:57,220 --> 02:23:58,980
How could you

2171
02:23:58,980 --> 02:24:05,220
It's not fair. I never get what I want as soon as I am happy some goofy shit has to happen to take it away from me

2172
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:09,220
They were perfect a million M and Feminine

2173
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:16,580
What make them that big again my life's over. They were so squishy and snuggly and warm and it's just not fair

2174
02:24:17,140 --> 02:24:18,180
True

2175
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:22,020
I can't go on like this. Everything is ash and woe. I'm gonna kill myself

2176
02:24:22,580 --> 02:24:26,980
Yeah, I'm gonna jump off the top of hq and fall infinitely into the void

2177
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:32,820
Void void void void void void void void void etc

2178
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:36,260
How should I do error Ari's voice?

2179
02:24:37,220 --> 02:24:42,900
Hey, you you want to put some clothes on is that too much? Is the inward voice too much?

2180
02:24:43,380 --> 02:24:45,380
I remember that from the t-bat place

2181
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:53,780
Hey, you want to put some clothes on no, that's too much. That's all too you want to put some clothes on you want to put on some clothes

2182
02:24:54,980 --> 02:24:56,980
Void void

2183
02:24:57,700 --> 02:24:58,820
Uh

2184
02:24:58,820 --> 02:25:05,860
Whose giant butt is that is that error Ari's giant part with the heart shamed pockets going through the the the doors there

2185
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:08,180
Okay, oh, let me zoom in

2186
02:25:08,980 --> 02:25:10,980
Oh, yes error Ari

2187
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:13,220
doing a little

2188
02:25:13,220 --> 02:25:15,220
doing a little rarity

2189
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:17,540
Oh, it's a it's a dress

2190
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:20,340
making

2191
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:22,900
It's the art. She's really doing the art of the dress right now

2192
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:27,060
Cool. Cool. Now, let's hit those nine flights of stairs

2193
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:29,220
nine

2194
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:31,220
That's a lot of flights

2195
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:34,660
That's looks so cute

2196
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:37,540
It is cute. Uh, I look like jade

2197
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:40,740
Yeah, yeah, definitely

2198
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:43,620
So why do we got to find Nate again?

2199
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:47,700
So we can use him as a blood sacrifice for the Nate fuckers

2200
02:25:48,660 --> 02:25:50,660
Wait, what?

2201
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:55,860
I mean everybody wants him back on the podcast so might as well get some sweet content out of it

2202
02:25:56,260 --> 02:26:01,060
Can't blame him though. Nate always brought that 2017 cringy edge that I sort of miss

2203
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:05,780
Why do you stop coming on anyway again? Why do you stop coming on anyway?

2204
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:09,700
I don't know he didn't say and then he started the gamer zone and talking pirates

2205
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:14,980
Apparently we're too cring for him to associate with let alone podcast weekly

2206
02:26:16,340 --> 02:26:18,340
But but podcasting easy

2207
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:19,700
Oh, right

2208
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:21,940
Now that's right. Yeah

2209
02:26:22,740 --> 02:26:24,740
Okay, I'm pooped

2210
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:31,460
Battery your battery is at three percent time for a charge. Oh, it's bro. It's the bro AI

2211
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:35,300

I have a type C. What do you take? Look at that face?

2214
02:26:42,420 --> 02:26:45,940
News so good. What the fuck? Yeah. Oh, I I'm looking

2215
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:50,020
Why does did ever Rory always have like a giant

2216
02:26:51,300 --> 02:26:56,980
Thighs like this. I don't remember from the last time. I don't remember. I think they're destroying them like that

2217
02:26:59,220 --> 02:27:00,020
Uh

2218
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:01,860
CCS

2219
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:03,060
One

2220
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:06,340
What the heck is that an ev charger? What?

2221
02:27:06,980 --> 02:27:09,460
Oh, like a tesla. Can you can you?

2222
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:13,300
Can you uh, can think you can carry me the rest of the way?

2223
02:27:13,940 --> 02:27:17,780
Hell yeah, I go to the gym at least once a month. It's not even that much

2224
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:22,020
Yo, if only I were there. I'm I'm lifting

02:27:36,580 --> 02:27:38,580
That butt's so fucking big

2230
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:40,580
So fucking big

2231
02:27:40,580 --> 02:27:42,580
Wait the apple

2232
02:27:43,140 --> 02:27:47,140
I there I remember there there's some backstory behind the big apple, but

2233
02:27:50,820 --> 02:27:52,820
I love my faces in this yeah

2234
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:55,700
Just five more

2235
02:27:56,740 --> 02:27:58,740
Okay, there's no way I'm pushing it

2236
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:00,420
push

2237
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:01,380
I'm

2238
02:28:01,380 --> 02:28:07,140
There's no way in piss. There's no way in piss shit in fuck and piss shit in fuck. They make it five more floors

2239
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:09,540
Gotta find a charger

2240
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:11,940
They open the door hello

2241
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:15,060
Another fucking monster

2242
02:28:15,620 --> 02:28:17,140
Fuck it

2243
02:28:17,140 --> 02:28:23,220
Scout wait scout nothing scout nothing scout nothing

2244
02:28:24,340 --> 02:28:27,380
Look how freaking cute these are. They're so cute

2245
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:31,860
They're so cute. I'm shimmying. Oh, no

2246
02:28:32,580 --> 02:28:34,900
Hey, hey close one. Is that the bear?

2247
02:28:36,340 --> 02:28:38,900
Is that the bear from gamer and the bear perhaps?

2248
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:41,460
I was thinking it was

2249
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:48,580
Beware beware of the bear could no prepare for the bear prepare for the bear much more likely. Maybe they're the same bear

2250
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:52,900
Why

2251
02:28:53,780 --> 02:28:55,780
There's just two bears and there they are

2252
02:28:56,740 --> 02:28:58,740
It's just one of the two bears

2253
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:00,100
Uh

2254
02:29:00,100 --> 02:29:03,780
It's so good. This is so good. Did we say on the show that like

2255
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:11,620
Hey, we'd love to maybe put some of these uh new comics in the in the in the throw them in the in the dang

2256
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:13,940
Perfect comic party

2257
02:29:14,180 --> 02:29:19,700
I think I should we definitely mentioned it. But yeah, I should reach out to new on twitter and like ask him like

2258
02:29:19,700 --> 02:29:23,380
Hey, what do you think? What do you think if we put these in there? Should we?

2259
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:27,220
You you said you you have the high res of all the

2260
02:29:28,260 --> 02:29:31,060
The past chapters, right? Uh, yes

2261
02:29:31,860 --> 02:29:33,860
Okay, cool. Um

2262
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:37,300
This one

2263
02:29:37,300 --> 02:29:39,300
This one's really this one looks really good

2264
02:29:40,020 --> 02:29:46,420
The faces in this one are really cool. I have I don't have enough nice things to say about news art

2265
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:48,660
uh, but I think

2266
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:53,380
There's uh, there is a new there is a new drawn comic in the dojin. So

2267
02:29:54,180 --> 02:29:58,420
That'll be funny. I need a dress like this. This is a good dress. It looks cool

2268
02:29:59,380 --> 02:30:04,820
This this the one where you got your tongue hanging out the the posture. Yeah, it's great. You look like

2269
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:11,860
You're running me of elaine from sign film and I always liked her so pretty

2270
02:30:12,660 --> 02:30:17,860
Look at the librarian like a gothic librarian. Yes. Very cool. Very

2271
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:20,500
Very nice

2272
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:21,780
new

2273
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:23,780
You've done it again

2274
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:26,420
You saw you son of a bitch. You've done it again

2275
02:30:27,140 --> 02:30:29,700
Uh, thank you very much. I'll appreciate it

2276
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:32,420
uh, next one

2277
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:34,260
should be like

2278
02:30:34,260 --> 02:30:36,260
You know, I saw um

2279
02:30:36,980 --> 02:30:42,180
I saw the dick show like posting fan art. They were like posting the fan art that they got that week

2280
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:45,220
on twitter

2281
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:47,700
And maybe we should do that or something. I don't know

2282
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:50,900
Because like yeah, that's pretty funny

2283
02:30:52,020 --> 02:30:54,020
Some of the stuff probably deserves to be

2284
02:30:54,260 --> 02:30:59,220
I mean, we don't really use the twitter for that much. Do we I don't I really don't use the twitter for for

2285
02:30:59,940 --> 02:31:02,340
I hardly ever do. Yeah, I just use it to retweet

2286
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:05,060
Maybe things

2287
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:10,500
That I tweet that maybe I want the pcp audience to see as well and like that's mostly most of what I do with it

2288
02:31:11,540 --> 02:31:13,460
um

2289
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:19,060
Yeah, it'd be a good idea. I think probably it probably would be a good idea. Okay. The next one is an image

2290
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:22,580
What is

2291
02:31:22,660 --> 02:31:24,660
Dang this

2292
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:32,100
Dang congressman, which I had a wife who would tell me her prophetic dreams. Oh

2293
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:34,580
it's um

2294
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:35,940
I think

2295
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:38,340
If I'm remembering remembering correctly

2296
02:31:39,380 --> 02:31:43,540
There's a there's a congressman called a representative clay higgins

2297
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:49,940
Who just straight up says that like his wife gets visions from god and has prophetic dreams

2298
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:54,820
Yeah, I think I may have heard of it. Yeah, and and he

2299
02:31:56,900 --> 02:31:58,900
I wish I had a wife who would tell me everything

2300
02:31:59,860 --> 02:32:05,300
Maybe if I had a maybe if I had a psychic profit for a wife, maybe I could have been a congressman too

2301
02:32:06,340 --> 02:32:08,580
Uh, unfortunately, it just didn't work out that way

2302
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:13,380
I'm pretty sure it's clay higgins that I'm thinking of

2303
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:16,100
Um, unless I mixed him up with someone

2304
02:32:16,660 --> 02:32:23,140
Because I follow clay higgins on twitter and his tweets are boring and but I just followed him for the meme

2305
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:26,420
Next one is

2306
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:31,700
Oh, I already posted it. Next one is called to gib from me. Please and thankles

2307
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:34,340
three two one go

2308
02:32:35,060 --> 02:32:38,500
Yeah, I don't know if you heard yet, but ben was

2309
02:32:39,460 --> 02:32:41,460
racist

2310
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:44,100
That the robot was in your place for

2311
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:50,260
Uh, do you need skulls for me? Thank you. What what did you say?

2312
02:32:50,980 --> 02:32:56,420
Wait robot. You must have it must have taken my mind. You remind me how racist you are ben saint

2313
02:32:56,900 --> 02:33:03,060
I said that you scolded me. You woke scolded me for saying that gino samuels

2314
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:07,460
Delivery was stiff and robotic. You said I shouldn't use the r-word

2315
02:33:08,740 --> 02:33:10,740
Oh

2316
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:13,300
You said it was triggering and I said I would do better

2317
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:16,100
Um

2318
02:33:16,420 --> 02:33:18,420
How do you not remember? How do you not remember this?

2319
02:33:18,980 --> 02:33:23,540
Uh, I don't know. I just you were so you were so you were so adamant. You were so

2320
02:33:24,100 --> 02:33:26,100
Impassioned about it

2321
02:33:26,100 --> 02:33:28,100
It was a rollback

2322
02:33:28,820 --> 02:33:30,340
I got you

2323
02:33:30,340 --> 02:33:36,580
Uh, next one is called. Oh, here we go. Gib appreciation. Oh, this one's not the ben and gib appreciation hour

2324
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:41,700
This one's just the gib appreciation not even an hour. All right. Okay three two one go

2325
02:33:42,420 --> 02:33:45,940
Also on this episode of the ben and gib appreciation hour

2326
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:50,660
I was listening to gib stream and she made a very cute funny joke

2327
02:33:51,380 --> 02:33:57,620
Where she just went like oh looking at my character stats high strength high speed. Hi. How are you?

2328
02:33:58,660 --> 02:34:02,980
And I appreciate that joke. It was small, but it was and it was subtle, but it was good

2329
02:34:03,620 --> 02:34:05,140
also also

2330
02:34:05,140 --> 02:34:07,140
I figured I should give a counterpart to

2331
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:15,460
Music that is very ben saint core music that feels very gib core. Have you ever heard of igloo ghost igloo ghost?

2332
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:18,580
Everything is really weird glitch core like

2333
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:20,260
um

2334
02:34:20,260 --> 02:34:22,500
Bops and whistles kind of sounding music

2335
02:34:23,220 --> 02:34:29,140
That is like very otherworldly, but also the mascots for it are like these weird little like

2336
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:33,780
clown-esque alien creatures with like big noses and party hats and um

2337
02:34:34,740 --> 02:34:41,380
The the lyrics I think are supposed to be like their language and it's really weird and funny and cute

2338
02:34:41,700 --> 02:34:49,300
And I feel like gib might like that and it just it feels gib core. It's like it's like odd and silly

2339
02:34:50,260 --> 02:34:53,860
and and and like nice and and chaotic and cool

2340
02:34:54,740 --> 02:34:56,980
And I don't know check it out

2341
02:34:57,220 --> 02:34:59,220
So

2342
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:05,780
I get regular ghost and you get igloo ghost. I get igloo ghost. Oh, I'm I'm looking at uh, I googled it

2343
02:35:06,500 --> 02:35:10,740
There's a little image of the little mascot character

2344
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:14,100
That is a gib core design

2345
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:18,100
Very cute. I yeah, I'll give this a listen

2346
02:35:20,820 --> 02:35:22,580
Sounds kind of neat

2347
02:35:22,580 --> 02:35:25,060
I'm almost a little more interested in this than in ghosts

2348
02:35:26,020 --> 02:35:28,020
Because it because I've never heard of this before

2349
02:35:28,740 --> 02:35:31,700
And once I've heard of something that's how I know that I'm not gonna like it

2350
02:35:32,420 --> 02:35:34,420
um, so

2351
02:35:35,300 --> 02:35:37,300
I was gonna say oh

2352
02:35:38,420 --> 02:35:45,060
Uh, you made a cute you made that cute joke. I had a bit on my last stream. I said I was really high energy and I was really like

2353
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:48,260
Uh, a hyper I I had a

2354
02:35:49,300 --> 02:35:52,740
A thing I don't know. I made myself laugh up roriously

2355
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:56,820
Well, that's always fun. That's always good when you know

2356
02:35:57,380 --> 02:36:02,900
I had a I had a bit that I I meant to clip it. I think I I should go back and I should clip it or something

2357
02:36:03,220 --> 02:36:05,220
Uh about how like

2358
02:36:06,020 --> 02:36:10,340
When I don't know if the story of mega man dot exe you have to

2359
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:15,380
update hub dot bat in or and you sync your and hub's dna

2360
02:36:15,940 --> 02:36:19,700
Because your twins you sync your dna 100 and you become

2361
02:36:19,940 --> 02:36:23,060
Sinked and so though if you die in the game you die in real life. Well

2362
02:36:23,780 --> 02:36:28,420
Uh, it was like, oh, what if what if um, what if hub was circumcised?

2363
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:31,380
And land was not and that's why hub died

2364
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:35,860
Like hub died because of being circumcised and so your dad is like land

2365
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:40,900
You have to you you have to run hub dot bat to complete his genetic code and sync it with you

2366
02:36:41,060 --> 02:36:47,780
But the one downside is if you do it you'll become so perfectly synced that you become circumcised just like your brother

2367
02:36:48,740 --> 02:36:50,740
It's the only way

2368
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:54,820
The only way to save him land. You have to be circumcised

2369
02:36:55,780 --> 02:36:58,740
To update the circumcised data into your dna

2370
02:37:01,460 --> 02:37:03,860
I I I'm killing myself again

2371
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:06,820
um

2372
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:07,860
It's just

2373
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:13,620
It's just your dad your dad is really fucked up your dad makes you do like he's a really he's a huge freak and he's like

2374
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:21,860
It's really it's actually really good that dr. Light didn't have any kids in the main timeline because that guy's a fucking sick sick fuck

2375
02:37:22,580 --> 02:37:23,780
um

2376
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:25,780
Next one is uh an image

2377
02:37:26,020 --> 02:37:30,660
And there's also a voicemail to go with it. Oh, it's a little guy. Oh, it's a little guy

2378
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:33,060
with his little

2379
02:37:33,060 --> 02:37:34,500
orbs

2380
02:37:34,500 --> 02:37:36,020
His little orbs

2381
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:38,020
Uh, let's listen three two one go

2382
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:42,900
Just as an example here is one of the mascots for the song clear tummy

2383
02:37:43,460 --> 02:37:45,060
By igloo ghost

2384
02:37:45,060 --> 02:37:52,180
Cute little guy. Don't you think I feel like he is gift core. I feel like this guy. That's what you said. I'll you any day

2385
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:54,900
Okay. Bye. Bye

2386
02:37:55,060 --> 02:37:57,460
Yes, I agree. He had he had the same

2387
02:37:58,260 --> 02:38:00,580
He had the same thought uh cool

2388
02:38:01,300 --> 02:38:03,300
Well, that's the last voicemail

2389
02:38:03,700 --> 02:38:04,660
So

2390
02:38:04,660 --> 02:38:06,500
Yeah

2391
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:08,500
I didn't read

2392
02:38:08,580 --> 02:38:09,860
One piece

2393
02:38:09,940 --> 02:38:11,300
In fact, I'm too

2394
02:38:11,300 --> 02:38:17,780
In fact, I'm two chapters behind because I didn't read it last week either. Oh dear. Yeah, because um

2395
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:23,540
Well, what do you you want to read it right now? Um, or

2396
02:38:25,700 --> 02:38:27,700
Is it too? I

2397
02:38:27,780 --> 02:38:29,780
I've read it so

2398
02:38:30,260 --> 02:38:34,820
You want let me just let me just check. I mean, it might be a really could really cool one

2399
02:38:35,540 --> 02:38:40,340
Yeah, I remember I'm remembering it being like like oh

2400
02:38:41,380 --> 02:38:47,060
Like a little bit of a pog moment. I see. Oh, yeah, it was definitely a pog moment. I think you should

2401
02:38:49,140 --> 02:38:51,140
Okay, so

2402
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:55,460
Uh, I guess I'll do that right now with that. Um, yeah, okay, so let me

2403
02:38:57,060 --> 02:39:01,460
No, wait, you you you did there was a break. So there's there's no um

2404
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:04,740
Oh, right like last week there was a break

2405
02:39:06,100 --> 02:39:11,140
Was there? I mean, I don't remember. Well, I am I'm reading the most recent chapter 1076

2406
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:18,340
And that follows on immediately from 1075 which we did read on the show. All right, let me um

2407
02:39:20,180 --> 02:39:22,180
Oh, yeah 1076

2408
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:24,980
It's the one with um

2409
02:39:26,020 --> 02:39:30,980
There's a double color page spread of the straw hats doing a cool poses and stuff

2410
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:34,420
Oh

2411
02:39:37,140 --> 02:39:42,820
I'm I'm a little did I did I read 10 1075 it's the yeah the gore say

2412
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:46,180
Standing there with the vega punk and then

2413
02:39:47,380 --> 02:39:51,220
Yeah, yeah, okay. I did I did read this one. Okay. At the end of the last one

2414
02:39:52,180 --> 02:39:53,540
it was like

2415
02:39:53,540 --> 02:39:55,540
Zorro and Luffy

2416
02:39:55,620 --> 02:40:01,460
With kaku and luchi and considering maybe letting them free because the seraphim have gone nuts

2417
02:40:05,140 --> 02:40:07,140
Yes, okay, I'm reading

2418
02:40:08,820 --> 02:40:11,860
And I'm gonna pee while you do that. Yeah, good good good

2419
02:40:13,940 --> 02:40:17,460
The the shorthand I feel like Oda's shorthand for being like

2420
02:40:19,300 --> 02:40:24,900
The coolest old guy in the world is drinking a huge amount of sake from a big plate

2421
02:40:26,020 --> 02:40:32,260
Yeah, he's always doing that that shanks what a white beard what was always doing it and now shanks is always doing it

2422
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:39,620
I also like how

2423
02:40:40,260 --> 02:40:42,180
he draws shanks

2424
02:40:42,180 --> 02:40:44,180
without those like

2425
02:40:44,420 --> 02:40:45,620
trousers

2426
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:48,500
That have like they go below the knee but only a little bit

2427
02:40:49,140 --> 02:40:50,020
Hmm

2428
02:40:50,020 --> 02:40:54,980
They look really comfortable, but for some reason they're also like really badass like ah, yeah

2429
02:40:56,500 --> 02:41:00,740
Uh, I mean, I think they look badass because they're on shanks. I guess I guess so

2430
02:41:01,300 --> 02:41:03,300
But I want some

2431
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:05,700
I guess I kind of have some already

2432
02:41:07,060 --> 02:41:13,140
Imagine like a an edgy tee and being like, oh, I want to wear those those those fluffy floral pant

2433
02:41:13,460 --> 02:41:16,500
pant like long shorts that like tie up on the leg

2434
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:21,060
I'll look like such a badass just like shanks. I always thought I always thought

2435
02:41:22,020 --> 02:41:27,060
Oda knew how to draw legs that looked comfortable to be

2436
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:32,420
Like Luffy's shorts the whole time. It's like, why don't they sell shorts like that?

2437
02:41:33,060 --> 02:41:35,060
This look cool

2438
02:41:36,660 --> 02:41:43,300
They sell like fake like sort of scuffed jeans and all like you can roll a jean up, but like it doesn't quite work

2439
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:47,700
They're like fluffy somehow

2440
02:41:51,140 --> 02:41:53,140
Dory and Broggy

2441
02:41:53,140 --> 02:41:54,820
What?

2442
02:41:54,820 --> 02:41:56,820
No, I mean

2443
02:41:58,260 --> 02:42:01,140
Who's that big kid?

2444
02:42:02,580 --> 02:42:06,580
Just a kid I guess looks I like that big kid looks cool

2445
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:10,020
Do you have a message for captain kid?

2446
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:15,860
Tell him he can either hand over his load pona griff rubbings and scram or he can risk fighting me. Hmm

2447
02:42:16,980 --> 02:42:19,140
Kid lost his arm fighting

2448
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:22,100
Shanks's

2449
02:42:22,180 --> 02:42:23,700
fleet

2450
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:25,700
Yeah, I don't think it was

2451
02:42:27,140 --> 02:42:29,140
I can't remember if that was like him

2452
02:42:29,860 --> 02:42:35,540
Like before time skip. He didn't have an arm. He may have had two arms and then in the time skip

2453
02:42:37,060 --> 02:42:40,020
Bunch of shit happened and he lost his arm fighting shanks's crew

2454
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:42,500
I thought he always had the

2455
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:46,260
Well, I know he always had the the magnet power

2456
02:42:47,220 --> 02:42:49,220
Yeah, I don't remember

2457
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:53,060
Weird

2458
02:42:53,620 --> 02:43:01,620
This seems weird that kid lost his arm fighting against red hair shanks who has one arm what's going on

2459
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:04,180
Is that just a coincidence?

2460
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:06,900
Did he steal kid's arm to replace his own?

2461
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:14,180
Kid you specifically have the just the right arm

2462
02:43:14,900 --> 02:43:16,180
It or

2463
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:18,180
Wait a minute. I'm putting it all together

2464
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:25,220
They were going to build the perfect white beard clone. They made uh, they made white beard's son

2465
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:29,220
And shanks was going to donate his arm to the hideous frankenstein projects

2466
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:34,820
But he lost it so we had to steal kid's arm to donate his instead to stitch the this man together

2467
02:43:36,660 --> 02:43:39,700
What's the way sounds legit? What's the white beard kid's name?

2468
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:41,780
Uh

2469
02:43:41,780 --> 02:43:43,780
Eugene

2470
02:43:43,780 --> 02:43:49,780
You oh the the edward weevil we the other guy edward we've yeah weevil weevil

2471
02:43:53,220 --> 02:43:55,220
Okay, uh

2472
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:07,060
They won't settle for an arm this time maybe the chief's coming through

2473
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:12,420
So glad to see you youtube back then oh your protection money. We don't do that

2474
02:44:13,220 --> 02:44:18,020
They won't settle for an arm this time. They'll take your life instead only if I lose ha ha ha. Oh my god

2475
02:44:19,780 --> 02:44:21,780
Wow

2476
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:26,660
Yeah, so it's they're fighting about this they're yeah, um

2477
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:30,260
I

2478
02:44:30,260 --> 02:44:32,660
All right, so I caught the uh the thing

2479
02:44:34,420 --> 02:44:38,340
That they gave a me little baby me hawk the dice dice fruit

2480
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:44,740
That's really I don't know. It's cool. I guess the idea behind each of them is they gave each one like the best fruit

2481
02:44:44,740 --> 02:44:46,740
They could that's why they gave baby ginbay

2482
02:44:47,060 --> 02:44:50,180
The the wave fruit to turn that he could swim through anything

2483
02:44:50,740 --> 02:44:54,260
And they give the best swordsmen in the world the I forgot about that

2484
02:44:54,820 --> 02:44:58,660
Yeah, and they give this guy they give him the thing that turns his whole body into a sword

2485
02:44:59,380 --> 02:45:03,380
That's awesome. Yeah, it's so fucking powerful dude

2486
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:06,580
Yeah, cool

2487
02:45:06,660 --> 02:45:08,900
So yeah, scary shit initially

2488
02:45:09,940 --> 02:45:12,820
They're fighting the two of them the the kuma

2489
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:15,540
Seraphim and the me hawk seraphim

2490
02:45:16,900 --> 02:45:18,900
And it's a little too much

2491
02:45:20,180 --> 02:45:22,420
And they gave yeah, the me hawk the the leg

2492
02:45:23,060 --> 02:45:25,060
Not the leg but like the um

2493
02:45:25,300 --> 02:45:27,300
The turn your whole body into a sword thing

2494
02:45:28,100 --> 02:45:30,260
Dice dice the dice dice fruit. Yeah

2495
02:45:31,860 --> 02:45:33,860
And so they agree

2496
02:45:34,100 --> 02:45:38,980
Uh to let him out. I like how luchi is not trying to be subtle at all

2497
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:42,660
Like he he's not he's not the kind of person

2498
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:44,900
to like

2499
02:45:44,900 --> 02:45:46,340
scheme I guess

2500
02:45:46,340 --> 02:45:48,340
He's just gonna say I'll kill you

2501
02:45:49,220 --> 02:45:51,780
I'll work with you now and then I'll try and kill you afterwards

2502
02:45:54,740 --> 02:46:00,660
Oh, I'll kill you. Oh, I'll kill you all right. Yeah, uh, it's like help us help us uh

2503
02:46:01,620 --> 02:46:07,060
Help us get these guys and then let us put you the handcuffs back on okay

2504
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:12,820
They're like, yeah, sure. Yeah, whatever

2505
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:14,740
Yeah, of course

2506
02:46:14,740 --> 02:46:16,740
And he's so proud he he like

2507
02:46:17,860 --> 02:46:19,220
Is easily

2508
02:46:19,220 --> 02:46:26,020
Is easily got by the the insinuation that he's like it would be a cow and a sore loser if he didn't yeah

2509
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:30,500
Yeah, you can't beat me so after this you got to fight me

2510
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:33,940
and

2511
02:46:34,260 --> 02:46:35,300
You know

2512
02:46:35,300 --> 02:46:40,260
Once, you know, if you win if you beat me then whatever but like, you know, you can't beat me

2513
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:43,140
So you can't you can't just do whatever you want. You got to fight me first

2514
02:46:43,780 --> 02:46:47,460
It's the same fight you it's similar. I guess to that moment when

2515
02:46:48,580 --> 02:46:50,820
He fought alki g the first time

2516
02:46:51,140 --> 02:46:56,900
And he said like Luffy alkegi. Yeah, Luffy fought alkegi and he got turned to ice

2517
02:46:56,980 --> 02:47:00,020
But because it was like a one-on-one duel he sort of like

2518
02:47:00,820 --> 02:47:04,100
Protected his friends by making it about like just them

2519
02:47:05,060 --> 02:47:08,260
And alkegi was like her. I guess I can't kill everyone

2520
02:47:08,740 --> 02:47:11,540
Like I plan to that's pretty cool. You got me

2521
02:47:12,980 --> 02:47:13,860
I

2522
02:47:13,860 --> 02:47:19,860
I forget exactly how I don't really remember what he was sort of like an like an honorable duel sort of situation

2523
02:47:21,780 --> 02:47:24,020
In order to protect his crew

2524
02:47:26,820 --> 02:47:30,340
But this time is a little more low stakes because luchi can't be luffy

2525
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:37,220
He probably can't I mean didn't didn't they just lose didn't luchi like just get owned

2526
02:47:38,020 --> 02:47:39,060
He did

2527
02:47:39,060 --> 02:47:41,060
Yeah, so I don't know

2528
02:47:41,060 --> 02:47:46,500
But he did come back. It wasn't like he was at the brink of death. He came back with the through with the

2529
02:47:47,140 --> 02:47:49,140
With kaku and stussy

2530
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:51,460
at the top

2531
02:47:51,460 --> 02:47:53,460
after they had retreated to

2532
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:56,980
To the egg area or whatever it's called

2533
02:48:00,340 --> 02:48:05,140
So they're all right, they've temporarily joined forces against uh

2534
02:48:05,780 --> 02:48:08,820
Frickin, I think it's just the the me hawk and the kuma

2535
02:48:09,780 --> 02:48:11,140
sarah phim

2536
02:48:11,140 --> 02:48:12,580
It looks so cool

2537
02:48:12,580 --> 02:48:16,020
Then doing their their big attacks at the same time. Oh, yeah

2538
02:48:16,660 --> 02:48:19,220
And of course kaku was like a swordsman. So it's like

2539
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:23,220
So it's their enemies. They're one-on-one enemies

2540
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:26,340
But together

2541
02:48:26,660 --> 02:48:29,060
It's like crack for me six king gun

2542
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:39,380
Yeah, luffy and luffy and luchi fighting together and uh, uh, zoro and kaku fighting together

2543
02:48:40,340 --> 02:48:45,460
I love I love kaku the fight the the zora versus kaku was one of my favorites of the whole series

2544
02:48:46,340 --> 02:48:47,700
yeah

2545
02:48:47,700 --> 02:48:49,700
The whole like fucking cutting through

2546
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:54,660
The any's lobby tower and then it was like slowly shifting the entire time after that

2547
02:48:56,100 --> 02:48:59,940
Yeah, I just liked him him using his like giant

2548
02:49:00,580 --> 02:49:01,860
giraffe

2549
02:49:01,860 --> 02:49:03,860
body so like

2550
02:49:04,100 --> 02:49:07,220
You can't outreach me. I'm everywhere

2551
02:49:10,340 --> 02:49:14,740
I can't wait to see it return. I can't beat a neck that long

2552
02:49:15,540 --> 02:49:18,340
There's no what do you even do against a neck like that?

2553
02:49:20,740 --> 02:49:22,740
Slice it I don't think so

2554
02:49:23,780 --> 02:49:28,740
Uh, so so then then we're in some sort of containment chamber

2555
02:49:30,340 --> 02:49:32,740
With a bunch of government intelligence agents

2556
02:49:35,060 --> 02:49:36,580
Yeah

2557
02:49:36,580 --> 02:49:38,580
From various crestinator podcast

2558
02:49:39,460 --> 02:49:41,460
Uh, ha ha ha true

2559
02:49:41,700 --> 02:49:43,700
various make clones. Yeah

2560
02:49:44,580 --> 02:49:46,020
and um

2561
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:48,420
So it seems two months back when we were meant to set sail

2562
02:49:49,540 --> 02:49:52,420
The weaponized seabees attacked us. We were brought to the island

2563
02:49:52,900 --> 02:49:56,980
Then other game agents came so two months ago something was going on

2564
02:49:57,460 --> 02:50:00,740
Agents were being captured and held in prison

2565
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:07,380
And then other agents that were sent to get them were held in prison, which is probably why cp0 is here

2566
02:50:08,020 --> 02:50:09,460
Yeah

2567
02:50:09,460 --> 02:50:14,660
In some in some fashion because because to them this is like oh, they thought vega punk was

2568
02:50:15,380 --> 02:50:22,820
Doing this capturing cp9 agents and just hold they thought they thought he was pulling a trade federation from the start of phantom menace

2569
02:50:23,460 --> 02:50:28,740
When they were just like catching. Oh, you sent your goons to come and inspect us. Well, we'll fucking

2570
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:31,380
Trap him and murder him. We'll gas him

2571
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:33,460
uh

2572
02:50:33,460 --> 02:50:35,460
But he says he

2573
02:50:35,460 --> 02:50:39,780
Is not the one behind it. He had no idea and now he's in here

2574
02:50:40,420 --> 02:50:42,420
and wasn't he

2575
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:44,660
I'm sorry. Wasn't he like a baby?

2576
02:50:46,020 --> 02:50:47,540
Moments ago. Yes

2577
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:49,540
He what well moments

2578
02:50:49,700 --> 02:50:53,460
It's been a bit a few minutes. There was that everyone split up

2579
02:50:54,100 --> 02:50:56,580
And go look for vega punk. So he's been gone for a little while

2580
02:50:58,100 --> 02:50:59,940
But yeah, bonnie

2581
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:02,500
Took his age out and turned it into funny little shapes

2582
02:51:03,300 --> 02:51:05,300
Right as one does

2583
02:51:05,540 --> 02:51:08,180
And I guess he got those back at some point

2584
02:51:08,980 --> 02:51:13,860
Yeah, and is now locked up after getting punched

2585
02:51:14,580 --> 02:51:15,940
probably

2586
02:51:15,940 --> 02:51:20,420
By bonnie, I guess. I mean, I can't think oh, yeah, he's like bleeding, right? Yeah

2587
02:51:20,420 --> 02:51:24,740
Yeah, he's got he got beat up and locked here and now he's learning about this thing going on

2588
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:28,260
Um, damn

2589
02:51:28,980 --> 02:51:30,980
They said vega punk could see everything

2590
02:51:31,060 --> 02:51:35,300
Kid knows everything, but does he know why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast cream?

2591
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:38,740
I mean why they're locking my captain kids like the taste

2592
02:51:39,380 --> 02:51:41,380
Yeah

2593
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:46,260
Uh, he didn't he didn't even know is happening under his own nose some some genius

2594
02:51:47,060 --> 02:51:48,020
um

2595
02:51:48,020 --> 02:51:50,020
Yeah, so it's it's

2596
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:56,100
One thing so who so I've no idea who the fuck could possibly I mean, I guess someone is is running things over

2597
02:51:57,540 --> 02:51:59,540
Maybe it was that shadowy figure that we saw

2598
02:52:00,500 --> 02:52:02,500
looming over one of the vega punks

2599
02:52:03,460 --> 02:52:05,460
before I thought that was just like a

2600
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:08,020
a hint of the seraphim

2601
02:52:09,140 --> 02:52:12,100
Yeah, maybe it was just one of the seraphim. I didn't didn't we

2602
02:52:12,580 --> 02:52:16,420
Wasn't there like a like a dark figure with like glowing eyes and we were like not sure

2603
02:52:17,700 --> 02:52:19,700
I was and it might

2604
02:52:19,700 --> 02:52:21,700
Or might not have been a seraphim

2605
02:52:22,180 --> 02:52:28,260
Uh, I guess we could go back and check. I felt like that was like, oh, there's something going on here

2606
02:52:28,260 --> 02:52:30,740
What's the mystery and it's oh, it's the seraphim but like

2607
02:52:31,300 --> 02:52:34,660
Yeah, there's another person that was not revealed in that moment

2608
02:52:34,820 --> 02:52:40,260
That is probably the person who is now being referred to as leaking data to the world government

2609
02:52:40,820 --> 02:52:42,020
Yeah

2610
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:47,140
And and all of the reasons that like vega punks like research is being outed

2611
02:52:47,860 --> 02:52:51,380
Um, the stuff that obviously he wouldn't let this slip himself

2612
02:52:51,860 --> 02:52:56,100
Stuff that would get the world government to to fucking send warships to kill him

2613
02:52:57,060 --> 02:52:59,780
Um, so yeah, somebody's been leaking stuff

2614
02:53:01,220 --> 02:53:03,220
And I guess

2615
02:53:03,700 --> 02:53:05,300
Who?

2616
02:53:05,300 --> 02:53:08,980
Is there anyone currently that we know about who it could be do you think?

2617
02:53:11,460 --> 02:53:13,460
Santomaru

2618
02:53:13,700 --> 02:53:15,700
I mean, why would he do it?

2619
02:53:15,940 --> 02:53:17,940
I don't know. He was already like

2620
02:53:18,660 --> 02:53:22,020
marine affiliated, but he was like loyal to vega punk

2621
02:53:22,820 --> 02:53:24,420
Yeah, we've learned

2622
02:53:24,500 --> 02:53:27,380
Because he was rescued like a as a baby or something

2623
02:53:28,500 --> 02:53:29,540
I mean

2624
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:33,940
Who have we seen that hasn't I'm just trying to think of who has any authority on egghead?

2625
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:36,740
I mean vega punks the guy and then there's like his seven

2626
02:53:37,460 --> 02:53:41,460
Clones or whatever and their sentomaru is like his direct underling

2627
02:53:42,580 --> 02:53:49,860
And then there's stussy who was a cp0 agent. Well, stussy just got here. I know but like

2628
02:53:50,100 --> 02:53:56,500
How do we know that? I don't fucking know. That's not that's not a good that's not a good theory. Um

2629
02:53:58,420 --> 02:54:01,700
She's just suspicious. I guess these guys have been here for two months

2630
02:54:02,340 --> 02:54:07,780
So someone's been here for a while. Yes, either somebody who's just not been introduced yet

2631
02:54:08,660 --> 02:54:13,380
Yeah, or it could be one of the vega punk like robots

2632
02:54:14,180 --> 02:54:18,740
Maybe maybe one could one of them be rogue and the other's not I think no

2633
02:54:20,260 --> 02:54:24,660
It could be but then like what's the seraphim doing killing the vega punks?

2634
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:31,860
You know, but is he killing all of them? Maybe he's is there one that like maybe hasn't been attacked

2635
02:54:35,140 --> 02:54:39,380
But don't well all the vega punks know everything that all the other vega punks know

2636
02:54:39,940 --> 02:54:44,020
Yeah, that's the only thing that's a little weird. I guess we don't know exactly how it works

2637
02:54:44,020 --> 02:54:46,420
But that's how it's been explained is that they share

2638
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:49,220
They share data

2639
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:53,700
Yeah, I guess they don't necessarily share experiences because one of them

2640
02:54:54,740 --> 02:54:56,740
will have like

2641
02:54:56,740 --> 02:55:01,300
Thoughts like they'll see something and they'll have to report it by speaking to the others

2642
02:55:02,580 --> 02:55:04,500
Oh, so like you think they can have

2643
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:10,740
Their own individual like thoughts about stuff and the others. It's just like information they learn

2644
02:55:11,940 --> 02:55:13,940
Yeah, I mean maybe yeah

2645
02:55:14,980 --> 02:55:21,540
Because like a thought in your head is not like something you see or hear or whatever. So maybe that stuff is not

2646
02:55:22,660 --> 02:55:24,100
transmitted

2647
02:55:24,100 --> 02:55:26,100
Yeah, it could be

2648
02:55:27,220 --> 02:55:32,820
I don't know. Lilith is evil. Lilith is just evil. Lilith is the evil one

2649
02:55:33,780 --> 02:55:38,340
But I mean she was with the others and she was being attacked with them

2650
02:55:39,140 --> 02:55:42,100
I mean the the most surprising one would be if it was shaka

2651
02:55:42,980 --> 02:55:45,060
But number one. Yeah

2652
02:55:46,260 --> 02:55:51,700
I feel like he's got more power to do that because he's like the guy who looks at all the information

2653
02:55:51,700 --> 02:55:54,100
He says things to everyone about what's happening

2654
02:55:55,060 --> 02:55:57,060
He seems the most on the level

2655
02:55:58,180 --> 02:56:02,100
Which is why it's like it would be the most he seems like the least likely candidate

2656
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:07,300
But that makes him probably my first guess if it is one of them, it's probably him

2657
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:11,140
Yeah, so

2658
02:56:11,140 --> 02:56:15,860
I guess at the moment we don't have much to go on other than the fact that not really where is bonnie

2659
02:56:16,340 --> 02:56:19,860
Um, and what did she learn when she got the kuma thing?

2660
02:56:20,500 --> 02:56:24,420
Did she learn more? Why is she not here? Did she do anything bad?

2661
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:27,780
Where'd she go?

2662
02:56:28,740 --> 02:56:33,540
Because if there was a bad guy if there was a bad guy that was orchestrating all of this for two months

2663
02:56:33,940 --> 02:56:37,060
And then they found vega punk beat him up and locked him up here

2664
02:56:38,340 --> 02:56:40,340
Did they not find bonnie either?

2665
02:56:41,540 --> 02:56:43,540
Is bonnie just somewhere else?

2666
02:56:48,740 --> 02:56:51,940
I think I think the fact that yeah, I think they I think they probably

2667
02:56:52,900 --> 02:56:59,300
Split up. I think bonnie and vega punk must have split up and then vega punk was taken in

2668
02:57:00,740 --> 02:57:04,100
I mean, this is all happening. This is like happening pretty fast. Yeah

2669
02:57:04,980 --> 02:57:09,300
Uh, so like they're probably still look whoever is doing this probably is looking for

2670
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:15,380
Bonnie or maybe they decided that bonnie is fine and they can let bonnie go

2671
02:57:16,180 --> 02:57:21,380
Yeah, I think it might be shaka. That's my this is my theory but it's only because

2672
02:57:22,580 --> 02:57:25,460
When they lost track of vega punk and bonnie

2673
02:57:25,540 --> 02:57:28,900
He was the one who was looking at the monitors and saying, oh, we don't know where they are

2674
02:57:29,300 --> 02:57:31,300
Everyone's split up

2675
02:57:31,300 --> 02:57:37,060
And everyone just agreed that he is calling the shots. So he would be the one who could

2676
02:57:37,860 --> 02:57:40,980
Throw everything direct people. Yeah. Yeah, definitely

2677
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:44,980
I mean, I have no idea. I have no idea why he would do that but like

2678
02:57:45,780 --> 02:57:50,580
We don't know anything about him other than that. He is vega punk sort of and he is

2679
02:57:52,020 --> 02:57:54,180
In charge

2680
02:57:54,180 --> 02:57:56,180
Yeah, and also the seraphim

2681
02:57:56,740 --> 02:58:02,260
They weren't necessarily attacking him in that room. They were attacking the cp zero and luffy and zoro

2682
02:58:03,140 --> 02:58:08,180
There's enough other people there that they weren't just attacking him. So maybe he was like on the white list

2683
02:58:09,460 --> 02:58:11,460
Yeah, but you wouldn't notice

2684
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:20,900
Yeah, he's he's he's I would say he's my suspect number one. Yeah, just because he has the most opportunity to do it

2685
02:58:22,500 --> 02:58:24,500
Uh

2686
02:58:24,500 --> 02:58:27,940
And it would have to entail that like some yeah, there's there's some

2687
02:58:28,580 --> 02:58:35,620
Either they don't actually know everything that all the other vega punks know or there's some mech mechanism by which one can hide something from the others

2688
02:58:35,620 --> 02:58:42,500
But I mean, uh, yeah outside of that or maybe sentomaru, I can't think of anyone else who would be

2689
02:58:43,780 --> 02:58:45,780
Doing some weird

2690
02:58:45,780 --> 02:58:48,260
Betrayal over like a long period of time

2691
02:58:52,740 --> 02:58:56,500
Well unless unless vega punk is just actually what if he's just lying

2692
02:58:56,820 --> 02:59:02,660
What if he's actually just lying and he put himself in jail and uh, he's he is bad and the mastermind

2693
02:59:02,900 --> 02:59:05,700
And all of them are are just playing a big long con

2694
02:59:09,060 --> 02:59:11,540
You know, it's possible. I just feel like

2695
02:59:13,620 --> 02:59:15,300
It would be a shame

2696
02:59:15,300 --> 02:59:17,860
If like vega punk was a bad guy this whole time

2697
02:59:18,900 --> 02:59:20,900
I agree

2698
02:59:21,860 --> 02:59:26,100
But what if I don't want daft punk to be evil we'll have to have to kill daft punk

2699
02:59:27,300 --> 02:59:30,820
Maybe he's not a daft punk after all. Maybe he's a sensible punk

2700
02:59:32,740 --> 02:59:35,700
What if he takes his head mask off and underneath is like

2701
02:59:37,220 --> 02:59:41,620
She's got some kind of fucked up. She's got some fucked up comedic villain face underneath

2702
02:59:42,820 --> 02:59:44,180
He's got some

2703
02:59:44,180 --> 02:59:45,860
big teeth or something

2704
02:59:45,860 --> 02:59:50,820
Yeah, like he's resentful for dr. Vega punk for making him ugly so that he needs to wear a mask

2705
02:59:51,220 --> 02:59:54,660
Yeah, you made all the other vega punks look nice. Well, what about me, huh?

2706
02:59:55,460 --> 02:59:57,140
That's why I started

2707
02:59:57,140 --> 02:59:59,140
spying on you and taking your secrets

2708
03:00:00,020 --> 03:00:02,020
Hmm. Yep

2709
03:00:02,020 --> 03:00:06,100
And vega punk nods and says, yep, that's exactly what I would have done. I should have known

2710
03:00:06,900 --> 03:00:09,940
In that situation, I would have behaved exactly the same way

2711
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:13,300
Uh

2712
03:00:14,020 --> 03:00:16,980
And then uh, I guess we're on to yeah kid and

2713
03:00:18,260 --> 03:00:21,220
freaking kid and shanks at albath

2714
03:00:21,860 --> 03:00:23,540
the giant island

2715
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:25,780
So shanks wants the pony glyph rubbing

2716
03:00:26,500 --> 03:00:28,500
and kid has one

2717
03:00:29,300 --> 03:00:31,300
and um

2718
03:00:33,380 --> 03:00:35,380
They're gonna freaking fight about it

2719
03:00:36,740 --> 03:00:40,740
Oh, this is cute. I've just realized um shanks and this giant kid

2720
03:00:41,060 --> 03:00:45,220
It's the same as when luffy was a kid and shanks is at the bar

2721
03:00:46,420 --> 03:00:49,300
and shanks is like drinking all his pirate friends and

2722
03:00:49,940 --> 03:00:54,660
Luffy's like, oh, come on. Take me with you. Come on. Take me with you on a cruise on a pirate adventure

2723
03:00:55,220 --> 03:00:58,100
And now shanks is saying that to this this giant kid

2724
03:00:58,820 --> 03:01:04,580
The same thing was the kid asking. Oh, yeah, there's no way I'd bring a hotheaded kid like you

2725
03:01:06,180 --> 03:01:08,180
Wait, this is is this a giant kid?

2726
03:01:08,420 --> 03:01:12,260
Yeah, it's a giant. Oh, these are the islands of giants. Oh, they're all giants

2727
03:01:13,140 --> 03:01:19,380
And oh, that's that's why the sake plate is huge and that's why the the blueberries are giant. Okay, this makes

2728
03:01:20,180 --> 03:01:24,100
Yeah, it all makes perfect sense now because like last time we heard about alba

2729
03:01:24,980 --> 03:01:29,220
Elbeth was um because kid had found it. He found albeth

2730
03:01:30,100 --> 03:01:32,500
And maybe he found it because he was looking for shanks

2731
03:01:33,780 --> 03:01:35,780
Because shanks was there

2732
03:01:36,820 --> 03:01:42,340
And so kid captain kid is fighting shanks his crew or is like causing trouble

2733
03:01:44,340 --> 03:01:47,860
And shanks is like, oh, well, I guess we got to go say hello

2734
03:01:48,100 --> 03:01:49,220
Oh

2735
03:01:49,220 --> 03:01:50,340
So

2736
03:01:50,340 --> 03:01:54,420
Is kid is kid the aggressor here? Is he like attacking shanks's fleet?

2737
03:01:54,980 --> 03:01:57,780
Is he trying to like get somewhere and shanks is blocking him?

2738
03:01:59,140 --> 03:02:01,140
I think um

2739
03:02:01,460 --> 03:02:05,380
It's likely that kid is the aggressor just because that's what kid is like and

2740
03:02:06,180 --> 03:02:07,860
seeing as he has a

2741
03:02:07,860 --> 03:02:09,860
a history of a shanks

2742
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:17,620
He probably wants to take down shanks in the same way that he and law took down big mom and like everyone took down

2743
03:02:17,620 --> 03:02:22,340
Kaido and all that. It's like he's one of the the yonko. He's a target

2744
03:02:23,220 --> 03:02:26,340
Hey, look at this. Uh, I mean, what do you make of?

2745
03:02:27,540 --> 03:02:29,540
in this panel

2746
03:02:29,940 --> 03:02:35,460
This panel of um elbeth. I mean just look at the way that the island looks there's like a big

2747
03:02:36,260 --> 03:02:37,700
black like

2748
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:39,700
pillar

2749
03:02:39,940 --> 03:02:42,900
I would say that's tree. That's like a giant tree

2750
03:02:43,620 --> 03:02:45,140
Hmm

2751
03:02:45,140 --> 03:02:47,620
Perhaps a world tree perhaps a yeeg dressil

2752
03:02:48,740 --> 03:02:52,340
That's a classic Norse thing along with vikings and giants. Oh, yeah

2753
03:02:53,620 --> 03:02:55,060
That's a good point

2754
03:02:55,060 --> 03:02:58,900
I I looked at the the the way that the island looks and I thought it kind of looked like

2755
03:02:59,620 --> 03:03:06,260
Fire and ice island or whatever that was called like it looked like some of these mountains were like melted glass or something

2756
03:03:06,980 --> 03:03:09,940
Yeah, maybe it's just a huge tree a huge huge world tree that would

2757
03:03:10,580 --> 03:03:12,580
Either that or it's like a huge

2758
03:03:12,980 --> 03:03:19,060
Viking elbeth giant castle the the the texture on it does look like bark

2759
03:03:19,780 --> 03:03:23,620
Now that you say that no, I think you're right. I think you've hit the nail on the head there

2760
03:03:24,180 --> 03:03:26,900
And then wait wait wait actually if you look up above the ships

2761
03:03:28,820 --> 03:03:32,580
Like above the ships there are like sort of uh screen tone like gray

2762
03:03:33,060 --> 03:03:37,220
Oh, yeah, there's like pillars like further away. Maybe it's many trees

2763
03:03:37,300 --> 03:03:40,020
I think these are just I think these might be giant trees

2764
03:03:40,900 --> 03:03:42,900
Yeah, is this like adam wood?

2765
03:03:44,020 --> 03:03:50,980
Oh, remember that being like the special words that the that was used to make gold rogership and then frankie bought the thousands

2766
03:03:51,940 --> 03:03:53,700
Yeah

2767
03:03:53,700 --> 03:03:55,700
Do these could be adam trees?

2768
03:03:55,940 --> 03:03:57,940
uh, did we

2769
03:03:58,500 --> 03:04:00,820
Do we know does like that come from elba?

2770
03:04:01,620 --> 03:04:03,620
I don't think

2771
03:04:03,620 --> 03:04:09,060
Comes from anywhere in particular, but we just know that that's a type of tree that's got like the best wood

2772
03:04:09,700 --> 03:04:11,700
And it's probably the big tree

2773
03:04:13,380 --> 03:04:15,380
Probably the giantest of trees

2774
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:18,820
Okay, okay, just a just a just an idea. Okay, it's

2775
03:04:19,620 --> 03:04:25,140
Wait a minute. Wait a minute adam treasure tree adam is a type of tree whose wood is considered the strongest

2776
03:04:26,020 --> 03:04:28,020
It's immense rarity makes it highly valuable

2777
03:04:30,660 --> 03:04:32,660
Uh

2778
03:04:34,580 --> 03:04:36,580
Okay, no

2779
03:04:37,860 --> 03:04:39,460
Uh

2780
03:04:39,460 --> 03:04:42,980
No, I think I think we've seen adam trees

2781
03:04:43,380 --> 03:04:47,860
I mean here here's a screenshot that supposedly has one in it and this is from the anime

2782
03:04:48,740 --> 03:04:51,940
But supposedly this is a screenshot of a treasure tree adam

2783
03:04:52,820 --> 03:04:54,580
And it's normal size. Oh

2784
03:04:54,580 --> 03:04:57,060
does that that that looks like the one that um

2785
03:04:58,020 --> 03:05:06,900
Uh, niko robin and the the librarians of ohara had is that that kind of tree? Oh, um

2786
03:05:08,340 --> 03:05:10,340
I don't

2787
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:12,580
I don't I don't know

2788
03:05:12,580 --> 03:05:14,260
probably not

2789
03:05:14,260 --> 03:05:16,260
ohara

2790
03:05:17,380 --> 03:05:20,820
I mean I had a huge fucking tree. Yeah, this is what ohara looked like

2791
03:05:21,380 --> 03:05:23,380
They built a library on the inside of it

2792
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:26,260
I think

2793
03:05:28,020 --> 03:05:31,460
Frankie explained the history of this one of a kind. Oh wait. No, there's only one

2794
03:05:32,260 --> 03:05:34,260
There's only one treasure tree adam

2795
03:05:36,260 --> 03:05:37,780
What

2796
03:05:37,780 --> 03:05:42,580
Frankie explained the history of this one of a kind tree long long ago an endless war raged on an island

2797
03:05:42,580 --> 03:05:48,180
People died and the island was destroyed by a rain of bullets and left in ruins. However, the people kept coming back to rebuild

2798
03:05:48,180 --> 03:05:50,180
the nation near a giant tree

2799
03:05:50,660 --> 03:05:55,060
A giant tree the only one that remained intact and that was adam

2800
03:05:55,620 --> 03:05:56,820
Adam

2801
03:05:56,820 --> 03:05:58,820
So that big tree could be adam

2802
03:06:00,020 --> 03:06:07,060
There is apparently also a sunlight tree eve on fishman island. Yes, and that's what and that's what lets the light

2803
03:06:07,860 --> 03:06:10,420
Come down through the red line

2804
03:06:11,860 --> 03:06:15,300
Through its roots to illuminate fishman island. Do you remember that?

2805
03:06:16,740 --> 03:06:18,340
Uh

2806
03:06:18,340 --> 03:06:22,340
That's why there's light. That's why there's light in fit. That's why there's light in fishman island. I remember

2807
03:06:23,220 --> 03:06:24,420
Uh

2808
03:06:24,420 --> 03:06:31,380
And us up. Yeah, and and us up was like treasure sunlight tree eve. Is that like the treasure tree adam?

2809
03:06:33,700 --> 03:06:35,700
Fascinating

2810
03:06:36,180 --> 03:06:38,180
We have to know more

2811
03:06:39,060 --> 03:06:44,500
Uh, so yeah, shanks is having a party is drinking and eating with the giants in the bar

2812
03:06:46,580 --> 03:06:48,420
And uh

2813
03:06:48,420 --> 03:06:50,420
That he's gonna go

2814
03:06:51,300 --> 03:06:53,300
Because one piece is just so boring

2815
03:06:54,180 --> 03:06:56,100
He's gonna go deal with kid

2816
03:06:56,100 --> 03:07:00,660
Um, and he says hey, uh, dory broggy. Can you lend me a hand? And I also notice

2817
03:07:01,460 --> 03:07:04,500
Uh, oi mo and kashi from any's lobby is behind them

2818
03:07:05,300 --> 03:07:06,900
as well

2819
03:07:06,900 --> 03:07:08,900
Remember those guys

2820
03:07:10,260 --> 03:07:12,580
I do remember those guys were on

2821
03:07:13,300 --> 03:07:17,940
They were on some other island before they were on any's lobby. Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2822
03:07:18,420 --> 03:07:20,420
They were like tricked into

2823
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:22,580
Being

2824
03:07:22,580 --> 03:07:25,940
Allied with the marines for some reason they said they were like tricked

2825
03:07:26,900 --> 03:07:31,460
Um by the marines saying dory and broggy were captured and they had to do this

2826
03:07:31,700 --> 03:07:35,220
But then us up told them that they met dory and broggy and they're fine

2827
03:07:35,860 --> 03:07:37,860
And so they turned the tables

2828
03:07:38,740 --> 03:07:40,740
They became friends of the straw hats

2829
03:07:42,500 --> 03:07:44,100
Yo

2830
03:07:44,100 --> 03:07:46,100
It's so cool

2831
03:07:46,100 --> 03:07:50,020
How much stuff how much elba for we're getting nowadays

2832
03:07:50,900 --> 03:07:55,060
Yes, this is the next big arc. Yeah, this is the one we're we're we're

2833
03:07:56,260 --> 03:08:00,660
We're moving towards the elba far egg egghead is like part of it

2834
03:08:06,420 --> 03:08:11,780
Who do you think's gonna win between kid and shanks, uh, I mean

2835
03:08:12,740 --> 03:08:18,980
Shanks obviously has more strength and the backing of the giants is obviously gonna do a lot

2836
03:08:19,460 --> 03:08:22,580
Yeah, kid is not as tough as he thinks he is

2837
03:08:23,300 --> 03:08:30,980
But he's got he's got uh hootspah, you know, he's got gusto definitely definitely and he's got uh

2838
03:08:32,340 --> 03:08:34,340
I mean killer is uh

2839
03:08:34,420 --> 03:08:38,660
I mean, he's got a history honestly of like of picking fights that he can't win

2840
03:08:39,220 --> 03:08:43,540
He picked he picked a fight with kaito and that resulted in him being imprisoned

2841
03:08:44,260 --> 03:08:48,500
Yeah, true. It didn't he and he was uh, who was who else was he fighting on?

2842
03:08:50,340 --> 03:08:57,220
Was he he fought other people on the on the kaito island? Or am I just did did he end up fighting?

2843
03:08:57,300 --> 03:09:00,100
Uh, uh, the the the wicker basket guy

2844
03:09:01,220 --> 03:09:02,900
Hawk

2845
03:09:02,900 --> 03:09:07,300
Basil Hawkins basil Hawkins or was that killer that fought basil Hawkins

2846
03:09:09,380 --> 03:09:11,380
I think

2847
03:09:11,460 --> 03:09:13,460
That's a new number of people

2848
03:09:14,020 --> 03:09:19,540
I can't actually remember who it was that did the final fight or was it Diaz or was it Diaz drake that fought basil Hawkins

2849
03:09:21,380 --> 03:09:25,220
Everyone fought him who has fought basil Hawkins at this point

2850
03:09:27,780 --> 03:09:31,700
Such a weak boy a little bit cool hair though

2851
03:09:33,780 --> 03:09:35,620
Yeah, so

2852
03:09:35,620 --> 03:09:38,260
He he fought kaito and he got imprisoned

2853
03:09:38,980 --> 03:09:44,580
And he got rescued by luffy and whatever was going on in that prison break

2854
03:09:45,780 --> 03:09:51,780
Um, and he's like, yeah, fuck you. I don't care about you, but let's team up anyway and kill kaito and all that

2855
03:09:52,980 --> 03:09:54,340
Hell yeah

2856
03:09:54,340 --> 03:10:00,020
He clearly is coming here with a chip on his shoulder or should I say a lack of a shoulder?

2857
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:03,780
His chip on his one shoulder

2858
03:10:04,740 --> 03:10:06,740
Ah

2859
03:10:07,140 --> 03:10:08,260
I mean

2860
03:10:08,260 --> 03:10:10,260
He's still got a shoulder

2861
03:10:10,580 --> 03:10:15,140
So, yeah, this this is implying that there's gonna be a fight because of course kid would not

2862
03:10:15,700 --> 03:10:18,260
Give them the the poneglas rubbings

2863
03:10:19,380 --> 03:10:21,700
Um shanks getting getting bitches

2864
03:10:22,100 --> 03:10:26,740
You have to see a couple panels of shanks getting bitches and drinking a huge plate of sake to know

2865
03:10:27,780 --> 03:10:31,700
This is the who are these women that are like jumping on them because they're not giants

2866
03:10:32,660 --> 03:10:35,540
Um, well earlier shanks said something like

2867
03:10:36,740 --> 03:10:40,580
How do you say? I guess I lost track of time catching up with everyone

2868
03:10:41,380 --> 03:10:44,820
um, maybe it's more than just the giants he's catching up with maybe there's like

2869
03:10:46,100 --> 03:10:50,740
Like other members of his like grand fleet if he has that i'm sure he has a grand fleet

2870
03:10:50,740 --> 03:10:56,660
We just haven't heard too much about them because why if they had had like a fleet of different pirates that would loyal to whitebeard

2871
03:10:58,820 --> 03:11:00,420
And uh

2872
03:11:00,420 --> 03:11:02,420
I guess luffy has that as well

2873
03:11:05,860 --> 03:11:08,820
Uh, yeah, yeah, like bar the bar not bartholomew

2874
03:11:09,220 --> 03:11:10,100
um

2875
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:15,380
What's the name of his bartholomeo bartholomeo his his underling speaking of bartholomeo

2876
03:11:16,020 --> 03:11:18,980
um, you might not remember but there was a point where

2877
03:11:20,020 --> 03:11:27,060
He declared war on shanks under the straw hat flag. Oh god. No when

2878
03:11:27,700 --> 03:11:30,500
Why it was it was in a cover like arc

2879
03:11:31,220 --> 03:11:33,220
Bartholomeo was doing some stuff

2880
03:11:33,300 --> 03:11:35,300
after dress rosa and then

2881
03:11:35,780 --> 03:11:37,780
he took over a town and he

2882
03:11:38,900 --> 03:11:42,740
Set fire to shanks his flag and put the straw hat flag there in its place

2883
03:11:43,380 --> 03:11:45,140
and then later

2884
03:11:45,140 --> 03:11:49,940
This event was referenced by the the the red-haired pirates

2885
03:11:51,140 --> 03:11:52,980
at the end of wano

2886
03:11:52,980 --> 03:11:59,540
When they could have gone and seen luffy, but they didn't I think shanks just did like a a hacky from across the sea

2887
03:12:01,460 --> 03:12:03,460
And then they left

2888
03:12:03,700 --> 03:12:05,700
Just a sense that luffy was there

2889
03:12:07,540 --> 03:12:10,820
I can't remember exactly. I think yeah, he did he did a hacky

2890
03:12:11,540 --> 03:12:15,300
to the the the green bullet the green bowl

2891
03:12:15,940 --> 03:12:18,100
Admiral who was there causing trouble

2892
03:12:18,340 --> 03:12:19,460
Hmm

2893
03:12:19,460 --> 03:12:25,860
He was like turning into a giant tree and he was trying to fight and and momonosuke was like saying no, you can't come here

2894
03:12:26,340 --> 03:12:29,300
This is my kingdom or whatever

2895
03:12:29,860 --> 03:12:36,740
And luffy was watching saying yeah, you go momonosuke, but then shanks did a whole big electric hacky conquerors hacky thing

2896
03:12:37,540 --> 03:12:43,380
To the admiral and then luffy could feel it. It's like that sound that feels familiar that hacky. I'm sorry

2897
03:12:44,020 --> 03:12:45,540
so you're saying

2898
03:12:45,540 --> 03:12:47,540
the green admiral showed up

2899
03:12:47,780 --> 03:12:51,220
And then shanks just like from all the way across the ocean like

2900
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:55,700
Disabled not all the way across the ocean. He was his ship was like at the edge of

2901
03:12:56,420 --> 03:12:57,220
wano

2902
03:12:57,220 --> 03:13:02,660
But yeah, it was a long way. It was like silly amount of distance. You couldn't see weird shanks. I

2903
03:13:03,620 --> 03:13:09,060
Kind of I don't know how shanks could see the admiral, but whatever and that was at the very end of wano, right?

2904
03:13:09,140 --> 03:13:12,100
That was a very end of wano. Yeah. Yeah after they've beaten everyone

2905
03:13:12,900 --> 03:13:15,540
And so they I think somebody mentioned that that does ring a bell

2906
03:13:16,100 --> 03:13:18,100
We can't see luffy yet

2907
03:13:18,100 --> 03:13:19,380
um

2908
03:13:19,380 --> 03:13:24,500
And also we can't forget about that thing that happened with the bartolomeo guy

2909
03:13:25,540 --> 03:13:28,260
We don't know. I don't think we know what happened to bartolomeo

2910
03:13:29,460 --> 03:13:31,460
um, but clearly

2911
03:13:32,900 --> 03:13:34,900
That's gonna have to be resolved I guess

2912
03:13:37,060 --> 03:13:39,060
True

2913
03:13:41,460 --> 03:13:43,460
Uh

2914
03:13:44,180 --> 03:13:49,140
I mean, I'm sure that shanks probably understands that bartolomeo is

2915
03:13:50,020 --> 03:13:52,020
an unruly vassal

2916
03:13:52,580 --> 03:13:54,580
And is acting on his own

2917
03:13:54,900 --> 03:13:58,500
Volition this is this is the part. I think where we'll we see

2918
03:13:59,620 --> 03:14:01,620
shanks having to be

2919
03:14:01,620 --> 03:14:03,620
ruthless because

2920
03:14:03,620 --> 03:14:05,620
If he's got a fight kid

2921
03:14:06,660 --> 03:14:10,100
Like I don't know if he's gonna be like nice about it

2922
03:14:11,140 --> 03:14:12,340
I

2923
03:14:12,340 --> 03:14:15,540
Yeah, I don't really see any reason why he should be

2924
03:14:18,340 --> 03:14:21,220
So that'll be cool. This is yeah, this is shanks like

2925
03:14:22,180 --> 03:14:25,220
Yeah, when he's not in nice guy mode he might

2926
03:14:26,340 --> 03:14:28,340
He might uh, be really

2927
03:14:29,140 --> 03:14:30,580
Fucking

2928
03:14:30,580 --> 03:14:34,660
He might even be a big meeting to this guy who's fucking attacking his ships

2929
03:14:36,260 --> 03:14:40,340
There's also the thing with um, like at the end of wano during that combo

2930
03:14:40,660 --> 03:14:46,820
Where shanks did the hacky and everything he said to beckman. Hey, isn't it time we claimed the one piece?

2931
03:14:47,300 --> 03:14:52,500
So that's what shanks is doing now. He's shanks is no longer just hanging out. That's so funny to just casually be like, hey

2932
03:14:53,460 --> 03:14:55,460
I feel like uh, you know

2933
03:14:55,940 --> 03:15:01,220
This comic's been going on for uh, uh, 28 years now. I think it's about time. We got the one piece

2934
03:15:01,860 --> 03:15:06,260
I think we should be moving we should be moving in that direction in my he's moving and shaking

2935
03:15:06,820 --> 03:15:10,980
It's it's about don't you think it's about time we got the fuck on with it

2936
03:15:11,700 --> 03:15:17,140
Um, let's go. He's just doing it. I do remember that he's gonna kid. He's gonna kill or severely

2937
03:15:17,780 --> 03:15:19,780
Mame kid and take his other arm

2938
03:15:20,580 --> 03:15:23,860
And and he's gonna have the pona cliff rubbings and then it will be like

2939
03:15:25,140 --> 03:15:26,340
Shanks

2940
03:15:26,340 --> 03:15:28,340
Might go after law next

2941
03:15:28,580 --> 03:15:30,580
Because law has another one of the rubbings

2942
03:15:31,700 --> 03:15:33,700
Yeah, so it'll be like

2943
03:15:33,940 --> 03:15:37,060
What and then it'll be he'll have to come for luffy after that

2944
03:15:37,460 --> 03:15:44,340
Does luffy have a they must have several rubbings at this point? Yeah, luffy only needs one more. I think yeah

2945
03:15:45,540 --> 03:15:47,540
Yeah, I guess

2946
03:15:48,180 --> 03:15:51,380
I guess if shanks is serious, he's gonna have to come after those rubbings

2947
03:15:52,980 --> 03:15:54,980
So

2948
03:15:55,940 --> 03:15:57,940
That'll be cool. That'll be exciting

2949
03:15:58,740 --> 03:16:02,820
Um, it's an airplane in my my noise. I don't know if that got noise removed

2950
03:16:03,380 --> 03:16:05,700
I think I heard a little buzz. Here's a question

2951
03:16:07,940 --> 03:16:12,180
Would would shanks have gone and after kids rubbing

2952
03:16:12,980 --> 03:16:19,940
If kid was not like already attacking his fleet or was it just like it just it just so happens that this kid guy is

2953
03:16:19,940 --> 03:16:25,940
Attacking my ships. Well, I'm gonna fucking get him and I'm gonna take his rubbing because I need that

2954
03:16:27,220 --> 03:16:28,420
um

2955
03:16:28,420 --> 03:16:29,700
You know

2956
03:16:29,700 --> 03:16:32,340
I think based on the fact that he's going after the one piece

2957
03:16:33,060 --> 03:16:35,060
he may be

2958
03:16:35,060 --> 03:16:42,420
Landing at albath after a kid because we know kid saw albath and there was no sign of like

2959
03:16:42,820 --> 03:16:44,820
Pirates being there. Oh, yeah

2960
03:16:45,380 --> 03:16:50,980
So maybe kid was in the area and now shanks has arrived and he's just gone up to the pirates and say hey bros

2961
03:16:51,460 --> 03:16:54,420
Remember me and everyone's like, how the hell yeah shanks

2962
03:16:55,380 --> 03:17:00,260
And he's sort of muscling in on the territory. He's just having a drink casually and then he's go, okay

2963
03:17:00,260 --> 03:17:02,900
Let's go get that shit now. Let's go kill kid

2964
03:17:04,340 --> 03:17:08,500
Knock him on the head. Right. Yeah. Yeah, he's he seems

2965
03:17:09,140 --> 03:17:12,900
That makes sense and it would be that like yeah, he's no he's he's actively

2966
03:17:13,540 --> 03:17:15,780
Going after people that have rubbings

2967
03:17:16,420 --> 03:17:19,460
He needs those rubbings. It's time to get the one piece. Oof

2968
03:17:20,260 --> 03:17:22,260
That's exciting

2969
03:17:22,500 --> 03:17:24,500
That's that's awesome

2970
03:17:24,980 --> 03:17:28,020
Uh, I'm freaking I'm freaking

2971
03:17:29,700 --> 03:17:31,700
This is a big pog chapter

2972
03:17:32,420 --> 03:17:34,500
Most a lot of these chapters have been pog

2973
03:17:35,940 --> 03:17:37,940
It's so like

2974
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:40,820
It really feels like

2975
03:17:41,300 --> 03:17:44,500
It really feels like things are slotting into place for like

2976
03:17:45,460 --> 03:17:47,460
a real like momentous

2977
03:17:48,900 --> 03:17:50,900
battle or or uh

2978
03:17:51,780 --> 03:17:54,580
Something's gonna happen things are moving

2979
03:17:55,940 --> 03:17:57,940
I'm excited

2980
03:17:58,740 --> 03:18:03,620

2983
03:18:11,540 --> 03:18:16,580
Oh, right. Right. Right. But like by next week, they'll by our next week. There will probably be another one

2984
03:18:17,380 --> 03:18:20,020
Probably uh, I don't know. I don't think so

2985
03:18:20,500 --> 03:18:24,660
Well, I well actually I don't remember if this one was out last week or not

2986
03:18:26,660 --> 03:18:30,340

2988
03:18:35,780 --> 03:18:41,380
There's gonna be some yeah, he's gonna he's gonna steal kid's arm or he's gonna maybe he'll take maybe he'll take his robotic arm

2989
03:18:41,540 --> 03:18:43,540
Maybe he'll be nice and take his robotic

2990
03:18:44,660 --> 03:18:46,660
No, no, I probably wouldn't do that

2991
03:18:47,220 --> 03:18:51,940
Like I mean he can't do that because right because it's all together with his yeah

2992
03:18:52,900 --> 03:18:56,500
You just make another one. What if he is like, hey kid, you're a machine

2993
03:18:56,900 --> 03:19:01,380
Magnet man, could you like build me an arm like that and I could just take it with me and like that would be cool

2994
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:04,980
Maybe they'll become friends and kid will make shanks a robotic arm

2995
03:19:05,620 --> 03:19:07,620
